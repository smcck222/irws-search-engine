FT  20 JAN 93 / President in waiting invokes JFK spirit

<TEXT>
AT NOON today Mr Bill Clinton becomes the 42nd president of the US.
Yesterday he spent a few quiet moments at the grave of the man who inspired
him to take up a political career, President John F. Kennedy.
Mr Clinton, his wife Hillary and about 20 members of the Kennedy clan placed
white roses on the graves of the two assassinated Kennedy brothers. He read
the inscriptions on their tombstones, but said nothing.
He hardly needed to, because it is the stuff of legend (and captured on
film) how, just four months before Kennedy was killed in Dallas in 1963, the
gangly 17-year-old youth from Arkansas, as a member of the American Legion's
Boys Nation, shook hands with the president at the White House.
There is an additional symbolism to the tribute. At 46, Mr Clinton is three
years older than JFK when he assumed office, yet both represent the ascent
of a younger generation of Americans to the seat of power. It is likely Mr
Clinton will again invoke the example and memory of his idol when he gives
his inauguration speech today.
Most of Mr Clinton's last full day as a president-elect had a youthful
theme. He took his customary morning jog and later was to attend a couple of
galas mostly for the young. He told an older lunchtime group, the governors
of the 50 states, that they ran 'our laboratories of democracy' and he would
need them to tell him as president what he was doing right - and wrong.
Elsewhere serious business was afoot, with new bombing raids over northern
Iraq and an apparent Iraqi offer of conciliation.
But there was good news from Capitol Hill. Assorted Senate committees
unanimously approved the nominations of six of his would-be cabinet,
including Mr Warren Christopher as secretary of state and Mr Mickey Kantor
as US trade representative. The full Senate may confirm some nominations
this afternoon.
The judiciary committee heard an apology from Ms Zoe Baird, the
attorney-general designate, for having employed two illegal aliens. Its
senior Republican, Mr Orrin Hatch of Utah, said the incident was no
disqualification to her serving as head of the Justice Department.
Meanwhile a dozen senior State Department appointments were announced and as
many as 100 more across the government promised for this week, thus ensuring
that not all desks in the corridors of power would be empty this afternoon.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Overseas holders to dispose of 45% Watts
Blake stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEBANESE, Belgian and German shareholders yesterday announced plans to sell
a combined 45 per cent stake in Watts Blake Bearne. The move is expected to
trigger a full scale bid for the world's largest ball clay producer.
Ceramics Holdings, controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family, Sibelco, a
privately owned Belgian-based producer of silica sand for the glass industry
and Quarzwerke, a private German producer of silica sand, are making the
sale under a concert party agreement in April 1991.
The companies said that under takeover rules: 'the acquisition of the
concert party members' holdings is likely to lead to an offer for the entire
issued share capital of the company.'
Mr John Pike, managing director of Watts Blake, said a sale to a single
purchaser would make it very difficult for the company to defend itself from
an unwelcome bidder.
'The board is gravely concerned about a number of issues that could arise
from this proposed sale. including the implications for the company's
employees and the local communities in which it operates,' said Mr Pike.
The group based in Newton Abbot, Devon also owns extensive reserves of ball
clay in the US and Germany. Almost two thirds of sales are used for the
manufacture of sanitary ware and wall and floor tiles.
Its performance is dependent upon the health of the construction industry;
pre-tax profits in 1991 fell by 27 per cent to Pounds 5.67m.
Profits in the fist six months of last year, however, rose by 7 per cent to
Pounds 3.74m helped by acquisitions.
Should a recommended purchaser offer less than 433p a share, Sibelco and
Quarzwerke have the right to buy Ceramics' shares at the same price.
Watts Blake shares yesterday rose from 425p to 433p having touched 455p at
one stage.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Xerox to move out of financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
XEROX, the US document pro- cessing group, yesterday announced plans to shed
its remaining insurance and financial services businesses to concentrate on
core operations.
The businesses to be discarded include Furman Selz, the New York brokerage
house; Crum and Forster, the property-casualty operation; and Xerox Life, a
life insurance and annuity business.
Xerox said it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 778m (Pounds 511m)
in the fourth quarter as a result of the move. This figure includes a net
Dollars 288m to strengthen reserves at Crum and Forster, plus Dollars 470m
for a partial writedown of goodwill attaching to the financial services and
insurance businesses. To help maintain its own financial position, Xerox
added that its board was considering the issue of up to Dollars 500m of new
equity during the first half of 1993.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said: 'It is imperative that Xerox continue to
maintain its strong balance sheet, to make sure our document processing
business has the financial resources to meet its growth objectives and to
facilitate an orderly disentanglement from our insurance and financial
services businesses.'
Xerox's troublesome foray into the financial services sector is reckoned to
have cost about Dollars 3bn. It has already pulled out of third-party
financing and, on the insurance side, has withdrawn from standard personal
property and casualty business. In the first nine months of 1992, Xerox made
after-tax profits of Dollars 28m from financial services, compared with
Dollars 374m from document processing.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese connection helps locals
to win Russian copper contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN-dominated Udokan Mining Company has won a tender to develop the
country's biggest copper deposit but Australia's BHP, the only other
contender in the race, has expressed a desire to co-operate with the winner.
UMC is 45 per cent owned by a Hong Kong businessman, Mr Eddie Wong, with the
remaining shares held by Russia's Arter group and local geological and
privatisation authorities of eastern Siberia's Chita region.
Mr Wong's Chinese connections are said to have helped secure in advance a
25-year contract for UMC to sell 200,000 tonnes of concentrate a year to
China, out of expected annual production of 360,000 tonnes. His stake is
held through a Cyprus-registered vehicle called Chita Minerals Company.
Despite a valiant effort by BHP to put together a proposal with far less
time than its Russian competitor, UMC had been been expected to win for some
time. This was not just because of its promise to start mining in 1997 but
more importantly because it was backed by a group of Russian plants which
proposed to supply most of the equipment for building the mine and
accompanying infrastructure.
A BHP representative was yesterday quoted in a Russian newspaper as saying
his company was interested in playing a role in the project. An adviser to
UMC said it was too early to comment on what this might involve.
Fluor Daniel, the US firm which put together Chile's giant La Escondida
copper mining project, will be the project manager. Allen &amp; Co, the private
New York investment bank, will be raising finance for the Dollars 1bn-plus
project.
Despite the fact that six leading western mining companies dropped out of
the race since it was launched last summer, Goldman Sachs, the US investment
bank which has been advising the government on attracting foreign
investment, argues its organisation of a world-class tender gave Russian
authorities a better deal than had there been no competition at all.
It appears at least to have succeeded in avoiding the shambles of a
pioneering Russian tender for Sakhalin oil reserves, which was badly hit by
political squabbling a year ago but ended with some of the losers joining
the original victors. Since then, a deal with an Australian mining company
for the development of the Sukhoi Log gold deposit, awarded without a
tender, has become the subject of a fierce dispute over whether and on what
terms it should be allowed to go ahead.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Qantas to axe 1,835 in
cost-cutting programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QANTAS, the government-controlled Australian airline, plans to make 9 per
cent of its workforce redundant over the next two years to help cut costs by
ADollars 158m (USDollars 108.9m) a year.
Yesterday's announcement follows a review by Coopers and Lybrand, the
accounting firm, which said the 1,835 redundancies would save ADollars 95m a
year. The remainder of the savings are to be achieved by increasing
efficiency.
The review was set up after the merger of Qantas and Australian Airlines,
the government-owned domestic airline, in September. The two airlines have
already shed a total 5,000 staff in the past 18 months.
Mr John Ward, Qantas chief executive, said the savings were essential to
increase efficiency in the run up to the flotation of the government's 75
per cent shareholding, expected later this year.
'The Qantas group can currently be counted among the top 10 airlines in the
world. The simple truth is that we must continue to improve our productivity
by 5 per cent per year to retain this position,' he said.
Mr Ward said Qantas would shortly begin discussions on potential synergies
with British Airways, which recently acquired a a 25 per cent stake in the
airline. He said the discussions could lead to further job losses.
Qantas said it hoped the trade unions would co-operate with the redundancy
programme, which will be delayed until early next month to give them time to
respond. The airline hopes to achieve at least 60 per cent of the job losses
through voluntary redundancy.
Qantas recorded a net profit of ADollars 137m in 1991-92, but Australian
suffered a loss of ADollars 38.4m, mainly because of recession and
fare-cutting following the deregulation of Australian domestic aviation in
1990.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Co-drivers needed on rocky road: Consolidation in the
Japanese car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP downturn in the Japanese car market over the past two years is
forcing manufacturers there to contemplate far-reaching changes of strategy,
which could lead to a consolidation of the industry.
Japanese car drivers have been the main beneficiaries of fierce competition
within an industry of 11 producers. The competition has forced Japanese
manufacturers to levels of efficiency and quality which are the envy of
their competitors.
That may be about to change. Japanese manufacturers are increasingly looking
to alliances to help reduce competition and cut costs.
Late last year Honda and Isuzu announced an agreement to sell each other's
vehicles, after Isuzu had said it would withdraw from passenger car
production.
Last week Nissan and Mazda confirmed they were discussing a plan to swap
vehicles to cut development costs. Nissan is likely to suspend production of
some light commercial vehicles and instead sell trucks supplied by Mazda.
Mazda will streamline its range of vans by taking supplies from Nissan.
Toyota and Nissan, the industry's two largest producers, are considering
jointly developing an electric car, which could have long-term implications
for collaboration over product development.
These are the first responses to the downturn in domestic demand since 1990,
which many industry executives believe could mark the start of a period of
much slower growth in a maturing market.
The slowdown comes as most manufacturers are starting to pay for the heavy
investment of the late 1980s. Japanese car producers have traditionally
relied upon expanding sales rather than reducing costs to raise profits.
Mr Jonathon Dobson, an analyst at Jardine Fleming securities, estimates the
Japanese market needs to grow by about 7 per cent for the producers to avoid
their operating profit margins being eroded.
Few believe the market will sustain that growth.
The industry is dividing into two groups: those under pressure and those
under heavy pressure.
A select few appear to be weathering the downturn in reasonable shape.
Toyota, the leading producer with about 41 per cent of the domestic market,
has large cash reserves and a reputation for low-cost volume production.
Mitsubishi Motors has increased its sales, partly thanks to its extensive
but tailored product range which includes leisure vehicles such as the
Pajero. Suzuki sold more cars last year than the year before because it
concentrated on the mini-car segment of the market.
The others - Daihatsu, Isuzu, Mazda, Honda and Nissan - are struggling. Many
in the industry believe that Daihatsu, the mini-carmaker, which has already
retreated from the US market, may be incorporated into its parent Toyota.
Nissan and Mazda are facing acute difficulties. In the late 1980s Mazda
seemed to represent the model new carmaker, with an impressive array of
redesigned products such as the popular MX-5 sports car. It boasts 4,000
permutations of car. Now it is paying for its image.
Sumitomo Bank, which has parachuted a senior executive on to the company's
board, is breathing down Mazda's neck. The carmaker's pre-tax profits in the
first half of the year to the end of March fell 73 per cent to Y3bn (Pounds
15.4m). The depreciation charge for investments such as its Hofu production
plant will rise 30 per cent this year to Y88bn. Its sluggish sales are
spread across five sales channels which share few costs. Its overseas
operations are less developed than the other carmakers.
Mazda, which is a quarter owned by Ford, the US manufacturer, has one of the
smallest production operations in North America which leaves it badly placed
to benefit from an upturn in the US market. It recently cancelled plans for
a separate luxury car sales network in the US. It is also the only Japanese
carmaker to lack a production presence in Europe. Long running talks with
Ford are yet to produce a deal but the company is understood to have
exploratory talks with Citroen of France.
Nissan, which incurred a pre-tax loss of Y14.2bn in the six months to the
end of last September, has been losing market share largely because its
ageing model range is over-extended.
Nissan sells 57 per cent fewer vehicles than Toyota, spread over 29 basic
models, compared with Toyota's 26. The Cedric model comes with thousands of
variations; the Laurel has 86 different steering wheels and 173 types of
steering column. To maintain this range Nissan needs a huge and costly array
of parts and suppliers.
All producers have slowly begun to cut costs.
Investment is being reined in and they have announced plans to standardise
and reduce the numbers of parts they use by up to 45 per cent.
Agreements to share large components are spreading: Mazda is taking diesel
engines from Isuzu. Wage costs are being restrained, partly by the spread of
single-shift working at many plants. As yet, however, no company has dared
cut into the large white-collar overheads in offices and showrooms.
However this cost cutting is unlikely to boost profitability, given the
bruising competition in a declining market. The obvious companion step is to
cut the pace of competition.
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan president, says the agreement with Mazda will cut
development costs but in the long run it could lead the two companies to
reduce the number of competing models on offer.
The next logical step would be to overturn the conventional wisdom of the
late 1980s, which was that product cycles would inevitably shorten as
producers rushed out new models to maintain market share. Stretching the
life of a model could save huge sums in research and development costs.
However until the market leader Toyota signals that it may take such a step,
the other companies will be loath to go it alone for fear that their market
share and profits will fall sharply.
Profits are under pressure in a slow growth market, opportunities for deep
cost cutting are limited by labour practices, and the costs of rapid product
development are rising unabated. The laggards of the industry will have to
start contemplating a more radical consolidation of the industry to allow
them to keep up the pace of the leaders.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Trading in YSL halted amid stake
sale speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the shares in Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion and cosmetics
company, and Elf-Sanofi were suspended yesterday amid speculation that YSL
might be selling a significant share stake to Elf-Sanofi.
Elf-Sanofi, the pharmaceuticals and beauty products arm of the state-owned
Elf-Aquitaine oil group, promised a statement and a press conference early
this afternoon to explain the new development.
Officials at YSL were unavailable yesterday, but their president, Mr Pierre
Berge, has made no secret of his desire to sell up to 15 per cent of the
company.
Mr Berge's openness last autumn about his willingness to sell a significant
stake to a 'true partner' had led to some softening of the company's share
price, and criticism from YSL minority investors.
However, in the past four weeks, YSL's shares have gained nearly a third,
and yesterday's suspension came after a sizeable rise last Friday.
Several months ago, Elf-Sanofi was canvassed as a possible buyer of the
shares jointly-owned by Mr Saint Laurent and Mr Berge, but was said to have
been ruled out because it was unwilling to leave the company's two founders
in management control.
Elf-Sanofi is essentially a pharmaceuticals company, but it has a perfume
and beauty products business centred around its four marques of Roger &amp;
Gallet, Stendhal, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Oscar de la Renta. The
Elf-Aquitaine group is itself a possible candidate for privatisation if
French conservatives win the March parliamentary election.
In the first nine months of last year, Elf-Sanofi recorded a 12.5 per cent
rise in turnover to FFr15.8bn (Dollars 2.85bn), while YSL's predominantly
luxury business has been much harder hit by the economic turndown with
profits falling to just FFr2.6m in the first half of last year on sales of
FFr1.39bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has long been an adman's axiom that if you can't find anything
interesting to say about a client's product, mount a teaser campaign.
Even so, the latest efforts by Coca-Cola and Lowe Howard Bell, its British
advertising agency, to drum up free publicity betray signs of unusual
desperation. Summoned yesterday to a 'major mystery announcement' at St
Martin's Theatre in London, home of the long-running whodunnit 'The
Mousetrap', hacks were treated to a tedious presentation by a top Coke
executive which included a man dressed as Kaiser Bill and a small inflatable
zeppelin.
These, it finally turned out, were the improbable themes of a UK commercial
for Tab Clear, a new colourless diet cola. No figures were available for
sales targets, the ad budget or even Coca-Cola's UK sales last year.
But as it happens, the same product was announced a month ago in the US,
where Tab's once-commanding share of the diet cola market has shrunk to less
than one per cent, and followed the launch of a similar soft drink by
arch-rival Pepsi.
Even as self-important a company as Coke should realise that if a secret is
really worth revealing, it will be faxed around the world in a matter of
hours. If it wants to attract media attention, it had better invent a better
mousetrap next time.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Inchcape lifts stake in Revasa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the motor and businesses services group, has increased its stake
in Revasa, the Italian insurance broker, through Bain Clarkson, its wholly
owned insurance broking subsidiary.
Bain Clarkson will pay a maximum of Pounds 1.7m, subject to performance, to
lift its stake in Revasa from 10 per cent to 49 per cent.
Bain Clarkson bought its initial 10 per cent shareholding in January last
year.
The Milan-based broker, currently ranked 10th in Italy in revenue terms, is
involved mainly in the property, casualty and construction sectors.
Mr Simon Arnold, chairman of Bain Clarkson, said: 'Italy is an important
market for us. This increased shareholding in Revasa will give us a stronger
position in the country, moving us forward in our strategy to gain
prominence in the major European markets through shareholding arrangements
such as this.'
Bain Clarkson also has operations in Greece, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland
and France, where it recently acquired a 25 per cent stake in CECAR, the
country's third largest broker.
Contrary to a weekend press report, Bain Clarkson's results are understood
to be holding up well, in spite of difficulties in the reinsurance market.

Carlton Television and London Weekend Television have set up a separate
television sales company to attract continental European advertising.
The joint venture will try to persuade overseas advertisers, particularly in
the food sector, that with a combined reach of 11m people, London is one of
the most important markets in Europe.
The new venture, London Television European Sales, said that the London area
accounts for 47 per cent of UK mineral water consumption, 44 per cent of UK
charge cards, 37 per cent of UK businessmen and 25 per cent of the UK retail
outlet total of 30,000.
The first television advertising campaign to be booked by the new venture,
for the German airline Lufthansa, begins on January 31.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Five-fold rise in net earnings
for NationsBank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONSBANK, the large south-eastern US regional banking group formed in
1991 by the merger of C &amp; S Sovran and NCNB, yesterday reported Dollars
1.15bn of net earnings for the whole of 1992, more than five times the
previous year's level.
The bank's earnings had been held back in 1991 by heavy merger-related
restructuring charges and provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, NationsBank said net income was Dollars 234m,
or 92 cents a share, even after a one-time Dollars 50m pre-tax provision
caused by closures and merger-related consolidations. In the same quarter of
1991, it suffered a loss of Dollars 244m, orDollars 1.08 a share.
NationsBank is the fourth-biggest bank in the US, with total assets of
Dollars 118bn and more than 1,700 offices in nine states and the District of
Columbia.
Mr Hugh McColl, chairman and chief executive, yesterday described its first
full year of operations as 'extraordinarily successful' and said the bank
was ahead of schedule, since 300 of some 400 planned merger consolidation
projects had already been completed.
He noted that the bank's level of non-performing assets had declined by 29
per cent in 1992, to Dollars 1.99bn. Bad debt provisions declined to Dollars
1.45bn from Dollars 1.6bn in 1991, while net write-offs fell to Dollars 866m
in 1992, from Dollars 1.3bn the previous year.
Mr McColl said NationsBank was proceeding with expansion plans, including a
deal with Dean Witter, the brokerage house partly-owned by Sears Roebuck, to
form a joint venture retail securities company.
Total shareholders' equity rose by 20 per cent in 1992, to Dollars 7.8bn.
The bank's ratio of capital to assets under the Tier 1 regulatory measure
used in the US stood at a healthy 7.54 per cent at year-end.
Net interest income improved by 6 per cent last year, to Dollars 4.19bn,
thanks to wider spreads being enjoyed by the entire US banking industry.
Non-interest income increased by 10 per cent in 1992, to Dollars 3.97bn.
On Wall Street, NationsBank's share price closed unchanged on the day at
Dollars 52 1/8.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mexico's revolution in retailing
 -Larger store chains join forces with US groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEND a Saturday at Mexico City's Club Aurrera, the membership-only discount
store half-owned by Wal-Mart, and you may never want to shop again. You will
have to wait an hour to enter the car park, fight off customers to find a
trolley, and spend another hour in the queue for a cashier.
Inside will be thousands of businessmen stocking up on office supplies,
merchants buying supplies for their own shops, and elegant housewives buying
imported food and clothes.
Company executives proudly say the Polanco Club Aurrera sells more per
square metre than the most successful Sam's-Club (Club Aurrera's twin) in
the US.
Wal-Mart's outstanding success is the first sign of a revolution in Mexican
retailing, spurred by competition in the sector, the opening of the economy
to imports and the impending North American free trade agreement.
Small corner stores are losing business to the supermarkets. In turn, small
supermarkets are being swallowed up by a handful of large Mexican chains.
And the large chains are forming alliances with the giant US retailers.
Wal-Mart's partner is Cifra, Mexico's largest retailer: Price Club, the US
warehouse club, has a similar venture with Comercial Mexicana, the
third-largest Mexican retailer: Gigante, Mexico's second-largest retailer
has formed a joint venture with Fleming, the largest US wholesaler.
Not to be outdone, Liverpool, Mexico's up-market retail chain, announced in
December a joint venture with K mart. They intend to invest Dollars 500m to
build 100 K mart stores in Mexico.
All these joint ventures have much the same purpose. As Mr Juan Carlos
Mateos, planning director at Gigante, explains: 'They have the know-how and
we have the know-who.'
The US retailers are gaining access to an emerging, consumer-starved market
of 85m people, where profit margins are around 6 per cent on sales - around
double those in the US. The Mexicans, in turn, have immediate access to US
technology, distribution and buying-power. The big winners are Mexican
consumers, who can buy a vast array of (often imported) products at almost
wholesale prices.
But many, especially small, undercapitalised Mexican suppliers will suffer.
The big retailers, unlike the corner stores, buy in bulk or not at all: are
quick to import if quality and price are better abroad; and expect goods to
be packaged to their taste, with bar codes added, and to be delivered at the
time they say.
Wal-Mart and Cifra have set the trend, opening their first Club Aurrera last
March, with two more soon afterwards. They plan to launch another six before
the end of this year.
In June, Cifra and Wal-Mart extended their joint venture, and formed two
jointly-owned companies. The first is administered by Cifra, and consists of
new Cifra supermarkets under existing Cifra brands: the second is
administered by Wal-Mart, and comprises Wal-Mart supercentres, Club Aurrera,
distribution centres and an import-export company.
Cifra says it will benefit from Wal-Mart's technology that should enable it
to control stocks better and increase turnover. Longer term, it hopes
Wal-Mart will help Cifra expand from its base in central Mexico by improving
distribution channels, says a company official.
Wal-Mart has 'the best distribution system in the US', says Ms Christine
Aimer, an analyst at Baring Securities in Mexico City, and 'will help Cifra
become a national retailer.'
Gigante has already opened a non-membership 'price-impact' supermarket
(called Supermart) with Fleming in the small town of San Juan del Rio, with
another three expected to open by April. The company hopes to open about 10
Supermart stores a year, and to have 50 stores in operation in five years,
with sales of Dollars 1bn.
The company is aiming at middle-size Mexican cities, where there are fewer
supermarkets and profit margins are higher. Fleming is helping Gigante scan
goods as they enter and leave the shop, thus helping control stocks, and
advises on the lighting and lay-out of the stores, says Mr Wayne Epperson,
head of the joint-venture.
But Mr Epperson is in little doubt that Fleming could not enter Mexico
without help from Gigante. He, like Mr Mateos, hints one day the joint
venture will be extended to include other Gigante stores.
Liverpool's joint venture with K mart is perhaps the most incongruous, since
Liverpool is an upmarket department store chain but will be managing K
mart-style food and general goods stores.
'The joint venture,' says Mr Michel Marcos, Liverpool's director-general, of
Liverpool 'will enable us to expand into different markets.'
Like all US and Mexican retailers, Liverpool is betting that Mexico's
economic reforms will raise the purchasing power of the middle- and lower
classes, making US-style mass-market discount stores profitable.
Significantly, Liverpool and Cifra are using their US alliances to promote
Mexican goods in the US via jointly-owned export-import companies. Both
companies know that unless Mexico's relish for consumer goods is matched by
increased export revenues, the future for the retail sector is bleak.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Philips' lighting division back
in the black in North America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EINDHOVEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, said yesterday that its lighting
division managed to make an operating profit in North America in 1992 for
the first time since 1984
Mr Einar Kloster, president of Philips Lighting, also said that the company
had 'caught up' with the competition in new lighting products such as
halogen lamps after falling behind by about two years at the beginning of
the 1990s.
Mr Kloster declined to give further details of the lighting division's 1992
results ahead of the scheduled release of group results March 4. Philips has
been involved in a reorganisation in the US after acquiring Westinghouse's
light bulb factories in 1983.
He predicted that 1993 would prove to be a 'very tough' year for lighting.
Philips' lighting business put in a strong performance in 1992, resuming its
traditional role of 'cash cow' after faltering briefly in 1990. In the first
nine months of 1992, the division posted a 63 per cent increase in operating
profit to Fl 602m (Dollars 325m) which helped to compensate for part of the
downturn in the group's key consumer electronics business.
Mr Kloster described the world lighting market as stable, with Philips,
General Electric of the US and Osram, a subsidiary of Siemens of Germany,
holding roughly equal shares of the market for conventional light bulbs.
Mr Kloster said Philips must use the 'window' opened by its competitors'
efforts to digest recent acquisitions to concentrate on becoming a low-cost
producer. The Dutch company's aim is to equip its European factories to
produce at least 200m light bulbs a year.
It has already announced plans to close its light bulb factory in Dijon,
France, and redistribute this capacity among the group's five other European
plants.

Owners Abroad has postponed the extraordinary meeting at which its
shareholders were to vote on a tie-up with Thomas Cook, the travel agency
group, writes Richard Gourlay.
The EGM will now be held on March 22, a week after the closing date of the
hostile bid from Airtours, the rival holiday company.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, welcomed the postponement of Owners
Abroad's EGM.
'Now Owners shareholders can concentrate on what matters,' he said.
'Airtours' offer is significantly higher than the 100p a share at which
Owners are planning their ill-conceived tie-up.'

FT  19 JAN 93 / A separation of powers: IBM is reducing its reliance on
mainframe computers and creating autonomous business units in an attempt to
reverse its decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer
and a symbol of US technological prowess, is today expected to report the
biggest annual loss in US corporate history.
Wall Street is forecasting total losses for 1992 to be about Dollars 4.7bn,
after taking into account pre-tax charges of Dollars 11.4bn to pay for
continuing cuts in the company's workforce and the consolidation of
manufacturing operations.
It will be the second consecutive year that 'Big Blue' has reported a loss
and the US financial community has delivered a damning verdict on the
company's performance. IBM's stock was yesterday trading at less than
Dollars 50 a share, down from more than Dollars 100 as recently as July.
Last week, the company's AAA credit rating was downgraded to AA minus by
Standard &amp; Poor's.
Today's results will add to the gloom surrounding IBM. But of even greater
significance to investors in the company, its customers and its rivals and
allies in the international information technology industry will be the
company's fate over the next five years or so. Can IBM survive as the
leading company in the world's information technology industry or is it
doomed to a protracted decline?
Until recently, such a question would have seemed unthinkable. Few companies
have had such power to set standards, influence trends and exert leadership
in an industry as IBM has for the past 30 years. Now only one thing is
certain. The company must change radically if it is to regain its strength
and profitability. The corporate structure on which IBM was built is
increasingly obsolete. The markets it has dominated have been reshaped by
advances in semiconductor technology that have reduced sharply the cost of
computers and the gross profit margins of computer manufacturers.
This trend has been under way for several years, but as IBM's chairman John
Akers told US analysts before the turn of the year, the rate of change is
accelerating: 'Advances in technology are placing more function, more power
and more memory in ever-smaller semiconductor chips, while proprietary
technologies are declining in value as industry-standard building blocks
become the norm.'
Many computing tasks that once ran on mainframe computers - the large
centralised systems which have traditionally been IBM's main product - can
now be carried out on networks of smaller, less expensive machines. This has
played to the strengths of a new generation of Silicon Valley competitors
which have lower costs and more flexible production and which have responded
more quickly to changing market demands. This is the primary cause of the
current downturn at IBM. It has been exacerbated by weak global economic
conditions which have depressed demand for its products.
Faced with a choice between a multi-million dollar investment in an IBM
mainframe and less expensive computer networks, information systems managers
within companies are increasingly choosing the latter option.
'Today, information systems managers are afraid to expose themselves within
an organisation by paying the high price of IBM mainframe computer power,'
says Mr John Jones Jr, an analyst at Salomon Bros in San Francisco. His
comment is a startling revision of the old adage that nobody was ever fired
for buying IBM.
Mr Jones estimates that IBM's mainframe revenues declined by almost 15 per
cent last year to Dollars 9.3bn from Dollars 10.9bn in 1991. Sales of
related products - such as data storage systems and printers as well as
software and services which, combined, represent about one-third of turnover
 -have also suffered.
IBM was built to sell mainframes. It has the structure, the sales and
support operations, the manufacturing and research and development goals,
and the high overheads of a mainframe computer company. Yet mainframes seem
unlikely to provide IBM with significant opportunities for growth.
IBM's dilemma is vividly illustrated by an analysis of the company's biggest
market, Europe, carried out by OTR Pedder, a Brussels consultancy. It shows
(see chart) that in 1974, when IBM was enjoying its greatest success,
mainframes comprised almost 80 per cent of the hardware market by value.
Today, the corresponding figure is only 20 per cent. From nothing in 1976,
personal computers and workstations have grown to more than 60 per cent of
the market by value.
The challenge facing IBM, therefore, is to make a transition from a company
heavily dependent on high-margin mainframe sales to a smaller, more flexible
organisation with a stronger presence in faster-growing areas of the
computer market such as personal computers, workstations, networking
systems, consumer products and computing services.
IBM has already taken steps to reduce costs. It has shed about 100,000
employees and reduced manufacturing capacity by 40 per cent since 1986. A
further 25,000 jobs, or 8 per cent of the workforce, will go this year.
Research and development spending, the seed corn of success in the computer
business, will be cut from Dollars 9bn to Dollars 8bn this year.
These measures have made an impact. Revenue per employee, a measure of
efficiency, is now Dollars 213,000, more than its competitors Digital
Equipment and Hewlett-Packard.
But most industry analysts believe further reorganisation is necessary. Mr
Mark Stahlman, author of a soon-to-be published study, Why IBM Failed,
remains critical: 'For all its restructurings over the last few years, IBM
has consistently chosen to nibble the bullet instead of bite it.'
The company may now be ready to cut deep into previously sacrosanct
territory. Mr Akers's pre-Christmas announcement that most of the 25,000
jobs to go this year will be in sectors supporting the mainframe business
was regarded as a watershed by many within IBM.
The cornerstone of his strategy, however, launched at the end of 1991, is to
decentralise management and turn IBM from a monolith into a 'federation of
increasingly autonomous and independent business units' that are more
flexible and able to compete more effectively in their own segments of the
computer market.
Known as the 'Baby Blues', the first of these fledglings have been the IBM
PC Company, formed last September to take over all the company's personal
computer operations; Adstar, formerly IBM's data storage division; and
Pennant Systems, IBM's high-speed printer operation. So far, the results
seem promising. Last November the IBM PC Company achieved the highest
monthly volume of PC shipments in IBM's history. It earned revenues of about
Dollars 9bn in 1992 - making it the world's largest personal computer
company - and is expected to be profitable this year.
Adstar, the data storage business, has established itself as an important
supplier in the industry. It is the leader in the rapidly growing market for
high capacity 3.5-inch disc drives, which store computer data, and achieved
an estimated Dollars 800m in sales to outside customers in 1992. Pennant
Systems, with revenues of Dollars 2bn, is expected to show a small profit
for last year.
There are criticisms, however, that IBM is not moving fast enough to give
autonomy to other segments of the business. Mr Stahlman maintains, for
example, that in workstations (high performance desktop computers) - the
fastest growing segment of the computer hardware business - IBM's product
development and manufacturing operation is hampered by an inability to
create its own strategic relationships in a highly competitive market.
Increased autonomy for IBM's operations is of particular importance in the
service sector, an area that represents one of the company's best
opportunities to return to profitability.
Sales of computing services - including consulting work, software, project
and facilities management, and systems integration - are growing at about 25
per cent a year compared with less than 5 per cent for hardware.
IBM is expanding its services operations, establishing new business units
worldwide and pricing its services aggressively to attract business.
Already, more than 40 per cent of IBM's revenues come from software and
services: 'In four or five years, IBM may no longer be a dominant force in
hardware products but it will be a computer services powerhouse,' says Mr
John Logan, vice-president of the Aberdeen Group, a Boston consulting and
market research group.
IBM's ambitions in computing services have produced a hostile response from
competitors. Mr Keith Burgess, managing partner for Andersen Consulting in
the UK, says: 'I find it a desperately cynical suggestion that any hardware
manufacturer or software house can enter the upper echelons of the
consulting business just like that. . . .The skills of the line manager are
not the skills to effect the step changes in performance that are the
hallmark of the effective consultant.'
Impartiality in recommending equipment is another potential problem. In the
US, IBM has formed a subsidiary, Integrated Systems Solutions Company
(ISSC), to create a buffer between its sales and consulting operations.
Since ISSC was formed in May 1991, it has won some impressive contracts,
including a 10-year, Dollars 3bn deal to manage McDonnell Douglas's IT
operations.
Beyond restructuring its operations to address existing markets more
effectively and shifting resources into the service sector, IBM is pursuing
new business opportunities:
It is beginning to focus on consumer electronics where the convergence of
computer, communications and consumer electronics technologies is widely
expected to create the next 'blockbuster' electronics product. Mr David
Robinson, president of consultancy CSC Index, points to the potential of a
device small enough to fit the pocket, cheap enough for the mass consumer
market and powerful enough to transmit voice, data and images over
communications networks.
IBM demonstrated a prototype of such a device at the Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas earlier this month. The 16-ounce 'personal communicator'
combines PC power, and electronic mail with cellular telephone and fax
capability.
'Whether or not this technology becomes an actual product is not really the
issue,' says Jack Kuehler, IBM president. 'The device is only the 'razor'.
Our intent - and our core business - is to provide the 'blades' of online
services, communications, visual content and information entry.' Technology
alliances are another element of IBM's recovery strategy. Among the most
significant is its partnership with Apple Computer. In a joint venture
called Taligent the two companies are developing personal computer software
that analysts believe may challenge Microsoft's dominance of the PC software
market. 'IBM handed the PC industry to Microsoft on a silver platter when it
adopted Microsoft's DOS operating system in 1981. Now it is fighting to
regain control,' says Mr Jones of Salomon Bros. IBM is also expanding its
sales of technology and components to other companies in the industry. In
particular, its semiconductor division is seeking external sales rather than
producing chips solely for internal consumption as it has done until
recently. As the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer it has the
resources and the technology to become a significant competitor in this
market.
Implementation of these strategies implies the emergence of a different
corporate structure. But few within the company or the industry see an
alternative to Mr Akers's plans. Most also agree that success will depend to
a large extent on the degree of autonomy afforded the new businesses and
operations.
'IBM's willingness to let go of the reins and allow subsidiary businesses to
develop according to their own internal logic is still the great question
facing the company,' write Mr Charles Ferguson and Mr Charles Morris,
authors of Computer Wars: How the West Can Win in a Post-IBM World, to be
published next month. They blame IBM's problems on its tendency to impose
'mainframe style management' on businesses where it is inappropriate.
Recovery will also require patience. 'IBM is like an aircraft carrier that
takes five or 10 miles to turn around in an age of speedboats,' says Regis
McKenna, a respected computer industry consultant and author of Who's Afraid
of Big Blue, an account of the success of Silicon Valley companies in their
contest with IBM. 'Companies such as Sun Microsystems and Apple Computer
grew up in a competitive environment. IBM grew up in the 1950s, when it
could control the market environment,' he says.
'Now it has to learn to become interdependent with the market. It will take
a long time, at least five years, to turn IBM around,' Mr McKenna predicts.

<TEXT>
WESTERN Germany's Green party, once the strongest ecological movement in
Europe, is to unite with Bundnis 90, a pro-environment group in the eastern
part of the country, in a joint-party conference in May.
The move is designed to regain a foothold in the federal parliament, which
the west German Greens lost in the last elections after narrowly failing to
get the required 5 per cent of the vote. Bundnis 90, a loose anti-communist
movement allied with the east German Greens, won 5.6 per cent of the vote in
eastern Germany.
The marriage of convenience was welcomed by the opposition Social Democrats
who hope to find a coalition partner if they gain power in Germany's next
general elections, scheduled to take place at the end of 1994.
But Mr Uwe Luhr, secretary-general of the liberal Free Democrats, the
minority party in the government coalition, called the merger 'an act of
desperation'.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (29): Realignment in a
world market - Corporate strategy, a Franco-British bid for a place in the
power game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST glance, it seems surprising that the move towards a single market
was not a large factor in the creation in June, 1989, of GEC Alsthom, one of
Europe's big three power engineering and transportation equipment groups.
The formation of the company from the power and transportation product
businesses of the UK's GEC and what was then CGE of France owed more to
developments in the world markets for these products, the need to be big
enough to continue financing product development and compete
internationally, and the requirement to reduce manufacturing overcapacity.
But the company recognised that Europe was to be its home market, even if
the single market was not predominant in the decision to merge. About 60 per
cent of sales are to countries within the EC, and GEC Alsthom expects the
figure to stay between 50 and 60 per cent in the next few years.
GEC Alsthom's organisation - a Dutch holding company and national companies
 -was driven by the existing legal and fiscal regimes rather than any
potential implications of a single market. But the company's industrial
strategy was to become as competitive as possible by the development of
areas of excellence without regard to geographic location, through a series
of multinational product-driven divisions.
A clear example of this is in steam turbines and generators, where GEC
Alsthom has concentrated on four specialist units to get the benefit of R&amp;D
rationalisation and volume manufacture, and to maximise the use of fixed
assets. 'The consequence of this,' it says, 'is that we only have a European
product and no longer have an exclusive British or French turbine
generator.'
From its earliest days, GEC Alsthom was also keen to grow its European base
by expanding outside its two home countries. In particular,it has made
acquisitions in Germany (including two boiler makers in eastern Germany), in
the Spanish rail transport industry, and in Italy, Belgium and Switzerland.
Three years on, the company has no reason to change its structure. 'We
always thought that, even with the emergence of the Single Market, a strong
local market close to the customers would be a plus and it still proves to
be correct. Beyond that our choice in running a company through a series of
multinational product-driven divisions has proved a very sensible decision
in the light of the Single Market.'
One of the advantages for GEC Alsthom in taking this approach is in dealings
with a single market that varies from product to product in its
'singleness'. Assuming that the EC continues to exist in something like its
present form, the company suspects a 'substantial implementation' of a
single market by the end of the century.
In the meantime the company has to deal with sectors such as the rail
industry, where national standards, operating practices and the dominance of
a single customer has perpetuated a system where suppliers and customers
have worked together to develop products for domestic markets.
But similar relationships in the power industry are now being weakened, at
least in the UK where the power industry has been privatised, and elsewhere
in Europe with the emergence of build-and-operate private sector power
stations.
The company has no doubt that, as a European company with only about 20 per
cent of its capacity outside the EC, it is much better in competitive terms
to be within the single market than trying to penetrate from outside.
That presence could become more important for large engineering companies
such as GEC Alsthom in view of the EC's new rules for opening up public
procurement contracts to competitive bidding. These will continue the
process of loosening the close ties between suppliers and public customers
in some European markets.
Looking back on the past three years, GEC Alsthom says it has learnt from
the experience of operating in the EC's different domestic markets, and has
been able to increase the amount of inter-country activities on particular
projects. 'Such lessons as we have learnt as the single market approaches
have been learnt because the people who make up the management of GEC
Alsthom have succeeded in fusing together their individual experience as
Britons, Frenchmen, Germans, Spaniards, Belgians, or other nationals.'

FT  19 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS says aluminium output to
fall by more than 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM OUTPUT in the Commonwealth of Independent States this year is
expected to fall by more than 10 per cent from the 1992 level, according to
CIS industry officials. They also want aluminium exports to go no higher
than 1m tonnes - more than 20 per cent below last year's estimated total.
The revised CIS forecasts were given to a team from VAW Aluminium of
Germany, the first delegation from the western industry to visit their
Russian counterparts this year.
Mr Karl Wobbe, VAW's management board member responsible for aluminium
production, said yesterday that, in spite of the extreme pressures on the
CIS industry, which was very short of raw materials and capital, the
production target was realistic.
'The CIS industry did not collapse last year and we don't expect disaster
will overtake it in 1993. So CIS exports will continue at a high level this
year and so will the problems they create for the rest of the world
aluminium industry. Prices will not go up from present low levels unless
western smelters make more production cuts,' he said.
Mr Wobbe said industry representatives estimate that CIS primary aluminium
output in 1992 reached 3.1m tonnes, not far below estimated capacity of 3.5m
to 3.6m tonnes and slightly higher than production forecasts made at an
industry gathering in St Petersburg in September. For a variety of reasons,
however, they expected 1993 production to fall to 2.675m tonnes.
CIS officials said that licences for the export of 735,000 tonnes of
aluminium were issued last year and another 150,000 tonnes was officially
exported under joint-venture arrangements, making a total of 885,000 tonnes.
However, they estimated that there was at least another 400,000 tonnes of
uncontrolled and unlicensed exports, including some directly from smelters.
Mr Wobbe said that Mr Gregory Maslov, head of the state-controlled Aluminium
Committee, set up in November and which seemed likely to take prime
responsibility for the CIS industry, wanted to cut exports by 400,000 tonnes
this year to leave more metal available for the domestic market.
However, the smelters wanted to export 200,000 tonnes on their own account.
Even so, the committee still hoped to keep exports at no more than 1m
tonnes.
In order to keep a tighter hold on exports, Russia increased aluminium
export duties from 50 Ecu (Pounds 39.25) a tonne at the end of 1992 to 130
Ecu for primary aluminium and to 205 Ecu for bartered metal. To discourage
exports of primary metal disguised as 'scrap', the duty on aluminium scrap
had been lifted to 460 Ecu a tonne.
Officials estimated that proceeds from nearly half the aluminium exported by
the CIS last year - about 600,000 tonnes - were used to buy alumina
(aluminium oxide) and other raw materials from the west so the CIS smelters
could continue producing metal.
'The aluminium committee wants stronger control of exports, but whether it
will succeed is another matter,' said Mr Wobbe. 'They (the CIS industry) are
begining to understand something about the free market and that you cannot
continue for ever producing at a loss.'
Alusuisse-Lonza said yesterday that overcapacity in the world primary
aluminium industry and low prices were forcing it to close its Steg smelter
in the Canton of Valais, Reuter reports from Zurich. Last year the smelter
produced 48,000 tonnes of metal compared with its capacity of 50,000 tonnes.
About 100 jobs will be lost when production ends in the autumn next year.
Inespal, Spain's state-owned aluminium producer, has told unions it wants to
cut 34,000 tonnes a year from the output of its La Coruna smelter, Reuter
reports from Madrid.
It produced 79,000 tonnes in 1992, and 39,000 tonnes from its Aviles
smelter.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Qantas to make 9% of workforce
redundant

QANTAS, the government-controlled Australian airline, plans to make 9 per
cent of its workforce redundant over the next two years to help cut costs by
ADollars 158m (USDollars 108.9m) a year.
Yesterday's announcement follows a review by Coopers and Lybrand, the
accounting firm, which said the 1,835 redundancies would save ADollars 95m a
year. The remainder of the savings are to be made by increasing efficiency.
The review was set up after the merger of Qantas and Australian Airlines,
the government-owned domestic airline, in September. The two airlines have
already shed a total 5,000 staff in the past 18 months.
Mr John Ward, chief executive, said the savings were essential to increase
efficiency in the run-up to the flotation of the government's 75 per cent
shareholding, expected later this year.
Mr Ward said Qantas would shortly begin discussions on potential synergies
with British Airways, which recently acquired a a 25 per cent stake in the
airline. He said the discussions could lead to further job losses. Qantas
said it hoped the trade unions would co-operate with the redundancy
programme, which will be delayed until next month to give the unions time to
respond.

Mr John Ward, Qantas chief executive, said the savings were essential to
increase efficiency in the run up to the flotation of the government's 75
per cent shareholding, expected later this year.
'The Qantas group can currently be counted among the top 10 airlines in the
world. The simple truth is that we must continue to improve our productivity
by 5 per cent per year to retain this position,' he said.
Mr Ward said Qantas would shortly begin discussions on potential synergies
with British Airways, which recently acquired a a 25 per cent stake in the
airline. He said the discussions could lead to further job losses.
Qantas said it hoped the trade unions would co-operate with the redundancy
programme, which will be delayed until early next month to give them time to
respond. The airline hopes to achieve at least 60 per cent of the job losses
through voluntary redundancy.
Qantas recorded a net profit of ADollars 137m in 1991-92, but Australian
suffered a loss of ADollars 38.4m, mainly because of recession and
fare-cutting following the deregulation of Australian domestic aviation in
1990.

Cascade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing, the Australian beer group, yesterday announced a deal with
Wilson Neill of New Zealand which will give it control of Tasmania's Cascade
brewery.
Foster's said Carlton and United Breweries (CUB), its wholly-owned
subsidiary, would establish a 50-50 partnership with Cascade Group,
wholly-owned by Wilson Neill, to acquire the Cascade name and a brewery in
Hobart.
The joint venture company will be controlled and operated by CUB.
Foster's said Wilson Neill would receive ADollars 27m (USDollars 18.6m) for
the Cascade name and the brewery, but would retain the Cascade group's other
assets, which include fruit juice manufacturing, a second brewery in
Launceston, and a chain of public houses.
The deal ends nearly a year of speculation about the future of Cascade,
which is one of Australia's most popular boutique beers.
However, the agreement is subject to the approval of the Trade Practices
Commission, which last year blocked a proposed outright sale of Cascade to
CUB for ADollars 100m.

NATIONSBANK, the large south-eastern US regional banking group formed in
1991 by the merger of C &amp; S Sovran and NCNB, yesterday reported Dollars
1.15bn of net earnings for the whole of 1992, more than five times the
previous year's level.
The bank's earnings had been held back in 1991 by heavy merger-related
restructuring charges and provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, NationsBank said net income was Dollars 234m,
or 92 cents a share, even after a one-time Dollars 50m pre-tax provision
caused by closures and merger-related consolidations. In the same quarter of
1991, it suffered a loss of Dollars 244m, orDollars 1.08 a share.
NationsBank is the fourth-biggest bank in the US, with total assets of
Dollars 118bn and more than 1,700 offices in nine states and the District of
Columbia.
Mr Hugh McColl, chairman and chief executive, yesterday described its first
full year of operations as 'extraordinarily successful' and said the bank
was ahead of schedule, since 300 of some 400 planned merger consolidation
projects had already been completed.
He noted that the bank's level of non-performing assets had declined by 29
per cent in 1992, to Dollars 1.99bn. Bad debt provisions declined to Dollars
1.45bn from Dollars 1.6bn in 1991, while net write-offs fell to Dollars 866m
in 1992, from Dollars 1.3bn the previous year.
Mr McColl said NationsBank was proceeding with expansion plans, including a
deal with Dean Witter, the brokerage house partly-owned by Sears Roebuck, to
form a joint venture retail securities company.
Total shareholders' equity rose by 20 per cent in 1992, to Dollars 7.8bn.
The bank's ratio of capital to assets under the Tier 1 regulatory measure
used in the US stood at a healthy 7.54 per cent at year-end.
Net interest income improved by 6 per cent last year, to Dollars 4.19bn,
thanks to wider spreads being enjoyed by the entire US banking industry.
Non-interest income increased by 10 per cent in 1992, to Dollars 3.97bn.
On Wall Street, NationsBank's share price closed unchanged on the day at
Dollars 52 1/8.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mexico's revolution in retailing
 -Larger store chains join forces with US groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEND a Saturday at Mexico City's Club Aurrera, the membership-only discount
store half-owned by Wal-Mart, and you may never want to shop again. You will
have to wait an hour to enter the car park, fight off customers to find a
trolley, and spend another hour in the queue for a cashier.
Inside will be thousands of businessmen stocking up on office supplies,
merchants buying supplies for their own shops, and elegant housewives buying
imported food and clothes.
Company executives proudly say the Polanco Club Aurrera sells more per
square metre than the most successful Sam's-Club (Club Aurrera's twin) in
the US.
Wal-Mart's outstanding success is the first sign of a revolution in Mexican
retailing, spurred by competition in the sector, the opening of the economy
to imports and the impending North American free trade agreement.
Small corner stores are losing business to the supermarkets. In turn, small
supermarkets are being swallowed up by a handful of large Mexican chains.
And the large chains are forming alliances with the giant US retailers.
Wal-Mart's partner is Cifra, Mexico's largest retailer: Price Club, the US
warehouse club, has a similar venture with Comercial Mexicana, the
third-largest Mexican retailer: Gigante, Mexico's second-largest retailer
has formed a joint venture with Fleming, the largest US wholesaler.
Not to be outdone, Liverpool, Mexico's up-market retail chain, announced in
December a joint venture with K mart. They intend to invest Dollars 500m to
build 100 K mart stores in Mexico.
All these joint ventures have much the same purpose. As Mr Juan Carlos
Mateos, planning director at Gigante, explains: 'They have the know-how and
we have the know-who.'
The US retailers are gaining access to an emerging, consumer-starved market
of 85m people, where profit margins are around 6 per cent on sales - around
double those in the US. The Mexicans, in turn, have immediate access to US
technology, distribution and buying-power. The big winners are Mexican
consumers, who can buy a vast array of (often imported) products at almost
wholesale prices.
But many, especially small, undercapitalised Mexican suppliers will suffer.
The big retailers, unlike the corner stores, buy in bulk or not at all: are
quick to import if quality and price are better abroad; and expect goods to
be packaged to their taste, with bar codes added, and to be delivered at the
time they say.
Wal-Mart and Cifra have set the trend, opening their first Club Aurrera last
March, with two more soon afterwards. They plan to launch another six before
the end of this year.
In June, Cifra and Wal-Mart extended their joint venture, and formed two
jointly-owned companies. The first is administered by Cifra, and consists of
new Cifra supermarkets under existing Cifra brands: the second is
administered by Wal-Mart, and comprises Wal-Mart supercentres, Club Aurrera,
distribution centres and an import-export company.
Cifra says it will benefit from Wal-Mart's technology that should enable it
to control stocks better and increase turnover. Longer term, it hopes
Wal-Mart will help Cifra expand from its base in central Mexico by improving
distribution channels, says a company official.
Wal-Mart has 'the best distribution system in the US', says Ms Christine
Aimer, an analyst at Baring Securities in Mexico City, and 'will help Cifra
become a national retailer.'
Gigante has already opened a non-membership 'price-impact' supermarket
(called Supermart) with Fleming in the small town of San Juan del Rio, with
another three expected to open by April. The company hopes to open about 10
Supermart stores a year, and to have 50 stores in operation in five years,
with sales of Dollars 1bn.
The company is aiming at middle-size Mexican cities, where there are fewer
supermarkets and profit margins are higher. Fleming is helping Gigante scan
goods as they enter and leave the shop, thus helping control stocks, and
advises on the lighting and lay-out of the stores, says Mr Wayne Epperson,
head of the joint-venture.
But Mr Epperson is in little doubt that Fleming could not enter Mexico
without help from Gigante. He, like Mr Mateos, hints one day the joint
venture will be extended to include other Gigante stores.
Liverpool's joint venture with K mart is perhaps the most incongruous, since
Liverpool is an upmarket department store chain but will be managing K
mart-style food and general goods stores.
'The joint venture,' says Mr Michel Marcos, Liverpool's director-general, of
Liverpool 'will enable us to expand into different markets.'
Like all US and Mexican retailers, Liverpool is betting that Mexico's
economic reforms will raise the purchasing power of the middle- and lower
classes, making US-style mass-market discount stores profitable.
Significantly, Liverpool and Cifra are using their US alliances to promote
Mexican goods in the US via jointly-owned export-import companies. Both
companies know that unless Mexico's relish for consumer goods is matched by
increased export revenues, the future for the retail sector is bleak.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Trial arbitration scheme for
Canadian securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN securities dealers and the Vancouver Stock Exchange are launching
an experimental arbitration service to provide a quick and relatively
inexpensive way of resolving disputes between stockbrokers and clients.
The service initially will be confined to claims of less than CDollars
25,000 (USDollars 19,500).
Members of the Investment Dealers' Association, including most of the firms
trading on the VSE, will be required to submit to binding arbitration if
this is requested by a disgruntled client. Neutral arbitrators will be
provided by the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration
Centre.
The new scheme is an effort to defuse criticism that the self-regulatory
efforts of securities dealers and stock exchanges have failed to provide
adequate protection to investors or sufficiently harsh penalties on
wrongdoers.
Under the rules, the arbitrator will be required to submit his findings
within 60 days of a hearing. The arbitrator will also apportion costs, which
are typically expected to total about CDollars 1,200, excluding legal fees
should the parties decide to be represented by lawyers.
The IDA said it would set up a national arbitration system if the British
Columbia project proves successful.

<TEXT>
THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange hopes to grab a bigger slice of the Dollars
1,000bn per day global foreign exchange market with plans to offer futures
and options contracts that resemble over-the-counter spot currency
transactions.
The new contracts, known as 'rolling spot' contracts, will be four times the
size of the CME's existing foreign currency products, a feature that should
make them more palatable to the institutional traders who dominate foreign
exchange trading.
The exchange plans first to offer rolling spot futures and options based on
sterling with a contract size of 250,000, and then extend the concept to
five other currencies on which it trades conventional futures.
The products have been submitted for regulatory review, and the CME hopes to
launch them by June. The futures and options will expire quarterly and be
quoted in terms identical to the interbank market.
Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, said: 'The spot market place as it stands is
needlessly cumbersome and inefficient. Each of these spot transactions and
rolls exacts a tremendous toll on banks, in that they involve considerable
transactional and operational expenses, as well as the potential for costly
mistakes in actual payment flows. The Merc's clearing house will streamline
this process by automatically adjusting for the roll, most likely in
variation margin.'

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Overseas holders to dispose of 45% Watts
Blake stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEBANESE, Belgian and German shareholders yesterday announced plans to sell
a combined 45 per cent stake in Watts Blake Bearne. The move is expected to
trigger a full scale bid for the world's largest ball clay producer.
Ceramics Holdings, controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family, Sibelco, a
privately owned Belgian-based producer of silica sand for the glass industry
and Quarzwerke, a private German producer of silica sand, are making the
sale under a concert party agreement in April 1991.
The companies said that under takeover rules: 'the acquisition of the
concert party members' holdings is likely to lead to an offer for the entire
issued share capital of the company.'
Mr John Pike, managing director of Watts Blake, said a sale to a single
purchaser would make it very difficult for the company to defend itself from
an unwelcome bidder.
'The board is gravely concerned about a number of issues that could arise
from this proposed sale. including the implications for the company's
employees and the local communities in which it operates,' said Mr Pike.
The group based in Newton Abbot, Devon also owns extensive reserves of ball
clay in the US and Germany. Almost two thirds of sales are used for the
manufacture of sanitary ware and wall and floor tiles.
Its performance is dependent upon the health of the construction industry;
pre-tax profits in 1991 fell by 27 per cent to Pounds 5.67m.
Profits in the fist six months of last year, however, rose by 7 per cent to
Pounds 3.74m helped by acquisitions.
Should a recommended purchaser offer less than 433p a share, Sibelco and
Quarzwerke have the right to buy Ceramics' shares at the same price.
Watts Blake shares yesterday rose from 425p to 433p having touched 455p at
one stage.

the most important markets in Europe.
The new venture, London Television European Sales, said that the London area
accounts for 47 per cent of UK mineral water consumption, 44 per cent of UK
charge cards, 37 per cent of UK businessmen and 25 per cent of the UK retail
outlet total of 30,000.
The first television advertising campaign to be booked by the new venture,

FT  19 JAN 93 / Xerox to move out of financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
XEROX, the US document pro- cessing group, yesterday announced plans to shed
its remaining insurance and financial services businesses to concentrate on
core operations.
The businesses to be discarded include Furman Selz, the New York brokerage
house; Crum and Forster, the property-casualty operation; and Xerox Life, a
life insurance and annuity business.
Xerox said it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 778m (Pounds 511m)
in the fourth quarter as a result of the move. This figure includes a net
Dollars 288m to strengthen reserves at Crum and Forster, plus Dollars 470m
for a partial writedown of goodwill attaching to the financial services and
insurance businesses. To help maintain its own financial position, Xerox
added that its board was considering the issue of up to Dollars 500m of new
equity during the first half of 1993.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said: 'It is imperative that Xerox continue to
maintain its strong balance sheet, to make sure our document processing
business has the financial resources to meet its growth objectives and to
facilitate an orderly disentanglement from our insurance and financial
services businesses.'
Xerox's troublesome foray into the financial services sector is reckoned to
have cost about Dollars 3bn. It has already pulled out of third-party
financing and, on the insurance side, has withdrawn from standard personal
property and casualty business. In the first nine months of 1992, Xerox made
after-tax profits of Dollars 28m from financial services, compared with
Dollars 374m from document processing.

<TEXT>
HONDA of Japan yesterday moved to strengthen its position in the European
motorcycle market by announcing an alliance with Piaggio, the Italian
manufacturer, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo.
Piaggio, which makes the Vespa scooter as well as mopeds, motorcycles and
small commercial vehicles, is Europe's largest maker of motorcycles.
Honda, which already has a wide-ranging technical collaboration with Peugeot
of France, is the world's leading motorcycle manufacturer, with a world
market share of about 40 per cent. It sells about 3.5m motorcycles a year
worldwide, made in 33 plants.
Motorcycle sales, particularly the strong growth in exports to the rest of
Asia, have helped Honda weather the downturn in its Japanese car sales.
Under the basic agreement between Honda and Piaggio, working groups will be
set up to examine product development for the European market. 'The
objective is to establish a collaborative working relationship focused on
new product development in small and mid-sized motorcycles,' said Honda.
The Japanese company will also provide some key components for Piaggio, such
as engines for the company's Gilera range of motorcycles.
The two companies also plan to co-operate in the design, manufacture and
procurement of standardised parts for use in their motorcycles for the
European market.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Custos slides SKr398m into red
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOS, the Swedish investment group, slid to a SKr398m (Dollars 55m) loss
after tax in 1992, a sharp reverse from the SKr159m profit recorded a year
earlier.
The group, which is majority-owned by Volvo, the motor vehicle group, and
Skanska, Sweden's largest construction company, blamed the loss on high
interest rates, turmoil in the capital markets, and a downturn in the
Swedish stock market. The group cut its dividend to SKr1 from SKr7.
Custos said income fell to SKr408m from SKr457m, while interest costs
climbed to SKr694m, compared with SKr585m. An injection into a subsidiary
amounted to a further SKr400m.
The group noted that the adjusted value of its share portfolio fell by 23
per cent to SKr5.76bn, compared with a fall of just 1 per cent for the
Stockholm stock market as measured by the Affarsvarlden general index.
At January 15, the company calculated its own net worth at SKr74 per share,
or a total of SKr3.52bn.
Volvo and Skanska launched a bid for full control of Custos last October in
what many thought would be the first step in the dissolution of
cross-shareholding links between the two groups.
The offer was later abandoned after it was rebuffed by big shareholders and
share prices began to recover.
However, a joint bid for a minority stake in a smaller investment company,
Protorp, did proceed successfully after the original terms were improved.
Skanska and Volvo said yesterday they now owned 99.6 per cent of Protorp's
shares, including those held by Euroc, Skanska's building materials
affiliate. The offer was worth SKr200 per share, valuing the company at
SKr2bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OIL-STARVED Cuba, which is trying to develop its domestic oil deposits, will
next month offer 11 onshore and offshore blocks for exploration and
development by foreign companies, Reuter reports from Havana.
It will be the first international tender of its kind by Cuba, which has
suffered severe oil shortages since the collapse of its preferential trade
links with the former Soviet Union.
The Cuban state oil company Cubapetroleo (Cupet) announced that the tender
inviting bids would be officially presented in Calgary and London on
February 10 and 17 respectively.
On offer for production sharing contracts were seven onshore and three
offshore blocks, with one block straddling land and sea. Foreign oil
companies had until August 1 to present their bids. A British company, Simon
Petroleum Technology, would help organise the tender.
Cupet officials said the blocks were in various parts of the island,
including one in the western province of Pinar del Rio and another in
south-eastern Granma province. These were areas which were either unexplored
or where past exploration data were now out of date, the officials said.
A second tender offering more exploration blocks was planned for later.
Over the past two years, Cuba has awarded contracts for seven exploration
blocks.

ITALSTRADE, the civil engineering arm of Italy's IRI state holding company,
has signed a letter of intent for a L80bn (Pounds 35m) contract to build
parallel tunnels beneath the Thames for a crucial section of London
Underground's Pounds 1.7bn Jubilee Line extension.
The 2.5km tunnel, linking the new Canary Wharf Tube station with that at
Canada Water on the south bank of the Thames, will pass 35 metres below
ground level. Construction, which involves Italstrade and two smaller
Italian building groups, will take four years.
Italstrade, Italy's second biggest civil engineering group, has also given
details of three other important contracts not previously announced.
Work has begun on the L200bn extension to Tangiers of the Casablanca-Rabat
motorway in Morocco. In Turkey, the company has won a L285bn contract to
build the Berke dam on the country's border with Syria; while in Romania,
construction recently started on a L240bn terminal building for Bucharest
airport.
Italstrade has been short-listed for a second Jubilee Line contract from
London Underground for a parallel 2.85km tunnel from London Bridge to the
new Canada Water station.
The Dollars 63m deal would take just under four years to complete.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Kosovo shudders under the yoke: Jonathan Ledgard reports on
Albanians' resentment at the rule imposed by Serbia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN LEDGARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE cramped and freezing bungalow which houses Kosovo's outlawed
ethnic-Albanian parliament, 14-year-old Lumzim was giving his testimony. He
looked shocked and close to tears.
Lumzim (not his real name) had saved DM300 (Dollars 188) selling cigarettes
on the streets and had planned to travel to friends in Albania with the
money. On the way to the bus station, he said, four Serbian policemen
stopped him, stripped him naked in the freezing cold and found the money
pinned to the inside pocket of his jeans.
They beat him, stole his passport and money and forced the pin down his
throat. An x-ray shows the two-inch pin lodged in his stomach. It would take
an operation to remove it, but Serbian-controlled hospitals have denied care
to Albanians.
The incident is part of the systematic political and human rights abuse,
identified by international human rights organisations, inflicted on ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 per cent of Kosovo's population.
Kosovo used to be an autonomous province of former Yugoslavia until it was
reincorporated unilaterally into Serbia three years ago by Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, its Communist-turned-nationalist leader.
Serbs, resentful that 500 years of Ottoman rule and the high birth rate of
ethnic Albanians has made them a tiny minority in the former cradle of
Serbia's medieval kingdom, voted overwhelmingly for ultra-nationalists in
last month's general elections - boycotted by ethnic Albanians. The outcome
has raised the tension level and the risk of an Albanian revolt which, once
unleashed, would invite Serb repression on a scale which could provoke
irresistible demands for intervention from the Moslem world.
It is a testament to the repression in Kosovo that Zeljko Raznjatovic ,
better known as 'Arkan' and described by the US government as a Serbian war
criminal, was elected to the all-Serbian parliament, and operates openly
from the lobby of the Grand Hotel. He dresses fashionably and is guarded by
thuggish veterans from the earlier fighting in Vukovar and other war-torn
towns and villages in Croatia.
In an interview he made clear his unconcern about his reputation and the war
criminal tag put on him by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of state.
'I don't give a damn about Eagleburger and his damn trial. He is more of a
war criminal than I am,' he says.
While extreme nationalists won most of the seats in the December elections,
the Democrats led by Mr Milan Panic, who were the only group prepared to
compromise over Kosovo, did not even win a seat. This is bad news for ethnic
Albanians, although Arkan claims they have nothing to fear. 'If the
Albanians are honest and look to Belgrade we welcome them,' he says. 'If it
is Tirana, the Albanian capital they look to, we'll help them back.'
Most ethnic Albanians here demand independence for Kosovo, rather than union
with even more impoverished Albania across the mountains. But, asked about
the clandestine ethnic Albanian government headed by self-styled president
Ibrahim Rugova, Arkan was ominously dismissive. 'Rugova is a tourist in
Serbia, an Albanian tourist. He will be leaving very soon, believe me.'
Mr Rugova is trying to keep the peace, and it is proving very hard. The
Serbs have shut all the Albanian media, but with every arrest and killing of
an Albanian by Serbian authorities the country people, for whom the
vendetta, or kahun, is still a cherished way of death, are becoming more
restless.
Mr Rugova and other ethnic Albanian intellectuals are haunted by the
knowledge that any war would end in slaughter of the unarmed Albanians, half
of whom are under 15 years of age.
The Yugoslav civil war has been fought from the hamlet up. Kosovo will be no
different. To stop a bloodbath here, the United Nations would have to deploy
massive peacekeeping forces on the ground in the rural communities and
emasculate the Serbian authorities. This seems improbable.
Young ethnic Albanians say they are prepared to die. 'We would rather die
than be Serbian slaves,' said one group of students.
Many Serbs think the same way. 'Only war will sort this mess out. That's why
I voted for Slobodan Milosevic. He will protect us from the Moslems, from
genocide,' said a working-class Serb in the Kosovan capital, Pristina.
Such views are common and there is almost no middle ground. Albanians want
to be free and Serbs want back what they see as their cultural heritage.
Arkan's cause is also clear.
He will use all means available to crush Albanian hopes of independence.
But even Arkan fears clannish Albanian culture and has sponsored the inflow
of Serb immigrants. He and his followers exude violence and the hatred
between Christians and Moslems here is tangible. As a warlord, Arkan has
already become rich through war. Many fear he also has a personal interest
in seeing war and the opportunity for pillage spread to Kosovo.

<TEXT>
A LARGE and increasing majority in Denmark supports the Maastricht treaty,
according to an opinion poll published yesterday.
The treaty is due to be submitted to a second referendum in Denmark later
this year. The poll showed that 56 per cent would vote yes, 30 per cent no,
and 14 per cent were undecided.
It was conducted on January 11 and 12, before the publication of the Tamil
report, on Thursday, and the consequent resignation of Prime Minister Poul
Schluter.
This compares with a December poll in which 51 per cent were in favour, 37
per cent against and 12 per cent undecided. In last June's referendum on the
treaty 50.7 per cent voted in favour of the treaty and 49.3 per cent
against.
The date of the second referendum has not yet been set, but it is expected
it will be held in May.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (23): Slow growth
limits benefits - Pledges to workers have mixed success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'social dimension' of the European Community was relaunched by Mr
Jacques Delors in 1989 to win the support of organised labour for greater
economic integration and to address the fear that labour as a whole could
lose out from the free market drive of the single market. It has been
remarkably successful in achieving the first goal, rather less so in
achieving the second.
The 1989 social action programme contained a series of measures, from
improving health and safety, establishing minimum rights for pregnant women,
young people and part-time workers, to imposing EC-wide limits on the
working week. But thanks to slower growth throughout the EC, and successful
blocking by the UK government, few of the important measures have so far
become directives.
If the Maastricht treaty is passed, its 'social chapter', which Britain has
opted-out of, will in theory make it easier to push through more social and
employment legislation by majority vote. But that also looks unlikely at
present.
Most member states are reluctant to adopt any policies that might reduce
competitiveness or provide succour to Britain, regarded as the 'Hong-Kong of
Europe'. And even within the European Commission's social affairs
Directorate-General 5 the leading strategists of the social dimension
privately accept that a less ambitious approach to legislation is required.
What is the case for the social dimension? Some supporters, especially in
the richer EC countries, have argued that the harmonisation of minimum
rights at work across the Community is required to prevent 'social dumping'.
That means capital flowing to areas where labour is least protected,
triggering downward pressure on standards in other countries.
There is little evidence that an increase in social dumping is accompanying
the arrival of the single market. That may be because the low wage
economies, such as Spain, Portugal and Greece, have quite strictly regulated
labour markets, making them unpopular with big business. It may also be
because unit labour costs are remarkably similar all over the EC, in other
words the high wage countries justify higher pay scales with high
productivity while low wage countries have low productivity to match.
There has, however, been a big increase in cross-border takeover activity by
EC-based multinationals, inspiring the draft directive on European works
councils, designed to give employees an EC-wide voice in corporate affairs.
But apart from a few highly specialised groups, such as airline pilots,
there is little sign that EC-wide collective bargaining or an EC labour
market is emerging. Only 2m EC nationals work permanently in another EC
country and the number has actually declined in the past 10 years.
Yet there is a broader, more 'political', case for the social dimension as a
counter-balance to the forces unleashed by the single market. Mr Robert
Lindley, of Warwick University, summarises it thus:
'While capital is more mobile than labour, financial capital is more mobile
than industrial capital. Combine the rigours of the single market with those
of free capital movement and there arises a situation in which financial
markets have apparently been handed much greater power to impose their
judgments of performances and priorities upon the workings of the other
constituents of the EC economy.'
The measures outlined in the social action programme are an attempt to
ensure that the judgments of one of those other constituents - labour - do
not go completely unheard. But by stressing harmonisation against
de-regulation and EC-wide rules against subsidiarity the architects of the
social dimension have risked trespassing on an area of economic life
strongly coloured by national differences.
There are 12 different systems of industrial relations in the EC and while
there are patterns of similarity which link some of them, there are also big
differences in the role of the law, the power of unions, and the structure
of working life.
Southern member states, for example, tend to have low female participation
and little part-time work. Spain and France have weak unions but strong
labour laws. Most of the northern European states have strong labour laws
and institutionalised 'social partnership' collaboration between organised
labour and capital.
The Christian Democrat/Social Democrat consensus that prevails in most
continental European countries invariably gives labour a powerful
institutional voice even where collective bargaining is weak.
Britain, with its laissez-faire regulatory framework but historically strong
(although now weakened) unions, is out on a limb. And its liberal hire and
fire rules, widespread use of 'atypical' work patterns, and long working
hours, make it the most affected by the regulatory regime the Commission has
been trying to impose.
Although the Commission denies it is trying to impose a particular model of
industrial relations on the EC it clearly leans towards the Germanic model
with its strong labour laws and legally-backed voice for employees.
Whether, in the longer run, the Commission succeeds in establishing a
'European model' remains to be seen. There is some evidence that the
'Germanic' model, already heavily plagiarised by Holland and Belgium, is
spreading into France, but otherwise there has been little spontaneous
convergence. Indeed, if there has been a common trend over the past decade
it is towards de-regulation and a weakening of social partnership, although
that has gone further in the UK than elsewhere.
Looking ahead, European labour faces a tough time. European monetary
integration will impose a single inflation and interest rate, and rule out
devaluation, with the result that the strain of economic adjustment will
fall on wages and employment in the weaker countries. And without
co-ordinated wage increases across Europe those countries with high unit
labour cost increases, such as Britain and Italy, will see lost
competitiveness flow directly into job losses.
The social dimension affords little protection against the potentially
dramatic effects of monetary integration. But it should not be written off
completely and, interestingly, it survived virtually unscathed from the
Edinburgh summit review of subsidiarity. Currently, in the UK, the
government's drive to contract out central and local government services has
been thrown into confusion by one of the oldest pieces of EC employment
legislation, known as the acquired rights directive.
The social dimension is undeniably suffering a cyclical down-turn, as it has
done before, but it has also established itself as a fact of life across
large areas of working life in the EC.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (24): How foresight
saved money - Corporate strategy, long range planning from Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics group, the removal of most of Western
Europe's internal tariff barriers on January 1 was just the latest stage in
a long and unhurried series of changes in one of its biggest markets.
Almost a decade ago, the company established a task force in Tokyo to study
changes taking place in the European Community. Six senior managers from
departments such as corporate planning, finance and accounts and personnel
spent a year studying the issue.
They filed a many-volumed report to top management in May 1985 which
recommended, among other things, the creation of a regional co-ordination
centre in Europe.
In October 1989, a small European co-ordinating office was established in
central London. Mr Takeo Fujii, the leader of the team which wrote the 1985
report, became its head.
A branch office was soon opened in Brussels. It has just three staff, one
Japanese, one local recruit, picked for his knowledge of the European
Commission and its directives, and a secretary.
One reason for the gentle pace and limited resources given to the project
was that Toshiba was growing quickly in Europe's fragmented markets in any
case.
Individual operating divisions had already set up shop in Europe. The first
manufacturing centre, for televisions in Plymouth, Devon, was established in
the 1970s. Manufacturing is now spread across Europe, with semiconductors
and VCRs made in Germany and microwave ovens and photocopiers in France.
There are eight divisions, including finance and basic research, that
operate almost entirely independently. Their only point of common contact in
Europe is Mr Fujii's London office.
Those eight divisions employ more than 5,000 people in 11 European
countries. Almost half work at manufacturing subsidiaries and Toshiba
Corporation shares are listed on nine European bourses. Sales in Europe are
worth Y65bn with Germany and the UK accounting for almost half the total,
France taking 17 per cent and Italy 11 per cent.
Distribution is strongly based on national borders. Almost all the output is
sent to distribution centres in individual countries before going to dealers
and shops. The output of office automation equipment, for example, is
co-ordinated from Dusseldorf, but products are routed via warehouses in each
country.
It is a system that is likely to continue for some time, says Mr Fujii.
Markets still have national characteristics, especially for products that
are retailed.
France has its own technical standards for televisions. Germany has
ultra-strict rules on the design of microwave ovens, and its consumers have,
until very recently, refused to buy flat screen televisions, preferring the
older, more rounded screens. Toshiba even had to buy its picture tubes for
the German market from European manufacturers Thomson and Phillips.
There are exceptions. Some television picture tubes are bought by other
manufacturers. Since there are a small number of industrial buyers which
each order a lot of units, the tubes are shipped directly to them from
plants in the US, Japan or Thailand.
Mr Fujii says there will be few changes in procedures in the short term. The
company will have to deal with new forms of paperwork, dealing with sales
tax and import/export statistics, and is having to set up new systems to
cope.
'Once the computers have been set up, I hope costs will be lower,' he says
In the longer term, some parts of distribution may be centralised. The
company is considering cities such as Hanover or Barcelona for the
establishment of a 'distribution logistics' centre, especially to deal with
products that are imported from outside Europe.
Eventually, it should be possible to distribute directly from, say, Germany,
to retailers in Italy or Spain. But Mr Fujii does not believe this will
happen soon in spite of a widespread belief among colleagues in Japan that
1993 has ushered in a perfect single market in Europe.
'Most Japanese may dream of a unified (European) market, but personally I
see only small changes,' he says. 'For the time being, country-by-country
structures will remain. Different markets have different needs. We are not
in a hurry.'

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (22): The wages of
rigidity - Edward Balls analyses the structure of Europe's unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR market is the Achilles heel of the European economy. High and
persistent unemployment across the continent are the most direct, and most
distressing, manifestation of Europe's labour deficiencies. But unemployment
is just one product of the more general problem of inflexibility and
immobility that threatens to hamper Europe's single market.
The OECD, in its latest economic outlook, calculates that total unemployment
in OECD European countries will rise to 19.9m in the first quarter of this
year . More than 80 per cent of Europe's unemployed are located in EC member
countries. The EC unemployment rate is expected to be 10.7 per cent of the
total workforce, up from 8.4 per cent in 1990. This quarter's EC rate
compares with 7.4 per cent in the US and 2.3 per cent in Japan.
There is surprisingly little national variation in unemployment rates among
the largest EC countries. Italy, at 11 per cent, had the highest
unemployment rate of the four largest countries in 1992, followed by France
with 10.3 per cent, the UK with 10.1 per cent and Germany with 7.6 per cent.
But many of the southern European states have much higher unemployment rates
with Spain's 18 per cent the highest.
The EC's high unemployment rate is, in part, a reflection of Europe's poor
recent growth record. EC gross domestic product is expected to have risen by
1.1 per cent in 1992 compared with 1.8 per cent in both the US and Japan.
But even when growth does eventually return to Europe, the Community may
remain hampered by high unemployment. EC unemployment rates have remained at
persistently high levels for more than a decade. The average EC unemployment
rate in the 1980s was 9.6 per cent of the workforce, up from 4.8 per cent in
the period 1974-79. The US average was 7.2 per cent in the 1980s and 6.7 per
cent in 1974-79.
Why does Europe have more unemployment than the US? One commonly cited
reason is unemployment benefits. In the US, most men are disqualified from
receiving any kind of welfare support after 26 weeks. In Europe, by
contrast, unemployment benefits tend to be both more generous and
open-ended.
The second reason is the relative rigidity of real wages in Europe compared
with the US because of Europe's more regulated labour markets and more
effective trade unions. The OECD calculates that the amount of unemployment
needed to keep inflation from rising is much higher in Europe than in the
US, Japan or Sweden. To reduce inflation by one percentage point,
unemployment must rise by more than twice as much in EC countries as in OECD
countries overall, and by four times more than in the US.
Yet, these unemployment rates tell merely part of the unemployment story.
They only include people who are available and looking for work. They
exclude the 'economically inactive': people who have no jobs but have given
up searching for employment. In fact, there has been a sharp rise in male
inactivity across the developed world over the past decade, particularly
among older and younger men and the unskilled.
Non-employment rates, the sum of the unemployed and the 'inactive' as a
percentage of the population, are much more constant across countries than
unemployment rates. The US, Canada and Australia have non-employment rates
similar to those in Europe. Only Japan and Sweden have low non-employment
rates by OECD standards.
In continental Europe, this rise was largely reflected in the unemployment
statistics. Elsewhere - the UK, Australia, Canada and Sweden - the rise in
activity was at least as important as the rise in unemployment.
The conventional view that Europe has a more serious problem of joblessness
than the US is misleading. The fact that the US has less generous
unemployment benefits and more flexible real wages does not mean that the US
has less non-employment. Instead, they explain why much of this US
non-employment fails to show up in the jobless statistics.
In the US, where wages are very flexible, the real wages of the lowest-paid
10 per cent of workers have fallen by 30 per cent since 1970. Very low
relative wages for unskilled jobs, and the absence of income support for
single men, help to explain the rise in crime among less educated men.
In continental Europe, by contrast, the relative rigidity of wages, and high
unemployment benefits has prevented unskilled real wages from falling but
employers have been unwilling to hire the unskilled at those wages.
The downside of America's less regulated labour market is more
non-employment outside the legal economy. But the advantage is a much more
impressive record of employment growth, particularly for women and young
people, albeit in lower paid and often part-time occupations.
US total employment grew by an average 2.6 per cent a year between 1983 and
1989, compared with just 1.0 per cent for the EC. Employment in Britain's
deregulated labour market grew by an average 2.0 per cent a year over the
same period. Both the UK and US have higher female participation rates and
lower women and youth unemployment rates then continental Europe.
But the US has one additional and unambiguous advantage - the mobility of
its population. The pattern of US employment growth is not equal across
states but the US does not have persistent high or low unemployment regions.
Regional problems caused by unequal rates of economic growth are offset by
migration.
Research by Mr Larry Katz and Mr Olivier Blanchard, published last year by
the Brookings Institution, shows that if employment in a particular state
falls by 1,000 in any year, then, on average, 300 workers stay unemployed,
fifty drop out of the labour force and 650 leave the state. Eventually,
out-migration erases the effect on unemployment and participation rates.
Migration does not play this equilibrating role to anything like the same
extent in European countries, let alone across national borders. In 1987,
2.8 per cent of the US population changed their state of residence compared
to 1.1 per cent of Germans who changed their region of residence, 1.3 per
cent in France and 1.1 per cent in the UK.
The European single market should encourage the creation of new jobs in the
Community but the geographic distribution of these jobs is unlikely to be
evenly spread. The inflow of migrants from eastern Europe and north Africa
may improve the currently low levels of mobility of EC workers. But, for
now, the relative immobility of the EC workforce remains an important
barrier to economic integration.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (19): Sex equality is
not all that it seems - Women will get a growing share of jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN are likely to win the bulk of the new jobs expected to be created in
the European Community over the next two decades. This may, however, have
some double-edged consequences for both national labour markets and for
women themselves.
It could contribute to the continuing high levels of EC unemployment. One
reason EC joblessness has continued at such levels is that about 70 per cent
of the new jobs created between the end of 1985 and the end of 1990 went to
previously unwaged women, rather than the registered unemployed.
This trend appears to be entrenched. The European Commission predicts that
previously unwaged women will take up most of the 25m new jobs it expects by
2010.
The consequences for women themselves are far from straightforward. Their
position in the future EC will depend in large part on whether they are
working full or part-time and on the national labour market systems within
which they work.
Recent research*, as yet unpublished, has found that women's work is
polarising, both between different groups of women workers and across the
different member states (Data was not available for Italy).
The research, which was completed for the European Commission's Network of
Experts on the Situation of Women in the Labour Market, says: 'Women's
increasing participation in all the labour markets of the EC over the past
decade might be expected to indicate increasing convergence in the labour
market positions of men and women. Evidence . . . suggests no such
expectation is justified.'
About 30 per cent of the jobs created between 1985 and 1990 were part-time
and EC employers are expected to increase their demand for part-time
workers, many of whom are likely to be women, over the next two decades.
The research, which is based on an analysis of the most comprehensive labour
market data available for EC countries, supports the recent finding by the
OECD that 'female part-timers are more restricted to a limited range of low
paid, low status jobs than female full-timers'.
In all EC countries women part-timers are more likely to work in
female-dominated or 'feminised' occupations than full-timers. Part-timers
are also more likely to be in lower level jobs than are women full-timers.
The researchers warn that overall measures of occupational segregation may,
however, mask divergent trends and levels of segregation for full-time women
workers, compared with part-timers and between the different EC labour
markets.
The report says: 'Overall measures of segregation are not necessarily very
revealing as the net change reflects the result of two trends pulling in
opposite directions: firstly a tendency for women to be increasing their
share of professional and higher level jobs, but secondly a tendency for
women also to be increasing their concentration of employment in sectors
where they were already heavily overrepresented, notably in clerical and
some service sectors.'
The research reveals that women's status at work varies considerably, even
between those member states with similar levels of development and of female
participation in the labour market.
For example, in the UK female part-timers dominate lower level jobs in
catering, whereas in France both full and part-timer of both sexes are more
evenly represented in these jobs.
Also, in some EC countries and occupations, part-time work is less of a
barrier to professional status than in others. In female-dominated
professions such as teaching, for example, part-time women workers have a
relatively higher share of professional jobs in Germany, Greece and the
Netherlands.
In contrast, in Denmark, France, Portugal and the UK part-timers generally
have a lower share of the professional jobs or have shares only equal to
their share of all jobs in the total labour market.
The research says: 'This example suggests that within feminised professions,
there is considerable scope for variety in the extent to which part-time
working is utilised and in some countries part-time work may be just as
common in professional areas.'
The study appears to undermine the argument that it is necessary for women
to work in the lower level part-time jobs to achieve what is sometimes
characterised as the main goal - increasing women's participation in the
workforce.
For example, like Denmark and the UK, the Netherlands has high levels of
women working part-time. However, unlike Denmark and the UK, the Netherlands
has a relatively low level of total female participation within the paid
workforce.
The research suggests that this is because the labour market systems of
member states will also have an influence on women's occupational
segregation into low status jobs within feminised sectors.
It says that in some countries the opportunities for part-time working in
higher level jobs seem to be greater and therefore the association of
part-time work with low skill concentration is reduced.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (21): The attractions
are still strong - World investors are keen to secure a foothold in the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL

<TEXT>
WHATEVER the political and economic uncertainties currently enveloping the
European Community, it remains the target for huge, inward flows of
investment aimed at securing a foothold in the world's largest trading bloc.
For while the debate over Europe's future has acquired new and broader
dimensions, the EC remains primarily a partnership of trading nations
offering those operating within it access to a marketplace of unparallelled
potential.
The scale of the market, the diversity of its customers, the prospect for
continuing expansion and the promise of relative political and economic
stability have combined as critical factors in helping to attract investment
from around the globe.
With fears receding that a protectionist Europe will emerge in the wake of
the single market - unless final failure to agree the Uruguay round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade leads to global trade warfare -
investors have continued to give high priority to raising their exposure to
the European marketplace.
In 1991, estimates suggest that total inward investment into the EC
countries reached Dollars 65bn, with the US and Japan topping the league of
big spenders.
For the US, Europe has long been a main target for external investment,
though the ever-present threat to its trading relationship with the
community was forcefully underlined with its threat to impose penal tariffs
on a range of EC products in the event of a Gatt breakdown.
For Japan, the political crisis over the future of the Maastricht treaty has
created considerable alarm. The country's cumulative interest in the EC
already amounts to more than Dollars 55bn. Although that is less than half
the level of investment it has in the US, the European market is potentially
as large.
Hopes for a balanced, mutually beneficial, political and trading
relationship between the EC and Japan manifested themselves in the joint
Hague declaration of 1991. But the continuing, huge trade imbalance in
Japan's favour - Dollars 27bn in 1991 - and the obstacles to doing business
in Japan itself ensure that tensions will continue.
Japan's approach is further complicated by considerable variations in the
strength of its bilateral relations with individual EC states.
Some EC officials claim Japan still plays off member states against one
another when it comes to inward investment decisions.
The UK has apparently maintained its position as the single largest
benefactor of the inflow of investment from Japan and from most other non-EC
nations. Only the US beats the UK performance as a recipient of overseas
funds.
The UK continues to account for around one-third of all incoming EC
investment. Its share reached a peak of nearly 40 per cent in 1990.
Japan has almost twice as much investment in Britain as in other EC
countries while the UK's share of US investment within the community amounts
to more than the combined totals recorded by Germany, the Netherlands and
France.
The debate over whether Britain's attractions are a reflection of its innate
weaknesses or strengths remains as lively as ever.
While ministers portray its success as a ringing endorsement of its open,
free market economy, without controls on currency movements or remittance of
profits, critics paint a rather different picture.
The counter-argument suggests that Britain offers investors a relatively
cheap base for operations, offering high workplace skills and a labour
market unencumbered by many of the obligations set down in employment laws
in force elsewhere in Europe.
Britain's isolation in refusing to sign the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty might well reinforce the image, although it may also serve to
underline its attractions for some inward investors.
France is the next most popular location for inward investment - accounting
for something approaching 20 per cent of the total - with Belgium next on 14
per cent.
The popularity of Germany as a target for inward funds is also rising, given
the comparative strength of its economy and the potential for exploiting
business opportunities in former east Germany.
Contrary to some expectations, incoming investment in Europe is not
overwhelmingly concentrated in high-tech businesses, but continues also at a
high level in traditional manufacturing activities.
The big question now, however, is whether the flow of corporate investment
into Europe has peaked.
Figures indicate that the process has, in the short-term at least, slowed
down dramatically. The 1991 total for inward investment fell by Dollars 20bn
on the previous year.
The latest slow-down, almost certain to have been continued in 1992, is, in
part, a reflection not only of the impact of recession in Europe but also of
weak domestic conditions within the inward investing nations.
In addition, many businesses will by now have made their principal
investments within the European market and are not maintaining budgets at
the same level.
Nor does the recent disarray within EC member states over the next phases of
European development - combined with the continuing threat that Denmark
might yet provoke another crisis of confidence - provide the preferred
backdrop for continuing inward investment.
There is also the question of how the community can best exploit the
continuing, inward flow of investment funds. The EC recognises the economic
imbalances which already exist within its boundaries but progress at evening
them out has been painfully slow.
The Commission itself recently acknowledged that regional differences
remained comparable with those which existed 20 years ago. The completion of
the single market means that capital and labour will increasingly locate
where the physical and economic environment is most attractive.
In spite of a doubling of the structural funds, the resources for promoting
regional development remain small. The volumes of investment required to
help promote broadly-based economic development are enormous but there is
scope for encouraging new, inward investment to help redress the existing
imbalances.
According to the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies at
Newcastle University: 'EC regional policy needs to be reformulated in such a
way as to ensure that the huge amount of investment flows towards the less
favoured regions and avoids the currently wasteful practice of national and
regional bodies spending vast amounts competing for inward investment.'

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (20): Drinks sector
sees the birth of the Euro-palate - Consumer tastes are becoming more daring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Euro-consumer is still a shadowy species, but one that is slowly gaining
substance as national tastes converge, according to market researchers.
In the drinks sector, a few more people every year are converted from
traditional, locally-produced spirits to international brands of whisky and
cognac. Many soft drinks find increasing acceptance across frontiers.
Northern Europeans are drinking more wine; and southern Europeans are
acquiring a thirst for beer. While the Germans, the continent's heaviest
beer drinkers, maintained a steady annual consumption of 142 litres a head
during the 1980s, Spanish consumption rose 36 per cent to 72 litres, and the
Portuguese lifted their intake a staggering 68 per cent to 64 litres.
Throughout the decade, the British ale drinker continued to develop a taste
for continental lager, bringing another note of harmony into the European
beer market.
At least one Dutch barman in Friesland no longer tries to make UK visitors
feel at home by scraping the froth off a glass of Pils and jovially
presenting them with 'an English beer'.
But the fact that Europe's beer drinkers now have more tastes in common does
not mean that by the end of the decade everybody will be drinking the same
few brands. Perish the thought.
Lager dominates the market - but there is a huge variety of brands and, on
the whole, each country still prefers its own.
Consumer loyalty to local brews is strongest in Germany, which accounts for
more than a third of European beer consumption. The country supports 1,150
brewers and rather more breweries. The Reinheitsgebot purity laws, which
required the use of only water, barley, hops and yeast in making beer, long
proved a barrier to imports.
But even since the laws were rescinded in 1987, imports have risen by a mere
0.5 per cent, and still represent less than 2 per cent of consumption.
Few believe, however, that such a situation can survive for much longer; and
Carlsberg of Denmark, and Grolsch of the Netherlands have recently acquired
German brewers.
Britain has been much more receptive to foreign products since the late
development of its lager market - with even Sol, a Mexican lager served with
a wedge of lime in the bottle, in the repertoire. One in three glasses of
lager drunk in the UK is a continental brand; and about the same amount is
shared by Australian, US, Canadian and other overseas brands.
It has been difficult to establish pan-European brands amid such diversity.
Heineken, of the Netherlands, the most pan-European of brewers, controls
only 9.6 per cent of the market, and the Heineken brand itself accounts for
a mere 3.4 per cent.
Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, has an estimated 6 per cent market share, but
sales of its eponymous brand account for little more than 2 per cent.
These two brewers, both dominant in their own countries, have achieved their
pre-eminence in Europe through wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquisitions,
joint ventures or licensing agreements in almost every EC state.
Thus Heineken owns Dreher in Italy, Murphy's in Ireland, Athenian in Greece,
El Aguila in Spain, and Francaise de Brasserie in France, while its
mainstream brand is brewed under licence in the UK by Whitbread.
Carlsberg owns Hannen in Germany, and has stakes in Poretti of Italy, Unicer
of Portugal, and Cruz Campo of Spain. It is forming a joint venture with
Allied-Lyons in the UK, and is brewed under licence in several other
countries.
With such widespread distribution, and sold as part of portfolios of local
products, Heineken and Carlsberg should continue to grow into true
pan-European brands.
Further contenders for such status may emerge from the continuing
consolidation of the industry - the growing presence of BSN, the French
brewer in the countries of southern Europe, suggests its Kronenbourg brand
is one possibility.
But during the 1990s, consumers seem likely to be more adventurous in their
tastes, demanding a greater choice of quality beers of all kinds.
Brewers may find it more profitable to cater for strong niche markets than
chase mainstream volume.
Such markets are already emerging - in the revival of cask-conditioned
regional ales in the UK, in the rediscovery of wheat beers in Germany, and
the growing popularity of Belgium's specialty beers seasoned with fruit or
spices.
Consumers are relishing the flavours - the malt and hops of English ales or
the coriander of Belgian white beer - after the blandness of so much lager.
Some products are acquiring the cachet of fine wines; and they should find
an equally appreciative and permanent market.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (16): Variety remains
the spice of life - Matching consumers with products is the challenge facing
corporations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE idea that we are now in a new era of EC-wide consumer homogeneity would
please consumer goods' brand managers everywhere - it would make life a lot
more simple - but we are far from that.
The member states of the European Community still have vastly differing
national legislation on just about every facet of consumer life; everything
from toy advertising to a legal definition of low alcohol beer has yet to be
harmonised. And as bigger fish - such as a common currency, or common
taxation policies - have yet to be fully fried, subsidiarity, the principle
permitting decisions to be made at the lowest possible level of community
life, is likely to be applied with regularity when it comes to consumer
matters.
All manner of issues affecting not only consumer choice but manufacturing
and exporting plans have yet to be determined. While the EC has abandoned
plans to compile 'recipe laws' stipulating what a particular product must
contain, proposals on minimum standards of food hygiene, labelling and the
use of additives have yet to be agreed on.
Some barriers have come down; a product legally available in one member
state must be allowed into the other 11 - which will pose problems in many
areas, not least that of pornography.
Other areas of as yet untested freedom of consumer choice include the
removal of restrictions on imports of duty and VAT paid goods. In the UK the
law may swiftly be rendered absurd. The customs and excise have suggested
import limits 'for personal use' of 10 litres of spirits, 90 litres of wine,
110 litres of beer and 800 cigarettes; anything above that may be deemed for
'commercial use' and thus subject to UK imposed duty. The restrictions
currently imposed on duty or VAT free goods will continue in place until
June 30, 1999.
Given the discrepancies between duty levels in the UK and elsewhere in the
EC on alcohol and tobacco, the single market's most immediate effect in
consumer terms may well be to give a boost to the vehicle rental businesses
of south coast ports, as people rent trucks to stock up across the Channel.
Some significant consumer legislation will take time to filter through,
particularly the EC's product safety directive - which applies from June
1994 - which states that goods must be safe during 'normal or reasonably
foreseeable use' and unlike current UK legislation will also apply to
second-hand products - threatening severely to dent the popularity of car
boot sales, one of the few growth areas of the UK economy in recent times.
All EC countries will be required to implement a scheme to withdraw
dangerous products from the market.
Another consumer-friendly piece of legislation will start to make itself
felt in early 1993, an 'eco-label' on domestic electrical products, showing
that they meet certain energy and water efficiency criteria. Eventually this
labelling is expected to be carried by all manufacturers of such products.
Draft EC legislation on food claims in advertising is likely to be adopted
by the Commission early this year, and is expected to establish a general
principle that claims should not be false or misleading. Claims made in food
advertising will have to be substantiated on the label. Responsibility for
regulating claims will probably rest with delegated authorities of the
member states.
But these and other legislative manoeuvres affecting advertisers and
consumers, the sub-text of which sometimes appears to be the construction of
a standardised consumer rather than a standardised consumable, need to be
seen in the context of subterranean changes occuring in the fabric of
European society.
The differences between the various member states' populations, their habits
and preferences are likely to defeat attempts to cajole them into
homogeneity. The EC is more complex in its internal divisions and perhaps
more resistant to imposed legislative change than its Eurocrats might wish.
For one thing, certain member states are likely to show much faster
population growth than others; some will contract. According to the
marketing research organisation NTC, over the next 30 years the Netherlands'
population is expected to increase by more than 13 per cent, while Italy's
will shrink by 7.4 per cent. Growth is expected in the UK, Portugal, Greece
and France, while Ireland, Denmark, Spain, Germany and Belgium are all
likely to follow Italy's downward path.
Overlaying that are profound changes already at work in the structure of the
family, none of which lend themselves to the positing of a pan-European
pattern. While it is estimated that 5 per cent of all families in the EC are
now single-parent, 81 per cent of those are located in the north-west of
Europe; in Denmark, more than 25 per cent of families with children are
headed by a single parent.
A north-south divide exists within the EC over the nature of the family,
with the traditional family structure holding up in the southern EC members,
and crumbling in its northern.
Moreover, other evidence suggests that while there exists a superficial
appearance of homogeneity of certain important factors - such as personal
disposable income - on a national level, regional disparities are cropping
up throughout the EC.
According to research by the Henley Centre for Forecasting (Frontiers
1991/1992), 'the divergence in prosperity across European regions is often
wider within countries than across them. Italians from Lombardy have a
personal disposable income twice as high as that as of consumers in Campania
or Calabria . . . consumers in the Balearics or Catalonia have 60 per cent
more disposable income than consumers from Extremadura or Andalucia.'
Such regional disparities inordinately complicate the business plans of
companies seeking to market their products from a fixed global viewpoint.
While it might make perfect cost sense to forge ahead with a pan-European
television advertising campaign for a branded consumer item when looked at
purely from intra-national levels, it might be less attractive when it is
realised that nationally-calculated figures often disguise considerable
regional differences.
The EC's own data suggest that average per capita income disparities are
widening; in the 25 poorest regions of the EC it fell to 56 per cent (from
57 per cent) of the EC average between 1980-88, while in the 25 richest
regions it grew to 137 per cent (from 135 per cent).
One of the central objects of Maastricht is the creation of common European
citizenship. Large global corporations have been slowly adopting
globally-aimed advertising strategies, in the belief that consumers the
world over are gradually losing their differences.
Up to a point that may be true. But the challenge for corporations within
the single market will be highly complicated. First they must understand the
developing legislative, economic, social and demographic distinctions within
the single market.
Then they need to finely tune their marketing decisions for successful

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (18): A Whirlpool
romance - Corporate strategy, why a US appliance giant sided with Philips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHIRLPOOL is the largest large domestic appliance manufacturer in the world.
Yet, by the late 1980s, the Michigan-based company had virtually no presence
in Europe.
This was an omission widely acknowledged at the manufacturer's top ranks.
David Whitman, the company's chairman, has said that his company mapped out
a long-term strategy in the mid-1980s which recognised that there was little
growth to be had in the US appliance market, that there was more likely to
be solid demand and future growth overseas, and that there would be
substantial lowering, or removal of trade barriers in Europe by 1992.
In fact, the company's internal estimates suggested that by 1993, western
Europe would account for a larger proportion of global appliance demand than
the US.
By 1987, Whirlpool was talking to Philips, the Dutch electronics group and
Europe's number one appliance manufacturer. Those discussions were
interrupted by the crash in the world stockmarkets, but by August of the
following year, the two companies had struck a deal. Whirlpool paid Philips
around Dollars 500m for a 53 per cent stake in a new joint venture company,
which - to all intents and purposes - took over Philips' large domestic
appliance division.
At the time, both companies envisaged that Whirlpool might become the sole
owner of the European business - Philips with the right to sell its minority
stake to the US company and the US company with the right to ask the Dutch
to sell. Three years later everything went to plan; Whirlpool duly bought
out the remaining 47 per cent of the equity for about Dollars 610m.
The relatively slow handover of the Philips business was mirrored at the
operational level. Whirlpool recognised at the outset that its own name -
although extremely familiar to the average shopper in the US - would carry
little weight in Europe, compared with the old-established Philips brand.
With this in mind, Whirlpool was given the right to use the Philips name on
appliances in Europe until 1998 - long after the potential buy-out of the
remaining minority stake, and the date set for European harmonisation.
Accordingly, the company decided, in early 1990, to adopt a 'dual-branding'
approach to products marketed in Europe. It placed both companies' names on
products it was selling in the European market, with a view to phasing out
the Philips tag once its own name gained recognition. Alongside the
middle-range Philips/Whirlpool brand, it continued to develop the
'Bauknecht' name as a premium high-end brand and to use the 'Ignis' and
'Laden' names for 'value-conscious' consumers.
Brand transfers have worked in the past - and Whirlpool says its programme
is ahead of schedule. It is now advertising solely under its own name in
four European markets, including the UK, although product packaging still
carries dual-branding there. It plans to move to pure single-branding in a
few selected markets next year.
On the operational front, Whirlpool's approach has also changed over time.
In 1991, it effectively created two business units - one to support the
Bauknecht brand and one to market Philips/Whirlpool, Ignis and Laden
products. Marketing and sales activities for the brands were to remain
separate in each country, while after-sales services were consolidated into
single offices in each market.
Last autumn, the company announced that it was creating three distinct sales
regions within the EC. The first encompasses Germany, Austria, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and Denmark; the second embraces France, Spain, Portugal and
Belgium; Norway, Ireland, Finland and the UK make up the third. In addition,
Italy remains a separately-managed area, as are the interests in
Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Support services and sales resources will be shared within these regions,
and a new central logistics department would aim to maximise distribution
efficiency. The aim is to replace the previous, fragmented national
warehouse network with regional distribution centres, as the trade barriers
between countries come down and Europe's transportation industry is steadily
deregulated.
Finally, on the manufacturing front, there has been a general reorganisation
around product groups - a process which has been proceeding for some time.
Laundry and dishwasher development centres will be located in Germany and
refrigeration and cooking product centres in Italy.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (17): Citizens
sceptical about their prospects - David Gardner finds that ordinary people
have yet to feel the benefits of the Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEAR of the completion of the single market has also been the year in
which the Maastricht treaty tottered on the brink, mainly because of a loss
of confidence by Europe's citizens in the Community's leaders, institutions,
and policy-making.
'Ever closer union' among European nations is not widely perceived to be
creating a Europe for people - a democratic polity in which sovereign member
states work supranationally producing visible benefits for their citizens.
The EC is increasingly seen as an organisation which does rather more for
business than for people; is undemocratic, intrusive and unaccountable; and
which by hyperintensifying competition in European industry contributes to
destroying rather than creating jobs.
That this is not an altogether accurate, fair or complete picture is beside
the point. European Commission president Jacques Delors summarised the
situation five days before the Maastricht treaty squeaked through
September's referendum in France: 'Either Europe will become more and more
democratic . . . or Europe will be no more'. If citizens are not persuaded
there is something in it for them, then the game is up.
Since 'Europe' came into being 40 years ago, it has been the enterprise of
the elites. The Paris weekly, Le Nouvel Observateur, captured how most
people visualise its workings just before the French referendum. It
published a photograph of a sharp-suited man against a backdrop of the
12-starred EC flag - with a paper bag over his head.
In spite of its remoteness and facelessness, the EC's overwhelming benefit
to people has been its interlocking of national interests in a way which
precludes war between Europe's leading powers. But that benefit is now taken
for granted. Modern Europeans have discounted it, and fear EC
centralisation. Yet, at the same time, they expect of the Community
practical benefits, such as job-creation, which it does not really have the
power to deliver.
Throughout the almost glacial progress of European integration, the member
states have guarded their national prerogatives jealously. As a
quasi-federation, the EC has been built up almost back-to-front.
Whereas a conventional federal system, such as the US or Germany, starts by
pooling obvious central powers such as foreign policy and defence,
macroeconomic co-ordination and monetary policy, the EC started with modest
items like coal and steel, wheat and milk. Only through the still unratified
Maastricht treaty has it broached a common foreign and security policy and a
single currency.
The relaunch of EC integration, moreover, came through the single market, a
battery of 282 measures designed to create a barrier-free economy in Europe.
The Twelve organised this exercise centrally, to the extent that not all
member states trusted their partners to flatten their part of the level
playing field. For the average citizen, however, the experience appears to
have been mixed.
Many of the single market measures have appeared intrusive, and at first
glance often seem more properly the concern of local councils, rather than
unelected bureaucrats and national ministers making decisions behind closed
doors in Brussels.
At one level, there has been a bonanza of tabloid headlines on 'Brussels
Euro-lunacies' ranging from alleged plans to suppress prawn cocktail crisps
to decrees defining a standard Euro-condom. But alongside the trivia, there
is genuine concern about the effect of many of the measures that have been
adopted over the past four years.
Of the single market's four freedoms - in the movement of capital, goods,
services and people - only the first three have been realised. This
achievement has increased competition during a European downturn and rising
unemployment.
Taken together with the failure to agree free movement across borders for
people, the overall enterprise looks a lopsided bargain, tilted heavily
towards business.
EC leaders - most of them unpopular at home and eager to pass the buck to
the European Commission for misfired EC measures that national ministers
decide on - concluded in the second half of last year that decision-making
had to be brought 'closer to the people'.
No populists they, the 12 heads of government chose as their primary vehicle
'subsidiarity' - meaning that there should only be action at EC level when
national or local measures would be ineffectual.
While subsidiarity was never going to enter anybody's vernacular, this
debate quickly moved from quasi-theology to naked power politics. Big member
states such as the UK and Germany tried - and failed - to use it to
emasculate the monopoly right of the Commission to propose measures, which
is viewed by the smaller and poorer EC members as the guarantor of their
interests in the Community.
Then the Euro-sceptical UK, which held the EC presidency in the second half
of last year, tried to roll back some 65 laws and proposals strengthening
workers' and consumers' rights, and environmental standards.
These are the most popular policy areas, particularly in the semi-detached
member state of Denmark, for whose voters subsidiarity was put on the agenda
after they rejected Maastricht last June.
At December's Edinburgh summit, an agreement was reached, preserving the
balance of power in the EC. It will make Brussels more cautious about the
ideas it brings forward and the closed-door Council of Ministers of the
Twelve more user-friendly, since important policy debates will, from
February 1, be televised for the press.
There is a danger, however, that Brussels will be inhibited in acting in
areas such as the environment and free movement for people, for fear of
upsetting member governments.
The subsidiarity debate was handled with opportunism by governments so that
mud stuck to 'Brussels' - synonymous in most people's minds with the whole
European enterprise. It also served as a smokescreen to obscure the real
issues of democracy and accountability.
It is unlikely that the EC can continue for long in this way. This is not
because there is some mass movement rattling the Eurocracy's gates demanding
to be let in, but because, on the contrary, apathy and resentment are
increasingly denying popular legitimacy to the EC - as last year's polls,
referenda and restive national parliaments demonstrated.
To reverse this, EC decisions will have to be seen to be more open, more
scrutinised in the European Parliament and national parliaments. And their
content will have to be more popular, if not populist - giving citizens a
greater stake in Europe.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (15): Deferrals and
omissions make progress patchy - Andrew Hill probes sensitive areas where
unity is elusive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE single market was always going to be a patchwork. Nobody ever expected a
flawless barrier-free area to take shape at midnight on December 31, 1992,
however much the politicians like to say that it has.
Instead, the single market has been an evolutionary programme of measures,
with different elements coming into force at different times.
Many of the most important changes have already happened. For example,
exchange controls were lifted in eight countries - all except Portugal,
Ireland, Greece and Spain - by July 1990.
The first legislation to open up the market for public procurement, worth 15
per cent of the European Community's gross national product, came into
effect as early as the beginning of 1989. Graduates' qualifications have
been recognised across all 12 member states for the past two years.
But in spite of the surprising speed with which the European Commission and
member states have worked to adopt and enforce single market legislation
there are still some notable gaps, which it will take many years and much
political negotiation to fill. Broadly, they divide into three areas:
delays, deferrals and omissions.
Delays: These are the measures which have not taken full effect, even though
they have been adopted by member states, because they have yet to be
properly implemented or transferred into national law.
Such delays are occurring in all areas of single market law. According to
some analyses, less than 50 per cent of Lord Cockfield's 280 or so measures
have been transferred into the national law of all 12 member states.
Commission officials play down this figure. They point out that the original
legislation makes clear that all adopted measures come into force on January
1, 1993, even if they have not been transferred into national law.
Thus, consumers or traders who believe that they are being deprived of the
benefits of the single market by their government's sluggishness can take
the national authority to court.
More worryingly for the barrier-free market, efficient member states - such
as Denmark, which has transposed more than 95 per cent of the relevant
legislation - could theoretically block the import of goods manufactured
under rules which had not been altered to conform with single market law.
Deferrals: The single market is riddled with deferrals - or 'derogations' in
EC jargon - usually written into legislation to ease a political agreement,
or because it will take time to implement a measure. Frequently they apply
only to one or two member states, sometimes to a specific industry.
The most obvious example is the 'transitional' system for collection and
administration of value added tax (VAT). Member states agreed a system which
allowed border controls to be abolished on January 1. But this is, in
theory, only a temporary measure, and the Commission still envisages the
installation of a permanent VAT system in 1997.
Under this permanent system businesses would benefit from the same
advantages as consumers, who can now buy all goods, except cars and
mail-order items, at local VAT rates. In practice, EC business is already
upset about the burdens allegedly imposed by the transitional system, and
may resist another change as early as 1997.
Other important derogations include: freedom for insurance companies to set
up and do business across the Community (July 1994); the 'single passport'
for stockbrokers and banks to deal shares across the EC (January 1996, with
banks' access to exchanges in Spain, Portugal and Greece delayed still
further); and open competition for airlines, which have been able to set any
fare they want from January 1, but will not be able to fly any route they
choose (including 'domestic' flights in one member state) before April 1997.
Omissions: These are areas which are usually so sensitive that member states
have been unable to agree. In most cases they were not even part of the
single market programme:
Energy. Energy liberalisation was excluded from the 1985 Cockfield white
paper, and recent discussions on how to open up gas and electricity markets
have led nowhere.
Member states have already, albeit reluctantly, agreed to allow some
cross-border transit of electricity and gas, and some countries favour
linked proposals to improve the transparency of companies' accounts and end
monopoly rights over electricity production and the construction of energy
networks. But they balk at the idea of giving consumers the right to buy
their energy from any supplier in the EC.
Commission proposals should have given large users the right to 'third party
access', as it is known, from January 1, with the possibility of small users
being granted the benefits from 1996. But the UK, the EC's strongest
advocate of energy liberalisation, ran up against heavy opposition during
its presidency of the Community and the measures have not been agreed.
Telecoms. The Commission, often using special powers to override EC members'
objections, has already pushed through measures to liberalise the EC market
in telecoms services and equipment. But it has fought shy of putting
pressure on member states to liberalise the most obvious area - ordinary
phone calls.
A long-awaited review of the sector, published by the Commission in October,
pointed out that the cost of cross-border telephone calls in the EC was
excessive but said there would have to be yet more consultation with the
industry and consumers before legislation could be introduced.
Postal services. Moves to open up mail services to competition are lagging
behind liberalisation of the telecoms sector, but the story is roughly the
same. A discussion paper produced by the Commission last May stepped back
from suggesting immediate liberalisation of mail services, although in due
course Brussels may produce legislation to open up direct mail, cross-border
and express postal services.
Company law. This is the area of the single market white paper where
progress has been slowest. That is not because the measures under
consideration are particularly sensitive - although Britain, among others,
objects to clauses on worker participation - but because member states seem
to have decided that such legislation is less essential than Lord Cockfield
and his colleagues originally thought. Even moves to agree a voluntary
European Company Statute for multinationals have stalled over the last year,
while a measure to harmonise takeover procedure across the Community has
been dropped altogether. (See separate article.)
A single currency. This is so obvious that it is often overlooked. EC
leaders agreed at Maastricht that a single currency would be in place by
1999 at the latest, but that 'deadline' is subject to ratification of the
treaty by national parliaments and to strict economic criteria.
Logic says that the Ecu would be an indispensable part of the single market;
politics - notably in Denmark and the UK - could mean that it ends up the
most important omission of the lot.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (13): A free trade area
but . . . - David Dodwell gauges the Community's protectionist leanings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE creation of the single market has for several years aroused fears that
the world is poised to collapse into competing trade blocks. Fears have been
inflamed by the recent progress towards a North American Free Trade Area.
With apologies to Mark Twain, reports of the death of free trade have been
greatly exaggerated.
However, the dangers of Europe turning inward should not be dismissed out of
hand, although these have been linked more with the wider evolution of the
EC than with the creation of the single market as such.
There is inside the EC a north-south divide which separates northern members
who are keener to encourage free trade from southern member states with
strong protectionist tendencies. For example, the large number of French
companies with state investments inhibits free trade within that market for
a number of products. So do policies in Italy favouring local manufacturers.
State supports for strategic industries, or 'national champions', and
government procurement rules that keep foreign competitors at bay are also
born out of protectionist reflexes.
These reflexes have been stiffened towards countries outside the wider
European region as EC member states have realised that, for reasons of
political as much as economic security, countries in eastern and central
Europe must be given improved access to the EC market. So far, offers of
improved market access to the former Comecon countries have been derisory,
and even these have been eroded by dumping actions against some of the more
successful exporters from Poland and Czechoslovakia. But in due course they
are likely to be improved.
The high level of trade conducted within the community - it averages about
60 per cent, and peaks at 75 per cent with Portugal - makes trade with other
parts of the world less significant than for countries in other regions. By
comparison, the US relies on the north and south American region for just 35
per cent of its exports, while Japan sells 36 per cent of its exports in the
Asia-Pacific area.
However, this does not mean a 'Fortress Europe' is a particularly attractive
option to most EC industries. Unlike countries elsewhere, those in Europe
are unusually dependent on international trade. Germany's exports account
for 26 per cent of its GDP - not far from the EC average - while Ireland's
exports account for 56 per cent of GDP. This compares with just 7.4 per cent
for the US, and 9.4 per cent for Japan.
For countries so heavily dependent on international trade, EC member states
have as much to fear from competing trade blocks as any. The emergence of
the North American Free Trade Area - embracing the US, Canada and Mexico -
and of a wider western hemispheric trading region given form by President
Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative, has given EC exporters clear
warning of the price that could be paid for raising protectionist walls
around Europe. At present, neither the single market nor Nafta need take a
protectionist form. But they provide the institutional means for this to
happen if the mood should change.
For these reasons, it is not surprising that Europe's trading partners have
refused to dismiss the danger of emergent protectionism around the creation
of the single market. Japanese foreign investment in Europe surged during
the second half of the 1980s as companies pre-emptively established a
production capability inside the EC.
Some of this was doubtless triggered by the new opportunities arising out of
the chance the single market provides to serve so large an integrated market
from just one or two locations. But some was also 'just in case' investment,
to avert the danger of losing access to important markets if the single
market raised effective protection around the EC.
A perverse consequence of this flood of inward investment has been to divert
investment from European countries outside the EC, in particular the Efta
countries. It is this - coupled with the fact that the Efta group relies on
the EC for two thirds of its exports - that has encouraged countries such as
Sweden to press so urgently for full EC membership.
However, obsession with the protectionist dangers of the single market have
clouded the trade-liberalising consequences of the change. Companies in each
EC member state that have in the past been hampered by national barriers to
trade are set to see almost all institutional obstacles fall to free trade
across the whole community.
Exporters to Europe which currently have to deal with 12 different sets of
export documentation, negotiating market access, and distribution
arrangements country by country, will from January have to jump just one set
of hurdles. Once goods land in one EC country, they can be moved freely
across a market of 344m people, without border controls, or other checks,
providing a marvellous opportunity to rationalise and improve distribution.
In due course, standards of all kinds will be harmonised, whether for
regulations for electricity sockets, safety standards or food additives,
giving exporters and domestic manufacturers the same considerable scope to
simplify production and packaging arrangements.
But whether or not the single market will raise or lower effective
protection will also depend heavily on the outcome of the long-delayed
Uruguay Round of talks aimed at reduction of barriers to international
trade.
The outcome of these talks, which have crept inconclusively forward for six
years, remains uncertain.
But in so far as the draft agreement published a year ago, and negotiations
up to the end of 1992, provide a guide, the Uruguay Round would reduce
protection in farm trade, cut tariffs in a number of industrial sectors to
zero, set a 10 year timetable for dismantling protection in textiles and
garments, and open up a number of service industries - including banking and
insurance, audio-visual services and shipping.
The Uruguay Round would set stricter rules for deciding whether or not an
exporter to the EC is dumping. This will be of particular importance to
Japan, the Asian 'tigers', and the liberalising countries of central Europe,
since the EC, with the US, is quick to take anti-dumping actions to protect
domestic industries that are inefficient, vulnerable, or simply powerful.
But neither the Uruguay Round, nor the establishment of the single market,
will overnight remove all inconsistencies in trade policy between EC member
states. It will take at least six months for national quota arrangements for
banana imports to be harmonised. Rationalisation of textiles quotas, quotas
on shoes and bicycles, and of 'voluntary restraint agreements' on imported
cars may take longer still to sort out.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (12): A house with
glass walls / A look at the development of industrial and competition policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The intellectual father of the single market, Lord Cockfield, once said
that if all had known how much more competition the single market would
result in, European industry and, surely, European governments would have
been against it' - Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner.
FOR THOSE who believe that Europe should have an industrial policy, the
beauty of the single market is that it represents such a policy in itself.
In a unified market, runs the argument, companies can no longer hide their
inefficiencies behind national barriers. Forced to operate on a truly
competitive European stage, they thus enter a Darwinian process which
produces regional champions capable of taking on the world's finest.
There will, of course, be casualties along the way. But, runs the argument,
there should be at least as many winners as losers. The removal of trade
barriers is in itself an important stimulus to economic growth, which will -
in theory - make good any damage suffered by industry as a whole through
increased competition.
However persuasive this argument, it suffers in the short term from two
serious snags. First, far from enjoying immediate economic growth, the
single market starts life in a fairly severe recession. It is unusually hard
to be sure how long this will last or how severe it will prove, if only
because it is partly due to the one-off effects of German unification.
Second, some of Europe's basic industries - steel in particular - are
suffering the effects of the wider structural change in eastern Europe. It
is again hard to be sure how long the influx of cheap manufactured
commodities from the east will last. But there is room for pessimism. If a
steel mill or petrochemical plant is not going to be replaced, it can be run
purely for cash rather than profit. This is a particularly attractive option
if the cash comes in the form of much-needed hard currency and the plant is
relied upon for holding a community together.
Additionally, the single market will have the effect of exposing industry to
greater competition from the industrial giants of the US and Japan. So it is
not hard to see why it is viewed with mixed feelings by some European
industrialists. In many cases, the net result is bound to be a competitive
squeeze on profit margins. This raises the immediate question whether
overheads and manning levels need to be squeezed as well.
This may be happening already. By the end of last year, the list of
multinationals announcing large-scale job cuts in Europe was lengthening
ominously. Part of this, however, was a conventional reaction to recession.
Furthermore, job losses in the European car industry, for instance, must be
seen in the context of continued controls on Japanese car imports until the
year 2000.
Again, the 12,000 European job losses announced last month by IBM are a
reminder that at least some European markets were exposed to the full force
of international competition all along.
But there seems little doubt that as companies integrate their production
around Europe - whether to take advantage of the single market or to protect
themselves from its pressures - systematic job losses will result. The
result, Mr Percy Barnevik, president of the engineering giant ABB, told the
FT earlier this month, could be a shake-out of labour comparable to that
seen in agriculture earlier this century.
Another element of industrial restructuring is to be expected as well.
Mergers and joint ventures in European industry are by no means new: they
are a consequence of industrial globalisation. But they are also a logical
response to the challenges brought by the single market.
It is not easy to specify the extent to which these mergers have been due to
the single market. The European food industry, for instance, has seen a
particularly high level of takeover and merger in recent years, with
multinationals such as Unilever, Nestle and BSN increasing their dominance,
and mere national players looking increasingly vulnerable. But this is
largely the result of developments within the industry itself, such as the
increased readiness of consumers to sample foreign food.
It is worth remembering that some of Europe's most important markets are not
much affected by the single market. The pharmaceutical industry still has to
satisfy the medical authorities in each EC country separately before it can
sell new drugs. Airlines are still greatly restricted on the routes they can
fly within the EC. Car-makers' protection from the Japanese will last until
the end of the century. The steel industry is still protected and subsidised
in many EC countries.
But in the long run, there is no doubt of the implications for industrial
structure. The domestic market for individual European companies is becoming
inexorably bigger. Another powerful stimulus for change comes through the
gradual opening up of government contracts to competitive tender from
companies from other EC countries. European industry is bound to respond by
becoming leaner and larger.
One of the most important determinants will be EC competition policy. Sir
Leon Brittan, head of the competition directorate until the end of last
year, was seen as a champion of the British preference for unfettered
competition. His successor, the Belgian socialist Mr Karel Van Miert, may
come under greater pressure to promote a more French-style industrial
policy, perhaps favouring regional champions through merger and acquisition.
Certainly, if the worst fears about the risks of the single market are
realised, the clamour from Europe's industrialists for a more
interventionist approach on restructuring can only become louder.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (14): Liberalisation
will be a slow process - Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE legal framework for a single European insurance market is now firmly in
place but it will take years - possibly decades - for genuine liberalisation
to occur.
Differences in taxation and contract law constitute real obstacles to cross
border trade, especially in life, home and motor insurance.
After moving at a faster rate than many would have predicted three years
ago, the European Commission has this year approved a raft of directives
aimed at liberalising the market for both life and non-life insurance.
The legislation, which governments must implement from 1994 onwards, will
open Europe's most protected markets to more competition and represents a
victory for advocates of greater liberalisation.
Under the 'single licence', insurers from any member state will be free to
trade in any other member state, under home country rules.
At the same time EC members are now committed to dismantling the vestiges of
the highly regulated regime. For example, governments cannot demand prior
approval of policy conditions or premium rates or require companies to
invest in a particular category of assets. That could have an important
impact on insurers in Germany, Italy and Belgium, for example, where the
motor insurance market is highly regulated.
Even so, genuine cross-border trading is still some way off. Insurers in
different member states operate under very different tax rules. Most
continental countries allow insurers much more freedom to build up tax-free
reserves, while the room for manoeuvre of UK companies in this respect is
still sharply circumscribed. Some life insurers must pay taxes on premiums,
others do not.
Variations in legal regimes and the lack of a single contract law system
will also hinder trade in insurance. According to London solicitors Lovell
White Durrant 'the diversity of contract law means that any comparison of
one insurance product with another becomes unbelievably complicated for the
layman'.
Penetration of some markets - especially those such as the German, French
and Italian, where retail networks are dominated by extensive networks of
tied agents, selling the products of just one company, rather than
independent brokers - will be tough.
So far Europe's biggest markets - the UK, France, Germany and Italy - are
still dominated by domestic companies, although some players are now
beginning to win significant shares of neighbouring markets, either through
outright acquisition or by the purchase of significant share stakes.
Germany's Allianz has an important share of the Italian market through its
acquisition of RAS, while France's Assurances Generales de France (AGF)
could eventually win important influence in the German market if its current
attempts to control Aachener and Muenchener - Germany's third biggest
insurers - are successful.
France's privately-owned Victoire has also made important headway by
acquiring Colonia, Germany's second biggest insurer, in 1989. Victoire is
currently engaged in a long drawn-out battle with its nationalised rival,
Union des Assurances de Paris, for control of the company and a string of
other European companies to which it is linked.
Elsewhere Italy's Generali as well as several French, Swiss, German and
Dutch companies are expanding in the rapidly growing Spanish and Portuguese
markets, while AGF is a dominant player in the Irish market.
Companies, such as Switzerland's Zurich and Winterthur, and Germany's
Allianz have built up strong shares of the continent's market for commercial
risks business (the policies bought by larger industrial and financial
companies).
By contrast UK companies have recently made relatively little impact in
Europe, although Commercial Union's Delta Lloyd subsidiary has an important
share of the Dutch market.

towards a friendly union of historic enemies

TRADE liberalisation has consistently been the most successful aspect of the
process of European integration, and the Single European Market brings it to
a triumphant conclusion.
Paradoxically, however, Europe's political leaders have always, just as
consistently, aspired to carry European integration into the superior
uplands of high politics. In a sense, the history of the European Community
is made up of the antithesis and alternation between these two themes.
From the beginning, the founder members of the European Community believed
that they were engaged in an essentially political enterprise, and they made
repeated attempts to put flesh on these aspirations. Yet, their efforts to
build an integrated Community with an explicitly political character have
run into repeated difficulties.
By contrast, the negotiation of the removal of barriers and the progressive
liberation of trade turned out to be surprisingly quick and easy, first in
the inaugural 1960s, and again in the past seven years.
The political aspirations of the high priests of European integration are
apparent in the names they use: the Brussels-based organisation started out
as the European Economic Community; it then became simply the European
Community, and now in the Maastricht Treaty it is renamed simply the
European Union.
Yet, the title which best matches its most unquestionable achievements is
the unofficial name long used by most ordinary people: the Common Market.
Even as they were embarking on economic integration, the founding member
states aimed to give their enterprise an explicitly political character. The
Schuman Plan of 1950 broke new ground in economic cooperation and trade
liberation, by bringing the coal and steel industries of the Six member
states under common rules; but the ulterior purpose of this new economic
enterprise, as described at the time by French foreign minister Robert
Schuman, was mainly political, to make war between France and Germany not
only 'unthinkable but materially impossible'.
Similarly, when the European Economic Community was formed at the end of
that decade, the central treaty responsibility of Walter Hallstein, the
first president of the European Commission, was to oversee the removal of
internal customs duties and the installation of a common external tariff.
But his constant refrain was: 'We are not in business, we are in politics.'
This antithesis between the political and the economic has meant that the
history of the European Community has been marked by an alternation between
attempts to get into overtly high politics, and lower-key phases of economic
regulation and liberalisation.
Repeatedly, the political leaders from the six founding member states have
tried to accelerate the pace of events, by building a new European
bridgehead on the high ground of politics. Just as repeatedly, their
political projects foundered. But each time they followed up their political
defeats by new and usually successful initiatives in the field of economic
or trade liberalisation.
This antithesis between high politics and pragmatic trade liberalisation has
been the most consistent single theme in the running policy debate between
the members of the Community, and it has regularly pitted the United Kingdom
against the original Six. Indeed, that argument, which is still going on
today, is the central key to the Community's development.
In the post-war negotiations which led to the creation of the Paris-based
Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (now the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development), Britain opposed the supranational
ideas advanced by France. In effect Britain won, because the OECD is still a
loose organisation of sovereign states without supranational powers.
But the argument did not end there. The next time it was the French who won,
since the primary characteristic of the first European Community, the
European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) founded in 1951, was that it had a
High Authority with significant supranational powers. The British stayed
away, but the Six went ahead.
Euphoria over the launch of the ECSC caused the Six, and especially the
French, to underestimate the difficulties of political integration. When the
Korean War broke out in 1950, and America pressed for the re-arming of West
Germany, the Six threw themselves enthusiastically into negotiations for the
creation of a European army. These concluded in 1952 with the signature of a
treaty for a European Defence Community, from which the British again stood
aside; but after long and fevered debates in France, the EDC treaty was
eventually rejected in the French National Assembly in 1954, through the
combined opposition of the Gaullists and the Communists.
The defeat of the EDC caused a major psychological shock among the Six. But
the momentum behind the European idea was nevertheless so strong that they
quickly developed another new initiative, for a Common Market. They
negotiated the Treaty of Rome in 1955-57, and launched the European Economic
Community (EEC) in 1958. Once again the British stayed away.
This was the moment when the Six finally began to find the right balance
between politics and economic liberalisation, between pre-ordained
objectives and future policy making.
In one sense the Rome Treaty was obviously an attempt to compensate for the
failure of the Defence Community, by launching a more cautious initiative at
the work-a-day level of trade liberalisation.
But the originality of the EEC was that it embedded the first policy
objectives of the Rome Treaty, the elimination of internal tariffs and the
creation of a customs union over a 12-year transition period, in an
ingenious machinery of common institutions, so as to enable this new
Community to improvise in the world after the customs union.
In practice, the removal of customs tariffs proved remarkably painless. The
French had feared that their industry would be unable to compete with that
of Germany; that was why they insisted from the outset that the industrial
customs union must be balanced by a common agricultural policy. In the
event, their fears proved groundless: like the other member states, their
economy was buoyed up by the rapid growth of the 1960s, and the Six were
able to complete their customs union in mid-1968, a year ahead of schedule.
The irony of this thriving Common Market was that it became the back-drop
for a re-run of the old battles between nationalists and supranationalists.
This time, however, it was France in the person of President Charles de
Gaulle which championed the nationalist cause from within; while the
British, who had refused membership when it was freely available, now wanted
to join but were refused entry by the French.
In 1961-62 de Gaulle tried to emasculate the European Community with a new
inter-governmental Treaty restoring political authority to the member
states. And in 1965 he returned to the fray, with a frontal attack on the
principle of majority voting under the Rome Treaty. Neither attack
succeeded; but the second left the Community bruised and politically
traumatised.
This political trauma lasted long after de Gaulle left the scene in 1969.
For the euphoria of the rapid economic growth of the 1960s gave way to
Euro-pessimism in the 1970s and early 1980s.
The international monetary system was thrown off balance by the US
abandonment of Bretton Woods in 1971. The world economy was thrown into
stagflation by the two oil crises of 1974 and 1979. And inside the
Community, it became apparent that tariff liberalisation was only the first
step towards a free market; member states were compensating for the
slow-down with national regulations, state subsidies and industrial policies
whose purpose and effect was protectionism.
The Community attempted to grapple with the consequences of the slow-down,
by searching for a follow-on programme for the customs union. In 1969 it
issued a declaratory call for an Economic and Monetary Union in Europe, and
again in 1972; but in practice nothing became of the idea.
It was not until the end of the decade that Europe began to recover its
inventive energy. In 1979, President Giscard d'Estaing of France and
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of Germany provided their solution to the
instability of the international monetary system, with their scheme for a
European Monetary System (EMS), which has since become the basic building
block of the more recent plans for Economic and Monetary Union.
Five years later (in 1985) the Twelve resolved that they must after all
settle down to turning the customs union into a true Common Market, by
removing the many remaining non-tariff barriers and other obstacles to
complete commercial freedom.
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then British prime minister, saw the Single
European Act as an attractively free-trade alternative to the more
politically ambitious projects which France and Germany seemed to be
promoting.
But as so often in the EC, Mrs Thatcher's ideological victory in favour of
simple free trade turned out to be more incomplete and more treacherous than
she may have hoped.
The immediate price of a commitment to a single European market, with its
four freedoms for goods, persons, services and capital, was a significant
enlargement of the role of majority voting. The deferred price, was that the
logic of the single market paved the way for the Delors report, which in
turn paved the way for the Maastricht Treaty and the programme for Economic
and Monetary Union.
These latest grand schemes have not necessarily been any better designed
than the EDC of 1952, and they may collapse under their own weight. But the
central fact about the Maastricht treaty is that it is an attempt to unite,
at a high level, the political and the economic themes of European
integration.

wider - More countries are queueing to join

THE deepening of the European Community brought about by the single market
also marks a step towards its enlargement.
During the second half of the 1980s, the EC became an attractive magnet for
applicants outside its borders. Three members of the European Free Trade
Association (Efta) - Austria, Sweden and Finland - are due to start EC entry
negotiations during the next few weeks, with a fourth country, Norway,
getting down to talks this spring. Their aim is to become full EC members by
1995.
These four states, together with the other three Efta members - Switzerland,
Iceland and Liechtenstein - were due from January 1 to have formed with the
EC the European Economic Area (EEA) - a free trade entity seen now as
encompassing a waiting room for full EC membership.
The start of the EEA has been delayed until the second half of the year.
This follows Switzerland's referendum rejection of the EEA last month - a
decision motivated by Swiss voters' fears that the EEA would bring a
dilution of their prosperity and stability. Assuming the other Efta states
go ahead with ratification, the EEA will now link only 18 states, rather
than the 19 (including Switzerland) originally planned.
Under the EEA, the regulatory framework of the single market is to be
transferred practically wholesale to Efta - which is to adopt EC rules on
competition, company law, consumer protection, education, the environment,
research and development and social policies. The Efta countries are to set
up their own enforcement body with powers over Efta territory. The Swiss
'No,' by a small majority of the electorate and a larger majority of
cantons, was not unexpected. In view of Switzerland's entrenched neutrality
and its unique system of direct democracy, there was even some quiet relief
among some Brussels officials,who feared that Switzerland's special features
might have made it the cuckoo in the EEA nest.
The No necessitates a time-consuming revision of the EC-EEA treaty meant to
have come into force this month.
Efta states will have to renegotiate funding of Ecu2bn over five years due
to be channelled to the EC's poorer regions under the terms of the EEA
accord.
According to initial indications, the six Efta states still in favour of the
EEA are asking the EC to accept a simple reduction of the Swiss
contribution. This has sparked hostility, above all from Spain.
Other Efta countries have also, like Switzerland, witnessed a cooling of
electoral enthusiasm about EC membership. Because these Efta members will
themselves be holding EC referendums during the next few years, further
Swiss-style setbacks cannot be ruled out.
Public opinion in Sweden and Finland, both in the grip of severe recession,
has become less keen on the EC - reluctance which has probably been
increased by the European currency turbulence in the closing months of 1992
which led to large devaluations of the Swedish krona and the Finnish markka.
There are also considerable doubts whether the Norwegian electorate will
give its blessing to the EC link-up. Memories are still strong of the
Norwegian referendum rejection of EC membership in 1972. However, if
neighbouring Denmark surmounts its problems over Maastricht with a Yes to
the treaty in the new referendum being held this spring, this will ease some
of the public opinion obstacles confronting the other Nordic states.
Despite the Swiss vote, the momentum towards EC enlargement is now
unstoppable. The main reason behind Efta's desire for full membership is
political rather than economic. The EEA confronts Efta states with EC
legislation over which they have no control. In a narrow financial sense,
full EC membership will bring the Efta countries additional burdens.
Because their per capita income is well above the EC average, all current EC
applicants among the Efta states would be large net contributors to the
Community budget. But the wish to play a full part in the political
development of the Community - possible only if they are fully within it -
appears to be paramount.
Even for Switzerland, which in the words of EC officials opted for
'isolation' last month, the door to EC membership is not closed for all
time. Mr Helmut Kohl, the perennially optimistic German Chancellor, believes
that the Swiss electorate will eventually come round to accepting that
joining the EC is in their country's best interests.
For several reasons, the Nordic and Alpine countries on the EC fringes
generally believe they would suffer disadvantages if the EC forged ahead
without them towards greater political and economic integration.
The inconveniences include the prospect of lower economic growth, as well as
the likelihood that investments and jobs would flow towards the EC core.
The London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research last autumn estimated
that membership of the EEA was likely to boost growth in Efta by 5 per cent
over the next few years.
Most Efta nations - especially those with the status of neutral countries -
are much more wary about the idea of Europe moving towards full-scale
political union, involving pooling of powers in areas such as defence or
criminal law. But there is considerable sympathy for the concept of greater
political co-operation in fields such as immigration policy. And the Nordic
states - in spite of, and partly because of, the autumn turbulence - are
among Europe's most fervent devotees of monetary union.
This enthusiasm is not shared in Switzerland. In view of the Swiss franc's
habitual hard currency status, the Swiss are no more eager to give it up for
a single European currency than the Germans are their D-Mark.
With the anticipated entry of the Efta states in the mid-1990s, the EC's
enlargement process will still be a long way from complete. Hungary, Poland,
the Czech lands and Slovakia are waiting in the wings, while Malta, Cyprus
and Turkey have longer-standing applications. However, all these states in
the ante-room will certainly have to wait until the next century before they
can accede to full membership.
In the meantime, they have little choice but to persist along the hard path
of restructuring their economies and overhauling their political
institutions. The non-Efta applicants see the EC above all as a means of
bolstering their economies and encouraging financial transfers from the
wealthier countries of Europe. The EC, however, views membership chiefly as
a reward for economic achievement, rather than as a precondition for it.
All these poorer states face an uncomfortable, somewhat paradoxical, truth.
Before they can join Europe's rich man's club, they will have to become
richer themselves - by registering up to a decade of higher-than-average
growth.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (7): Latent power to
turn the tide - Martin Wolf weighs up the prospects for united Europe's
economic recovery
</HEADLINE>

IT WAS not supposed to be like this.
The single market is open for business, just as the European economy slows
down. Far from heralding renewed economic dynamism, January 1993 coincides
with rising unemployment, currency turbulence and popular dissatisfaction.
The European Community witnesses not a new burst of confidence and
creativity, but a return to the gloom that occasioned the single market
programme.
The OECD's latest Economic Outlook gives the growth of Europe's real gross
domestic product at 1 per cent between 1991 and 1992 and forecasts it at 1.2
per cent between 1992 and 1993.
By contrast, the Outlook published last June forecast growth of 2.4 per cent
between 1992 and 1993. This halving of the forecast for the coming year is
consistent with the past over-optimism of the mainstream forecasters. The
economic growth of 2.5 per cent forecast by the OECD for 1993 to 1994 could
prove to be yet another overestimate. The European economy would then
experience four successive years of disappointing growth.
Economic performance of the main European economies has been far from
uniform.
Worst by far has been that of the UK. After falling by 2.2 per cent between
1990 and 1991 and by 1 per cent between 1991 and 1992, GDP is forecast by
the OECD to rise by 1.3 per cent between 1992 and 1993. Yet even the
expected growth of 2.4 per cent between 1993 and 1994 would only bring GDP
back to its 1990 level.
By contrast, Italy is at least expected to sustain positive growth, though
at low rates, throughout. Between 1990 and 1991 growth was 1.4 per cent.
This is expected to be followed by 1.2 per cent growth from 1991 to 1992 and
0.8 per cent from 1992 to 1993.
In spite of Italy's fiscal crisis, the most severe among the group of seven
leading industrial countries, its economic performance has not been much
worse than that of France, even though French rigueur has made it the EC's
blue-eyed boy. Between 1990 and 1991 French GDP expanded by 1.2 per cent.
The OECD says it will expand by 1.9 per cent between 1991 and 1992 and
forecasts only 1.6 per cent growth in the following year.
Europe's disappointing economic performance is partly explained by an
adverse world economic environment, particularly the lingering recession,
from which the US seems at last to be recovering.
It is also explained by problems within particular countries, notably the
UK, with its overhang of private sector debt, and Italy, where public debt
exceeds total GDP. But the principal failure lies in Germany, Europe's
economic and geographical heart.
After four years of rapid economic growth, capped by the positive economic
effects of unification in 1990 and 1991, German GDP continued to expand by
2.9 per cent in the first half of 1992, but only to contract by 0.9 per cent
in the second half. The OECD has forecast 1.2 per cent growth of GDP between
1992 and 1993, but the organisation's chief economist has already lowered
this forecast by half a percentage point.
Surprisingly perhaps, a German recession need not be bad news for the rest
of Europe. The German economy has slowed in response to the Bundesbank's
determination to bring inflation down from the 4.5 per cent registered in
1991 (measured by the deflator for total GDP) and expected by the OECD for
1992, to the 2 per cent it thinks is tolerable.
German short term rates of interest have been exceptionally high in both
nominal and real terms. But the belief that the D-Mark would never be
depreciated within the exchange rate mechanism turns these German interest
rates into the floor for all ERM members. Those interest rates have then
deflated the economies of the rest of Europe. French short term real
interest rates are 7-8 per cent, for example.
The contractionary effect of these rates has endured far longer and been far
stronger than the stimulus generated by the disappearance of the German
current account surplus between 1990 and 1991. Europe needs lower short term
rates of interest. Though a deep recession is bound to damage Germany
politically and economically, it should lead to lower German interest rates
and so give members of the ERM the lower interest rates they need.
By now, this group excludes the UK and Italy, both shaken out of the ERM in
mid-September. Apart from the suspension of the pound and the lira, the
Spanish peseta has been realigned twice and the Portuguese escudo once,
while the Irish punt, the Danish krone and the French franc have all been
subject to considerable pressure.
The collapse of Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian attempts at fixing their
exchange rates attests to the general disarray. Should the process of
dissolution proceed still further, the Maastricht treaty's planned march
towards economic and monetary union by 1997, or 1999, will lose all
plausibility.
In any case, the convergence criteria laid down in that treaty, largely at
German behest, will create severe difficulties. At present only two
countries - France and Luxembourg - fulfil all these criteria, though
Denmark (which has opted out from Emu) and Germany (the majority of whose
citizens would like to opt out) almost make the grade.
The European slow-down has helped to bring about convergence of inflation:
eight EC member states had consumer price inflation of between 2.2 and 4.1
per cent in 1992, with German inflation highest of this group. But slow
growth makes it much more difficult to meet the Maastricht criteria for
fiscal policy.
The IMF and the OECD argue that most member states cannot afford and should
not attempt further fiscal stimulus. This may well be so, but slow growth
will make reducing fiscal deficits difficult, while the immediate
consequences are bound to be deflationary.
Gloom is the natural reaction to Europe's current economic situation. The
single market is not having the positive effect on Europe's economic
performance that was hoped. The monetary system is under attack. Meanwhile,
policy-makers seem totally ineffective. The growth package agreed at the
Edinburgh summit was nugatory, for example. As for the Bundesbank, it
remains obstinately set on its deflationary course.
Yet, there is more to the prospects for the European economy than the
current slow down. The important questions are those about the long term.
Here there are important worries, but there are also opportunities.
Among the worries are whether Germany will manage to integrate the east
German economy or will be struggling semi-permanently with high overall
unemployment and high public sector deficits; whether the eastern European
economies will achieve rapid economic growth; whether the world economy will
recover its lost dynamism; and whether, in particular, the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations will be successfully completed.
These worries are the counterparts of economic opportunity. German
unification should enable the EC's most important economy to achieve faster
growth than in the 1970s and 1980s; eastern European reform could revitalise
the European economy as a whole; and a dynamic and truly global economy can
be created for the very first time.
Since the EC is the world's largest trading entity and one of its two
largest economies, accounting for more than a quarter of world output, it is
itself able to turn its worries into opportunities.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (8): Emu can go it
alone - Hans-Peter Frohlich suggests Germans are too enthusiastic for
political union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HANS-PETER FROHLICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY GERMANS think that the Maastricht treaty is heavily lopsided. It
specifies European Monetary Union (Emu) in great detail but is very vague on
European Political Union (Epu). This result does not conform to the original
German intention: before the Maastricht summit, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
insisted on the need for parallel progress on Emu and Epu.
Numerous voices in Germany have recently called for new efforts to
complement Emu with Epu. Particular support for Epu comes from many German
economists, on the grounds that Emu will not be able to function without it.
This view is based on four main arguments, none of which is truly
convincing. It is possible to create Emu without Epu. Furthermore, the
creation of the single market may give an additional spur to this beneficial
process.
The first of the four arguments for Epu rests on the premise that a single
currency provides an additional incentive for government deficits. This is
because a single currency removes the inflation and interest rate
constraints for public borrowing.
Consequently, the theory goes, fiscal policy must be tightly controlled on a
community level - a process which, in the final analysis, requires political
union. Otherwise, anti-inflationary monetary policies are likely to be
thwarted by fiscal laxity.
Yet, while a single currency does lift some public borrowing constraints, it
also creates new ones, because national governments can no longer use the
inflation tax to finance deficits. The increasing mobility of capital in a
monetary union will at the same time put pressure on governments to project
an image of fiscal soundness.
In addition, the Maastricht treaty itself helps to ensure budgetary
discipline. One of the criteria for eligibility to join stage three of Emu
is that the government deficit must not exceed 3 per cent of GDP. The ratio
of public debt to GDP must also be not higher than 60 per cent.
In practice, these criteria may not be 'watertight'. But would matters be
improved with European political union? There is room for doubt whether in a
political union central authorities really are in a significantly better
position to enforce budgetary discipline among the lower tiers of
government. Federally structured states, such as the US or Germany, provide
numerous examples to the contrary.
The next economic argument in favour of Epu runs like this: a single
currency implies that the exchange rate is no longer an economic policy
instrument. Under these conditions, asymmetric demand or supply shocks in
the Community would lead to large and destabilising fluctuations in output
and employment. Since most pain would be felt in the less productive, poorer
economies, the richer countries would have to provide financial support for
them. A large-scale horizontal fiscal transfer mechanism, however, would be
acceptable to the voters only within an already-unified political entity.
This argument ignores the dynamic effects of economic integration. Monetary
union would further increase the mobility of goods and capital in Europe
which, as experience shows, tends to benefit the poorer countries most.
Spain and Portugal are cases in point. Since joining the EC in 1986, both
have enjoyed growth rates almost twice as high as the rest of the community.
The single market, combined with monetary union, may actually reduce the
need for fiscal transfers, provided national governments pursue the right
economic policies, which must above all be geared to improving the supply
side.
The third line of argument emphasises that price stability cannot be
achieved by the central bank alone, no matter how independent or skilled it
is.
The primacy of price stability often implies painful policy trade-offs in
terms of lower growth or higher unemployment levels. These consequences will
not be accepted unless all segments of society share a broad anti-inflation
consensus. In Germany the Bundesbank has always been able to count on that
consensus, enabling it to play its role as guardian of the currency. Many
observers doubt, however, whether this traditional German preference for
price stability will be shared throughout Europe. Emu would then be doomed
to failure.
This reflects old thinking. There have been times when Germany looked like
an island of price stability in an inflationary sea, but the position has
changed in recent years.
Six countries have, since 1979, participated with Germany in the narrow band
of the EMS exchange rate mechanism. During the 1980s, most of these
countries - Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands - have seen their inflation rates converge with or even fall
below, German levels. This clearly documents their commitment to price
stability.
The EMS split between low and higher inflation countries has been made still
more evident by the currency unrest of last autumn. And, under the
Maastricht rules, those countries which have not attained an anti-inflation
consensus will be barred from joining Emu.
Fourth, some observers hint at constitutional problems if Emu is not
accompanied by Epu. They say it would be mistaken to transfer responsibility
for one aspect of economic policy - monetary affairs - to a supranational
institution, while leaving the rest in the hands of national governments.
Since monetary policy decisions of the European central bank in these
circumstances are not likely to be co-ordinated with national economic
policies, they may produce undesirable effects. More fundamentally, European
central bank actions may infringe national powers to shape economic policy.
This reasoning is rooted in the Keynesian view that central bank actions
influence aggregate economic activity.
Alternatively, one may postulate that a central bank's only job is to
provide sound money, and that this is a goal to which all other economic
policy objectives are subordinate. This is why prudent societies put
responsibility for monetary policy in the hands of an independent central
bank. It does not make much difference in this context whether the central
bank operates autonomously within one country, as the Bundesbank has done
for many years, or on a supranational level, as the European central bank
would.
Thus, there is little reason to assume that monetary policy cannot be
conducted effectively unless Emu is accompanied by Epu. On the contrary, Emu
without Epu might represent a superior institutional framework for price
stability.
In Emu without Epu, policy-makers will have a much better chance of
accepting the fact that monetary policy is no longer within their grasp. In
most European countries, national control over monetary policy has long been
an illusion; under EMS rules, Germany's partners have to follow the course
of the Bundesbank.
In Emu they will be better off. While the central bank continues to be out
of their reach, they will be faced with monetary policies set by a
supranational institution, rather than by an individual foreign central
bank.
If monetary policy is transferred to a supranational level, it will, after
all, be largely depoliticised. With its formal status of autonomy, the
European central bank would be in a good position to live up to its task:
providing sound money for the citizens of Europe.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (28): A non-migratory
species - Retail banks prefer to stay in their own national High Streets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE walking down the high street of a provincial European town is
unlikely to encounter a foreign bank.
In Margate's high street, there are branches of Midland, Lloyds, National
Westminster and Barclays. Across the channel in Dieppe, Credit Lyonnais,
Credit Agricole and Banque Nationale de Paris are to be found.
But the French banks have not migrated en masse to the UK nor have the
British ones to France.
This may seem odd, given that banking is regarded as one of the more
international industries. Indeed, the provision of banking services to big
companies became a transnational business long before the European Community
single market programme began to take shape.
However, retail banking - providing services to individuals and small
companies - is still on the whole a domestic business. A range of cultural,
tax and regulatory obstacles have combined to prevent the creation of a
single market in retail banking products.
A typical example of a barrier to international competition was encountered
recently by the UK bank Barclays in France. In the autumn, it tried to get
around a French government ban on interest-bearing current accounts by
launching a new product which combined a non-interest paying current account
with an automatic sweep mechanism to shift a customer's surplus funds into a
money market account.
There was uproar from French banks, which were concerned that their
profitability would be squeezed if they responded by offering similar
products. However, the French finance minister, Mr Michel Sapin, came to
their rescue in mid October by announcing a prohibition on automatic sweep
mechanisms.
So Barclays was deprived of the ability to market a product widely available
in the rest of Europe - to the possible detriment of French consumers.
This incident illustrates the severe limits of the single market programme
to encourage genuine international competition in retail banking. The
various European Community banking directives which come into effect on
January 1 will do nothing to remove such barriers to competition. They
relate mainly to the levels of capital which EC banks must have to continue
in business (The Own Funds and Solvency Ratio directives) and the way in
which banks are supervised (the Second Consolidated Supervision Directive
and the Second Banking Directive).
The Second Banking Directive is the most important new EC banking
legislation. It creates a 'passport' for EC banks, which allows any bank
authorised to do business in an EC country to set up branches in another EC
country, without the need to get the permission of the supervisor in that
other country.
In theory, therefore, it reduces the costs and complications for EC-based
banks of expanding within the EC. An example of a cost-saving move which
some banks are contemplating as a result of the directive is to convert
various subsidiaries scattered throughout Europe into branches. This would
release capital held by each of the subsidiaries for use by the parent bank.
The directive will have more significant ramifications for bank supervisors.
The Bank of England will for example spend far less time monitoring the
financial affairs of branches of foreign EC banks. The Bank's supervisory
department will continue to take an interest in the liquidity of such a
branch, but responsibility for monitoring its financial health in a more
detailed way will rest with the parent bank's domestic supervisor.
Because there remain significant obstacles to success in transnational
retail banking within the EC, no bank is currently engaged in developing a
Europe-wide network of branches.
Though a number of banks, such as Barclays, National Westminster, Credit
Lyonnais and Deutsche, have retail networks in different countries, they
have typically managed each country's network as an autonomous business -
with its own local brand name, financial system and management.
Only one bank has attempted to use its own brand name, system and products
in branches scattered throughout several European countries. Paradoxically
this bank is not European, but is America's Citibank.
The record of Citibank's European operations has been patchy. For the time
being, therefore, European banks may use computers rather than expensive
branches to deliver services across frontiers within the EC.
The way forward may have been shown by Royal Bank of Scotland, which has
developed an electronic system, IBOS, for linking its branches with those of
Credit Commercial de France, Spain's Banco Santander and Banco de Comercio e
Industria in Portugal.
The idea is that any customer of one of these banks, whether a company or
individual, can have access to a full range of banking services even if he
or she is travelling abroad within Europe.
Although RBS's plan for EC banking may not be Napoleonic in its ambition, it
has the virtue that the costs of IBOS are modest - which is reassuring given
the chequered history of most banks' ventures outside their home
territories.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (27): Divided we still
stand - The obstacles to a single law for companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Company Statute (ECS) is nearly a quarter of a century old, but
it has not yet been born.
The proposal, dreamed up by the European Commission in 1970, was supposed to
provide a single corporate structure for multinationals in the EC. Instead
of having to find their way around different national systems and set up a
network of PLCs, SAs, NVs, AGs and SpAs, multinationals would be able to
establish a single SE - 'Societas Europaea' - under Community law. Lawyers'
fees would be slashed, administrative nightmares banished and large European
companies could get on with making money.
But what seemed a smart idea - or just plain common sense - has repeatedly
stumbled on the very national differences it hoped to eliminate. Twice
revived since 1970, ECS was even added to the fast-track single market
programme only to suffer the indignity of being overtaken by newly-minted
directives in other fields. As 1993 begins, and despite member states'
efforts over the past 18 months, the ECS is still under negotiation.
The ECS would be voluntary, but the principal obstacle to agreement has been
the proposal's detailed requirements for employee participation in the
management of SEs. Britain is particularly opposed to such obligations,
while Germany, which already has strong rules on worker participation, is in
favour.
'In theory, people are interested in the idea of incorporating as a European
company and that's an attractive prospect,' comments one British official.
'But when they see what's on the table they are less impressed.'
At the most recent ministerial discussion of the ECS - under British
chairmanship last November - it was agreed that any company seeking to
register would have initial subscribed capital of Ecu120,000, and would
conform to the definition of public limited companies in the member state of
registration. But the ministers made no headway on the question of worker
participation and will have to return to the ECS during the next six months,
under the Danish presidency.
Yet the plight of the European Company Statute is as nothing compared to the
fate of its company law siblings in the original 1985 single market
programme. Indeed, this is the principal area where the ambitions of Lord
Cockfield, then internal market commissioner, have not been realised.
Early on, member states adopted measures which allow loose collaboration
between companies, under the clumsy-sounding title of a European Economic
Interest Grouping (EEIG). This initiative has enjoyed a modicum of success
since it came into force in July 1989 - some 350 EEIGs have been created -
but, as the Commission itself makes clear, 'it is an instrument for economic
co-operation, not for integration'.
Member states have also adopted measures on disclosure requirements for
company branches set up in another Community country, a directive enabling
sole individuals to operate as a private limited company, and amendments to
earlier directives on the content, auditing and publication of accounts.
But there has been stalemate in the principal areas for harmonisation of
company law:
Fifth company law directive. This is a measure which goes back nearly as far
as the ECS, and covers roughly the same ground. The difference is that it
would establish a compulsory European statute for virtually all public
limited companies. As a result, it has been attacked by the same member
states which oppose the ECS. For months it has been regarded as a 'low
priority', even by Brussels, which has chosen to concentrate on the ECS;
Tenth directive on cross-border mergers. Another low priority for the
Commission, this measure has also fallen foul of British objections to
worker participation because it allows member states to prevent cross-border
exchanges of shares if employees are deprived of rights of representation as
a result of the deal.
Thirteenth directive on takeover bids. This directive is backed, among
others, by liberal economists, who believe there will be no genuine free
movement of capital in the Community until corporate predators can hunt
across borders following a single EC takeover code. But its potentially
far-reaching proposals for a single threshold - above which bids would have
to be launched - and harmonised rules on the content and publication of
offer documents may never see the light of day. At the Edinburgh summit last
month, EC leaders agreed that the controversial measure went into 'excessive
detail'.
If it survives at all, the takeover directive will be replaced by a list of
'general principles' which would then be fleshed out by individual member
states.
But in Brussels and beyond, there are few tears being shed about the
apparent failure of the single market company law programme. The main reason
for this is that neither Commission nor member states any longer regard the
measures as essential to the operation of the single market.
For one thing, much of the nitty-gritty of EC corporate law had already been
adopted by the time the single market programme was launched. The series of
unnamed company law directives are numbered one to 13. Some of those
measures have sunk without trace, but others have been operating since the
1970s.
The first company law directive - which lays out harmonised publication
requirements for the incorporation and winding-up of companies - was adopted
as early as 1968. In addition, other single market measures, aimed, for
example, at eliminating double taxation for companies with subsidiaries in
other EC countries, have helped ease the burden for genuinely European
corporations.
More importantly, much of the corporate restructuring and economic boom
predicted by advocates of the single market has already happened - largely
without the aid of a harmonised European company law and well ahead of the
1993 deadline.
As a recent upbeat Commission assessment of the programme points out,
mergers and acquisitions involving companies from different EC countries
increased threefold between 1984 and 1989 - while the value of such deals
rose by 700 per cent.
'All the available evidence points to one inescapable conclusion - EC
business has moved swiftly to make the most of these new possibilities,'
says the report.
There is a third reason why proposals to harmonise company law now appear to
be merely the icing on the single market cake, and therefore dispensable:
the current recession has taken the edge off corporate deal-makers'
appetites, reducing the pressure for a single European company statute, or a
single takeover code. But assuming that recession lifts and the single
market takes off, the ECS may yet get the chance to prove its worth.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (26): Classic
industrial response to the open market place - Corporate strategy, a
Franco-Swedish combine hits the road
</HEADLINE>

THE nearly three-year-old alliance between Renault and Volvo, the French and
Swedish car and truck makers, is a classic industrial response to the
competitive challenges and opportunities thrown up by the single market.
When the pair exchanged minority stakes in 1990, they cited as reasons the
growing competition in their industry, the costs of stringent environmental
rules and the increase in investment needed to keep pace with technology.
The purpose has been to share these burdens by spreading costs and
ultimately to work towards a full merger, which both partners would dearly
like to achieve.
A merger looked possible early last year but was subsequently shelved due to
changes in the French government's attitude.
Losses at Volvo provoked the former government of Mrs Edith Cresson to have
second thoughts about the deal. The present government, under Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, has no such doubts, but it does not have the opportunity to pass
the legislation needed to pave the way for a merger because of the closeness
of the legislative election in March.
If the partnership has been a political balancing act, it has also required
some fine judgment in business terms. Renault and Volvo have had to strike a
delicate balance between their pledge to act as if they were one company,
and the vital need to keep their brand identities separate, so as not to
steal shares of a declining market from each other.
This explains why the alliance has made more progress in their car
businesses, where Renault and Volvo occupy clearly different markets, than
in trucks, where they compete.
Like the single market itself, the Renault-Volvo alliance has advanced
gradually in small steps, which look uninspiring on their own but add up to
much progress. Renault executives say the results have been far more
encouraging than they expected.
The first step, early in 1990 after the agreement to exchange shareholdings,
was the creation of a joint car and truck research centre in France. This is
studying joint components like gearboxes and rear axles for trucks and
common stamped steel sheets for truck cabs. In cars, the centre is working
on areas like safety, new materials and alternative fuels.
Another early step was the establishment of joint component purchasing
committees for both cars and trucks, which have since evolved into formal
joint ventures last June, to represent both companies to their main
suppliers.
This could turn out to be the biggest cost saver in the alliance, since the
partners' car making divisions already buy 15 per cent of components from
common suppliers and components represent two-thirds of Renault's
manufacturing costs. In trucks, the partners say 60 per cent of their
suppliers are shared. Volvo estimates that, as a result, its group will save
SKr800m annually in the next two to five years, though Renault has not given
a precise estimate.
The partners have also agreed to exchange some car engines, saving Renault
an estimated FFr1bn on its development bill to date. Volvo's Dutch plant is
to take a Renault diesel engine and economy two-litre petrol driven unit,
while Renault is to take a Volvo two-litre 16-valve petrol engine for a
future model. There are no plans to swap truck engines because they feel
that the engine is a part of a truck's marketing identity.
There will, however, be some joint products in specific areas, always under
the proviso that they will keep their marques separate. A jointly developed
range of top of the line executive cars, for example, is planned for sale in
Europe by the year 2000.
They will use common platforms, engines and gearboxes, but have different
body styles and be sold as separate marques through the partners' respective
dealerships.
There are no such plans for a common truck, though the pair are jointly
developing a low floor commuter bus, due to come on to the market this year
or next.
Again, it will be sold under different names, either as Heuliez, the French
bus maker controlled by Renault Vehicules Industriels and Volvo Bus, or as
Volvo alone.
On marketing, the pair partially merged their French car and light
commercial vehicles sales divisions just over a year ago, but have no plans
to do so in trucks.
Overall, the general pattern at Renault and Volvo has been to combine forces
where there are clear common interests, but to stay apart where their
interests might clash. It is a difficult balance to get right, just as much
between companies as between nations, as the recent history of the European
Community itself shows.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (25): There's a long,
long trail awinding - Jonathan S Schwarz traces the uneven progress towards
a uniform taxation system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HARMONISATION of tax systems in the European Community has been on the
political agenda since the EC's inception.
Fiscal barriers have been identified as an important inhibition to
intra-community trade and investment. However, since revenue-raising by
Governments is regarded as at the heart of sovereignty, the development of a
European tax system has been a long and tortuous process.
When the Single European Act was passed in 1987, it was recognised that
taxation, unlike other targets for harmonisation, was so close to the
states' national interests that majority voting did not apply. As a result,
the unanimous approval of member states is required to introduce new EC tax
law.
Nevertheless, a unified tax system is now discernible, particularly in the
indirect tax field, with new items being added to the agenda all the time.
The longest standing element of European Community tax law is the common
customs duty regime. A single Community customs law sets rules for the
import of goods into the community and provides for their valuation.
European Community regulation specifies the valuation of goods for customs
purposes.
Although implementation and collection of customs duty is handled by member
states, collaboration is ensured by the customs co-operation council. Once
goods have crossed the customs frontiers around the community, they enter
into free circulation and may be traded freely without further customs duty.
As part of the single market, agreements have now also been reached on the
harmonisation of excise duties relating to tobacco, alcohol and fuel oils.
Value added tax (VAT) is perhaps the real European Community tax. It was
introduced into community law by the first VAT directive in 1967 and all
states were required to adopt a common system by 1972.
Not only is VAT established under community law which all members are
required to implement, but because a portion of the tax collected is paid to
the community directly. and forms part of its own resources, it is also a
European tax.
The introduction of the interim VAT regime on January 1, 1993 was a major
step towards disregarding intra-community boundaries in determining how the
supply of goods should be taxed.
Although the method adopted is complex, it is designed to move towards a
system where transactions between member states will be taxed in the same
way as transactions within a single member state.
While the adoption of a 15 per cent minimum standard rate of VAT has
required only Germany, Luxembourg and Spain to increase their rates,
psychologically it has reinforced the idea of VAT as a common European tax.
Furthermore, the European Court of Justice has shown little tolerance for
member states which attempt to impose turnover taxes that do not comply with
community law, or fail to implement the tax directives properly. Virtually
no member state has escaped judgment on this.
Direct taxation has not proceeded at the same rate as the indirect tax
system. Although proposals for corporate tax harmonisation have been around
for more than two decades, it is only at the beginning of 1992 that two
corporate tax directives entered into effect.
The parent and subsidiary companies directive aims at eliminating the
withholding of taxes on payments across member states' borders and
eliminating double taxation on distributions paid by subsidiaries to their
parent companies in other member states.
The second directive is designed to facilitate tax free cross-border
corporate mergers, acquisitions, divisions and share-for-share exchanges.
Both directives have, however, been criticised as being incomplete and
somewhat unclear as to their precise scope and meaning.
Member states have also been slow to introduce implementing legislation, and
the manner in which the directives have been implemented varies noticeably
from one member state to another. As a result, the term 'harmonisation' is
perhaps inappropriate. The Treaty of Rome talks of approximation of laws and
this is a more realistic description of the manner in which these directives
actually take effect.
Thus while the two directives may present a picture of a common system, in
practice wide variations mean that the rules of member states differ
significantly and only have some common features.
In the case of the mergers directive, implementation is further inhibited by
the fact that in several member states, corporate law has not kept pace with
tax developments, and therefore transactions which are contemplated under
the directives cannot be implemented under existing corporate law. Other
difficulties arise because the directive only covers corporation taxes,
whereas in practice such transactions are often affected by a variety of
other taxes notably stamp duties, registration and transfer taxes.
In addition to the two corporation tax directives, a treaty was signed
between all member states in an attempt to harmonise the rules relating to
inter-company transfer pricing. The arbitration treaty provides for a common
standard of measuring arm's length prices, as well as for an arbitration
mechanism in the event of differences between the treatment of transfer
pricing adjustments between the member states.
While arbitration has been advocated as a method of resolving such
difficulty by many practitioners, the treaty has yet to be ratified by all
member states. Even when it does enter into effect, it has a limited initial
life of six years and many doubt whether this is sufficient time to test the
system thoroughly.
While success in achieving a unified system in the direct tax field has been
limited, in practice there has been convergence between European corporate
tax systems in a number of respects. The first and most obvious is an
alignment of mainstream corporation tax rates.
Most countries have tax rates between 33 and 40 per cent. In addition, most
member states, at least during the 1980s, attempted to broaden their tax
bases and reduce rates. A variety of incentives, such as investment tax
credits and accelerated depreciation, have been eliminated generally.
While the taxation commissioner, Mrs Christiane Scrivener, has approved this
process some countries, such as Belgium, have been concerned that excessive
tax competition between states would cause undue pressure to be brought on
the governments. This has not prevented Belgium along with Luxembourg from
entering into competition with the Netherlands to produce the ideal European
holding company location.
The Ruding committee appointed by the Commission to consider the future of
direct tax harmonisation in the EC produced a detailed report containing
ambitious proposals for a European tax system whose introduction was to be
geared to the stages of economic and monetary union contemplated by the
Maastricht Treaty.
Uncertainty about Maastricht and turmoil in the currency markets, which has
thrown into question the very existence of the European exchange rate
mechanism, has sharply halted progress towards economic and monetary union.
The Commission has, however, proposed a more modest programme of measures
designed to facilitate cross-border transactions within the community,
including extending the current parent subsidiary directive to all forms of
company and to payments of interests and royalties. A proposal has also been
made to enable European groups to use cross-border losses. Mrs Scrivener
believes that such measures would go some way towards eliminating tax
disadvantages of cross-border
investment and trade. With the Commission under fire for its alleged
tendencies towards centralisation, she is reluctant to push member states
too far.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (5): Hang on to your
passports - Goods will move more freely than people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DON'T throw away your passport. For the EC traveller, the barrier-free
European market has not quite arrived.
The lifting of frontier controls on goods and people was perhaps the most
symbolic goal of the single market programme.
However, for six months or more it has been obvious that at least one,
possibly three, and perhaps all 12 member states will not achieve the second
of those objectives before the end of 1993.
Member states appear to have met the deadline for lifting frontier controls
on goods. For all its alleged faults, the new 'transitional' regime for VAT
and excise duty has done away with the need for basic administrative border
controls on all products. Some 60m tax forms, and the people who used to
fill them in, have gone too.
On the other hand, there are lingering doubts about how a new frontier-free
regime will affect certain products. In the case of bananas, for example,
member states have just agreed a new quota regime, but it is unlikely to
come into force for at least six months. There is as yet no definitive
system for monitoring the cross-border movement of works of art or of
'dual-use' goods, which have both military and civilian applications. The
most likely solution is a formal or informal 'cellule de crise' to deal with
any problems which might occur between January 1 and the implementation of a
new regime.
Officials agree it is little more than a sticking plaster solution, but it
has allowed frontier controls on goods to be lifted before the January 1
deadline. If member states keep their nerve - and do not allow the
inevitable media scares about loopholes and errors to shake them into a
hasty reimposition of controls - then free movement of goods seems more or
less assured.
The abolition of passport controls presents quite different problems, which
are unlikely to be resolved before the end of this year, if at all.
Nine months ago, the Community seemed to divide into three main camps on the
question of passport checks.
Britain has always been the member state most vehemently opposed to the
lifting of border controls on people and its government's argument is
relatively simple.
The 1986 Single European Act, it says, does not oblige the UK to lift its
controls on non-EC citizens. Consequently, Britain must maintain at least a
minimal check to ensure that unwanted non-EC travellers do not slip through
the EC passport lane at ports and airports.
In the second camp are Denmark and Ireland. Denmark wants to maintain border
controls, but has indicated in the past it might be prepared to lift them if
sufficient safeguards are put in place. Ireland claims to be committed to
the lifting of controls. But because of its geographical proximity to
Britain, and the fact that most of its travellers pass through the UK under
an existing free-travel agreement, it would find it difficult to loosen its
controls without at least consulting the UK.
Finally, the European Commission and the remaining nine EC countries, which
are members of the Schengen free-travel agreement, dispute the British
interpretation of the Single European Act and are committed to the lifting
of border controls on people.
Until recently, it looked as though the dispute between the Commission and
the British government might end in the European Court. An individual court
case - perhaps brought by a federalist MEP or ordinary free-travel zealot -
is still not out of the question, but in the past six to nine months, a
number of new elements have reduced the immediate threat of Commission court
action:
Euro-politics. Since the Danish and French referendums on the Maastricht
treaty, Brussels has been increasingly reluctant to challenge member states
on strongly held points of principle. Mr Kenneth Clarke, British home
secretary, warned fellow EC interior ministers in June that pressurising
Britain on passport controls could swing the UK parliament against the
Maastricht treaty - it was a potent argument, according to observers.
The refugee problem. Increasing immigration pressures and racial tension,
particularly in Germany, have made the Schengen nine think twice about
lifting their internal border controls as quickly as they had intended. The
Schengen accord does commit them to abolish internal checks, but only when
external frontiers have been sufficiently strengthened, and ancillary
measures - such as a computer link between Schengen immigration authorities
 -have been put in place. Neither has yet happened.
Practical difficulties. Airports - most notably the busy Schiphol hub in
Amsterdam - have won a deferral of the deadline for lifting controls, on the
grounds that they cannot physically change their infrastructure before
December this year to separate EC and non-EC arrivals.
The result is that even the most enthusiastic countries are unlikely to lift
their internal border controls on people before the middle of this year.
Travellers in continental Europe will probably notice little change - cars
will still be able to sweep through most internal borders without checks;
airports will still check passports, although controls may get lighter as
terminal infrastructure is adapted to cope with the new regime.
Britain, on the other hand, is planning to retain its controls at airports
and sea borders unaltered until Schengen decides to abolish its internal
checks.
When that happens, UK seaports will probably implement a version of the
so-called 'Bangemann wave' - named after the current internal market
commissioner - requiring EC travellers to show the cover of their passport
to officials.
Schengen's disarray on border controls let Britain off the hook as far as
the January 1 deadline was concerned, but it seems unlikely that an eventual
'two-speed' solution to the question of passport checks will be acceptable
to all continental European countries. According to Schengen, the Bangemann
wave is too strict as a control on internal borders and too lax as a control
on external frontiers.
If Britain - or, indeed, Ireland and Denmark - decides to apply only minimal
checks to travellers arriving from outside the Community then Schengen
members may have to start examining the passports of passengers on flights
and ferries from non-Schengen EC partners.
That would be a strange and unhappy end to a project that was supposed to be
built on mutual trust and partnership.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (3): Now comes the hard
part - Enforcing the new legislation will provide the real test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER pushing dozens of new laws through their national parliaments, EC
member states must now live up to their promises and make the European
single market work.
One word is likely to dominate debate on the single market in 1993:
enforcement. Striking the correct balance between the supervisory role of
member states and the European Commission will not be easy; but it is vital
if cross-border disputes about implementation are to be avoided and
confidence in the single market is to be retained.
The task is daunting. Rhetoric in Brussels about the irreversible common
destiny of EC member states often minimises the deep-rooted diversity. Just
as there is an obvious 'top tier' of strong economies in northern Europe
built around Germany, so too there will be a 'lower tier' of countries
lagging on enforcement standards - particularly in the sensitive area of
public procurement where the temptation to protect national companies will
be formidable.
The signs already point in this direction. Although 95 per cent of the
single market programme set out in the original white paper were complete by
the end of 1992, less than half of it was expected to be transposed into
national law of all 12 member states, according to a report by the committee
on economic, monetary and industrial affairs of the European Parliament.
Denmark, often accused of being the Community troublemaker after its
rejection of the Maastricht treaty, has the best track-record on
transposition.
Moreover, there are important gaps in implementation in areas such as
dual-use technology which can have military application, explosives, works
of art and meat goods. Nor are companies likely to be ready to adjust to the
new rules covering VAT collection.
Mr Ben Patterson, the Conservative MEP who authored the above report, is
flush with examples of foot-dragging in common professional standards: Greek
engineers trained in Germany whose qualifications are not recognised back
home; British airline pilots who, having worked for a private German
airline, cannot get permanent jobs; and a failure to reach agreement on
general recognition of higher education diplomas.
The most serious work to date on enforcement is the report drawn up by Mr
Peter Sutherland, the former EC Commissioner responsible for competition
policy, who chaired a high-level group on implementation last year.
The 60-page study makes numerous practical suggestions aimed at making the
single market fairer, more consumer-friendly, more open and more efficient
in terms of streamlining its laws. Among its chief recommendations are:
A 'deeper partnership' between the European Commission and member states
aimed at exchanging information, mainly through officials working on an
informal basis;
Provision by states and Brussels of informal advice on redress for breaches
of EC law to those requesting it. Plus an ombudsman at EC level or in each
member state;
Systematic consolidation of EC law and creation of a legislative
co-ordination unit inside the Commission to prevent overlap;
A better understanding and use of EC law, including possible compulsory
courses for judges and a new communications campaign to make sure EC
citizens are aware of their legal rights.
The Sutherland report was influenced heavily by the debate within the
Community on 'subsidiarity' - devolving decision-making to the lowest
appropriate level - which erupted in the wake of the Danes' rejection of the
Maastricht treaty.
Some critics have wondered whether Mr Sutherland pulled some of his
enforcement punches. His panel's rejection, at this stage, of a central
clearing house to collect data on infringement of the single market, for
example, may reflect fears of a new Brussels bureaucracy policing
cross-border trade; but it raises the threat of unsatisfactory trade-offs
between countries. 'Those who have stronger standards of implementation will
lose out,' says one EC official.
The UK, the driving force behind subsidiarity, is anxious that the
Commission does not turn into a shrinking violet. This is not so much a
political volte face; more a hard-headed calculation that if cross-border
disputes flare up, the Commission is well placed to act as arbiter rather
than burdening the European Court with dozens of legal cases.
Thus, a recent UK draft proposes permanent Commission inspectorates to
monitor selectively member states' performance, and a Commission review
which 'where necessary' may go to the relevant Council of Ministers. 'The
logic of the internal market demands satisfactory arrangements for its joint
management by the Commission and the national administrations,' says the
report.
As the Commission's response to both the Sutherland and the UK report made
clear, much will depend on strengthening the machinery for co-operation
between Brussels and member states. Proposals include a new training policy
for officials in enforcement, new computer networks to speed up the flow of
data on the operation of the internal market, and more efficient management
of the customs union.
These are the challenges facing those struggling to keep the playing field
level in the single market; but it is clear that plenty of voices will be
calling for the outstanding gaps to be filled.
Mr Patterson is convinced that there are sufficient uncovered areas to
warrant production of a new Commission white paper.
'In addition, there will be a need to deal with the new barriers to free
movement which changing technology and the ingenuity of protectionist forces
will create.'
The converse argument is that some forces - such as organised crime - may be
so adept at freedom of movement of goods and capital that calls for
reimposing some controls may prove irresistible. But for the moment the
forces of integration are firmly in the saddle as the race to take advantage
of the single market enters the home stretch.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (6): A socialist's
dilemma - The role of the new competition commissioner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE internal market was not the only innovation ushered in with the new
year. On January 6, European business came under the watchful eye of the
European Community's first socialist competition commissioner, Mr Karel Van
Miert, a pragmatic Belgian responsible for transport and, latterly,
environment in the 1989-92 Commission.
Mr Van Miert has a hard act to follow. Sir Leon Brittan, now responsible for
EC trade policy, was a committed liberal in the competition field. But the
instinctive reaction of some of his supporters - that Mr Van Miert is bound
to be 'soft' on competition - is not necessarily borne out by the evidence.
For example, during the past four years, the Belgian commissioner has pushed
through a complex and far-reaching air liberalisation package, which lifted
government curbs on air fares from January 1. By mid-1997, this same deal
will allow any EC airline to fly any route, including domestic services,
anywhere in the Community. Given the strong vested interests ranged against
Mr Van Miert, this was no mean achievement.
Nonetheless, Mr Van Miert takes over the role of competition commissioner at
a difficult time. Pressure to reverse, or at least freeze, EC competition
policy is growing. This is partly a result of the single market itself,
which has opened previously protected EC industries to new competition from
other EC countries and from outside the Community. It is also a symptom of
the general recession which has tempted more interventionist-minded
governments to try out protectionist solutions.
In his earliest statements after announcement of his new job, Mr Van Miert
restricted his statements on EC competition policy to saying that there
would be changes. He is likely, for example, to look more carefully at the
social and industrial impact of competition decisions than his predecessors.
Purists fear this will water down policy, but Sir Leon believes the
precedents established under his regime and that of the previous
commissioner, Mr Peter Sutherland, will last.
So what is in the panoply of anti-trust weapons which Mr Van Miert has
inherited from his predecessors, and how will he use them?
The EC merger regulation. Probably the most far-reaching of the innovations
to emerge during the Sutherland-Brittan period, the regulation allows the
Commission to look into large-scale cross-border mergers within set
deadlines, and outlaw or amend deals. In fact, only one deal has been
blocked outright since the regulation came into force 2 1/2 years ago - the
Franco-Italian bid for de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer,
which, as transport commissioner, Mr Van Miert supported.
As competition supremo, Mr Van Miert will have to decide whether the
threshold for examining deals under the regulation should be lowered, as
favoured by Sir Leon and by the Commission's own merger task force. He will
also grapple with the controversial question of how to define the market for
each merger, and whether to allow European champions to develop in line with
the growth of the single market.
Articles 85 and 86 of the original EC treaty, which are aimed at preventing
cartels, price-fixing and abuse of a company's dominant position. In the
last months of his tenure, Sir Leon pledged to introduce new
internally-binding deadlines for such cases, which frequently take a year or
more to complete. If Mr Van Miert backs the Brittan reforms, he will have to
try to persuade reluctant competition officials that such deadlines are
feasible and necessary and ensure they are implemented. At the same time, he
inherits a commitment to devolve responsibility for smaller anti-trust cases
to national authorities - but without allowing overall competition policy to
be distorted.
Article 90 of the EC treaty, which gives the Commission the right to issue
directives breaking open public monopolies without first having to gain
member state approval. That right was affirmed by the European Court in
1991, but since then even Sir Leon has fought shy of using it, although he
has threatened it many times against energy, postal and telecommunications
monopolies. This would be one way of opening up some of the most difficult
outstanding areas of the single market. But it would also be a last resort
option. If Mr Van Miert chose to use it, he could alienate those member
states - notably France - which were happiest with his appointment.
State subsidies. This is probably the area in which Mr Van Miert will face
the strongest challenges to his authority, as member states seek to ease
their favourite industries into the single market. Sir Leon's advisers claim
Mr Van Miert was too soft on state aid to airlines, the supervision of which
is still the responsibility of the transport commissioner. But it is
impossible to predict from a handful of decisions how he will react to more
complex cases which bring together industrial, social and competition
considerations.
An independent EC cartel office. This is not yet part of the Commission's
armoury, but the question of whether to create a separate German- or
British-style competition authority is certain to be posed during Mr Van
Miert's tenure.
The suggestion was always attacked by Sir Leon, partly on the grounds that
it would encourage commissioners to take purely political decisions, whereas
under the current system they are bound to consider the implications of
their rulings for competition.
In fact, critics suggest that latterly Sir Leon was himself much too eager
to tailor competition policy to short-term political demands: striking
creative deals with merging companies, for example, to avoid another row
like the one that exploded over de Havilland.
Competition lawyers in Brussels, and their corporate clients, say they are
seeking the same from Mr Van Miert as they sought - and did not always
receive - from his predecessors. They want predictability in the
implementation of EC competition policy, enabling business to work
confidently within the single market. Mr Van Miert's much-vaunted pragmatism
will face a hard test.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (4): It really worked /
Interview with Lord Cockfield, market mastermind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD COCKFIELD, the crusty British peer who was European commissioner for
the internal market from 1984 to 1988, is in the satisfying position of
seeing a vision turned into reality.
'The single market is almost exactly as envisaged,' he says, 'except for
minor flaws, such as the remaining frontier controls over people, and the
fact that the financial sector reforms are not as liberal as I would have
liked.'
Lord Cockfield's stint in Brussels coincided with a number of milestones in
the single market process. His biggest achievement was the 1985 European
Commission White Paper and its nearly 300 legislative proposals setting out
the framework for the market.
His great strength, according to observers at the time, was writing the
paper in a way which gave national politicians a clear and logical blueprint
for building the market. His experience as a commissioner of Inland Revenue
in Britain gave him the ability to find ways through thorny and highly
technical tax issues requiring unanimous agreement by all 12 member states.
As a salesman for the programme, however, Lord Cockfield was less adept. He
rarely ventured forth to national capitals to lobby ministers, preferring
instead to stay in Brussels and to make his points at Council meetings
He did, however, ask Mr Paolo Cecchini, a senior Commission official, to
oversee the compilation of what became the landmark report on the proposed
market. It stands as one of the largest pieces of market research ever
conducted. Especially in view of its rosy economic forecasts and commercial
scenarios, many economists came to view it mainly as a propaganda exercise
to sell the White Paper proposals. But the report, published in 1988, set
off a flurry of corporate strategic reviews.
The economic buoyancy of 1986-90 - when EC economies registered average
annual growth rates of 3.2 per cent - made it easier for politicians to
accept those parts of the programme curbing national monopolies or
initiating painful industrial restructuring. 'An economic downturn three or
four years ago and it could have been another story,' he concedes.
A former trade secretary in Mrs Thatcher's government in the early 1980s,
Lord Cockfield shied away from harmonisation of standards as the main way of
overcoming national regulatory differences in European industries, favouring
instead mutual recognition and market-oriented solutions.
His belief in the power of market forces is undiminished, as is his
conviction that the imperfections in today's market will soon disappear.
'Once we get rid of frontier controls and major nationalistic impulses, such
as public procurement, then the forces of trade and the market will wash
away the remaining barriers,' he says. However, he does not make light of
the challenges in making the market work. 'The single market is in the bag.
But we may have to deal with new barriers.'
Lord Cockfield is a harsh critic of British government policy towards the
European Community in general, and the single market in particular. He takes
issue with politicians who promote the single market as an alternative to
the far wider concept of European economic and political union.
'The UK government had little real understanding of what the single market
meant,' he says. 'The original concept was that the single market would be
the foundation on which we would build economic unity . . . the market is
not the end of the road, but a road that leads somewhere, to economic union.
It's just a pity that the economic agenda was not completed before work
began on political union.'
He says that the objective of a single European currency was enshrined for
the first time in the Single European Act. He regrets the emotions
surrounding the currency issue - one of the most controversial points in the
debate over the Maastricht treaty. 'The single market is an enormous benefit
and the single currency would have produced a large add-on benefit.' In view
of the difficulties of keeping to the Maastricht monetary union timetable,
he believes there is a good chance that Europe's single currency will turn
out to be not the Ecu, but the D-Mark.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (1): A leap across
fallen barriers - The single market is not a panacea for the problems of
Europe. But with the right policies, hope will be restored in the east and
in the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's single market, born at the start of this year, is
an old idea, superimposed upon a continent jolted into several new
directions at once.
Allowing goods, people, services and capital to flow around an area
accounting for about one quarter of world economic output marks a giant step
forward for the EC. Breaking down Europe's barriers fulfils the concept set
out in the 1957 Treaty of Rome of forming a genuine common market.
The single market programme is enshrined in the Single European Act, which
came into effect in 1987. Launching measures with the effect of increasing
competition and building a more homogeneous EC business environment has
already produced some harsh effects - not least in contributing to plant
closures and layoffs as companies try to concentrate their EC operations in
the most efficient or low-cost centres.
The programme as a whole, however, is a recipe for growth. European industry
as a whole faces a grave problem of deteriorating international
competitiveness - particularly in comparison with the newly industrialising
countries of the Pacific rim, which have been making large inroads into EC
markets.
As part of a strategy of overcoming this drawback, European governments and
legislators have accomplished a victory of Community-mindedness over
national interests - and have put into place a powerful springboard to help
cope the EC with the economic challenges of the 1990s.
Some important areas are still to be dealt with, for instance in energy,
telecommunications and transport. An imperfect solution has been found over
the vexed question of creating a unified system for collecting value added
tax across the continent.
Additionally, partly because of controversy over immigration pressures -
touched off by the conflict in former Yugoslavia, as well as upheaval
elsewhere in the world - some controls remain in force on people crossing EC
borders, particularly at airports. None the less, roughly 95 per cent of the
liberalisation measures outlined in 1985 have been established as EC
legislation, extending to the main fields of industry, public procurement
and financial services.
The Community seems unlikely to embark upon a new phase of large-scale
legislation to clear up exemptions. But it has set itself a goal during the
next few years not only of completing the single market agenda, but also of
making it work.
The EC now has a market-place. There is a long way to go, however, before we
have a single Europe. The ructions during 1992 over the Maastricht treaty
underlined that consensus is far from complete on future political and
economic integration. The road to economic and monetary union (Emu) - which
many top European politicians, though not quite so many leading businessmen
 -have always regarded as essential for bringing the single market to
maturity - is now strewn with more obstacles than seemed apparent a year
ago.
After the autumn exchange rate turbulence, a large question mark also hangs
over the future of the European monetary system.
Yet, the single market process of harmonising regulations and laws on
products, trade, traffic and people has placed the EC firmly on the road to
supranationalism. Neither the Single European Act nor Maastricht sets down a
blueprint for a federal European state. But member countries now recognise
that a formal renunciation of sovereignty in important areas once held to be
the prerogative of nation-states, and a pooling of resources and powers, can
maximise benefits for all.
The single market's period of gestation has coincided, in the east of the
continent, with the death of communism. But capitalism's triumph is by no
means unmitigated. After the excitement and euphoria generated by the
breakdown of the east-west divide and the ending of the cold war, Europe is
weathering a phase of dourness and doubt. Last year's controversies over
Maastricht exposed a disquieting gap between politicians and voters over the
speed and direction of European development.
The swing to fringe extremist parties in many countries during the past 12
months is a symptom of some deeper pressures - among others, mounting
unemployment, now standing at around 16m throughout the EC.
Europe's task for 1993 is thus to show it can successfully manage a highly
difficult period of transition. There are three immediate challenges. First,
businesses and individuals have to show they can maximise the chances
offered by the single market, in spite of the most severe economic downturn
for 10 years in western Europe, and a deep restructuring crisis in the east.
Placing the rules of the single market on to the statute book was difficult,
but making them work will be more onerous still. The EC will also have to
ensure fair and equitable enforcement.
Second, the EC has to progress towards the goal of a wider Europe. The
Community's decision at the Edinburgh summit to start EC entry negotiations
this month with Austria, Finland and Sweden, reversing the previous
agreement to wait for ratification of Maastricht in all 12 states, is an
encouraging sign that the momentum of enlargement can be maintained.
The rejection last month by Switzerland - the EC's second most important
trading partner, after the US - of the plan for a free trade area between
the EC and the European Free Trade Association (Efta) was a blow, but not a
disaster.
The EC's single market encompasses 344m people. The European Economic Area,
which will now come into effect in the second half of the year, about six
months later than planned, will unite a population of 370m people, including
all the other six Efta states apart from Switzerland. The three Efta states
starting accession negotiations this month may join by 1995.
The third challenge concerns the east of the continent. Even on the most
optimistic assumptions, the former communist countries of eastern and
central Europe will have to wait beyond the year 2000 until they can join
the EC.
In partnership with the new administration in Washington, the EC will have
to redouble efforts to prevent chaos across the former communist bloc from
sparking off more generalised disruption in Europe. In 1992, the EC's
inability to stop, or even significantly influence, the war in
formerYugoslavia painfully illustrated the limits of the EC's fledgling
foreign policy. In 1993, the difficulties caused by economic dislocation and
political fragmentation in the east could become still worse if the European
economy slides into full-scale recession.
The economic clouds over the continent are all the more disquieting because,
in theory at least, the approach of the single market should have blown them
away. When EC governments negotiated the concept in 1985, the single market
programme was viewed as a sizeable boost to trade and investment.
An optimistic report published in 1988 under the aegis of Mr Paolo Cecchini,
a senior Commission official, forecast that the single market would increase
EC gross national product by 4.5 per cent over the medium term. It would
also, according to the report's conclusions, dampen inflation, improve
countries' budget positions, lower external deficits and create 1.8m new
jobs over the longer term.
Anticipation of the single market undoubtedly speeded up trade and
investment during the second half of the 1980s, illustrated particularly by
a spate of cross-border acquisitions and mergers. Growth was also
accelerated by the boom in Germany in 1989-91 caused first by the collapse
of the Berlin Wall and then by reunification.
EC experts now reckon that 30 per cent of the forecast effect of the single
market programme may already have worked its way through to the European
economy. The fillip to western growth at the end of the 1980s explains why
many of the controversial proposals of the Single European Act - in contrast
to those in the Maastricht treaty - did not attract undue opposition in
parliaments and public opinion.
The economic expansion in the late 1980s also helps explain why the EC,
shrugging off a decade of drift after the first oil crisis in 1973, suddenly
became a burning source of hope and prosperity for the eastern half of the
continent. Now, however, high German interest rates and the post-unification
difficulties faced by the German economy have thrown a pall over the
landscape.
With the dissipation of the positive economic effects of the late 1980s, the
EC - and those outside who see it as a beacon of light in a dark world -
have had to scale down their expectations for the 1990s.
The single market is not a panacea for Europe's problems. Yet, if
governments adopt the right policies to end the recession, it provides the
best route towards stability and prosperity later in the 1990s - for both
halves of the continent.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (2): Fishermen need not
wear hairnets - David Marsh tries to dispel some of the more alarming
anxieties about life in the new Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSERTION: A Commission directive will oblige fishermen to wear hairnets
aboard their boats.
FACT: Untrue. A Council directive, which took effect on January 1 1993, aims
at ensuring strict hygiene conditions in fish-processing plants. Dockside
staff who cut fish will have to wear suitable head cover to avoid
contaminating fish. This does not mean hairnets. It does not apply to
fishermen on boats, with the exception of workers on factory vessels.
ASSERTION: Firemen will have to adopt new uniforms to conform with EC safety
rules.
FACT: From January 1 1993, 'personal protective equipment' must satisfy
common safety requirements under a December 1989 Council directive. This
includes firemen's uniforms and hats. All products marketed after 1993 will
have to include an EC conformity mark.
ASSERTION: EC regulations require Christmas trees to be symmetrical in
shape, with regularly spaced needles.
FACT: Untrue. No EC regulations on standardised Christmas trees. The
Christmas Tree Growing Association of western Europe has, however, drawn up
European specifications to try to aid marketing.
ASSERTION: EC regulations forbid the marketing of a favourite Danish apple,
the Ingrid Marie.
FACT: For the purpose of freedom of movement and consumer protection, EC
apples are classified into two categories - 'small', with a minimum diameter
of 55mm, and 'large' with a diameter exceeding 65mm. In July 1989 the Danish
fruit growers' association classified the Ingrid Marie as 'large'. However,
since half the harvest did not reach the required size, the apples could not
be marketed normally, and had to be sold to the processing industry. There
are two solutions: to introduce a new 'medium-sized' category - which could
increase administration costs - or to reclassify the Ingrid Marie as
'small'.
ASSERTION: The Commission wants to outlaw the dye which gives smoked haddock
its distinctive golden hue.
FACT: Untrue. More than 30 colours are provided for in the Commission's
proposals for a Council directive for colours used for foodstuffs -
including those used for haddock.
ASSERTION: The European parliament wants to stop skiing when snow is not
deep enough.
FACT: The parliament adopted in June 1991 a resolution to preserve the
ecological balance in Alpine areas, proposing restrictions on ski runs where
snow is less than 20 cm deep. The Council has not followed up these
recommendations.
ASSERTION: Britain's Essex coast will face an invasion of cockle fishing
boats this year.
FACT: On January 1, existing UK public health requirements on molluscs were
replaced by new EC requirements. (Directive 91/493/EEC, L 268). This means
that cockles from certain parts of the Thames estuary will no longer have to
be processed in a particular plant in Leigh-on-Sea. But foreign fishing
boats which want to catch UK cockles are still subject to Sea Fisheries
Committees byelaws.
ASSERTION: An EC food hygiene directive will force street vendors and cafes
to close.
FACT: A general food hygiene directive is under discussion in the Community.
The proposal is broadly similar to provisions already in UK law. Detailed
guidance will be left to voluntary codes of industry practice, to be drawn
up in consultation with producers, retailers and consumers.
ASSERTION: Charity shops are banned from selling second-hand toys as a
result of EC toy safety directive.
FACT: According to Directive 88/378/EEC on the Safety of Toys, in force
since January 1 1990, all toys placed on the Community market for the first
time must bear the CE safety mark. This applies to new toys sold in charity
shops - but not to second-hand toys.
ASSERTION: Under new EC legislation, there will be a reversal of 'burden of
proof', meaning that lifeboat teams and mountain accident services could be
sued for negligence by people they try to rescue.
FACT: A proposed directive on liability of suppliers of services intends to
make a provider of services responsible for proving that everything possible
is done to assure safety of the consumer. This covers sea and mountain
rescue services. But proposals make specific reference to the notion of
'legitimate expectation'. So the person rescued cannot in practice hold
rescue services responsible for injuries sustained.
ASSERTION: An EC directive on health rules unfairly discriminates against
French soft cheeses.
FACT: The Council adopted in June 1992 a directive on health rules for
production and marketing of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based
products. It will come into effect on January 1 1994. As far as soft cheeses
are concerned, it will ensure that milk used comes from animals and stocks
which satisfy health and hygiene requirements. Cheeses produced should
comply with specified microbiological criteria (checks for listeria,
salmonella, escherichia coli etc.) Products failing to conform may be
withdrawn.
ASSERTION: The Royal Navy will have to end its tradition of stirring
Christmas pudding mixtures with wooden oars, on account of a new EC hygiene
regulation.
FACT: Untrue. The framework directive on materials in contact with
foodstuffs (89/109/CEE - L40) merely states that such materials should not
'transfer their constituents to foodstuffs in quantities which could
endanger human health or bring about an unacceptable change in the
composition of the foodstuffs'.
ASSERTION: EC regulations are forcing butchers' shops to close.
FACT: Untrue. New rules on handling of fresh meat apply only to
slaughterhouses, processing plants, storage facilities and warehouses, not
to retail premises.
ASSERTION: A draft directive states that Euro-furniture shall not be made of
European oak because it is too knotty. German and Italian varieties will be
favoured because they have fewer knots.
FACT: There is no such draft directive. Two long-standing pieces of
legislation on marketing of certain seeds, such as oak, set up quality
conditions. The UK has complained in the past that not many seeds from
British oaks are recognised as eligible for planting in other EC countries.
ASSERTION: Youngsters will have to give up newspaper delivery rounds if the
EC directive on protection of young people at work is adopted.
FACT: Untrue. Young people in full time education are restricted to 15 hours
a week and three hours a day for light jobs, but will still be able to do
paper rounds. Work must take place outside official school hours. Must
generally be between 6 am and 8 pm - although exceptions are allowed.

FT  19 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Two-way pull on Airways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S flag carrier airline British Airways was one of the most actively
dealt stocks yesterday as negative sentiment continued to exact its toll on
the shares following last week's 'dirty tricks' settlement with Virgin
Airways.
Turnover rose to 4.7m and, at the day's worst, the shares were down 10 1/2
at 260p on fear of further negative revelations over the affair. This was
compounded by concern that BA may have to surrender more lucrative slots to
Virgin following a meeting last night with the UK transport minister. Fears
of an escalation of the conflict with Iraq also weakened the market's
enthusiasm.
However, a feeling that the earlier falls had been overdone later emerged,
boosted by reports that BA would soon announce a revised partnership deal
with USAir, the sixth largest carrier.
This steadied nerves and, together with bargain hunting during the
afternoon, helped the stock to lift off the bottom and close 5 1/2 down at
265p.
Thames deals
Thames Water underperformed a generally unhappy water sector after reports
that the group's directors had sold around 1.2m bonus shares into the
market. The Thames directors were said to have sold the stock at 480p and it
was later placed in the market around 482p. The block accounted for most of
the turnover in Thames Water yesterday, which totalled some 3m shares.
The Thames stock was thought to have been taken with a minimum of fuss. But
there were suggestions that the water sector had seen a good deal of
switching involving the four water stocks in the FT-SE 100. Anglian lost 7
to 476p, North West 6 1/2 to 469p and Severn Trent 6 to 455p. Thames settled
9 off at 484p.
Unilever pleases
Reports of strong earnings at Unilever at the first of a series of planned
meetings with analysts helped to bolster confidence in the shares, which
have underperformed both the food manufacturing sector and the general
market over the past three months.
The shares advanced 11 to 1079p, although in thin turnover of 697,000. The
presentations, held to inform market specialists about Unilever's
fourth-quarter trading pos-ition, are due to continue over the next few
days, with analysts predicting further strengthening on the group's upbeat
message.
Earnings growth in the US, where operating profits declined last quarter,
was reported to have recovered well, while reassurances were given over
market worries about Unilever's exposure to the weakening German economy.
There was also talk of Unilever strengthening its position in a number of
key sectors, with the group privately saying that earnings growth was above
15 per cent on the same period last year.
By coincidence, the Anglo-Dutch group yesterday announced a tie-up with BSN,
the French food company, to market frozen yoghurt on the Continent. Unilever
shares have underperformed the All-Share by around 8 per cent over the last
quarter and the food manufacturing sector has lagged behind the All-Share by
1 per cent.
BCI meetings
Meetings between Blue Circle Industries and several London stockbroking
firms provided the trigger for minor increases in profits estimates by
building analysts. Also, worries about a possible cut in the building
materials group's dividend, due to be announced in mid-April, when it
reports preliminary figures, were generally dispelled.
Specialists said Cazenove, BCI's own broker, had met the company and edged
its current profits forecast higher, from around Pounds 78m to Pounds 84m,
although this was not confirmed.
The upgrade was described as largely cosmetic and made because the proceeds
of the recent disposal by the group of its ATCO lawnmower business will be
taken above the line on the profit and loss account. 'The rise in the shares
reflects prospects for 1993 and the dividend,' said one analyst.
BCI shares closed 12 higher at 208p after heavy turnover of 4.9m. The shares
fell away to 124p last October, the lowest level since August 1986, but have
subsequently moved sharply higher, partly because of takeover speculation.
Composite insurers provided two firm features in General Accident, boosted
by a Hoare Govett recommendation and 14 higher at 574p, and Commercial
Union, where UBS was believed to be recommending a switch from Prudential
into CU.
A move by glass manufacturer Pilkington to increase its float glass prices
by 8 per cent drew a positive response from the market, where Pilkington
shares were hoisted 4 to 111p. Turnover was a good 3.2m shares.
The price rise is the third by Pilkington since the winter of 1991. The
previous two failed to stick. The news immediately impacted on Heywood
Williams, the glass distributor, whose shares raced up 12 to 204p on hopes
of improved merchanting margins.
Housebuilder Tay Homes shocked the market by announcing a profits warning,
the shares losing 17 at 151p, after 146p.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo Holdings rose 12 1/2 to 728p after recent falls
and a rebound on Friday in US drug shares. The stock shrugged off reports
from the Netherlands that Glaxo's new migraine treatment might be linked
with heart attacks as well as harmless chest pains.
Second-line pharmaceutical stocks, featured as a buy opportunity last week
by one analyst, also performed well. Amersham gained 5 to 679p and London
International improved 5 to 269p xd. The sector was hit in the new year as a
number of investors moved away from stocks perceived as recession proof.
Recently merged television company Yorkshire/Tyne Tees jumped 14 to 136p
ahead of today's full-year results. The company is expected to announce
profits of about Pounds 20m.
There was very vague talk that Carlton Communications might link up with
London Weekend Television. Carlton, which has been recommended by analysts
for fundamental reasons, gained 10 at 813p. LWT preference shares put on 5
at 300p.
Belief that Resort Hotels will hold its dividend tomorrow, together with a
broker's buy note, helped the shares improve 3 to 42p.
Bass remained friendless, with the pall of sell notes from Kleinwort Benson
and NatWest Securities continuing to cover the stock. There are also worries
over the annual meeting statement due this week. The shares closed 11
cheaper at 588p.
Vague bid talk was heard in Cadbury-Schweppes after last week's Hanson
rumours, but the shares failed to react, closing a penny firmer at 460p.
Hopes of good interims this week from Park Food lifted the shares 6 to 221p.
Dixons was weak in early trading after weekend press reports over the
quality of its earnings, but the shares later rallied to close 1 1/2 ahead
at 227p xd.
The market appeared to discount suggestions that aero-engine maker
Rolls-Royce would cut the dividend in March when it reports full 1992 year
figures. The shares rose 5 to 112p in trade of 3.1m.
Confirmation that Charter Consolidated is planning to sell its 38.4 per cent
stake in Johnson Matthey lifted the former and depressed the latter. Shares
in Charter rose 15 to 663p, while those of Johnson Matthey gave up 19 to
494p. Several possible buyers were named, including German car group
Volkswagen, but the favourite appeared to be American Barrick, the Canadian
gold producer.
Chemicals group Courtaulds slid 11 to 558p on muted market talk of a profits
downgrade.
Industrial gases specialist BOC Group improved 3 to 746p, with Hoare Govett
highlighting the stock in its weekly sector review. The group also announced
the appointment of a new deputy chairman.

FT  19 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares drift down in lacklustre trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING all but ground to a halt yesterday afternoon as the London stock
market turned its attention from the uncertain economic scene to the
heightening tensions in the Middle East. Although shares rallied after
giving ground when Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, said
inflation in Germany was still 'unacceptably high', news of a fresh allied
air strike against Iraq unsettled the market in the second half of the
session. With Wall Street activity reduced by the Martin Luther King
holiday, London closed on a lacklustre note.
Firmness in sterling gave some support at first to hopes that the next cut
in UK base rates will not be too long delayed, in spite of a warning from Mr
Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, that the government faces
difficulties in keeping inflation under control. But optimism was finally
discouraged yesterday by Mr Tietmeyer's comments, which undermined hopes
that the Bundesbank might this week lead the way to lower interest rates
across Europe.
The FT-SE Index closed 2 points lower on the day at 2,763.1, having failed
to sustain an early gain of 10 points as investors hoped that the new
trading account which opened yesterday would bring some recovery from the
setback of the previous week.
In the absence of support from the investment funds, share prices moved
narrowly throughout the session. The more revealing image of the trading
session came from the day's Seaq volume total of only 488m shares, the
lowest daily figure since the turn of the year. On Friday 616.5m shares were
traded, and retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.19bn, well up
to recent daily averages.
US dollar weakness, in spite of warlike developments in the Middle East,
took the heart out of the international blue chips. Leading oil issues
suffered from the subdued trading pattern on Wall Street.
Traders believed that the London market was still restrained by fears of
rights issues from leading UK companies, and also by concern over the
outlook for the government bond market as the City awaited details of the
impending funding moves.
The current setback in equities was ascribed to the unexpected commitment of
investment funds to UK stocks during the Christmas period. At that time,
share prices rose strongly, with gains often exaggerated by lack of stock on
traders' books, and are proving highly vulnerable now that the institutions
have backed away again.
Today is expected to bring the first comprehensive details of the Christmas
selling season at the leading UK retail stores. Hints of higher retail sales
volumes in the final days of December, which traditionally provide the
lion's share of sales and annual profits for the retailers, underpinned the
stock market's Christmas gains.
The warnings on inflation, both from the UK chancellor and the Bundesbank
vice-president, have also damped down the enthusiasm shown on the London
stock market during the final months of last year. Hopes for a further
reduction in UK base rates, probably to 6 per cent, have now been postponed
until the spring and, according to some analysts, will be incorporated in
the chancellor's Budget measures.

FT  19 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED tension in the Middle East, along with continuing worries over the
UK economy, led to a lack of activity in the derivatives sector, writes Joel
Kibazo.
On the Liffe, trading in the March contract on the FT-SE Index opened at
2,789 and demand from several US houses soon sent it to 2,794.
The positive mood faded as fears of further activity in the Gulf emerged and
the gilts market performed poorly. By 11.30am, the contract had fallen to
2,766. March drifted for the next few hours before talk of a cut in interest
rates led to renewed buying.
This was curtailed by con-firmation of an attack in the Middle East as the
early buyers used the unease over the news to turn sellers.
March closed at 2,769, down 16 from its previous close and 3 points below
its estimated fair value premium to cash, which yesterday fell to 9.
Turnover was a poor 4,981 contracts, just over half Friday's total.
Traded options were equally dull and turnover reached a meagre 17,541 lots.
Some 4,759 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, while the Euro
FT-SE 100 option only traded 626 lots.
Lonrho was the most actively dealt stock option with a day's total of 1,842
lots. This was followed by Hillsdown at 1,720 and then by British Airways at
985, with the January 280 puts the most busy series.

FT  19 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow steady amid worries on
Iraq raid
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
IN SPITE OF the Gulf crisis, US share prices ended mostly unchanged
yesterday in trading that was quieter than usual because of the Martin
Luther King Day holiday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.79 at 3,274.91. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.31 off at 436.84, while the Nasdaq composite
was 0.98 firmer at 698.13. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled a
modest 197m shares.
The market opened in a cautious mood with investors and dealers unsettled by
the latest attack by US and allied forces on strategic military targets in
Iraq. The renewal of hostilities has upset the market, which had thought
that late January would be a period for concentrating on fourth-quarter
corporate results and a relatively smooth handover of power between the
outgoing Republican and incoming Democratic administrations.
BankAmerica moved ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 49 1/2 on reports that the
West Coast banking group was close to selling as much as Dollars 2bn in bad
real estate loans and properties to Morgan Stanley Realty Fund. The news,
regarded as an indication that conditions in the depressed US property
market may be improving, lifted other bank shares, notably Chase Man-hattan,
up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 30 1/2 , and Citicorp, Dollars  5/8 ahead at
Dollars 23 5/8 .
Xerox dropped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 82 3/4 on news that the document
processing group is shedding its remaining financial services operations
(which will cost Xerox a Dollars 778m after-tax charge in the fourth
quarter) and considering issuing Dollars 500m of new equity.
Tucson Electric Power was the day's most active NYSE stock, firming Dollars
 1/8 to Dollars 2 3/4 in volume of 6.7m shares as investors continued to be
encouraged by last week's completion of a restructuring plan.
Boeing put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 37 1/2 in heavy trading on news that
it had won a Dollars 525m contract to supply 12 new 737 jets to Royal Air
Maroc, a Moroccan carrier.
On the Nasdaq market, Centocor plummeted Dollars 11 1/8 to Dollars 6 5/8 in
volume of 10m shares on news that clinical trials and European sales of the
company's lead product, Centoxin, had been suspended after an unusually high
number of patients died while taking part in research on the drug.
Canada
TORONTO was mixed overall, but weak pipeline and real estate issues exerted
downward pressure on the TSE 300 index, which finished 11 points lower at
3,295.6, although advancing stocks exceeded declines by 315 to 309. Volume
came to 36m shares.
The pipeline sector index fell 1.8 per cent, real estate lost 1.3 per cent
and industrial products declined 1.1 per cent.

SAO PAULO'S Bovespa index rallied from an early afternoon low, but was still
off 1.3 per cent, or 1,164 points, at 87,833 at the close. At worst it was
down some 4 per cent. Brokers said that investors were anxious over the
Brazilian senate's vote today on a long-delayed port bill, which will
propose the privatisation of services and deregulation of the labour market.

FT  19 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German rate cut hopes move
Frankfurt, Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES had another run yesterday at the frequently explored prospect of a
German interest rate cut, Frankfurt rising and Zurich subsiding in
consequence, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw its highest close for nearly four months, the DAX index ending
28.58, or 1.85 per cent higher at 1,573.13, its best since September 21.
Turnover climbed from DM5.2bn to DM6.2bn.
Technical and fundamental reasons were put forward for the rise, in addition
to the initiative by traders who saw the possibility of a short term gain on
the market, both on the interest rate theme and after the improvement in
sentiment delivered by Siemens's better than expected figures last Thursday.
Traders said that there was short-covering after Friday's stock options
expirations and Allianz, frequently volatile in this connection, put on DM63
to DM2,057. Buying was also encouraged by the convincing DAX break through
1,560 and some illiquid stocks - notably the construction group, Hochtief,
up DM55 to DM978 - exaggerated the underlying strength of demand.
Among stocks which appeared on various brokers' buy lists last Friday,
Daimler ended DM13.50 higher at DM564.00, BMW and Volks-wagen keeping it
company with gains of DM10 and DM7.50, to DM499 and DM276 respectively. In
chemicals. Hoechst extended its recent return to relative strength with a
rise of DM8.40 to DM255.80.
PARIS started the week strongly with activity noted in the finance and
construction sectors. The CAC-40 index closed 10.46 ahead at 1,837.54 in
turnover of some FFr2.8bn.
Among the financials, Suez gained FFr9.20 to FFr278.30, Paribas put on
FFr4.30 to FFr394.80 and Societe Generale improved FFr1 to FFr603 as
investors continued to look forward to lower interest rates.
Building stocks were also busy on expectations that infrastructure spending
would be increased this year, a view partly borne out by news that the
government planned to set aside FFr11.5bn for motorway construction in 1993.
Bouygues, which stands to benefit, advanced FFr13 to FFr589.
Alcatel rose FFr6 to FFr657 on news that it had won two contracts totalling
FFr700m for telecommunications in Thailand and Pakistan.
AMSTERDAM featured Daf which fell 15 per cent on weekend reports in the
local press which again highlighted the company's financial difficulties.
The group's shares closed Fl 1.25 lower at Fl 7.05 but off the day's low of
Fl 6.80. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.7 higher at 98.4, helped by a
strong bond market.
The publishing sector built on last week's gains with Wolters Kluwer another
Fl 1.40 ahead at Fl 86.60 and Elsevier up Fl 1.00 at Fl 124.30. Among
financials, ABN Amro and ING both gained 40 cents to Fl 52.70 and Fl 57.60
respectively.
ZURICH succumbed to profit taking in blue chips which left the SMI index
down 16.4 at 2,084.6 with almost half the decline coming in the final 15
minutes of trading.
The consolidation also reflects shifts in investment into other European
bourses, particularly Germany, following the Swiss rally which began in
early December.
Bank stocks slipped with Union Bank down SFr4 to SFr885 and SBC easing SFr6
to SFr313. Concern that Nestle may soon announce a rights issue contributed
to a SFr20 decline to SFr1,070.
MILAN turned in another strong performance on the first day of the new
trading account with investors encouraged by the approval for a referendum
on constitutional reform and further consideration of the new fiscal
incentives for the stock market.
The Comit index rose 6.31 to 484.93 in hefty turnover which proved too much
for the telematic continuous trading board, which ceased to operate an hour
before the official close.
Industrials led the advance with Fiat up by L151 to L4,390 before a further
rally to L4,460 in after-hours trading.
Telecommunications were also firm with Stet adding to Friday's advance. The
shares rose by L8 to L2,028, and L2,120 in after-hours trading.
BRUSSELS saw volatile trading in Arbed which rose to the day's high of
BFr2,140 after breaching the BFr1,900 resistance level before closing up
BFr135 at BFr1,995. The Bel-20 index lost 3.96 to 1,140.59 in turnover of
BFr1.2bn.
COPENHAGEN welcomed reports that a new government would be formed soon and
the KFX index rose 3.66 or 4.8 per cent to 79.63 in turnover of DKr359m.
STOCKHOLM saw strong activity in the banking sector help lift the
Affarsvarlden General index by 6.8 to 933.8 in turnover of SKr678m.
Among the banks, Handelsbanken's A shares gained SKr6.50 to SKr43.50. OSLO
also firmed slightly on stronger oil prices and the composite index finished
1.49 higher at 386.52 in turnover of NKr152.6m.
VIENNA improved with the ATX index closing 7.02 higher at 719.08. Leykam,
the paper manufacturer, rose Sch9 to Sch231 on news late last week that it
had established a joint venture in the Czech republic.
ISTANBUL declined in late trading and the 75-market index closed 68.67 lower
at 4,017.16.

FT  19 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei improves in wake
of government bonds rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RALLY in government bonds boosted the stock futures market, and share
prices closed higher with the support of arbitrage buying, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 101.64 up at 16,617.24 on index-linked buying.
Purchases by public funds supported the index in early trading; it fell
later to a day's low of 16,502.26 on selling by investment trusts, but
registered a high of 16,625.26 just before the close.
Volume decreased to 140m shares from Thursday's 170m. Traders said investors
remained on the sidelines after Friday's national holiday. In spite of the
rise in the Nikkei, other indicators reflected underlying weakness. Declines
outnumbered advances by 486 to 379, with 218 issues unchanged, and the Topix
index of all first section stocks edged down 0.84 to 1,267.07. In London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off 0.11 at 1,032.05.
Reports of the US missile attack on Iraq had little impact on the Tokyo
market. 'Japanese shares will not be affected unless there is drastic
reaction on other overseas markets,' commented an analyst at Nikko
Securities.
Arbitrageurs sought shares as the futures market was buoyed by hopes of
lower interest rates. Yields on the No 145 10-year government bond fell
below 4.4 per cent for the first time since April 1988, as bond market
participants were encouraged by the Ministry of Finance's outright purchase
of bonds.
Large-capital shares were actively traded by institutional investors, who
cross-traded holdings to realise profits. Nippon Steel, the most active
issue of the day, firmed Y2 to Y288, while Mitsubishi Heavy gained Y1 at
Y515.
Video game makers fell on concern over allegations that video games had
caused epileptic seizures among children. Sega Enterprises declined for the
fourth consecutive day, ending Y80 lower at Y9,890, while Nintendo shed Y100
to Y10,400 on the Osaka stock exchange.
Electronics issues were mixed, with Sony up Y70 to Y4,130 and Matsushita
Electric Industrial ahead Y10 at Y1,110 on hopes regarding the expected
economic recovery in the US. Toshiba slipped Y7 to Y607, weighed down by
profit-taking.
Sumitomo Electric Industries put on Y3 at Y808 on short-term buying by
individuals on reports that the company's joint venture had developed a
substance to reproduce hair roots.
In Osaka, the OSE average edged forward 0.52 to 18,052.28 in volume of 53m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC RIM markets were mostly firmer yesterday.
HONG KONG saw late buying of blue chips by overseas institutions which
helped to reverse an early decline. The Hang Seng index ended 10.22 higher
at 5,882.02.
Turnover fell to HKDollars 2.44bn from Friday's HKDollars 3.06bn, with
investors restrained by continuing uncertainties about the Sino-British
dispute over Governor Chris Patten's democratic reform package and US
president-elect Bill Clinton's China policy.
Demand from Chinese companies took Sun Hung Kai Properties 10 cents ahead to
HKDollars 28.80 and Jardine Matheson moved 50 cents higher to HKDollars
46.75.
AUSTRALIA saw a modicum of overseas interest and the All Ordinaries index
appreciated 4.4 to 1,528.8 in turnover of ADollars 276.72m.
A 16 cent rise to ADollars 13.28 by BHP was attributed to reassuring
comments from the Papua New Guinea government about the future of the Kutubu
oil field, in which BHP has a 9.6 per cent stake.
SINGAPORE held mostly steady, but Malaysian stocks traded over the counter
saw choppy early trade after reports that Malaysia's hereditary rulers had
rejected proposed amendments to take away their immunity from the law. Later
it emerged that a compromise was likely to be reached. The Straits Times
Industrial index gained 4.6 at 1,577 in turnover of 88.8ms shares.
KUALA LUMPUR moved erratically before closing on a higher note which saw the
composite index up by 6.88 at 624.37. Multi-Purpose Holdings advanced 23
cents to MDollars 1.83 in active trading after an unconfirmed report that a
Chinese city was to be allowed to hold a weekly lottery.
SEOUL ended slightly firmer as buying, centred on large-capitalisation
shares, outweighed some afternoon profit-taking. The composite index moved
up 1.92 to 693.23 in turnover of Won529.61bn.
MANILA slipped in reaction to news that the government intends to break up
Philippine Long Distance Telephone's monopoly. The composite index declined
5.90 to 1,306.65. PLDT's share price, which ranged from 905 to 890 pesos
most of last week, fell to 870.
BOMBAY rose on sustained buying triggered by a belief that weekend changes
in Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's cabinet would spur India's economic
reforms. The BSE index finished up 60.51 at 2,586.05.

FT  19 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Italy and Spain attract strong interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Measures to boost popular share ownership in Italy and renewed foreign
investment interest in Spain saw these two markets outperform the rest of
Europe last week.
But weakness in Denmark, upset by the resignation of Prime Minister Poul
Schluter over the 'Tamilgate' affair, and Ireland, still fighting pressure
to devalue the punt, helped to take the European component of the FT-A World
Indices into negative territory.
Spain has enjoyed a traditionally good start to the year, with hopes of an
easing in interest rates throughout the Continent helping to improve
confidence.
Mr Victor Galliano, Spanish analyst at Baring Securities, comments that many
investors are beginning to look to invest outside the hard currency markets
and see Spain as a good opportunity.
Inflation data which came in slightly under expectations year-on-year also
gave a boost to the market, and Mr Galliano believes that the general index
could reach a short term high of 250.
The Italian market began to improve early in the week, ahead of Friday's
decision by the government to allow investors a 27 per cent tax break in
newly quoted companies and the opportunity to swap holdings in government
bonds for privatised shares.
Elsewhere, Hong Kong had a good week with a 5.5 per cent gain. Mr David
Bates, of Asia Equity in London, ascribes this to suggestions that secret
negotiations are being held between Chinese and UK officials to resolve the
conflict over plans for political reforms in the colony. Reports that
Governor Chris Patten has softened some of these proposals has also helped
sentiment, he says.
Among the Latin American markets, Mexico weakened 3.6 per cent in local
currency terms, partly in reaction to Wednesday's allied air attack on Iraq
which caused slight falls among many of the world's markets.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Slight uncertainty on dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR slipped by exactly 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark in European
trading yesterday after Bundesbank officials dashed hopes of another
near-term cut in German interest rates, writes James Blitz.
At the end of last week, the US currency had enjoyed a rally up to DM1.6355,
as some dealers started to think that the Bundesbank could reduce short-term
rates at its council meeting on Thursday. There has been speculation that
the Bundesbank could cut its officially posted ceiling rate, the Lombard, by
up to 50 basis points this week.
However, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's No. 2, helped to quash such
thoughts yesterday, by saying that inflation was well above what was
acceptable over the longer term.
His remarks followed comments from Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief
economist, who said that inflationary dangers had not been averted, in spite
of the weak-ening economy.
The dollar's fall through a key support level of DM1.6200 was probably due
to technical factors, too. The currency has risen 10 pfennigs since December
18, and a retraction was to be expected as dealers took profits. It finished
in London at DM1.6155. In New York the US currency slipped further to end at
DM1.6135.
Mr David Cocker, chief economist of Chemical Bank, believes that the dollar
will go higher, reaching DM1.85 this year. 'The dollar's rise will
accelerate,' he said, 'as interest rate levels come together on a world-wide
basis.' He thinks this convergence is certain to be led by cuts in German
interest rates.
However, Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in
London, believes that the dollar rally could peter out from here. 'We are
into the third week of the year,' he said, 'and the dollar has not made as
much progress as had been expected. A lot of people will review their
scenarios.'
Mr O'Neill is of the view that the US economic upturn is not as strong as
anticipated, and that there is a lingering possibility of another cut in
short-dated US interest rates.
The huge trade budget and deficits in the US also set limits on how much the
US can raise rates. Mr O'Neill believes that, at best, the dollar will go no
higher than DM1.70 this year.
Tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism continued to subside
and, for the first time this year, every ERM currency was within 50 per cent
of divergence from its central rate against the European Currency Unit
(Ecu).
The comments from the Bundesbank weakened the French franc yesterday, and it
closed at FFr3.385 to the D-Mark, more than  1/2 centime down on the day.
Pressures on the Irish punt eased. Irish interbank offered rates were quoted
at between 19 and 22 per cent, compared with Friday's levels of 32 to 40 per
cent.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Money Markets: French rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH RATES in the French markets closed softer yesterday, even though the
Bank of France decided not to alter its officially posted interest rates,
writes James Blitz.
The French franc's good performance against the D-Mark last week had led
some dealers to think that France might reintroduce its five to 10-day
lending window yesterday, and cut the overnight lending rate to below the 12
per cent level.
Lingering bearishness in the Bundesbank may have stopped the French
authorities taking this decision. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank deputy
president, said yesterday that the German inflation rate was still far above
acceptable levels.
However, the French currency appeared to be unaffected by this comment and
continued to hover around the FFr3.38 level to the D-Mark, which is more
than 5 centimes above its floor against the German currency in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
French cash rates consequently softened. Three-month money yesterday
declined from around 11 1/2 per cent to 11 1/4 per cent. French franc
futures also progressed slightly, with the March contract closing 9 basis
points higher on the day at 90.45.
At this level it still assumes that three-month money will be at 9.55 per
cent by the spring, some 180 basis points below yesterday's level.
Helped by Mr Tietmeyer's comments, Euromark futures fell back yesterday,
with the March contract finishing at 92.16, some 7 basis points down on the
day.
Short-dated rates in the sterling cash market were soft yesterday, in spite
of a large shortage of Pounds 1.7bn forecast by the Bank of England at the
start of operations.
However, most of the shortage was removed in the early round, conditions
were easy for most of the day and the overnight lending rate progressively
fell from its opening level of 6 7/8 per cent. Three- month money ended the
day unchanged, fractionally below the base rate figure of 7 per cent.
At the weekend, Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, signalled a cautious
approach to further UK interest rate cuts, and this may have been
responsible for the 6 basis-point retreat in the March short sterling
contract to a close of 93.43.
One dealer suggested that the market had never been expecting a rate cut,
and the only issue of debate now was whether rates would be reduced in the
March budget by 50 or 100 basis points.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Pulling
together for UK agriculture - Renewed drive to capture a greater share of
the domestic market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER management; better budgeting and better marketing; 'these three, but
the greatest of these is better marketing'. Such have been the texts on
which sermons to British farmers have been preached for generations. But the
truth is that most British farmers are far more interested in better
production.
History has conditioned us to derive satisfaction from growing bigger and
better crops and from persuading cows to give more milk and hens to lay more
eggs. The UK has always been in deficit for food; always relied on imports,
first from the empire and more recently also from the European Community.
Indeed at the start of the Second World War Britain produced only 30 per
cent of its food at home.
Today domestic production represents about 55 per cent of total food
requirements - 70 per cent of what could be produced in the British climate.
The improvement is a direct result of government encouragement, over many
years, to expand home production and help the balance of trade.
But there is still a substantial food trade gap - the difference in value
between what is imported and exported, which Food From Britain, the
government-sponsored promotional organisation, has put at more than Pounds
5.5bn. Of that well over half could be produced at home. In recent years, as
the urge to grow more has been modified, the food and drink trade gap has
grown to record the highest ratio of imports of any major economic sector.
And an increasing proportion of those imports have been coming from other
northern European EC countries. In other words they mainly consist of
commodities produced under similar climatic conditions to those of the UK
and could just as easily have been produced here.
The question is why are British consumers buying foreign food?
One of the main reasons is undoubtedly the comparative lack of marketing
expertise and organisation in the UK agricultural sector.
Farmers in competing countries, like Holland, Denmark and France, which have
relied on agricultural exports for many years, were long ago forced to
co-operate to bulk up commodities for overseas sales. Many of these have
since merged to become powerful marketing organisations able to supply UK
retail chains with large quantities of produce to agreed specifications.
As British supermarkets grew to control more than two-thirds of all food
purchases and their buyers became more demanding, individual growers and the
UK's much smaller co-operatives increasingly found themselves losing sales
to the continental producers. It was not that the foreign food was necessary
better nor that it it always cheaper, but it could be supplied in sufficient
bulk to be spread, in identical form, around hundreds of stores. Hence the
growing penetration by EC competitors of the British food market and
widespread concern at the trend, which has extended all the way to the prime
minister's office.
Last week the great and the good of the British farming, food processing and
retailing industries gathered at 10 Downing Street for the second time in 15
months to discuss ways of improving opportunities for British food
suppliers. Under the chairmanship of the prime minister they determined,
among other things, to collaborate to try to source more food from UK
producers; to focus Food From Britain's activities on exporting and to
assist farmers and growers to become more market orientated.
Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, accepted Mr John
Major's invitation to chair a small group to follow up the seminar and to
monitor progress.
Farmers will wish him and the top level initiative every success. Moreover,
at least one supermarket group, Safeway, claims to have switched Pounds 41m
worth of purchases from overseas to the UK since the first Downing Street
meeting in November 1991. Safeway further states that 82 per cent of the
food it retails is now sourced in Britain and that there is potential for a
further Pounds 150m worth within three years.
The other retail giants are a little more coy about their achievements and
plans, but it seems probable that they may be moving in the same direction.
They are not philanthropists, however. The pound's devaluation last autumn
has mad it much more expensive for them to import and so, for the time being
at least, commercial interest coincides with patriotism.
Meanwhile the fundamental marketing deficiencies of British agriculture
remain: the lack of organisations big enough to apply real leverage against
the retail giants and a piecemeal approach to promotion and quality
assurance.
Whether it is a realistic objective even to try to build groups to match the
strength of the supermarkets is doubtful. As someone pointed out at a
farming conference a few days ago, to be equal in turnover to Sainsbury
alone it would be necessary to control 20m acres - half the UK.
A potential marketing strategy which has never been fully exploited,
however, might be to promote the real qualities of British food in a
co-ordinated way so that it became natural and automatic for consumers to
buy items that were home produced.
Attempts at this have been made before. Food From Britain, for instance,
launched 'quality certified' British food a few years ago. That was
inadequately focused and did not take off. The NFU came up with its 'Food
From the Countryside' initiative in 1991, but it too has failed to make a
significant impact. And there are dozens of individual commodity schemes
through which producers and retailers are seeking to gain commercial
advantage by advertising some special assurance of quality.
They are all too small, however, to impress the busy housewife and most of
the limited cash available for such schemes is being wasted. What is
required is a strategy to ensure the quality of UK produced food and to
promote it to consumers. Effective UK policing of EC regulations already
means that the quality and safety of British food is equal to or above that
of most competitors, even though this fact is largely unrecognised by the
public. It is high time capital was made from this superiority and all
supermarkets fulfilled their collaborative assurances to the prime minister
and submerged their own-brand marketing ploys on behalf of farmers and the
nation.
They should co-operate to initiate a nationally co-ordinated strategy
involving all those represented at 10 Downing Street last week and many
others. It should establish production criteria acceptable to consumers. It
should set standards for ethical, responsible and safe methods by which food
should be produced. And it should provide a system of verification that the
quality standards being claimed are achieved.
It would not be easy, because of factional interests. But the reward for
attempting it could be a truly integrated British food industry serving the
interests of the government, the farmers and the consumers.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: More Brazilian iron ore deals
agreed

<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the world's leading exporter of iron
ore, has reached an agreement that will cut the price paid by Japanese steel
mills by between 11 and 12 per cent.
Japan is the largest market for the state-owned company's ore production,
accounting for about 19m tonnes of the company's 60.4m tonnes of exports
last year. The price reductions are similar in scale to those contained in
an agreement with German producers announced last week. The company
suggested that they would set the pattern for its prices for the rest of
Europe.
High grade northern sinter material, from the Carajas site, will be supplied
at Dollars 18.15 a tonne and southern sinter at Dollars 16.90 a tonne.
Prices for pellets will be renegotiated under a separate accord. The German
deal included a price reduction for pellets from Dollars 31 to Dollars 28 a
tonne.
CVRD's existing contract with the Japanese mills will remain in effect until
its scheduled expiry in April. A company official said that the early
renegotiation was 'completely atypical'.
The company also revealed that producers in the UK and Italy will enjoy
similar price reductions.

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN-dominated Udokan Mining Company has won a tender to develop the
country's biggest copper deposit but Australia's BHP, the only other
contender in the race, has expressed a desire to co-operate with the winner.
UMC is 45 per cent owned by a Hong Kong businessman, Mr Eddie Wong, with the
remaining shares held by Russia's Arter group and local geological and
privatisation authorities of eastern Siberia's Chita region.
Mr Wong's Chinese connections are said to have helped secure in advance a
25-year contract for UMC to sell 200,000 tonnes of concentrate a year to
China, out of expected annual production of 360,000 tonnes. His stake is
held through a Cyprus-registered vehicle called Chita Minerals Company.
Despite a valiant effort by BHP to put together a proposal with far less
time than its Russian competitor, UMC had been been expected to win for some
time. This was not just because of its promise to start mining in 1997 but
more importantly because it was backed by a group of Russian plants which
proposed to supply most of the equipment for building the mine and
accompanying infrastructure.
A BHP representative was yesterday quoted in a Russian newspaper as saying
his company was interested in playing a role in the project. An adviser to
UMC said it was too early to comment on what this might involve.
Fluor Daniel, the US firm which put together Chile's giant La Escondida
copper mining project, will be the project manager. Allen &amp; Co, the private
New York investment bank, will be raising finance for the Dollars 1bn-plus
project.
Despite the fact that six leading western mining companies dropped out of
the race since it was launched last summer, Goldman Sachs, the US investment
bank which has been advising the government on attracting foreign
investment, argues its organisation of a world-class tender gave Russian
authorities a better deal than had there been no competition at all.
It appears at least to have succeeded in avoiding the shambles of a
pioneering Russian tender for Sakhalin oil reserves, which was badly hit by
political squabbling a year ago but ended with some of the losers joining
the original victors. Since then, a deal with an Australian mining company
for the development of the Sukhoi Log gold deposit, awarded without a
tender, has become the subject of a fierce dispute over whether and on what
terms it should be allowed to go ahead.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coking coal cut of Dollars 2 a
tonne in new contract deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARARD MCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE steel mills have struck their first coking coal contracts for
1993, bringing a Dollars 2 a tonne cut for top quality Australian hard
coking coals.
The settlement, to be announced in Tokyo and Sydney later today, will result
in a new fob price of Dollars 49.30 and set the benchmark for Australian and
Canadian sales throughout Asia. The Dollars 2 cut, rather than the actual
price level itself, will also be required from the mills' US suppliers.
The cut reflects the oversupply of hard coking coal throughout the world and
the poor state of the steel mills' finances. It was made possible by the
recent slide in the Australian dollar from US75 cents a year ago to 68
cents. The US producers, faced with increased costs and no currency benefit,
will be hard pushed to match such a price cut.
Although the price levels in Europe are different for the same coals, the
settlement will probably see the start of European price negotiations in
earnest.
So far the only settlements appear to have been between the Polish state
coal trader, Weglokoks, and its European customers - last Friday British
Steel is believed to have agreed to a cut of about Dollars 2 for its Polish
supplies.
The Australian/Japanese settlement is also expected to open the way to a
fairly swift agreement with Australia's steam coal suppliers.
Steam coal price movements are normally linked with those of semi-soft
coking coals, which have been cut by Dollars 2.50. There are hopes among
suppliers that the cut will be closer to Dollars 2 but a recent accord
between three South African suppliers and Japanese power companies on a
reduction of Dollars 2.45 suggests these hopes will not be fulfilled.
The new South African price of Dollars 30.59 a tonne, while lower than
1992's contract price levels, is well above the spot market throughout
Europe and Asia with business being struck at below Dollars 25 fob in most
markets.
The Greek cement company Heracles has just struck an agreement for spot
South African coal for about Dollars 23.50 a tonne.
Similarly, the 1992 Australian price of Dollars 38.90 a tonne, is more than
Dollars 10 higher than spot settlements into Asian and European markets.

London robusta COFFEE futures were depressed by further heavy speculative
selling in New York yesterday, which traders attributed to technical
factors. The March position in London closed at Dollars 956 a tonne, down
Dollars 19 on the day. COCOA futures were also down, but that was largely a
reflection of sterling's strength against the US dollar and dealers said the
market's mood remained basically 'constructive' after the comfortable
absorption of about 40,000 tonnes of producer sales last week. At the London
Metal Exchange the pound's firmness masked a modest rise in dollar prices
for COPPER. LME NICKEL prices rose smartly from early lows, but the cash
price still closed Dollars 42.50 down at Dollars 5,765 a tonne. Dealers said
some support developed on the dip below Dollars 5,800 a tonne, and prices
continued to advance on short-covering in after hours trading. There was
little reaction in the gold market to news of the renewed allied attacks on
Iraq and the London bullion market price closed just 30 US cents higher at
Dollars 328.15 a troy ounce.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Investors react positively to
Portugal's Y75bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Portugal returned to the international capital markets
yesterday for the first time since late 1988 with a successful Y75bn
(Dollars 595m) five-year Eurobond.
Bankers said the positive reaction to the issue reflected the strength of
investor interest and the careful preparation undertaken by the lead
managers, Daiwa Europe and IBJ International. Although the spread of 75
basis points over comparable Japanese government bonds was less generous
than had been expected, it tightened immediately and ended the day at around
72/73 basis points.
The only reservation expressed was that the issue could become illiquid if
too many bonds end up in the hands of banks looking to swap the assets into
floating rate instruments.
The deal could mark the start of a steady flow of Portuguese borrowing, said
bankers. At the end of last year, Portugal abolished the requirement for
borrowers to place 40 per cent of any funds raised abroad in non-interest
bearing deposits at the central bank. Portuguese borrowers are now free to
borrow lower cost foreign funds.
The republic plans to raise between Dollars 2.5bn and Dollars 3bn in 1993 to
re-establish its position in the international capital markets and pave the
way for borrowing abroad by its corporate sector.
The treasury director, Mr Manuel Pinho, said last week that Portugal has a
budgeted government deficit of around 4 per cent in the next fiscal year and
foreign exchange reserves standing at Dollars 20bn, compared with Dollars
7.5bn three years ago. Portugal's early devaluation within the European
exchange rate mechanism last year helped to avoid a substantial drain on its
reserves, bankers said.
Bankers reported a good level of demand for the latest large Eurosterling
transaction, PowerGen's Pounds 250m, 10-year, 8 7/8 per cent issue through
S. G. Warburg Securities.
Japanese investors like utilities and the 10-year maturity is under-utilised
because of the lack of swap opportunities, they said.
Elsewhere, smaller D-Mark issues continued to emerge. DG Bank said the
DM120m, seven-year, 7 5/8 per cent Eurobond it arranged for the
Amsterdam-based financing arm of the Spar supermarket chain was targeted
mainly at domestic retail investors. Bayerische Vereinsbank added to the
supply of reverse floating rate note issues, with a DM100m, 10-year note
through its Curacao arm. The coupon is 8 1/2 per cent for the first year,
after which it will be set at 13.2 per cent minus six-month Libor.
IMI Bank Luxembourg re-opened the European Investment Bank's recent
seven-year, 12 3/4 per cent Lira issue, increasing the amount to L300bn from
L200bn. The only change in the terms was an increase in the issue price to
reflect generally lower yields and swap spreads in the medium to long-term
area since the original tranche appeared, said IMI.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: BIS report points to
shortening of debt maturity profiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRICTIVE lending policies, including the non-renewal of maturing
long-term loans, continued to characterise banks' credit relations with
countries outside the BIS reporting area in the first half of 1992,
according to a report released today by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS)*.
The report highlights a further shortening of debt maturity profiles, noting
the banks' preference for short-term trade-related credits and the
accumulation of interest arrears.
'The maturity profile of reporting banks' claims continued to shorten in
most instances,' said the BIS. The combination of a preference for
short-term trade-related credits, additional interest arrears, debt sales
and write-offs sent the share of short-term debt (defined as up to and
including one year) to a new record high of nearly 48 per cent of total debt
owed to banks in the first half of 1992.
Short-term claims on Portugal surged to a record 61 per cent of total
international bank lending to Portugal, reflecting persistent short-term
capital inflows after the country's entry into the European exchange rate
mechanism.
A reduction in exposure to Norway was more than accounted for by the cut in
short-term credit lines to banks in distress.
As a result, Norway's maturity profile lengthened and the domestic banking
system's share of the country's external banking debt fell again to an
all-time low of 33 per cent.
The former Soviet Union was the only one of the eastern European countries
whose combined banking debt increased, but the Dollars 2.4bn rise reflected
the accumulation of arrears and the drawdown of existing unused facilities.
The deferral of principal repayments accentuated the shortening of the debt
profile: short-term debt jumped by three percentage points to 20.7 per cent.
The increase in bank claims on Latin America was the biggest half-yearly
rise for eight years, while at the same time a reduction in deposits
outstanding largely reflected the repatriation of flight capital.
The largest new borrowings in Latin America were by Brazil (Dollars 2.2bn),
Argentina (Dollars 1.2bn) and Chile (Dollars 0.9bn), which all saw a
shortening of their maturity profile.
Trade-related credits and, for Brazil and Argentina, the accumulation of
arrears, were mainly responsible for the maturity shift.
China's short-term borrowing fell to 38.5 per cent from 42.5 per cent and
its public sector's share of the debt fell by seven percentage points, to
37.2 per cent.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Daiwa Bank downgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE senior long-term rating of Daiwa Bank was downgraded yesterday from A1
to Aa3 by Moody's Investors Service, the US ratings agency, which referred
to 'uncertainty' over the leading Japanese commercial bank's asset quality.
The downgrading highlights continuing doubts about the health of Japanese
banks, whose non-performing loans and those of their affiliates, have risen
as sharply as property and stock prices have fallen. Moody's said the amount
of Daiwa's lending to the domestic property market 'remains significant in
relation to its comparatively weak core earnings' and the bank could face
further problems if asset prices continue to decline.
Moody's also downgraded the long-term rating of Fujitsu, the Japanese
computer company, from A2 to Aa3, citing concern over its earnings potential
given the softening of demand for mainframe computers.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Tap sales raise record Fl 9bn for 10-year
Dutch paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S higher-yielding government bond markets showed strong gains as
perceived tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism subsided,
sparking hopes of cuts in short-term interest rates.
Among the hard-core European bond markets, the Netherlands outperformed
Germany which was held back by comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the
Bundesbank deputy president, that inflation in Germany is still too high.
THE Dutch bond market saw strong demand from domestic institutions for the
new 7 per cent state bond due 2003, the first 10-year bond to be issued
since last June. Towards the close of trading, the Finance Ministry said tap
sales for the new bond raised a record Fl 8.9bn, the biggest amount raised
in a single day since the ministry introduced tap sales in 1990 to issue
debt.
Dealers initially estimated the ministry was seeking to raise a total of Fl
10bn, but some traders said they believed the amount could be increased
given the strong demand. The price of the tap issue was raised five times,
ending the day up 32 basis points at 99.55 to yield 7.06 per cent.
The strong demand for the bond resulted in a narrowing of the yield spread
between Dutch and German paper by 3 basis points to around 3 1/2 basis
points.
DANISH government bonds rallied yesterday, helped by the combination of
favourable signs on the political front, an opinion poll predicting a 'yes'
vote in the forthcoming referendum on Maastricht and hopes of an easing in
money market rates.
Dealers said a shortage of sellers also pushed up prices and some offers by
the central bank throughout the day were not enough to satisfy demand. The 8
per cent government bond due 2003 closed at 97.00, up from 95 1/4 on Friday.
FUNDING worries continued to plague the UK government bond market, with
long-dated gilts losing nearly half a point.
The Bank of England is due to announce today the details of the gilt auction
scheduled for January 27.
Dealers are expecting the Bank to auction as much as Pounds 3bn of stock,
with the 8 1/2 per cent gilt due 2007 emerging as a likely candidate.
The Liffe gilt future contract fell from 99.28 at the opening to trade at
99.22 by late afternoon. In the cash market, short-dated gilts ended little
changed while long-dated bonds fell, leading to a steepening of the yield
curve. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 119 3/16 to 118 3/4 by
late afternoon.
FRENCH government bonds continued their new year rally, thanks to a
continued recovery in the franc. The 8 1/2 per cent OAT due 2003 ended up
0.38 at 105.03 to yield 7.76 per cent while on the Matif, the Paris futures
exchange, the March bond futures contract closed at 113.64, up 0.20 from
late Friday.
JAPANESE government bond prices rallied to reach their highest levels in
nearly five years, boosted by government purchases of 10-year and 20-year
government bonds in the secondary market.
The yield on the No. 145 10-year benchmark bond fell to 4.345 per cent
yesterday, dipping below 4.4 per cent for the first time since April 1988.
Until now, the government has bought bonds through private placements rather
than in the secondary market.
The Bank of Japan bought Y100bn worth of bonds yesterday on behalf of the
Ministry of Finance's trust fund bureau, which invests public funds such as
postal savings in financial markets. An official at the trust fund bureau
said the move was designed to diversify its investments.
The decision, however, comes at a time when a sharp rise in postal savings
is causing some concern among policy makers. The postal savings system,
which offers higher yields than the country's banks, saw an inflow of some
Y12,300bn, fuelling complaints from the banks.
Meanwhile, a fall in long-term market rates is expected to prompt long-term
credit banks to lower their prime lending rates to corporations, increasing
the amount of funds available to companies.
The Ministry of Finance plans a Y100bn purchase of government bonds every
month.
THE New York Treasury market was closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King
holiday.

<TEXT>
THE Soeryadjaya family yesterday sold over 100m shares in Astra
International, which dominates Indonesia's vehicle sector, to a 19-member
consortium in a deal worth at least Rp1,000bn (Dollars 484m).
In a flurry of trading yesterday, 102.5m Astra shares, 42 per cent of the
company, passed through the market at Rp10,000 a share.
The sale valued the shares at about 30 times estimated 1993 earnings,
compared to the market average of 15 times, and coincided with further bad
news on vehicle sales. Astra yesterday revealed sales down 30 per cent
year-on-year in the 12-months to last November to 101,309 units.
The Soeryadjaya family, founders of Astra and, until last month, its
majority shareholders, still hold an estimated 12.4m shares.
However, the family may be forced to sell these to repay depositors of their
privately-owned, bankrupt Bank Summa, which was ordered into liquidation in
December owing Rp1,600bn.
Details of yesterday's transactions have not been released but brokers
believe the four main purchasers, taking 49m shares, were companies
controlled by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a timber tycoon; Mr Liem Sioe Liong, who
runs the Salim Group; Mr Henry Pribadi, head of the Napan plastics and
petrochemicals group; and Mr Murdaya Po, who runs Berca, a light industry
and electronics group.
Brokers say Bank Danamon, a publicly-listed bank, has taken 5m shares, while
Bank Exim and Bapindo, both state-owned banks, have bought 10m shares each.
State-owned companies now own 27 per cent of Astra.
While yesterday's sale has resolved the company's ownership crisis, brokers
say Astra still faces hard times.
The high sale price, 'increases the likelihood the new owners will
restructure the company, perhaps by selling-off assets,' said one foreign
broker.
The sale was at a premium to Astra shares traded on the regular market which
closed last week at Rp9,000 a share.

prices for the Silicon Valley chipmaker's main products came under pressure,
writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
The net loss for the fourth quarter was Dollars 23.7m, or 66 cents a share,
compared with net income of Dollars 5.9m, or 15 cents, in the fourth quarter
of 1991. For the full year, Cypress posted net losses of Dollars 21m, or 56
cents, compared with net income of Dollars 34.2m, or 85 cents, for 1991.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Go-ahead for Rhone Poulenc share
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE French Finance Ministry last night announced that it would, after all,
go ahead this week all with its 'on-off' sale of 6m Rhone-Poulenc shares at
FFr500 (Dollars 92.59) each.
The size and distribution of the share sale follows exactly what the
ministry announced last year - 2.7m shares to be sold in France, 1.7m
elsewhere abroad, 1m in the US, and the remaining 10 per cent on
preferential terms to Rhone-Poulenc employees.
But last year the ministry never set a price for this sale of 10.6 per cent
of the total equity of the state-controlled Rhone-Poulenc. In early
December, the government said it would not proceed with its planned sale by
February 1 in current conditions as the company's share price was gyrating
downwards, partly because of steadily lower revision of profit forecasts.
Recent stability in the stock market and an improvement in Rhone-Poulenc's
own share performance have now persuaded the government to proceed. In
advance of last night's announcement, Rhone-Poulenc this week revised its
1992 growth forecast for the third time, estimating that last year's
operating profit had risen by 5 to 10 per cent.
This week's sale, and an accompanying enfranchisement of Rhone-Poulenc's
non-voting shares, will bring the state's direct stake in the company from
77.5 per cent to 45 per cent. But indirect state holdings still give it an
ample majority of the equity.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Brother Industries turns in
full-year operating loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BROTHER Industries, the Japanese office equipment and sewing machine maker,
yesterday reported a full-year operating loss of Y1.27bn (Dollars 10.8m),
the first since its listing 31 years ago and a sign of the extreme pressure
on the country's machinery makers.
The company managed to register a pre-tax profit in the year to end-November
of Y1.1bn, down 69 per cent, but said a 2.7 per cent fall in sales to
Y160.8bn was responsible for the turnround from an operating profit of Y481m
in the previous year.
Having announced a restructuring plan last year, under which the product
line is to be trimmed by 30 per cent and 10 per cent of workers are to be
transferred to new ventures, Brother is under pressure to make deeper cuts.
It said yesterday executives' bonuses would be halted, but its real problem
was a shrinking sales base and increasing competition in the office
equipment market, which had been targeted for sales growth.
Sales have now fallen for three consecutive years, and the ambition to rely
increasingly on sales of office equipment and other industrial machinery has
been undermined by the sharp fall in capital spending by Japanese companies.
Brother said domestic sales fell 8.5 per cent over the year, and while
exports to the US increased, there was weaker demand from Europe.
For the current year, sales are expected to decline by a further 2.3 per
cent to Y157bn, while pre-tax profit is forecast to rise 64 per cent to
Y1.8bn.

plants into separate units

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BETHLEHEM Steel, the second-largest US steel manufacturer, announced
yesterday that it was splitting its two large plants into separate business
units in order to make them more financially accountable and to bring them
closer to their customers.
The move is a significant departure for a company which has a reputation as
one of the more conservative of America's integrated steel manufacturers.
It is one of the first initiatives by the company's new chairman, Mr Curtis
Barnette, who was formerly Bethlehem Steel's senior vice-president.
Mr Barnette took over as chairman late last year on the retirement of Mr
Walter Williams.
The new units are based on the company's two flat rolled steel plants at
Burns Harbor, Indiana, and Sparrows Point, Maryland.
The two plants together produce some 7.5m tons of steel a year.
Each plant will now be responsible for its own marketing, operations and
financial performance.
As part of the move, Bethlehem's product marketing operations, which are
currently run from group headquarters in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, will be
split between the two units.
The move will make Bethlehem's structure similar to that of low-cost
mini-mills.
The mini-mills, which make steel from scrap metal, have made substantial
inroads over the past 20 years into markets that were once dominated by the
integrated manufacturers.
Mr Barnette said that 'major benefits of the business unit structure include
improved customer focus, responsiveness, speed of decision-making, employee
commitment and business awareness.
'It places the responsibility for the success of the business in the hands
of those at the division level.'

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: BCE to dispose of SHL shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, is selling its 25.6 per cent
interest in the fast-growing international systems integrator, SHL
Systemhouse for CDollars 83m (USDollars 64.8m)
The 9.7m SHL shares are being sold via a secondary offer underwritten by
Gordon Capital at CDollars 8.55 each. The offer closes on February 10.
SHL was part of the Kinburn hi-tec and packaging group in the mid-1980s.
BCE, then still on a diversification course, invested CDollars 400m in SHL
and Kinburn equity and loans. But Kinburn failed early in the recession and
BCE wrote down its investment by CDollars 224m in 1990.
Early in 1991, it planned to raise its 25 per cent stake up to 60 per cent
and use a revamped SHL as the data processing centre for Bell Canada, its
telephone unit. But the plan ran into opposition and BCE decided to sell.
SHL is now expanding fast in the US and Europe under new management and is
profitable again.
Bell Canada has formed Bell Sygma as a data processing and
telecommunications systems management and service unit. Its own DP
operations are being transferred to Sygma. BCE is concentrating on competing
with Unitel, now 20 per cent owned by AT&amp;T, in the long-distance market and
in building its global telecom business.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHLANDS Gold, the Papua New Guinea mining company, yesterday blamed
falling gold prices and lower sales for an 18.6 per cent cut in net profits
to K21.9m (Dollars 22.5m) for the six months to December 13. Highlands, 65
per cent owned by MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, has a 30 per
cent stake in the Porgera gold mine, which is the focus of a dispute with
the PNG government.
Net profits soared 78 per cent to K51.86m in the year to end-June, following
Porgera's first full year of production, in which output was significantly
higher than expected.
However, confidence in the Porgera project was shaken in November when the
PNG government said it wanted to increase its 10 per cent holding to 30 per
cent.
Highlands and its two joint-venture partners, Placer Pacific and Renison
Goldfields Consolidated, have resisted the government, and are holding
protracted talks on the issue in Port Moresby.
Highlands also holds about 30 exploration licence areas in Papua New Guinea
and it is negotiating with the Indonesian government to explore an area in
northern Sumatra.

GLAXO HOLDINGS, through its main Canadian subsidiary, has put a further
CDollars 30m (USDollars 23.4m) into BioChem Pharma, a Montreal drug research
group, by exercising an option on 3.9m BioChem shares, writes Robert Gibbens
in Montreal.
Glaxo took the option nearly three years ago when it backed BioChem's 3TC
anti-Aids drug with a commitment of CDollars 125m for development.
The exercise price was CDollars 7.80 a share, against BioChem's market price
of around CDollars 20 a share last Friday.
Glaxo now holds 17 per cent of BioChem and has invested a total of CDollars
72m so far in equity and research money.
The agreement between both companies covers BioChem compounds for viral
diseases.

THE Soeryadjaya family yesterday sold over 100m shares in Astra
International, which dominates Indonesia's vehicle sector, to a 19-member
consortium in a deal worth at least Rp1,000bn (Dollars 484m).
In a flurry of trading yesterday, 102.5m Astra shares, 42 per cent of the
company, passed through the market at Rp10,000 a share.
The sale valued the shares at about 30 times estimated 1993 earnings,
compared to the market average of 15 times, and coincided with further bad
news on vehicle sales. Astra yesterday revealed sales down 30 per cent
year-on-year in the 12-months to last November to 101,309 units.
The Soeryadjaya family, founders of Astra and, until last month, its
majority shareholders, still hold an estimated 12.4m shares. They may be
forced, however, to sell this stake to repay depositors of their
privately-owned, bankrupt Bank Summa, which was ordered into liquidation in
December owing Rp1,600bn.
Details of yesterday's transactions have not been released but brokers
believe the four main purchasers, taking 49m shares, were companies
controlled by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a timber tycoon; Mr Liem Sioe Liong, who
runs the Salim Group; Mr Henry Pribadi, head of the Napan plastics and
petrochemicals group; and Mr Murdaya Po, who runs Berca, a light indus-try
and electronics group.
Brokers say Bank Danamon, a publicly-listed bank, has taken 5m shares, while
Bank Exim and Bapindo, both state-owned banks, have bought 10m shares each.
State-owned companies now own 27 per cent of Astra.
While yesterday's sale has resolved the company's ownership crisis, brokers
say Astra still faces hard times.
The high sale price, 'increases the likelihood the new owners will
restructure the company, perhaps by selling-off assets,' said one foreign
broker. The sale was at a premium to Astra shares traded on the regular
market which closed last week at Rp9,000 a share.
Bankers to Astra, which has loans and facilities from foreign banks of more
than Dollars 900m, remained cautious about the ownership change, having
earlier expressed reservations about some of the buyers. Those looking to
Toyota, Astra's principal joint-venture partner, for a lead were
disappointed.
The Soeryadjayas have placed 20m Astra shares in escrow while negotiating
with Toyota for their sale. Toyota had expressed reluctance to buy the
shares until the identity of other new shareholders was confirmed.
A Toyota official said yesterday the company remained undecided as to
whether to buy the shares and is 'still considering . . . whether, or how,
to assist Astra International'.

BROTHER Industries, the Japanese office equipment and sewing machine maker,
yesterday reported a full-year operating loss of Y1.27bn (Dollars 10.8m),
the first since its listing 31 years ago and a sign of the extreme pressure
on the country's machinery makers.
The company managed to register a pre-tax profit in the year to end-November
of Y1.1bn, down 69 per cent, but said a 2.7 per cent fall in sales to
Y160.8bn was responsible for the turnround from an operating profit of Y481m
in the previous year.
Having announced a restructuring plan last year, under which the product
line is to be trimmed by 30 per cent and 10 per cent of workers are to be
transferred to new ventures, Brother is under pressure to make deeper cuts
to bolster profits.
It said yesterday that executives' bonuses would be halted, but the real
problem was the company's shrinking sales base and the increasing
competition in the office equipment market, which had been targeted for
sales growth.
Sales have now fallen for three consecutive years, and the ambition to rely
increasingly on sales of office equipment and other industrial machinery has
been undermined by the sharp fall in capital spending by Japanese companies.
Brother said domestic sales fell 8.5 per cent over the year, and while
exports to the US increased, there was weaker demand from Europe.
Domestic demand for industrial sewing equipment has been hurt by the
mounting pressure on local garment makers, whose sales have fallen because
of the increasing quality of low-cost imports from China.
For the current year, sales are expected to decline by a further 2.3 per
cent to Y157bn, while pre-tax profit is forecast to rise 64 per cent to
Y1.8bn.
Omron, a Japanese manufacturer of control components, is to embark on a
three-year streamlining plan that includes reducing capital investment in
plant and equipment and overall staffing, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
The plan will allow Omron to see group earnings rise even if sales growth is
flat, the company said.
It added that the move would reduce staffing at group companies by 1,500, or
9.4 per cent. The Omron group employs about 16,000.
The company said Omron also planned to cut capital investment at group
companies by 33 per cent to Y10bn a year from Y15bn annually.

REYNOLDS Metals, the diversified aluminium producer based in Richmond,
Virginia, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 152.1m, or
Dollars 2.55 per share, and a full-year deficit of Dollars 748.8m, or
Dollars 12.56 per share.
The losses reflect previously-announced after-tax charges for environmental
and restructuring costs and for required changes in benefits accounting.
Without the various special items, the company said it would have reported
net income of Dollars 1.29 per share for the year, including 8 cents per
share in the fourth quarter for tax benefits related to Canadian debt
restructuring.
In 1991, the company earned Dollars 23.7m, or 40 cents per share, in the
fourth quarter.
Sales for the 1992 fourth quarter were Dollars 1.35bn, compared with Dollars
1.45bn in the corresponding period of 1991.
Revenues for the full year were Dollars 5.66bn, compared with Dollars 5.78bn
a year earlier.
Mr Richard Holder, chairman, said continuing world oversupply of aluminum
and depressed prices led him to expect another loss in the first quarter and
'gradual improvement thereafter'.

<TEXT>
PRIMERICA, the diversified US financial services group, yesterday announced
a 16 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 153.3m, in spite
of a decline in brokerage earnings.
The strong final quarter took Primerica's full-year 1992 profits to Dollars
593m, a 24 per cent improvement on the Dollars 478.8m earned in 1991.
A net gain of Dollars 68m from the sale of securities holdings and other
assets, combined with lower debt costs and solid increases in profits at
Primerica's consumer finance and insurance services divisions, helped to
offset the drop in net income at the group's Smith Barney stockbroking unit.
Smith Barney reported a profit of Dollars 38.2m in the final quarter, down
from Dollars 49.8m a year earlier.
The decline in earnings was attributed to lower trading revenues, the result
of market conditions that were less favourable than in the fourth quarter of
1991, which was a particularly strong period for US equity markets.
Although profits tailed off in the final quarter, Smith Barney still
produced record earnings of Dollars 170.1m for the full year, well up on the
previous high of Dollars 152.4m reported in 1991.
Large increases in broking, investment banking and asset management revenues
were behind the record performance.
Elsewhere in the Primerica group, earnings were higher than a year ago.
Consumer finance services recorded net income of Dollars 51.3m in the fourth
quarter, up 13 per cent on the same period a year earlier and once again the
result of cost containment measures and lower loan loss provisions.
Full-year earnings at consumer finance services reached Dollars 193.5m, up
from Dollars 175m in 1991.
Profits from insurance services in the fourth quarter rose 19 per cent to
Dollars 46.8m, taking the division's annual profits to Dollars 187.3m,
compared with Dollars 174.8m in 1991.
Sales of new life insurance remained flat, but mutual fund sales soared in
the final three months of the year, boosting total sales for the year to
Dollars 1.1bn, up 36 per cent on 1991.
Corporate expenses dropped sharply in the quarter, falling from Dollars
16.8m a year ago to Dollars 6.7m, thanks primarily to low US interest rates,
which reduced the cost of Primerica's debt. Overall, expenses in 1992 fell
51 per cent to Dollars 48.2m.
Primerica also said yesterday it planned to take a charge of about Dollars
15m in the first quarter of this year to cover the costs of adopting new
accounting procedures relating to post-retirement benefits.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal increases
dividend
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of Montreal, which posted the strongest earnings growth among Canada's
six big banks last year, has raised its quarterly dividend and plans a
2-for-1 share split.
BMO announced at its annual meeting yesterday that the quarterly dividend
would rise to 56 cents a share from 53 cents. The increased dividend will be
paid to shareholders of record on February 8.
The share split will be achieved by declaring a 100 per cent stock dividend,
to be paid on March 20 to shareholders of record on March 5.
BMO lifted net earnings by 7.5 per cent to CDollars 640m (USDollars 499m) in
the fiscal year to October 31, compared with an average 50 per cent drop for
the big six. It also posted the second-highest return on shareholders'
equity, of 14 per cent.
Although its loan-loss provisions rose substantially last year, BMO has a
smaller exposure than most of its competitors to Olympia &amp; York and other
troubled property groups.
Except for problems with a western Canadian coal mining company, the bank
said in its latest annual report that 'the rest of our portfolio withstood
economic pressures very well.'
BMO is gradually integrating its services with those of its wholly-owned US
subsidiary, Chicago-based Harris Bankcorp. The two banks have merged their
services to large corporate clients.
BMO's new trust-company subsidiary, officially launched last week, is
expected to draw heavily on Harris's experience in fiduciary services.
PWA's Canadian Airlines International is reinstating 14 of the 32 flight
segments it had suspended from its schedule earlier this month in an effort
to tackle overcapacity.
'We cannot maintain reduced capacity in the double digits when Air Canada
responds with a 3 per cent reduction,' said a Canadian Airlines official.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Repsol to raise Dollars 500m
with share placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPSOL, the Spanish state-controlled energy group, is to raise at least
Dollars 500m through an international issue of shares that will reduce the
government's ownership of the company to less than 50 per cent.
The share placing, which is likely to go ahead within three months, will be
the first of several disposals of state shareholdings scheduled for this
year as the government seeks to reduce its budget deficit by asset sales.
Repsol said yesterday that Lazards was advising in the design of the share
offer and that issue managers would be decided shortly. The placing, aimed
at institutional investors, is likely to be marketed aggressively in the US,
Europe - notably in the UK - and Japan.
In a circular last month inviting bids to lead the placement syndicate,
Repsol indicated it was seeking to raise more than Dollars 500m. At current
market prices - Repsol is trading at Dollars 24 a share, which is close to
its historic high - the conglomerate would be putting some 7 per cent of
itself on the market and the state-held equity in Repsol would fall from
54.5 per cent to 47.5 per cent.
The placement has been made possible by last year's repeal of legislation
that had made majority public ownership of Repsol mandatory.
Similar legislation has been approved that allows public ownership of
Tabacalera, the domestic tobacco producer and distributor in Spain, to drop
below the 50 per cent mark.
Under the framework of the 1993 budget, the Spanish exchequer aims to raise
Dollars 1.3bn through the partial privatisation of state-controlled
companies.
Analysts believe the Repsol placement will be followed by share offerings in
Tabacalera, which is 53 per cent state-owned, and by Endesa, the large
electrical utility, which is 67.5 per cent owned by the state.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Trading in YSL halted amid stake
sale speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the shares in Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion and cosmetics
company, and Elf-Sanofi were suspended yesterday amid speculation that YSL
might be selling a significant share stake to Elf-Sanofi.
Elf-Sanofi, the pharmaceuticals and beauty products arm of the state-owned
Elf-Aquitaine oil group, promised a statement and a press conference early
this afternoon to explain the new development.
Officials at YSL were unavailable yesterday, but their president, Mr Pierre
Berge, has made no secret of his desire to sell up to 15 per cent of the
company.
Mr Berge's openness last autumn about his willingness to sell a significant
stake to a 'true partner' had led to some softening of the company's share
price, and criticism from YSL minority investors.
However, in the past four weeks, YSL's shares have gained nearly a third,
and yesterday's suspension came after a sizeable rise last Friday.
Several months ago, Elf-Sanofi was canvassed as a possible buyer of the
shares jointly-owned by Mr Saint Laurent and Mr Berge, but was said to have
been ruled out because it was unwilling to leave the company's two founders
in management control.
Elf-Sanofi is essentially a pharmaceuticals company, but it has a perfume
and beauty products business centred around its four marques of Roger &amp;
Gallet, Stendhal, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Oscar de la Renta. The
Elf-Aquitaine group is itself a possible candidate for privatisation if
French conservatives win the March parliamentary election.
In the first nine months of last year, Elf-Sanofi recorded a 12.5 per cent
rise in turnover to FFr15.8bn (Dollars 2.85bn), while YSL's predominantly
luxury business has been much harder hit by the economic turndown with
profits falling to just FFr2.6m in the first half of last year on sales of
FFr1.39bn.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Sweden faced with mixed economic
signals - The aftermath of the flotation of the krona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW weeks ago, Sweden's decision to float the krona seemed to thrust a ray
of light into the gloom enveloping the country's corporate sector. Since
then, the mood has been tempered by the realisation that 1993 is still going
to be an awful year for the Swedish economy, and that even in 1994 recovery
may be a very slow business.
The signals are nothing if not mixed. And the contrasting announcements
recently from two of Sweden's leading industrial groups are a vivid
illustration of this.
The message from SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, was
that worsening conditions in key European markets would reduce demand for
its products in 1993, forcing a further 2,000 in staff cuts.
In contrast, SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, headed by Mr
Sverker Martin-Loff, upgraded its 1992 results forecast, thanks to currency
factors and the benefits of cost-cutting.
If nothing else, these announcements emphasise the schizophrenia that
characterises corporate Sweden at present. For most of the big international
groups, which dominate the country's business sector, exports and profits
should rise quite sharply this year thanks to the benefits of a devaluation
that has so far seen the Swedish krona fall by around 20 per cent.
However, because demand is likely to be weak in many European countries, and
particularly in Germany, Sweden's largest export market, the benefits will
not be as great as they were in 1982, the last time Sweden devalued, when a
strong international recovery was under way.
At the same time, a weaker currency will do nothing to alleviate the plight
of the thousands of small and medium-sized businesses that depend on the
domestic economy, which in 1993 is likely to be as depressed as it was last
year.
Sweden is heading for its third consecutive year of negative GNP growth this
year, with investment and private consumption set to fall further, and
unemployment still heading upwards.
Thus 1993 will be a year when the performance of exporters such as the car,
engineering and forestry companies, will stand out sharply from other
sectors of business, like banking and construction.
Since devaluation, very few of Sweden's leading exporters are not
competitive, because, in addition to the advantage of a weaker currency,
they have also benefited from rationalisation, low wage increases, and cuts
in employers' social security contributions. One estimate suggests that
Swedish corporate competitiveness this year will improve by more than 15 per
cent as a result.
For pharmaceutical companies like Astra and Kabi Pharmacia (part of
Procordia), which were faring well even before the krona was floated, the
devaluation provides an extra boost. For other groups, such as the car
companies Volvo and Saab, the steel groups SSAB and Avesta Sheffield, and
the forestry companies Stora, MoDo and SCA, it means a return to
competitiveness and in many cases a return to profit after the difficulties
of the past two years, because they are all big net exporters from Sweden.
For a third category, such as SKF and the big white goods manufacturer
Electrolux, the benefits are not so positive because they are not such big
exporters from Sweden and demand in many key markets remains weak.
For a loss-making company like Volvo, prospects have been transformed by the
combination of productivity improvements and currency movements. At its
Torslanda car plant, it now takes 50 hours to produce a car compared with 75
hours last year. The company has estimated that a 13 per cent devaluation of
the krona is worth some SKr2bn in the long term.
In the pulp and paper sector, there has been a similar transformation. Both
MoDo and Stora can expect to be more than SKr1bn (Dollars 137m) a year
better off following the devaluation if the krona stays at its current
level.
These and other export-orientated companies have a big weighting on the
Stockholm stock exchange, which is why Swedish share prices have risen by
nearly 30 per cent since the krona floated.
It also explains why Alfred Berg Fondkommission, the Stockholm-based
securities house, calculated last month that total profits for the top 35
Swedish companies could return to 1991 levels of SKr36bn in 1993 before
advancing further to SKr63bn in 1994, basing its forecast on a 15 per cent
eventual devaluation and a rate of SKr7.50 to the dollar.
The figures would represent a strong recovery from the 1992 level of
SKr7.6bn, although even the 1994 figure only takes the companies back to
where they were in 1989.
By contrast, the outlook for the domestic economy is bleak, not least
because of the crisis in the banking sector.
Many commentators expect credit losses in the banking system to be higher in
1993 than in 1992, and no-one will have been encouraged by last month's
announcement from SE Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, that it might
need support from the state. Such difficulties could tighten the credit
squeeze on the corporate sector considerably.
Meanwhile, construction activity is set to fall further next year, prompting
an increasing number of calls for major infrastructure investment programmes
to help get revival under way.
The best hope for the country's domestically-orientated companies is that
interest rates will come down sharply in 1993. There has been some
relaxation already, although the central bank is expected to keep a
generally tight grip on monetary policy to hold down inflation.
The hope is that a combination of lower interest rates and higher exports
will bring about discernible signs of recovery next year - in time to boost
the re-election hopes of the coalition partners who form the minority
government.
However, the longer term prospects for Sweden's recovery will depend on how
quickly it can cut its rising budget deficit and reduce public expenditure
as part of an overhaul that promotes an enterprise culture.
It will also depend on whether it has learned from the mistakes of the past.
In public, at least, few industrialists were calling openly for a
devaluation before the event, precisely because they feared the long-term
consequences would be negative.
Mr Sten Westerberg, senior partner at Maizels Westerberg, says previous
devaluations have proved wasted opportunities for Swedish industry, as
eventual overheating and cost inflation have eroded the initial benefits.
The same mistakes will not necessarily be repeated this time, as inflation
pressures are much lower in a depressed international business climate. But
there are many who still fear that they will recur and that Sweden will once
again find it is uncompetitive later in the decade.

FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Philips' lighting division back
in the black in North America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EINDHOVEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, said yesterday that its lighting
division managed to make an operating profit in North America in 1992 for
the first time since 1984
Mr Einar Kloster, president of Philips Lighting, also said that the company
had 'caught up' with the competition in new lighting products such as
halogen lamps after falling behind by about two years at the beginning of
the 1990s.
Mr Kloster declined to give further details of the lighting division's 1992
results ahead of the scheduled release of group results March 4. Philips has
been involved in a reorganisation in the US after acquiring Westinghouse's
light bulb factories in 1983.
He predicted that 1993 would prove to be a 'very tough' year for lighting.
Philips' lighting business put in a strong performance in 1992, resuming its
traditional role of 'cash cow' after faltering briefly in 1990. In the first
nine months of 1992, the division posted a 63 per cent increase in operating
profit to Fl 602m (Dollars 325m) which helped to compensate for part of the
downturn in the group's key consumer electronics business.
Mr Kloster described the world lighting market as stable, with Philips,
General Electric of the US and Osram, a subsidiary of Siemens of Germany,
holding roughly equal shares of the market for conventional light bulbs.
Mr Kloster said Philips must use the 'window' opened by its competitors'
efforts to digest recent acquisitions to concentrate on becoming a low-cost
producer. The Dutch company's aim is to equip its European factories to
produce at least 200m light bulbs a year.
It has already announced plans to close its light bulb factory in Dijon,
France, and redistribute this capacity among the group's five other European
plants.

<TEXT>
LILLEY Construction, Scotland, part of Lilley, the troubled UK contracting
and construction group, was yesterday acquired by the Lonrho subsidiary
Sunley Turriff. The amount of the deal was not disclosed.
The group asked to be put into receivership earlier this month after a
financial rescue package failed to obtain the unanimous support of its
bankers.
The Glasgow-based group, which employs 2,800 people, faced difficult
conditions in its core construction activities and had been over-exposed to
property development.
Mr Ken McClelland, managing director of Lilley Construction, Scotland, said
the workforce would have to be reduced by about 25 per cent to 350.
Before receivership orders in hand and in prospect had been worth about
Pounds 20m and he expected that about 60 per cent of this business would be
retained. Turnover this year is expected to be about Pounds 40m.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lazard to manage Crown funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROWN FINANCIAL Services said yesterday that Lazard Investors would become
the fund manager for its Pounds 680m in assets because it had decided that
it was not able to offer customers the quality of performance they required.
The move comes at a time of rising pressure for consolidation in the fund
management industry as firms struggle to build sufficient 'critical mass' to
offer services profitably. Charges for existing clients are based on a
percentage of funds under management and managers must either pare costs or
increase the size of their portfolio in order to improve profitability.
'Our performance had been hurting a bit, but with a portfolio of only Pounds
700m, we just couldn't afford the quality of fund management necessary,'
said Mr Herb Beiles, managing director at Crown, the UK life, pensions and
unit trust subsidiary of Crown Life of Canada.
Crown had been having difficulty retaining existing clients and attracting
new ones because it could not offer a sufficiently attractive investment
track record or access to investments in overseas markets, he said.
The funds under management are too small to allow the company to hire the
kind of expertise needed to both expand and improve the quality of service.
'We want to provide our sales team with an A-1 product,' Mr Beiles said. 'We
just didn't have the critical mass.' Life insurers need to have at least
Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn under management in order to offer high-quality
investment services, he said. Lazard Investors already manages Pounds 3.2bn
for a range of clients including international pension funds.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tay shares fall 10% on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Tay Homes tumbled by 10 per cent yesterday to 151p after
the company became the latest housebuilder to issue a profits warning.
Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, said that the collapse of the housing market
last autumn meant that group pre-tax profit for the year to June 30 was
unlikely to be as high as had been expected.
Analysts yesterday cut their forecasts from about Pounds 6m to between
Pounds 4m and Pounds 4.5m. This compares with pre-tax profits of Pounds
6.14m last year and Pounds 8.26m in 1990-91.
Mr Spencer said that the group, like other housebuilders, had been hit by
the devaluation of sterling last autumn which had dented the confidence of
would-be buyers.
Tay had been forced to reduce prices in order to maintain unit sales, which
were expected to be similar to the 1,100 achieved in 1991-92. Average prices
had fallen from Pounds 68,000 to Pounds 63,000 during the past 12 months.
Sales, however, had improved sharply during the first three weeks of this
year. 'Visitor levels have been high and sales good. We can only hope that
this is the beginning of the long-awaited housing market recovery,' he said.
Net borrowings at the end of December were Pounds 20.5m, representing 68 per
cent of shareholders' funds.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Inchcape lifts stake in Revasa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the motor and businesses services group, has increased its stake
in Revasa, the Italian insurance broker, through Bain Clarkson, its wholly
owned insurance broking subsidiary.
Bain Clarkson will pay a maximum of Pounds 1.7m, subject to performance, to
lift its stake in Revasa from 10 per cent to 49 per cent.
Bain Clarkson bought its initial 10 per cent shareholding in January last
year.
The Milan-based broker, currently ranked 10th in Italy in revenue terms, is
involved mainly in the property, casualty and construction sectors.
Mr Simon Arnold, chairman of Bain Clarkson, said: 'Italy is an important
market for us. This increased shareholding in Revasa will give us a stronger
position in the country, moving us forward in our strategy to gain
prominence in the major European markets through shareholding arrangements
such as this.'
Bain Clarkson also has operations in Greece, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland
and France, where it recently acquired a 25 per cent stake in CECAR, the
country's third largest broker.
Contrary to a weekend press report, Bain Clarkson's results are understood
to be holding up well, in spite of difficulties in the reinsurance market.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Gestetner sale talks abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GESTETNER Holdings, the office and photographic equipment distributor,
yesterday said the sale of its Vivitar and Hanimex camera distribution
businesses had fallen through.
Concord Camera Corporation of the US and Gestetner jointly called off the
talks after Concord failed to put together the necessary financing.
Mr Andrew Adams, Gestetner projects manager, said talks between the two
groups were continuing and he was still hopeful an agreement could be
reached.
The sale would have further focused Gestetner on its core office equipment
markets after what has been an unhappy diversification into the photographic
supply business.
When the proposed sale was announced last September, Mr Basil Sellers,
Gestetner chairman, said one reason the group was withdrawing was that there
was no follow-on market in camera distribution, as there was in office
supplies.
The deal would have involved the sale of the camera business apart from
Hanimex Australia. In the year to October, the camera business reported
trading profits of Pounds 1.1m on sales of Pounds 81.4m.
The collapse of talks with Concord is unlikely to be seen as particularly
bad news for Gestetner's finances. The Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.3m) cash and
1.3m Concord shares which it would have received in payment would have had
little impact on a balance sheet that appears to be relatively lowly geared
for a distribution company.
But equally, the failed sale will do little to dispel the bid speculation
that has surrounded Gestetner since last year.
Since the Australian group, Chiltern Capital - then called AFP Investments -
took management control of Gestetner in 1986, the revitalised company has
never really fulfilled its early promise.
Hanimex was one the group's first diversifications in 1989 after two
successful years in which cost were cut and its manufacturing culture was
replaced successfully with a more market-driven approach.
Two years ago Ricoh, the Japanese photocopier group, bought a 24 per cent
stake in Gestetner from AFP in a deal that valued Gestetner at about Pounds
500m.
At yesterday's close of 151p, the group is worth barely half that.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation at Ocean to involve 500 job
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Ocean Group rose 15p to 265p yesterday on the announcement by the
freight, environmental and marine services company of changes to reorganise
its management and overhead structure.
Mr Nicholas Barber, chairman, said: 'We, like most other companies at the
moment, are suffering the pain of recession. We're not looking for green
shoots and aren't expecting any for a while.'
The reorganisation will involve nearly 500 redundancies and is expected to
incur one-off costs of about Pounds 8m, which will be taken in the accounts
for the year to December 31 1992.
It follows July's relocation of the head office from central London to
Bracknell and the stripping out of the divisional level of the management
structure.
Mr Barber said that yesterday's move would not have much benefit in the 1993
year, but that in the full 1994 period, he expected the savings would more
than balance the Pounds 8m exceptional costs incurred.
Although some operating locations will be closed in the cost-cutting
exercise, some '90 or more per cent' of the it concerns management level
redundancies.
The head offices in Bracknell and Liverpool will lose about 80 jobs between
them and the balance will go from the regional offices.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GrandMet foresees end to dispute with Brent
Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND METROPOLITAN, the food, drinks and retailing group, expects to settle
by this summer its dispute over a Pounds 50m payment from Brent Walker for
the sale of William Hill, the betting shops chain, a senior company
executive said yesterday.
Mr David Nash, GrandMet's finance director, said the dispute over deferred
payments totalling more than Pounds 50m and Pounds 10m in interest from
Brent Walker should be settled by 'mid year' with the help of an
adjudicating accountant.
Details of the negotiations were disclosed for the first time in GrandMet's
1992 annual report and accounts, which were circulated yesterday.
The report presented the company's results in line with the latest rules
issued by the Accounting Standards Board.
This had the effect of increasing pre-tax profits from Pounds 902m to Pounds
925m in the year to September 30 1992.
The restated 1991 results were more than halved from Pounds 950m to Pounds
448m, principally as a result of FRS 3, the new standard on the profit and
loss account which virtually eliminates extraordinary items.
Most of the restated figures had already been shown in a note to the
company's pre-liminary results released in September, and had little effect
on the share price, which closed unchanged on the day at 420p.
The accounts also show that emoluments excluding pension contributions to
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, rose from Pounds 713,391
to Pounds 770,682.
The value of intangible assets - such as brands - increased on the balance
sheet by Pounds 60m, offset by a reduction of Pounds 32m caused by exchange
adjustments.
There were post-employment provisions of Pounds 113m and performance
guarantees and indemnities to third parties totalling Pounds 183m.
The company said it supported 'in spirit and letter' the recommendations of
the Cadbury committee on corporate governance, and complied with 16 of its
19 guide-lines.

Profits of Soundtracs, the professional audio equipment specialist, fell
from Pounds 545,699 to Pounds 350,385 pre-tax for the 12 months to November

production is exported to North America, the Far East and Europe.
Earnings emerged at 2.45p (3.79p). A final dividend of 1.35p makes a

Along with its results Soundtracs announced its first acquisition since
joining the USM in 1986. It is paying Pounds 300,000 cash for Sussex-based
Spendor Audio Systems.
For the year to April 30 1992 Spendor returned pre-tax profits of Pounds

The board of Aberdeen Petroleum yesterday cast doubt on the value of an

In a letter to shareholders, Aberdeen urged investors not to support the

'There is minimal marketability in the shares of Bellwether,' the board
said. 'In these circumstances, it is not possible to form a view as to the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aberdeen Trust, the investment and unit trust management group, raised
pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.76m in the year to September 30, against Pounds
1.23m struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.36m.
Despite net attributable profits ahead at Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 851,000) and
earnings per share at 1.53p (1.45p), the final dividend is cut from 1.5p to
0.5p making a total of 1.5p (2.5p).
The company said it believed that dividends had previously been maintained
at an unsustainable level and now wished to adopt a long-term policy capable
of producing growth.
It believed that a period of consolidation was appropriate to enable it to
develop investment activities and to maximise operating profits. A
rationalisation programme had been commenced which would significantly
reduce overheads.

WITH SALES sharply higher at Pounds 3.92m, against Pounds 1.11m, pre-tax
profits of British Thornton Holdings, the furniture making and contract
packaging group, moved ahead from Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 301,000 in the six
months to October 31.
However, serious problems arose in the educational and scientific furniture
businesses and significant trading losses were incurred. A number of senior
management changes have been made and steps taken to increase efficiency and
reduce overhead costs.
The result this time was struck after a Pounds 171,000 exceptional charge
being compensation to a former director for loss of office and related
costs.
Earnings per share were 0.2p (0.09p). A special interim dividend of 0.25p
(nil) has already been declared.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Peel rises 8% despite weak property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEEL HOLDINGS, the Rochdale-based property group, reported an 8 per cent
improvement in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.64m to Pounds 1.77m in the
half-year to September 30.
Mr John Whittaker, chairman, said demand for property was weak and rental
income declined. Demand for retail warehousing had, however, remained
strong.
Turnover rose to Pounds 32.2m (Pounds 29.8m). Property sales amounted to
Pounds 26.6m at about book value. Net rental income was Pounds 21.1m which
more than covered interest charges of Pounds 19.7m.
Borrowings stood at Pounds 349m, the bulk of which originated in the group's
Pounds 304m takeover of London Shop in 1988. The interim dividend is held at
1p.
Mr Peter Scott, managing director, said Peel increased its stake in the
Manchester Ship Canal to 75.6 per cent - the second increase since the group
acquired a 68 per cent interest in May 1991 - and would like to acquire the
outstanding share capital, saving the group the costs and complications of
maintaining two separately listed companies.
He said the group had failed to agree a fair value for MSC in past talks
with its minority shareholders. Valuing the company was complicated by its
outstanding planning application for a 1m sq ft shopping centre at
Dumplington, Manchester, likely to be resolved soon.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Carlsberg-Tetley starts trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLSBERG-TETLEY, the Pounds 510m joint venture formed by the merger of the
UK brewing, distribution and wholesaling operations of Allied-Lyons and
Carlsberg, began trading yesterday.
The merger, given the government go-ahead less than two months ago after a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, creates a third force in the UK
brewing industry.
Carlsberg-Tetley, with an output of 6.2m barrels of beer a year from its six
breweries, will have an 18 per cent share of production, rivalling Bass with
23 per cent and Courage with 20 per cent.
The company, with an annual turnover of Pounds 1.1bn and profits of about
Pounds 100m, has a strong portfolio of brands, including Carlsberg Pilsner,
Skol and Castlemaine lagers, each with sales of 1m barrels, and Tetley, the
UK's best-selling ale.
Mr Don Marshall, Carlsberg-Tetley's managing director, said yesterday that
the partnership would also benefit from the combination of distribution
systems. Allied's strength in direct sales to the pub trade in the Midlands
and northern England was complemented by Carlsberg's focus on wholesalers
and other brewers, particularly in London and southern England.
The company is closing seven of its 32 depots with a loss of up to 100 jobs.
No brewery closures are planned. Allied has recently closed its Romford
plant and its smallest brewery at Alloa, which was considered in danger of
closure, will now brew Carlsberg for outlets in Scotland.

Owners Abroad has postponed the extraordinary meeting at which its
shareholders were to vote on a tie-up with Thomas Cook, the travel agency
group, writes Richard Gourlay.
The EGM will now be held on March 22, a week after the closing date of the
hostile bid from Airtours, the rival holiday company.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, welcomed the postponement of Owners
Abroad's EGM.
'Now Owners shareholders can concentrate on what matters,' he said.
'Airtours' offer is significantly higher than the 100p a share at which
Owners are planning their ill-conceived tie-up.'

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Bank to pay Pounds 27m for AMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS Bank yesterday announced that it is to expand its share of the
agricultural finance market to about 15 per cent by acquiring the
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation from a consortium of high street banks.
Lloyds said it would pay Pounds 27m for AMC, which was set up by statute in
1928 to provide loans tied to first mortgages on agricultural, horticultural
and forestry properties. AMC's net asset value in December was Pounds 57m.
Lloyds owns 13.3 per cent of AMC. The other shareholders are the Bank of
England (27.4 per cent), National Westminster Bank (26 per cent), Barclays
(17.3 per cent), Midland (13.3 per cent) and Royal Bank of Scotland (2.7 per
cent).
AMC was deregulated in 1991 following an Act of Parliament in 1987. Although
it made a profit of Pounds 7.8m in the year to last March and expects to
make a similar amount this year, it has traditionally not sought large
profitability.
Mr John Kaye, managing director, said the discounted price compared to asset
value reflected the fact that AMC had a high ratio of loans to capital. AMC
lendings amounted to Pounds 971m in September - about 8 per cent of the
market.
Mr Kaye said AMC anticipated the bank injecting about Pounds 25m of capital
into its new subsidiary. He said AMC had sought a single owner following
deregulation.
Mr John Davies, Lloyds deputy chief executive, said the bank believed AMC
had a 'very sound' business that could be developed more vigorously under
sole ownership.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Cost controls help Aerospace Engineering
rise to Pounds 109,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEROSPACE Engineering, the Swindon-based precision engineering group,
yesterday reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 27,000 to Pounds
109,000 for the half year to October 31. Mr John Davis, chairman, attributed
the improvement to shrewd cash management, cost control and benefits flowing
from the disposal of the loss-making aero engine testing business in July.
The proceeds from that deal enabled the group - which turned in a Pounds
230,000 pre-tax loss in the last financial year - to reduce borrowings by
Pounds 900,000. At October 31 these stood at Pounds 8.28m compared with
Pounds 11m six months earlier.
However, reflecting both the first-half performance and current trading
conditions, the interim dividend is halved to 0.25p. Earnings per share
emerged at 0.19p (0.05p).
Turnover from the continuing aerospace engineering and electronics
divisions, and the newly-formed power and control division, dipped to Pounds
13.2m (Pounds 13.4m) - overall sales for the comparable period of the
previous year amounted to Pounds 15.1m.
Pressure on prices cut operating profits to Pounds 675,000 (Pounds 1.12m),
but interest charges fell to Pounds 545,000 (Pounds 703,000).
Mr Davis said trading conditions were unlikely to improve by the year-end.
However, the aerospace division would benefit from the airline industry's
growing preference for 'one-stop shop' engineering services and resilient
demand for new aircraft.
In addition, the electronics division generated strong interest in its
latest microwave circuitry, vital for the transmission of large amounts of
data in satellite and mobile communication systems.

futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED dealing costs and increased asset allocation activity led to a
growth in trading of equity futures in 1992, according to a new guide
published yesterday.
The guide, from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, is the third in what has become an
annual event. It says increased liquidity has been generated by the growing
use of futures to cover cash positions. Also, more unit trusts have been
dealing in futures to cover positions before investing in the underlying
equity market.
However, it acknowledges that, 'The recent emphasis has focused on asset
allocation switches.'
The guide lists the leading contracts traded on the world's main stock
markets with a detailed breakdown of turnover and contract size.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Measuring up for a water fight - The
argument over Ofwat's price review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'FUNDAMENTALLY arbitrary and flawed' was one of the accusations hurled
yesterday by the water industry at proposals from Ofwat, its regulator.
The latest skirmish is part of the build-up to the crucial Periodic Review
in 1994, when Ofwat will reassess the basis for water bills for the first
time since the 1989 water privatisation, and set future price rises. It
reveals the extent of the differences yet to be resolved between the two
sides over the basis for setting water prices.
The attack is contained in the industry's 50-page response to a consultation
paper from Ofwat in November on the correct definition of the companies'
capital value, a notoriously slippery figure.
Their assets include miles of Victorian sewers and pre-war water mains,
whose value is highly debatable, as well as state-of-the-art treatment
plants, part of a huge industry-wide spending programme which could cost
some Pounds 45bn by the year 2000.
A dry and highly-technical issue, the definition is nevertheless central to
the review: unlike the regulators of the other privatised utilities, Ofwat
is legally obliged to allow companies to earn a 'reasonable' rate of return
on their capital when setting price rises.
The approach favoured by Mr Byatt, Ofwat's director general, in his November
paper is to take the stock market value at flotation in December 1989 as the
value of assets at that point - Pounds 6.1bn at the end of the first day's
trading.
To bring it up to date, he proposes adding on the capital spending since
then. This hybrid system - market value for the old assets, and current
value for the ones bought after 1989 - gives a capital figure of some Pounds
12bn to Pounds 13bn.
Given the pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.5bn made by the industry in the year
to March 1992, it suggests - in rough terms - a pre-tax return on capital of
some 11 per cent.
Ofwat has argued that the attraction of this approach is its simplicity. It
also gives a relatively high figure for return on capital, for which the
water customer should be grateful, as it would allow Ofwat to be tough at
the periodic review.
Mr Byatt has pointed out - in a good illustration of the difficulty of the
definition - that if, instead, he took the cost of building the assets at
today's prices, which several companies suggested, that could lead to a
capital figure as high as Pounds 100bn. If he allowed the companies to earn
the same return on old assets as on new ones, the industry would make 'too
much profit' and the customer would suffer through higher prices.
The water companies have attacked Mr Byatt's arguments on two main points.
Their paper 'questions Ofwat's preference for (stock) market-based
valuations'. Instead, it wants Ofwat to use the government's own 'Indicative
Values', calculated in 1989 on the basis of projected cashflows.
The water industry argues that this is the only measure of value which
treats the 10 large water and sewerage companies which are floated on the
stock market on the same basis as the 33 water-only companies which remain
in private hands.
Its paper argues too that Ofwat's version is guilty of 'circularity': it
defines the value of the assets by the stock market value, but the value
that the market puts on the companies is partly based on its view of how
much profit Mr Byatt will let the assets earn.
City analysts said yesterday that they thought Ofwat would have to consider
the arguments seriously. However, they pointed out that as some of the
indicative values were higher than the stock market values at flotation,
this could help the water companies' arguments for a higher capital figure.
The water companies also attacked Ofwat's proposal to give back to customers
some of the price rises permitted during years of heavy spending to allow
companies to keep interest charges comfortably covered by profits - a
necessary 'cushion' if banks are to agree to lend them money. Ofwat's
argument is that this is an 'advancement' of revenue and should be returned
to the customer once the spending programme has diminished.
The companies have called this 'neither rational nor fair', arguing that it
'could not be implemented in a way which is clear and comprehensible either
to customers or the capital markets'.
Their complaint is that there is no obvious 'benchmark' level of prices by
which to measure the 'advancement' of revenue. The proposal could be
'self-defeating', they warn, because immediately Ofwat selected a benchmark,
bankers would use it to calculate the 'cushion' for their interest payments
instead of using the actual revenue.
This will not be the last tussle between the two sides. Within a few weeks
Ofwat will publish its final consultation paper before the review  - on how
the UK's supply of water can be increased and who should pay for it.
Water companies' finance directors believe an answer to these and other
buried conflicts - including a long-standing disagreement on the cost of
capital - will eventually be hammered out in horse trading during the
review.
But yesterday's report shows that differences between the companies and
their regulator are still considerable and that resolution of the
differences is unlikely to be easy or quick.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Bock succeeds in acquiring 19% of Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier, has become Lonrho's biggest
shareholder with an 18.8 per cent equity stake following completion of the
group's 198.67m share rights issue.
As expected, a little more than 29.1m shares were taken up as a result of
the 3-for-10 issue at 85p per share, representing 14.6 per cent of the
offering.
Included in the acceptances were 27.6m shares taken up by Laerstate, Mr
Bock's private company. These shares were offset against Laerstate's
underwriting commitment for 100m shares.
Mr Bock had already acquired 43.5m shares from Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's
chief executive, giving him a total stake of 143.5m shares.
Mr Bock paid 115p a share, a substantial premium to the current share price,
for half of Mr Rowland's 15 per cent stake. He has the option to buy the
other half after three years, which would take his total holding to 24.8 per
cent.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Photo-Me up 21% to Pounds 10.5m -
Substantial boost from favourable currency movements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S devaluation helped Photo-Me International, the world's largest
photo-booth manufacturer and operator, increase pre-tax profits by 21 per
cent to Pounds 10.5m in the six months to October 31.
Currency movements boosted profits by Pounds 1.3m, compared with a debit of
Pounds 123,000 last time. Sales rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 72m.
The group translated its overseas earnings into sterling at the rate
prevailing at the end of December.
Mr Dan David, chairman, said the worldwide recession showed signs of
recovery and this, together with current operating returns, encouraged
confidence in continued progress during the second half, subject to no
significant exchange rate movements.
Mr David Miller, chief executive, said the best measure of the underlying
performance was the 12 per cent growth in operating profits from Pounds
14.5m to Pounds 16.2m.
Operating profits grew less rapidly than turnover because about Pounds 8m of
sales went to the group's new business, including 'Fun' studios, which allow
customers to be photographed in front of famous backdrops or with
celebrities.
Another new business is the instant printing systems division, which has
2,000 business and invitation card machines worldwide, a quarter of them in
the UK.
Potentially the most lucrative new business provides photos for identity
cards, which are made in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and the
US. Although all the new businesses are profitable, they enjoy much lower
profit margins than the core division.
Mr Miller said that although he continued to be excited by the potential of
putting photos on products such as bank cards and driving licences, these
results showed the group could grow steadily even without such breakthroughs
 -which were largely in the hands of banks and governments.
Since the Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989, the group has put 200 booths into
eastern Europe, Russia and the Baltic states. Mr Miller said there was huge
potential for expansion there, the main constraint being the group's need to
get its returns in hard currency. The group has 14 booths in China, which
produce revenue in Hong Kong dollars.
Mr David said: 'World demand for real identity ensures that the group
continues to expand and we continue to look for realistically priced
international opportunities.'
Earnings per share rose 15 per cent to 10.76p (9.37p). The interim dividend
goes up from 1.3p to 1.4p.
COMMENT
These results were above expectations, and the shares were duly marked up
15p to 349p. Photo-Me emphasised that much of the profits rise was due to
the weaker pound and it is assuming there will be a smaller currency benefit
in the second half. The new businesses are only just profitable, but the
photo-booths keep chugging away impressively. The real bonanza for these
shares would come with greater use of photographs in bank cards, driving
licences and identity cards. Forecast annual profits of Pounds 19.5m put the
shares on a prospective multiple of 17.6, a slight premium. Some
institutions have been put off by the high proportion of stock held by
directors through nominees, but the register has become clearer and the
shares are likely to attract an increasing following.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Unigate in Co-op milk deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIGATE, the dairy, food processing and distribution company, has agreed to
purchase for Pounds 17m some of the milk businesses of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society.
The businesses cover 348 milk rounds in London, the south-east and Cornwall
together with a processing dairy in Penryn, Cornwall, with four depots.
The purchase will add about 1 percentage point to Unigate's share of the
liquid milk market in England and Wales, taking it to just over 13 per cent.
Assets involved are valued at about Pounds 6m and there are 217 employees.
The deal follows a previous in-fill acquisition by Unigate of Sussex Dairies
last August.
Mr Gordon Summerfield, managing director in charge of milk related
activities, said the acquisition was in line with Unigate's strategy of
'buying dairy businesses which fit in with our existing operations'.
He pointed out that said such acquisitions 'allow for greater efficiency
both in processing and distribution'.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Co-drivers needed on rocky road: Consolidation in the
Japanese car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP downturn in the Japanese car market over the past two years is
forcing manufacturers there to contemplate far-reaching changes of strategy,
which could lead to a consolidation of the industry.
Japanese car drivers have been the main beneficiaries of fierce competition
within an industry of 11 producers. The competition has forced Japanese
manufacturers to levels of efficiency and quality which are the envy of
their competitors.
That may be about to change. Japanese manufacturers are increasingly looking
to alliances to help reduce competition and cut costs.
Late last year Honda and Isuzu announced an agreement to sell each other's
vehicles, after Isuzu had said it would withdraw from passenger car
production.
Last week Nissan and Mazda confirmed they were discussing a plan to swap
vehicles to cut development costs. Nissan is likely to suspend production of
some light commercial vehicles and instead sell trucks supplied by Mazda.
Mazda will streamline its range of vans by taking supplies from Nissan.
Toyota and Nissan, the industry's two largest producers, are considering
jointly developing an electric car, which could have long-term implications
for collaboration over product development.
These are the first responses to the downturn in domestic demand since 1990,
which many industry executives believe could mark the start of a period of
much slower growth in a maturing market.
The slowdown comes as most manufacturers are starting to pay for the heavy
investment of the late 1980s. Japanese car producers have traditionally
relied upon expanding sales rather than reducing costs to raise profits.
Mr Jonathon Dobson, an analyst at Jardine Fleming securities, estimates the
Japanese market needs to grow by about 7 per cent for the producers to avoid
their operating profit margins being eroded.
Few believe the market will sustain that growth.
The industry is dividing into two groups: those under pressure and those
under heavy pressure.
A select few appear to be weathering the downturn in reasonable shape.
Toyota, the leading producer with about 41 per cent of the domestic market,
has large cash reserves and a reputation for low-cost volume production.
Mitsubishi Motors has increased its sales, partly thanks to its extensive
but tailored product range which includes leisure vehicles such as the
Pajero. Suzuki sold more cars last year than the year before because it
concentrated on the mini-car segment of the market.
The others - Daihatsu, Isuzu, Mazda, Honda and Nissan - are struggling. Many
in the industry believe that Daihatsu, the mini-carmaker, which has already
retreated from the US market, may be incorporated into its parent Toyota.
Nissan and Mazda are facing acute difficulties. In the late 1980s Mazda
seemed to represent the model new carmaker, with an impressive array of
redesigned products such as the popular MX-5 sports car. It boasts 4,000
permutations of car. Now it is paying for its image.
Sumitomo Bank, which has parachuted a senior executive on to the company's
board, is breathing down Mazda's neck. The carmaker's pre-tax profits in the
first half of the year to the end of March fell 73 per cent to Y3bn (Pounds
15.4m). The depreciation charge for investments such as its Hofu production
plant will rise 30 per cent this year to Y88bn. Its sluggish sales are
spread across five sales channels which share few costs. Its overseas
operations are less developed than the other carmakers.
Mazda, which is a quarter owned by Ford, the US manufacturer, has one of the
smallest production operations in North America which leaves it badly placed
to benefit from an upturn in the US market. It recently cancelled plans for
a separate luxury car sales network in the US. It is also the only Japanese
carmaker to lack a production presence in Europe. Long running talks with
Ford are yet to produce a deal but the company is understood to have
exploratory talks with Citroen of France.
Nissan, which incurred a pre-tax loss of Y14.2bn in the six months to the
end of last September, has been losing market share largely because its
ageing model range is over-extended.
Nissan sells 57 per cent fewer vehicles than Toyota, spread over 29 basic
models, compared with Toyota's 26. The Cedric model comes with thousands of
variations; the Laurel has 86 different steering wheels and 173 types of
steering column. To maintain this range Nissan needs a huge and costly array
of parts and suppliers.
All producers have slowly begun to cut costs.
Investment is being reined in and they have announced plans to standardise
and reduce the numbers of parts they use by up to 45 per cent.
Agreements to share large components are spreading: Mazda is taking diesel
engines from Isuzu. Wage costs are being restrained, partly by the spread of
single-shift working at many plants. As yet, however, no company has dared
cut into the large white-collar overheads in offices and showrooms.
However this cost cutting is unlikely to boost profitability, given the
bruising competition in a declining market. The obvious companion step is to
cut the pace of competition.
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan president, says the agreement with Mazda will cut
development costs but in the long run it could lead the two companies to
reduce the number of competing models on offer.
The next logical step would be to overturn the conventional wisdom of the
late 1980s, which was that product cycles would inevitably shorten as
producers rushed out new models to maintain market share. Stretching the
life of a model could save huge sums in research and development costs.
However until the market leader Toyota signals that it may take such a step,
the other companies will be loath to go it alone for fear that their market
share and profits will fall sharply.
Profits are under pressure in a slow growth market, opportunities for deep
cost cutting are limited by labour practices, and the costs of rapid product
development are rising unabated. The laggards of the industry will have to
start contemplating a more radical consolidation of the industry to allow
them to keep up the pace of the leaders.

FT  19 JAN 93 / BSN and Unilever form joint venture for iced snacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, and BSN,
France's largest food company, have formed a joint venture to develop and
market worldwide a range of new products combining ice cream and yoghurt.
Unilever is the world's largest maker of ice cream, with sales last year of
about Pounds 1.6bn in 30 countries, while BSN is the biggest producer of
yoghurt, with sales of almost FFr24bn (Pounds 2.8bn) last year.
The venture appears intended to exploit growing demand among
health-conscious consumers for new types of frozen desserts and snacks.
Demand is strongest in the US, where sales of products such as frozen
yoghurt have recently increased rapidly. However, the joint venture will
focus initially on France and Spain, where it plans to launch products soon.
Sales will be expanded to other countries later. The two companies said the
worldwide market for the venture's products, described as 'combining the
ideal properties of yoghurt and ice cream', could eventually amount to
hundreds of millions of litres.
Marketing of the products is expected to rely heavily on the companies'
leading brand names. Unilever's ice cream brands include Motta in France,
Frigo in Spain and Wall's in Britain, while BSN's main international yoghurt
brand is Danone.
No figure was given for the initial investment in the joint venture, which
will be equally owned and use existing facilities provided by the two
partners. Based in Paris, it will be headed by a steering committee of three
managers from each company under a rotating chairmanship, while Unilever
will provide operational management.
Mr John Campbell, food industry analyst with County NatWest, said the
venture would probably enjoy reasonable growth potential, though prospects
in Europe were uncertain because the market was still largely undeveloped
there.
BSN has relied increasingly on alliances and partnerships to enter new
markets, such as Italy, China and Japan. However, Unilever has traditionally
preferred to have full control of its businesses. However, the Anglo-Dutch
group recently formed a joint venture with PepsiCo, the US soft drinks and
snacks group, to sell canned iced tea.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Branson says apology from BA 'falls short'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Branson will decide next week whether his Virgin Atlantic Airways
will take any further legal action in the US courts against British Airways.
Virgin said yesterday it had received 'an extremely brief confidential note'
from BA which fell short of the the 'act of good faith' it was seeking from
its larger UK rival to show it had changed its attitude.
Mr Branson, who yesterday met Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary,
is also seeking a commitment from the government to fair competition in the
UK airline industry after the victory in the High Court last week in his
'dirty tricks' libel battle against BA.
The ball was now in BA's court, a Virgin official said yesterday, explaining
that Mr Branson would review next week all options about action, if any, he
intended to take. Virgin's next move would depend on the response of BA. Its
board is understood to have met to analyse the impact of the Virgin affair
which is now under board investigation. A further meeting is expected this
week.
Non-executive directors led by Sir Michael Angus, the president of the
Confederation of British Industry, have expressed determination to establish
the extent of the 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin and to ensure
nothing similar happens again.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, has also said
BA wanted to establish a less confrontational relationship with Virgin.
In his talks with Mr MacGregor yesterday, Mr Branson pressed for the
establishment of a regulatory body to ensure fair competition in the
allocation of take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow airport.
Mr Branson has campaigned for more slots at Heathrow to expand Virgin's
long-distance international services in competition with BA. He now hopes to
use his victory in the courts to press his case.
Virgin officials said yesterday that the airline's expansion plans had been
frozen for the past 18 months because it was unable to secure more peak-time
slots at Heathrow. In turn, Virgin last year put on ice plans to sell a 20
per cent stake in the airline to fund its expansion. The company said these
would only be resurrected if it could secure the slots to expand its
services.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Eagle Star near to settling legal dispute with BBL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAGLE STAR, the general insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, is
understood to be close to settling its long-running litigation with Banque
Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian bank.
News of a possible settlement in the case, which concerns commercial
mortgage indemnity policies on property loans worth Pounds 220m, will
hearten the company after last week's defeat in a legal battle with a
Lloyd's syndicate.
Judge Diamond ruled in the Commercial Court last Thursday that Eagle Star
must pay Dollars 40m (Pounds 25.8m) in potential claims arising from a
reinsurance policy purchased by syndicate 640 in 1973.
In the BBL case, which centres on a disputed valuation of six properties, it
is believed that Eagle Star could pay around Pounds 100m to settle, although
this amount could be reduced following reinsurance recoveries. BBL brought
the case after Eagle Star failed to honour policies taken out on six loans
in 1989.
The settlement move follows the adjournment of the case last Tuesday in the
11th week of the hearing. Eagle Star will seek to expand its case against
the valuers of the six properties.
Losses on commercial and domestic mortgage indemnity policies have
contributed to Eagle Star's recent trading difficulties. Pre-tax losses were
Pounds 394m in 1991, and Pounds 66m in the first nine months of last year.
BAT Industries pumped Pounds 450m into the company to boost its solvency.
Mr Michael Heath, executive director, said Eagle Star would appeal in its
case against syndicate 640. Between 1973 and 1991 it paid out Dollars 25m to
syndicate 640, but in June 1991 refused to make any further payment, arguing
that claims could only be paid on the basis of a 'demonstrable legal
liability'.
Like a number of syndicates and insurance companies, syndicate 640 had
settled many of its claims arising from asbestosis under the terms of the
Wellington agreement, which allows insurers to compromise on and accelerate
claims to asbestosis sufferers. Eagle Star suspended payments following a
legal ruling involving another Lloyd's syndicate.
Eagle Star is also contesting claims from Lloyd's syndicate 727 on similar
grounds, although in this case the dispute has gone to arbitration. Mr Heath
said yesterday that the Lloyd's ruling would have no 'financial impact'.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Patten backs primary school streaming in reform package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL reforms to primary education in England, including streaming of
pupils by ability and an overhaul of teacher training, were announced
yesterday by Mr John Patten, education secretary.
They mark a further stage in the government's assault on 'progressive'
teaching methods and on the university-based 'education establishment' which
it believes fosters them.
Mr Patten is writing to all 19,000 primary schools in England urging them to
'achieve a better match of work to children's needs'.
His 'five-point plan' includes greater use of 'whole class' and
specific-subject teaching, the introduction of streaming by subject where
possible, and grouping of children by ability where not.
Mr Patten's announcement marks the first time that the government has sought
to make streaming at primary level a matter of national policy.
Reforms to teacher training would reduce the proportion of time spent by
students in training colleges. They might involve the transfer of funds from
colleges to schools, which would then contract with colleges for specific
courses.
'There is still much to be done to improve the education offered to pupils,'
Mr Patten said. 'I firmly believe that there must always be adequate room
for the teaching of the basics to a good standard.'
He is urging schools to teach children for the government's recommended
minimum number of hours - 21 for five to seven-year-olds and 23 1/2 for
eight to 11-year-olds - amid concern that a significant minority are
teaching for less.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education spokesman, condemned formal streaming in
primary schools as 'merely a preparation for selection to secondary school'.
She added: 'Constant chopping and changing in line with the latest fanatical
doctrine is creating chaos in our schools.'
The government's action follows reports yesterday from the National
Curriculum Council and the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted).
Mr Patten has accepted the council's proposal for a five-year rolling review
of national curriculum subjects. He is instructing Ofsted to report on the
implementation of the reforms.
Yesterday's reports are a follow-up to an influential discussion paper,
known as the Three Wise Men Report, published in January 1992. It called on
teachers to 'abandon the dogma of recent decades' which had led to
'excessively complex classroom practices and devalued the place of subjects
in the curriculum'.
In similar vein, Mr David Pascall, National Curriculum Council chairman,
yesterday described the curriculum as 'too complex and over-prescriptive'.
He said: 'As a consequence, depth of learning is being sacrificed in pursuit
of breadth and the lack of rigour and challenge is not resulting in the
necessary improvements in standards.'
Professor Stewart Sutherland, chief inspector of schools, said there was
growing concern about an 'overloaded' national curriculum.
Mr Patten's proposals for primary teacher training follow changes to
secondary-level training last year. They limit to one third the proportion
of time students spend in college, obliging them to undergo school-based
training for the rest. The teachers' unions oppose the changes.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Companies lobby for industrial growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALLIANCE of 21 big British companies, including Imperial Chemical
Industries, Marks and Spencer and Rolls-Royce, has emerged as a force within
Whitehall trying to ensure that UK policies encourage manufacturing growth.
Senior managers from the group hold unpublicised quarterly meetings at 10
Downing Street with Mr Gus O'Donnell, Mr John Major's press secretary, at
which they pass on views about economic trends and the action they would
like from the government.
The group, the British Management Data Foundation, is the brainchild of Mr
Anthony Cowgill, a 77-year-old former brigadier, who founded it in 1980.
Other members include Shell UK, Wellcome, Allied-Lyons, ICL, British Gas,
National Power, TI Group and Lucas. British Petroleum, Unilever and British
Aerospace, while not part of the foundation, sometimes send people to
meetings.
News of its activities comes as industry steps up its efforts to win a
bigger voice in Whitehall after years of complaining that government
policies do not value manufacturing highly enough.
In a meeting with Mr O'Donnell in November, the foundation pressed for
long-term efforts to make the civil service more sympathetic towards
manufacturing, as well as for cuts in interest rates. Mr O'Donnell said the
Downing Street gatherings were a 'useful exercise'. Notes from the meetings
were passed to Mr Major.
The group met Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last year
to discuss how to promote industrial innovation.
It has recently started a discussion with Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief
economic adviser, in an effort to build on the Treasury's initiative to
foster better links with industry.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Pounds 200m donation by Sainsbury chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Sainsbury, chairman of supermarket chain J. Sainsbury and one of
Britain's richest men, has given shares in the company worth Pounds 200m to
the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, a grant-making trust which he set up and
has funded since 1967.
The donation, from Mr Sainsbury's personal holding, is believed to be by far
the largest UK charitable contribution by a private individual in recent
times. It was described as 'a staggering sum' by the Charities Aid
Foundation, which monitors charity finances.
The Gatsby Foundation disbursed about Pounds 15m last year, making it
Britain's third largest grant-giving trust measured by spending. Yesterday's
donation of 35.6m J. Sainsbury ordinary shares - roughly 2 per cent of the
company's equity - will increase its capital to about Pounds 500m.
Income from the donation will finance the foundation's existing commitments,
the cost of which exceeded its revenues in recent years. Until now, the
shortfall was made good by periodic contributions by Mr Sainsbury.
The trust, named after F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby - the
tragic tale of an ostentatious American parvenu with a mysterious past -
finances a wide range of activities close to the 52-year-old Mr Sainsbury's
personal interests.
They include management and technical education, African development
programmes, support for disadvantaged children, economic and business
research, healthcare and plant science. The trust is a leading supporter of
the Centre for Business Strategy at the London Business School, where Mr
Sainsbury is chairman of the board of governors.
The trust is the largest of several charitable organisations founded by
members of the Sainsbury family, which have total assets of about Pounds
1bn. Three of Mr Sainsbury's cousins helped finance a new wing for the
National Gallery in the late 1980s.
The Gatsby Foundation says it will retain the shares as an investment. They
currently pay an annual dividend of about Pounds 4m.
The arrangement will help to maintain effective control of the publicly
quoted company by family members, who together control directly and
indirectly about 42 per cent of its shares.
Mr Sainsbury will remain the wealthiest member of the family with a holding
of 312.5m shares after the donation.
J. Sainsbury's shares closed yesterday at 563p, up 1p.

FT  19 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Water companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The water companies' response to Ofwat on how the 1994 regulatory review
should be conducted unsettled the market. Recent performance of the sector
suggests investors are looking for reasons to switch into more cyclical
stocks. But the document is little more than a gentle reminder that the
industry's price limits in the second half of the decade are still
undecided. Like other recent public exchanges with Ian Byatt, the tone is
gentlemanly compared with the bluster between other utilities and
regulators.
It is hardly surprising the industry would prefer its capital base measured
on the complex basis set by government at privatisation. If Mr Byatt opts to
take market capitalisation instead, as he is minded to do, the companies'
current rate of return on capital would look embarrassingly high - perhaps
11 per cent. Under the original government formula the rate of return would
look more modest. The industry is right to point out the flaw in valuing on
the basis of market capitalisation. That figure itself would adjust quickly
to changes in expectation of what the regulator would allow.
The industry is equally right that huge capital investment has to be
financed. Mr Byatt may be tempted, for example, to reduce the companies'
rate of return by restricting profits growth while they press ahead with
capital investment. That would mean sharply higher gearing. Mr Byatt would
doubtless argue that his presence would reassure potential lenders. Given
the short track record of the privatised utilities, banks and bond market
investors may be less certain.

FT  19 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should not take too much heart from the recent slew of
sterling Eurobond issues. Yesterday's issue from PowerGen brings to Pounds
1.5bn the amount raised so far this year. But the range of borrowers and
maturities suggests pockets of demand for sterling bonds rather than the
wave of international buying required to help fund the public sector
borrowing requirement. There has been overseas interest. But with sterling
hovering around DM2.50, the potential for currency gain looks hardly enough
to tempt big money.
The surprise is that more companies have not moved to lock into long-term
rates before the government starts borrowing in earnest this spring. While
short rates are low most are evidently satisfied with floating rate bank
debt. Moving to longer maturities involves higher interest payments. Even
so, companies with a natural requirement for long-term funding - utilities
among them - may yet regret not raising 10-year money at less than 9 per
cent. The danger is not so much that the government will absorb all
available institutional funds - life companies have an appetite for
corporate bonds which yield a little more than gilts. Overseas investors
will be needed to fund the PSBR. They may demand higher yields or a lower
exchange rate before buying more sterling bonds. Any borrowers hanging on
for lower interest rates are running something of a risk.

FT  19 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that Allied-Lyons' joint venture with Carlsberg is finally up and
running, it is worth pausing to consider the implications for the beer
market as a whole. Carlsberg-Tetley is the industry's third force after Bass
and Courage. With this critical mass comes a relatively good fit. Allied is
strong in the on-trade with strength in the midlands and north; Carlsberg is
strong in off-trade in London and the south-east. That should help raise
market share. But how quickly, and, apart from the long-suffering regional
brewers, at whose expense?
Much depends on the rationalisation that must now follow. Closure of seven
depots with a loss of up to 100 jobs can hardly be the end of the story.
There must be more cost-savings both in marketing and in production -
although Allied has already made an independent start with the closure of
its Romford brewery. Without greater efficiency, Carlsberg-Tetley can hardly
expect to take share away from the likes of Bass, at least in the off-trade.
That will take time. The initial impact on Allied's earnings may be small. A
strong third player could eventually hurt Courage which is still wrestling
with a hotch-potch of brands following its deal with Grand Metropolitan.
More intriguing will be the effect on Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle.
The former has suffered from the recession in the south-east but has a new
marketing-orientated chairman in the form of Sir Michael Angus. The latter
boasts efficiency and strong brands, but lacks critical mass and broad
distribution. If Carlsberg-Tetley is right, these are both prerequisites of
success.

FT  19 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Margins of error
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One would not expect Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton to blame supervisory failure
for the bad debt troubles afflicting British banks. Doubtless competition
following the financial liberalisation and technical innovations of the
1980s did play a role, not to mention the government's delay in tightening
policy when the economy began overheating. It all seems so obvious with
hindsight. The Bank of England had worries at the time. It could have given
fuller voice to them.
Bankers are congenitally prone to excess, especially in markets freed of
credit controls. They need constant reminding to price risk correctly. An
under-borrowed customer can quickly become risky if offered credit on terms
too generous to refuse. The worst effects of the asset bubble could have
been avoided if, in assessing creditworthiness, banks had concentrated more
on sustainable cash flow than availability of security. Institutions like
Barclays would now spend less time doubling as property companies.
Of course, the risks would be smaller if policy were more predictable and
stable. Since it is not, bankers must set their prices accordingly. Margins
have not risen much in the 1990s, so they still appear not to have learned
this lesson. Borrowers should not complain about margins, especially those
who shopped around in the good times. They will have got what they paid for
 -lenders who had less natural interest in supporting them when times became
tough. One lesson of the recession is that long-term banking relationships
may be worth paying for.

<TEXT>
It has long been an adman's axiom that if you can't find anything
interesting to say about a client's product, mount a teaser campaign.
Even so, the latest efforts by Coca-Cola and Lowe Howard Bell, its British
advertising agency, to drum up free publicity betray signs of unusual
desperation. Summoned yesterday to a 'major mystery announcement' at St
Martin's Theatre in London, home of the long-running whodunnit 'The
Mousetrap', hacks were treated to a tedious presentation by a top Coke
executive which included a man dressed as Kaiser Bill and a small inflatable
zeppelin.
These, it finally turned out, were the improbable themes of a UK commercial
for Tab Clear, a new colourless diet cola. No figures were available for
sales targets, the ad budget or even Coca-Cola's UK sales last year.
But as it happens, the same product was announced a month ago in the US,
where Tab's once-commanding share of the diet cola market has shrunk to less
than one per cent, and followed the launch of a similar soft drink by
arch-rival Pepsi.
Even as self-important a company as Coke should realise that if a secret is
really worth revealing, it will be faxed around the world in a matter of
hours. If it wants to attract media attention, it had better invent a better
mousetrap next time.

One of the big unknowns of early 1993 is how Barclays Bank will address the
continuing institutional pressure to split the role of chairman and chief
executive. There is even talk of Barclays looking as far afield as the US
for a new ceo.
In the meantime one man to watch is 45-year-old information technology
supremo Joseph De Feo, who has only been with the bank for three years. Big
banks have to get their operating costs down if they are to survive, and De
Feo is the man in the hot seat at Barclays.
He has a lot in common with Gene Lockhart, Midland's ex-technical wizz. Both
are straight-talking Americans who have made their reputations on Wall
Street rather than in UK branch banking. Pride of place in De Feo's office
goes to a huge Louisville Slugger baseball bat and he is not afraid to
describe Barclays property lending binge as 'dumb'.
Unlike Lockhart, who was promoted to the Midland board within a year of
joining, De Feo has not yet made it into Barclays' inner sanctum. He's also
said to earn rather less than the Pounds 725,844 Lockhart commanded at the
peak of his popularity.
However, in much the same way that Lockhart's future was tied closely to
that of his boss, Sir Kit McMahon, De Feo's high flying career also depends
on the star of current Barclays' chairman Andrew Buxton remaining in the
ascendancy.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Observer: Royal rumpus goes global
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the more nervous members of Britain's embattled royal family think the
whole world is agin 'em, they might take comfort from knowing they are not
alone. There seems to be a bit of an outbreak of royal-bashing around the
globe.
Spain's royal household has come under fire following a British TV
documentary in which King Juan Carlos behaved rather frivolously in the eyes
of some courtiers. Meanwhile, the right of Malaysia's sultans to remain
immune from prosecution for any offence, however big or small, is also under
attack.
Malaysia's media have been regaling the public with all sorts of alleged
royal misdeeds, ranging from tales of lavish parties, and prodigious
gambling, to overspending on imported luxury limos and air-conditioned
stables for their finest polo ponies. Indeed, one golf-mad sultan is alleged
to have assaulted, and killed, his caddie in a fit of rage.
However, what seems to have brought matters to a head in Malaysia is the
latest revelation of the sultans' high living - a Pounds 7m boondoggle paid
for out of the public purse.
Its purpose? To decide on the best location for a royal viewing of the moon
 -apparently something of a favourite pastime among the country's sultans.
It's alleged that they used the meeting to get up to other less than courtly
pranks - like locking a senior government official in a kennel and roundly
abusing several others. Now that's Observer's idea of real royal dirty
tricks.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Leading Article: How to target inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDGED BY what the chancellor said over the weekend, lower UK interest rates
are not to be expected in the near future. The justification for such
caution at a time of the barest whispers of recovery was the need to keep
underlying retail price inflation within the target range of 1-4 per cent
established after sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. Is this
either the right goal or the best indicator for policy?
The case for making control over inflation the principal aim of monetary
policy remains strong. This is not just because low inflation is desirable
in itself. It is at least as much because of the costs of instability.
Attempts to lower inflation may create irreversible economic damage. For
this reason, monetary policy must try to keep inflation as stable as
possible, rather than permit the wild swings characteristic of the British
stop-go cycle.
The problem is not with the ultimate aim, but rather with how its
achievement is measured. Overdue reliance on the annual change in the RPI
suffers from several drawbacks. First, it shines its spotlight on what may
turn out to be irrelevant economic history, although the effects of current
monetary policy on future inflation ought to be the main concern. Second,
pursuit of a target for the RPI is likely to prove economically
destabilising, following devaluation. Third, a target for the RPI does not
provide wage bargainers with a reference point as clear as the exchange
rate.
Worrying expectations
What should matter to monetary policy is not past inflation, but
expectations for the future. As it happens, these expectations are worrying.
The Treasury pointed out in last week's Monthly Monetary Report that the gap
between returns on conventional and index-linked gilts is not only 5
percentage points at the long end, but is also 0.2 percentage points up on
the previous month. Investors doubt the government's integrity, a fact that
helps to justify the chancellor's caution.
The RPI will also be affected by the devaluation, now 10 per cent since just
before September 16. Many seem horrified that devaluation may be passed
through into prices. They should not be. A devaluation was needed to
increase the incentive to produce tradable goods and services. It does so by
raising their relative prices. But the most important relative price is that
for labour, which must fall if a devaluation is to work.
Blip in inflation
If the government responds to the needed blip in inflation following
devaluation by tightening monetary policy further, it will destabilise the
real economy. What monetary policy must avoid is a rise in earnings in
response to the higher retail prices. Particularly in the aftermath of
devaluation, the relevant indicators of inflation are pay and earnings, not
the RPI.
Pay and earnings should in fact be a permanent target. The government - or,
better still, an independent Bank of England - should take a leaf out of the
Bundesbank's book, by stressing the link between its monetary policy and
trends in pay. In so doing, it would be targeting not merely one of many
indicators of underlying inflation, but its principal determinant. It would
also avoid policies that bring about largely cosmetic improvements in
underlying inflation by squeezing profits. Above all, it would give
pay-bargainers a clear reference point, something lost when sterling was
devalued.
As it happens, the evidence on pay and earnings, like that on inflationary
expectations, underlines the case for caution. An appropriate target for the
annual increase in earnings might be 2-5 per cent. While pay settlements may
be easing below 4 per cent, earnings were last reported to be rising at an
underlying annual rate of 5 1/2 per cent. Even though the rate has been
declining in recent months, it is still not securely within the desired
range.
The chancellor is right to be cautious, though somewhat lower interest rates
may soon be justified. But he is not so obviously right in how he is
targeting inflation. The country needs a clear link between changes in
monetary policy and in pay, the principal determinant of underlying
inflation. The RPI is not a sensible indicator, particularly after a
devaluation. The chancellor should carry on fighting, but first he must
choose the right targets.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Leading Article: The carrot and the stick
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ESCALATING confrontation between Iraq and the western allies has all the
grim inevitability of a play in which both sides are playing prescripted
roles when neither can be sure of the ending. President Saddam Hussein
constantly tests and taunts the allies' resolve; the US, Britain and France
respond with shows of military force that are designed to punish him but may
serve to bolster his standing at home and in the wider Arab world.
What the allies lack at present is a coherent political strategy to match
their military muscle. This is worrying, for without one they may be
condemned to further escalation almost for its own sake, with the eventual
risk of a serious foreign policy debacle.
It is not that a specific rationale is wanting for the west's individual
actions. The air raids on anti-aircraft missile systems last week and
yesterday are politically justifiable in that they are designed to remove
threats to the implementation of the no-fly zones imposed over the north and
south of the country in defence of Iraq's Kurdish and Shia Moslem
populations. Sunday's cruise missile attack on a nuclear component plant in
the outskirts of Baghdad was defensible as an appropriate response to
Saddam's persistent refusal to give UN inspection teams unconditional access
to military facilities.
But as the attacks, and Saddam's 'cheat and retreat' tactics, continue, it
must be asked: what, overall, is the west trying to achieve? And in what way
do its actions, taken as a whole, bring that goal closer?
Far from clear
If the answer to the first question is Saddam's removal from power, it is
far from clear from official statements in Washington, London and Paris. The
emphasis, rather, is on the more limited tasks of enforcing the terms of the
Gulf war ceasefire and helping to protect Iraqi citizens from their leader's
worst excesses.
This obfuscation is understandable. It would be hard to imagine a strategy
aiming explicitly at the toppling of Saddam securing a consensus in the UN
Security Council, any more than such an objective was a formal aim of the
broad-based coalition that fought the Gulf war two years ago. Even if the
western allies did spell out their desire to remove the Iraqi leader, they
are most unlikely to be able to do the job themselves.
It may be argued, by extension, that further explanation of western strategy
is unnecessary, that measured, ad hoc military strikes are sufficient to
contain the threats posed by Saddam to his neighbours (through invasion or
the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction) and to his own citizens.
The problem with this line of reasoning is that it condemns the allies to a
pace and intensity of action determined by the level of provocation offered
by Saddam. This is doubly true at a time when the leadership of the western
world is in transition. Saddam is watching intently for any sign of
diminished resolve on the part of the incoming US president; the logic of
force almost demands that he step up the pace.
Searching reappraisal
Mr Bill Clinton will have to conduct a searching reappraisal of US Gulf
policy. First, he has no alternative to continuing to seek full Iraqi
compliance with the Gulf ceasefire. Second, he must build on the existing
effort to protect the Kurds and Shias, whose repression is acknowledged as
another source of regional instability, by warning Saddam that western air
power will be used against attempts to interfere with international relief
supplies. Third, he should muster a broader international force to defend
Kuwait's borders, which remain alarmingly vulnerable to Iraqi incursions.
Fourth, and most important, he should attempt to elaborate a political
strategy aimed not at directly toppling the Iraqi leader but at encouraging
Iraqis to do so. Alongside the stick of military action, he should hold out
the carrot of US co-operation provided Iraq adopts a regime that respects
the will of the international community and the dignity and well-being of
its own citizens. In place of the unmitigated despair Iraqis are
experiencing today, he should offer the conditional hope of a lifting of
sanctions. By clearly enunciating such a prospect, he may just make it
possible.

<TEXT>
The idea that President-elect Bill Clinton will escape from the clutches of
foreign policy is piffle. He hopes to devote nearly all his time to US
domestic affairs. He can forget that. When he delivers his inaugural address
tomorrow, the smoke will be rising from bombed-out ruins in Baghdad.
Americans will be twisting arms in Somalia. Bullets fired in Sarajevo will
whistle around the new president's ears. More to the point, the remnants of
the Soviet empire will still be in danger of further collapse into a series
of local wars. Any of the eastern states, including Russia, might fall
victim to a right-wing coup. Their nuclear arsenals are still intact. The US
cannot ignore such threats to its security.
Mr Clinton should know. He is a 'wonk', a swot, a voracious reader. He has
studied the history of his predecessors. Every inaugural speech since the
conclusion of the 1939-45 war has included a promise that Uncle Sam will
continue to act as the world's policeman, or at least as a global
peacemaker. On January 20 1949, President Truman spoke of opposition to a
regime that adhered to a 'false philosophy'. It lasted for 40 years. Mr
Truman announced the establishment of a new defence pact, which, three
months later, became Nato. In January 1953 General Eisenhower was equally
clear. 'To meet the challenge of our time,' he said, 'destiny has laid upon
our country the responsibility of the free world's leadership.'
No one will forget President Kennedy's 'pay any price, bear any burden'
speech of 1961. Four years later President Johnson vowed that 'in concert
with other nations, we shall help men defend their freedom'. It took
President Nixon nearly two terms to extricate the US from the Vietnam war, a
direct consequence of the Kennedy-Johnson dicta. In spite of that
experience, President Carter devoted part of his dovish address of January
1977 to a message 'to you, citizens of the world'. It included an
undertaking that 'the United States will meet its obligation to help create
a stable, just and peaceful world order'.
Mr Carter was unlucky. Iran held US citizens hostage until the day after he
stepped down. In 1981 President Reagan's first speech was focused on the
domestic economy, as Governor Clinton's is expected to be tomorrow. Yet Mr
Reagan warned: 'We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be,
knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of not having to use that
strength.' He has since boasted that that sentiment won him the cold war. He
could be right.
His successor was not so fortunate. After his inauguration on January 20
1989, when he predicted that 'the day of the dictator is over', President
Bush was caught napping by the falls of both Mr Gorbachev and the Communist
party of the Soviet Union. He tried to construct a post-cold war policy,
around the notion of a 'new world order'. Actions were to be legitimised by
the United Nations and supported by American power. He did well in
assembling the coalition that won the first Gulf war. He does not, however,
leave office with a new order in place. In Iraq, the day of the dictator is
demonstrably not over.
Mr Bush's problem - our problem - is that no convincing mechanism for a
global foreign policy or its regional constituent parts exists. Mr Clinton
has acknowledged this. 'We cannot go four more years without a plan to lead
the world,' he says in Putting People First, the book of his campaign. In a
sentence that could easily fit into tomorrow's address he adds: 'The defence
of freedom and the promotion of democracy around the world not only reflect
our deepest values; they serve our national interest.' He does not actually
have a plan, but proposes to ap-point a team to construct one. Yet we have
been invited to believe that the anti-Vietnam war generation, of which Mr
Clinton is the most celebrated product, may dissociate the world's most
powerful republic from its previous international concerns.
The issue is not isolationism. That narrow sentiment is stronger now that
the Soviet threat has disappeared. It will thrive while so many domestic
problems are pressing. It flourishes in recession. But it cannot prevail.
The world will not allow it to do so. What Mr Clinton needs is a structure
that can guide the conduct of US relations with other states. Foreign
ministries knew where they stood when there were two superpowers and a third
world. Nobody knows quite what to think now that those neat divisions have
faded.
What we outsiders will look for in tomorrow's inaugural address is more than
a mere ritual affirmation of America's acceptance of its global reach. We
need to see evidence that Mr Clinton meant what he said when he wrote last
year: 'We must define a new national security policy to build on the victory
of freedom in the cold war.' If he cannot find a single theme, a grouping of
policies for specific areas will do.
For example, the bombing has not yet destroyed Mr Saddam. It can only defeat
or contain Iraq as part of a regional strategy that has been clearly thought
through. There are many questions for the policy wonk. Does Washington see a
long-term threat in a resurgent Iran? Is there to be a pause in the Middle
East peace negotiations, or is the new president not quite so beholden to
the Israeli lobby as was first thought? Is Syria to be trusted? Again,
incremental yet ineffectual measures in former Yugoslavia have not yet
brought peace. The Vance-Owen plan is ingenious, but lasting stability can
only be guaranteed when we have a European-American alliance that is willing
and able to defend the principle that borders are not to be changed by
force. As to Russia, the maintenance of a democratic, pro-market government
in office is of at least as much importance to the US as any single domestic
programme.
Yet Washington can no longer be relied on to support global policies on its
own. It demands participating allies. This is reasonable. I offer these
phrases to the Clinton inaugural address: 'We shall pay part of any price,
share any burden, meet a fair percentage of any hardship . . . in order to
assure the survival and success of liberty.' The new president will have to
pin something like that on his wall. There is no serious alternative.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Flexibility wins friends: Pressure is growing for a
compromise on Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong is daring to hope. Conciliatory comments by both Chinese officials
and Governor Chris Patten have raised expectations that a compromise over
the colony's political development might be achievable.
The stock market - the most visible indicator of the colony's mood - in the
first weeks of the year has recouped much of the losses it sustained in
December, when China suggested it might not honour business contracts in the
colony that span the transfer of sovereignty in 1997.
Mr Allen Lee, leader of Hong Kong's main conservative political grouping,
who this morning will meet Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, says
that the atmosphere in the colony has improved markedly since the beginning
of the year. In today's talks, he will press Mr Major to amend Britain's
proposals for increased democracy in the colony to make them more acceptable
to China.
A more flexible stance by Mr Patten is one of the reasons for the colony's
increased optimism. While maintaining his 'principles' - that arrangements
for the colony's 1994-95 elections have to be fair, open and acceptable to
Hong Kong - he has indicated a greater willingness to consider alternatives
to his plans. Last week he even reminded the members of the Legislative
Council (LegCo), the colony's lawmaking body, that political reforms in the
colony must be acceptable to China.
Beijing, for its part, has restrained its personal attacks on Mr Patten. It
has also adopted a softer tone on political matters. Mr Lu Ping, Beijing's
most senior official involved in Hong Kong affairs, has played down reports
that China would set up a shadow government in Hong Kong if Mr Patten
persisted with his proposals.
But there are also fears that what looks like accommodation on both sides is
simply a change in tactics, designed to make their respective positions more
appealing to an increasingly divided population in Hong Kong.
'What I am afraid of is the continuation of a stalemate - a situation where
Mr Patten introduces his package, pushes it through LegCo, and China decides
to go its own way,' says Mr Lee. 'We cannot afford to live with four years
of China not co-operating with the UK.'
This view, widely held in the colony, is most strongly felt in the business
community. Mr William Fung, managing director of Li &amp; Fung, a trading
company, says: 'When the Basic Law (the mini-constitution, published in 1990
by Beijing, for Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese sovereignty) came out,
people thought it was a broadly acceptable basis for Hong Kong's future.
Why, then, has the governor decided to upset the apple cart?'
Mr Chan Wing Kee, managing director of the Yangtzekiang Garment
Manufacturing Company and chairman of the Hong Kong Exporters Association,
suggests the direction of Mr Patten's reforms is misplaced.
'The 1995 elections are not the most important thing facing us,' he says.
'What is important is the first chief executive (CEO) of the Special
Administrative Region and how he will work for Hong Kong and China. We still
live in a place where who is in charge is more important than the system. If
you push China into a corner, the CEO may not be the best one for Hong
Kong.'
But the 'system' is where the fate of Mr Patten's proposals will be decided.
LegCo will receive the governor's legislation towards the end of next month,
and it will then initiate the process of legislative review by which it is
ratified. The process promises to be protracted.
'The legislation will be scrutinised clause by clause and many amendments
will be made; it will be messy and time consuming,' says Mr Simon Ip, the
legal profession's representative in LegCo.
Mr Ip is one of the increasingly influential group of independent LegCo
members who do not belong either to the main conservative group, headed by
Mr Allen Lee, or to the democrats, headed by Mr Martin Lee, who support Mr
Patten's proposals.
The independents hope that LegCo can produce legislation that manages both
to preserve Mr Patten's democratic intent - a broadening of the franchise -
and to go some way towards answering China's concerns. But achieving both
will be difficult.
China has always regarded Hong Kong's political development as an issue to
be settled between itself and Britain. Beijing has been dismissive of LegCo,
referring to it as only a consultative body.
Moreover, in the current row China has said that its objections to Mr
Patten's proposals are less to do with democracy than with honouring past
Sino-British agreements. It charges Mr Patten with repudiating a 1990
understanding between the UK and China concerning the 1995 LegCo polls.
Mr Patten's proposals, it says, violate the 'spirit' of past agreements in
two ways. According to one proposal, the 'election committee', which will
appoint 10 of the 60 LegCo members in 1995, would consist of 250 popularly
elected local officials. In 1990 Britain gave provisional endorsement to a
body that would have a narrower franchise.
His plans for nine new 'functional' constituencies have also angered China.
The 21 functional representatives in the current LegCo are drawn from and
elected by specific professional and business groups, such as doctors and
lawyers. Mr Patten's nine additional seats would be filled from a broader
constituency, encompassing all workers.
Many LegCo members hope that, if they can amend Mr Patten's political
reforms along the lines of the 1990 'agreements', China may acquiesce. In
particular, support is gathering among independents to preserve the existing
system of functional constituencies and to devise an election committee that
is more consistent with the Basic Law. 'We are all looking for a way out,'
says Mr Vincent Cheng, Hongkong Bank's chief economist and an appointed
legislator.
There is also growing support for an amendment, first suggested by Mr Jimmy
McGregor, an independent democrat, to limit electors to voting for one
member of LegCo. 'If we can implement one man, one vote, then how the new
functional constituencies are drawn up is a secondary issue,' says Mr Cheng.
He points out that, under the current system and the one proposed by Mr
Patten, a single elector, who has a recognised profession and is a company
owner, could have three votes: one for his professional affiliation, one
through his membership of the chamber of commerce, and one for a
geographical constituency.
Such an amendment, which would end Mr Patten's plans for nine democratically
elected functional seats, could please Beijing. But whether the amendments
that emerge from LegCo's negotiations can provide the basis for a compromise
between Mr Patten and China will be clear only after the talking stops.
For now, and not before time, local politicians will be given a greater say
in the process of transition to Chinese rule and the political system which
will follow. Beijing may find it harder to reject their judgments than those
of the final British governor.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Letter: Efficiency greater in the parts than the whole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof LEON HOLLERMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his column (Economic Viewpoint, January 14) Samuel Brittan states
'The US still produces much more per head than its main competitors,
including Japan . . .'
This is true only if you compare the Japanese economy as a whole with the US
economy as a whole. Sector by sector, you get quite different results.
Compare, for example, the efficiency of Japanese agriculture with that of
the US. In manufacturing, however, which is what Samuel Brittan was writing
about, Japan's efficiency is greater than that of the US.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Letter: Abolition of ACT would be to throw out baby with
bathwater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J C BARNSLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your articles ('Government urged to look at ACT issue' and UK company
news, January 12) on the problems that advance corporation tax is causing
for many UK-based companies made some telling points, but might have given a
somewhat misleading impression of the ACT system. It does have good points:
When a company accounts for ACT, on paying a dividend, it also gives its
shareholders an equal tax credit to set against their own personal UK tax
liabilities. The ACT that can be set against the company's corporation tax
bill is not a long-term cost to the company. Only ACT that cannot be used in
this way (surplus ACT) is a real cost to the company, and even then the
creation of that surplus ACT will have provided an equivalent economic
benefit for its shareholders.
The tendency of the ACT system to encourage profitable investment in the UK
rather than overseas might be seen as helpful with the UK in recession and
3m unemployed.
So while the system clearly has flaws, any call for its abolition would be
throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The preferable approach, which the
100 Group is taking, is to suggest constructive changes to relieve the worst
of the current problems.
The most obvious and eminently simple improvement is to get rid of the
antiquated rule restricting the amount of ACT paid that can be set against
corporation tax due. Allowing pound for pound set-off would improve
utilisation at relatively low cost.
ACT is an important tax. Flaws in its operation have been swept under the
carpet for far too long. By some positive indication in the budget, such as
abolishing the limitation on setting ACT against corporation tax, the
chancellor would show that he recognises this and is seriously considering
ways to improve the system without losing unacceptable amounts of tax.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Letter: No climb down by Prince Sihanouk over Cambodia
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From K L BINDRA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The heading of the news item 'Sihanouk climbs down' (January 11) is
used in a derogatory manner, which means 'he withdrew attention from a
previously held position by admitting that he was wrong'. This is not only
inaccurate, but there is also absolutely no basis for such a conclusion.
The facts are that, under section III, article 6, of the Paris Peace
Agreement, the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) had to take
direct control of the ministries of foreign affairs, defence, public
security, finance and information, as well as other administrative agencies,
bodies and offices, which could directly influence the outcome of the
elections. Besides, all the civil police were to operate under Untac's
direct control or supervision in order to ensure that law and order are
maintained effectively and impartially, and that human rights and
fundamental freedoms are fully protected. Unfortunately Untac failed to
implement it properly, with the result that the Vietnamese installed a
communist regime in Phnom-Penh (though less brutal than the Khmer Rouge, it
has always suppressed dissent; its human rights record has been criticised
by Amnesty and Asia Watch), which has been attacking and intimidating both
the non-communist factions, so that they should not carry on their
electioneering campaigns outside Phnom-Penh.
Prince Norodom Sihanouk had denounced the Phnom-Penh faction for a series of
bombing and other attacks on both the non-communist parties, and also Untac
for not controlling the violence (as it had not taken full direct control of
the administration). The prince had warned on December 14 1992 that, unless
both acted vigorously 'against the poisoning of public atmosphere . . . and
such injustice and political terrorism', he would stop co-operating with
them. As the intimidation and killing of non-communist functionaries
increased in the next fortnight, he had no option but to stop co-operating
with them.
It had the desired effect. Mr Akashi (Untac chief) asked Untac to take full
control of the situation, to create a neutral political environment. He
called on Prince Sihanouk in Beijing on January 8, and explained to him the
action he had taken. He further assured the prince that both the
non-communist fronts will no longer be intimidated in future, and will be
properly protected from attacks by the Phnom Penh faction.
The prince accepted the assurance, and agreed to co-operate. Though he is
ill, he even agreed to preside over a meeting of the supreme national
council of Cambodia in Beijing, at the end of the month, to solve some
urgent problems.
As such, by no stretch of the imagination is this a 'climb down'. Instead of
complimenting Prince Sihanouk for his achievements, he is sneered at. This
reminds me: 'East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall
meet.'

FT  19 JAN 93 / Letter: Regulatory review must not tie independent financial
advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G H E HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You are right, in your leading article, to call for the alternatives to
the Personal Investment Authority to be spelt out ('City regulation',
January 14). The members of the existing self-regulatory organisations
(SROs) will decide whether the PIA comes into existence. They need to know
the implications of their decisions before they vote and they should be
aware of planned changes within which SROs will operate.
However, your suggestions that Fimbra, the regulator for financial
intermediaries, could be absorbed within a strengthened Lautro, the
regulator for unit trust and life companies, and that independent financial
advisers would have to become tied agents, except where they could obtain
authorisation through professional bodies, is misguided. While examples of
poor advice being given have come to light (incidentally, largely from tied
agents), these have affected a small minority of the recipients of advice.
A far more pernicious consequence of the Financial Services Act has been the
contraction in the availability of independent advice. However tough the
regulatory environment, 'tied advice' will not be a universally adequate
substitute for independent advice. It is, therefore, important that the
current review of SROs does not force independent financial advisers into
the tied agency sector.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Letter: Pay plight of young people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SAM JOHNSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the pay falls experienced by under 21-year-olds, when
compared with older workers ('Under 21s slip behind in pay', January 14)
highlights a big issue - and the fact that there has been 'no evidence of
systematic falls' since young people were removed from wages council
protection should not be used to detract from its significance.
Young people are in an increasingly precarious position. In addition to low
pay we have seen in recent years the removal of income support from
16-17-year-olds, introduction of student loans, decline of the Youth
Service, continual changes in education and more generally rising
homelessness and unemployment.
Young people are the future of the country and we ignore their plight at our
peril.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Arts: A weekend with Janacek - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1926 Janacek came to London for the most important overseas visit he
undertook to promote his music. Unfortunately, his timing was not
propitious: a couple of days before the main concert the country was plunged
into a general strike, leaving no programmes, no transport and no newspapers
to advertise the event or carry reports of it. He returned to Czechoslovakia
disappointed and dejected.
The irony of this failed attempt to find a wider international audience is
that since the 1950s it has been in this country, as much as any, that
Janacek's music has come to prominence and popularity. The idea of a weekend
devoted to a survey of his music, supported by films and talks, is one that
no serious music-lover today would begin to question.
Over the past few years these BBC single-composer weekends at the Barbican
have become a regular feature of London's musical life. But what started out
as an ambitious project to put before the public in-depth profiles of
difficult 20th-century composers is now edging on to safer ground. Last
year's choice was Berg, for the first time not a living composer; and now we
have in Janacek one who has a large corpus of his works - the operas -
already accepted by the public at large.
As a result, the emphasis has changed. The importance of this weekend
shifted to the smaller pieces, although the larger orchestral scores - Taras
Bulba and the Sinfonietta - were included to provide a rousing climax to
each evening, as they most certainly did in these muscular and dynamic
performances by a BBC Symphony Orchestra in very fine fettle under Andrew
Davis.
So central is the place occupied by the operas in Janacek's output that at
least one had to be included. This was From the House of the Dead, arguably
the most suited to concert performance. Again Davis goaded the music
forwards with an awesome grip on its vital energy, giving the lie to the
theory that the opera does not have much narrative drive, but it was not in
the end an especially moving performance. A well-chosen cast, headed by Jan
Blinkhof as a Filka Morozov of raw power, Kim Begley a clarion Skuratov and
Russell Smythe an impassioned Shishkov, seemed locked in the opera's
claustrophobic ambience of prison violence. There was less of the tenderness
that gives the opera its humanity.
The 'spark of God' which Janacek saw in each of these characters
encapsulates one of the personal beliefs that is expressed throughout his
music. With their out-of-the-ordinary plots, focusing upon the human
condition, the operas are able to develop those feelings in a way denied his
other music. Of the rare works performed during this weekend, the 'Danube'
Symphony, receiving its first UK performance, roamed across folk territory
and down modernist paths with no very convincing sense of direction. The
Violin Concerto, recently 'realised' from the composer's sketches, remains a
wildly inventive, but unsatisfying torso.
From other areas of his output there was a selection of the piano music, all
fascinatingly individual, played by Radoslav Kvapil. The BBC Singers under
Simon Joly ventured into the (mostly) unaccompanied choral music, including
a drawn-out, but surprisingly sensual setting of the Lord's Prayer. There is
a lot of folk arrangements that might have been added, but at nearly an hour
in length this sample was enough.
Altogether, the most entertaining single programme of the weekend was the
Sunday afternoon chamber music recital. From a searing account of the First
String Quartet by the Lindsay Quartet, it continued via a brilliantly
sparkling Mlad from London Winds to the Concertino, which picks up on the
animal life so beloved by Janacek. This was, in fact, the very programme as
he intended it for the Wigmore Hall on his visit in 1926 - now generously
applauded, a happy case of musical dues at last being paid.

<TEXT>
Europe on the Brink (BBC 2, 7.45) looks like an expensive enterprise, with
presenter Francine Stock wafting around Europe in search of things to come.
Part one got off to a rather slow start last week, with the worthies of
Watlington on Remembrance Sunday burbling away about what it means to be
British. However, once we got to the experts' views and predictions, the
programme improved and was notably good, if hair-raising, about immigration.
This week's investigation focusses on the long-term economic prospects for
Europe weighed against America and South-east Asia.
Human nature being what it is, I am willing to bet that attendance figures
at London Zoo have been given a fillip by the recent episode of the poor man
who carried an armful of dead chickens into the lions' den and was mauled
for his pains.
The Ark (BBC 2, 9.25) is the first of no less than four documentaries about
the parlous state of London Zoo and the new management's plans to save the
rats - not to mention all the other hapless beasts - stuck on the sinking
ship.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Arts: My Favorite Year - Theatre in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Remember 1954? I don't. I was not yet born during the heyday of live
television comedy and matinee idols, the era in which My Favorite Year, the
first Broadway musical of the New York season, is set.
But I can certainly remember the 1980s and early '90s, as musicals like
Phantom of the Opera, Starlight Express, and Miss Saigon have upped the
genre's technological ante at the expense of originality and humanity. These
memories have a lot to do with why I found My Favorite Year, which recently
played at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in a Lincoln Center Theatre
production, so wonderfully refreshing.
This new musical, based on the 1982 film of the same name starring Peter
O'Toole, is far from perfect, but what it has in large supply, which so many
of today's musicals lack, is charm. It is a good, self-contained,
self-controlled little musical, and unlike last season's nostalgia vehicles
 -the Gershwin mishmash Crazy for You and Jerry Zaks' over the top revival
of Guys and Dolls - it does not give the sense of material worked over and
tarted up with making millions in mind.
The creative team - lyricist Lynn Ahrens, composer Stephen Flaherty and
writer Joseph Dougherty - has filled out the movie's strong story line with
a tight, clever book and tuneful songs that spring naturally from the action
and dialogue. It is the tale of junior comedy writer Benjy Stone (Evan
Pappas), who is assigned to keep his now-faded and drunken childhood movie
idol Alan Swann (Tim Curry) off the sauce for the week Swann is the guest
star of 'King Kaiser's Comedy Cavalcade'.
Given that set up, everything that you think will happen happens, with a
decidedly 1990's personal-growth twist. Swann charms everyone, falls off the
wagon and clambers on again just in time to save the day and make up with
his long-neglected teenage daughter. Handling Swann mixes up Benjy's life
just enough so that he can really shine in straightening it out: he gets the
girl; recognition for his yeoman writing duties; and in bonding with Swann
works through some lingering bad feelings about his own father, who deserted
his family when Benjy was young. It is all pretty predictable, but Ron
Lagomarsino's production clips along with such verve and it is all played
with such freshness that the lack of originality does not seem to matter.
Pappas' Benjy embodies what makes My Favorite Year charming; he is as simple
and perky as his bow tie, with a soaring singing voice and some of the
production's best numbers on which to show it off. Curry's Alan Swann is
less successful; he is too obviously playing at star quality, the essence of
which is effortlessness. A shame, because when he lets down his guard, as in
his climactic confrontation with Benjy in 'The Lights Come Up,' his natural
magnetism is estimable: he can swashbuckle through my musicals in his
Musketeer getup anytime.
Andrea Martin, as the doubletaking second-banana comedy writer Alice Miller,
gets the show's best laughs and its cleverest musical number: 'Professional
Showbusiness Comedy.' Her performance is almost too excellent, though,
because it points out what keeps My Favorite Year merely good instead of
sublime. If only the whole production had her dead-on, period-specific zing]
My Favorite Year saves the title tune, its most memorable, for last and is
this good, old fashioned musical's final nod to the classic rules of
showbusiness: it leaves 'em humming.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Arts: The Song of Tales - A Roman evening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 20 years ago, almost at the outset of his career, the Neapolitan
musicologist-composer-producer Roberto De Simone created a spectacle
entitled La gatta Cenerentola (The cat Cinderella), based largely on Lo
cunto delli cunti (The Tale of Tales) by Giambattista Basile, the 17th
century collection of fairy-tales that has inspired many subsequent works,
among them Prokofiev's Love of Three Oranges. With liberal admixtures of
mime, dance and traditional music (plus some music of his own) De Simone
created a piece of stage magic, subsequently revived several times, and now
a part of Italian theatrical history.
The recent announcement of a new De Simone full evening of Neapolitan song
and story naturally aroused keen expectation among his fans, especially
since the title Il canto de li cunti (The Song of Tales) again recalled
Basile, and suggested that La gatta Cenerentola would have a successor. But
the wily producer both disappointed and rewarded his admirers. The earlier
piece was a kaleidoscope of visual invention and brilliant colour; the new
work is sober to the point of starkness - the performers are all dressed in
black - and movement is reduced to the essential minimum. But within these
narrow, self-imposed confines, Il canto de li canti proved to be as varied
and thrilling as anyone could wish.
It began with Basile - a story of an Ogre and his garden - narrated, chanted
and sung by seven singers, with subtle, deliberately scant accompaniment,
then ranged through other traditional songs and stories to some versions of
Don Giovanni, of which the most exhilarating saw Pulcinella standing in for
Leporello, and then a hilarious bit of 18th century farce - L'Opera di Zeza
 -with enchanting pastiche music by De Simone, and with the superb
Neapolitan actor Rino Marcelli, en travesti, as Zeza (before that, he had
been a magnificent Pulcinella).
The second half featured more recent pieces: a staged poem by the late
comedian Toto, in which two dead men - a street-sweeper (again the
unparalleled Marcelli) and an aristocrat (the suitably pompous Enzo Pierro)
 -come to wry conclusions about life and death; some songs of Salvatore Di
Giacomo, the 19th-century poet whose lyrics were seized upon by generations
of composers; and finally a series of pieces by Raffaele Viviani, a somewhat
underestimated turn of the century author whose bitter streak distinguishes
him from other Neapolitan humourists.
The outstanding quality of this production - apart from the unerring taste
and interest of the selected material - was its coherence, its apparent
spontaneity along with its impeccable organisation. In a sense there were no
stars (even Marcelli worked in perfect synchrony with the others); and in
another sense, the interpreters were all stars: a glittering constellation
that, despite the almost bare stage and the funereal dress, lit up the
Teatro Valle in Rome and, from there, should go on to shine in many other
theatres.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Arts: The gentle manipulator of space is at it again /
Review of Tim Head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easier to describe the work that Tim Head is currently exhibiting than
either to justify or to condemn it. The first thing to strike us, even
before we register his latest group of 15 canvases that occupies the huge
lower gallery of the Whitechapel, is the space itself. We enter a room
transformed, its walls now a light and uniform sky-blue, its floor covered
with green plastic turf. Head, the gentle manipulator of space, the teasing
confounder of familiarity and expectation, is at it again.
We need not go so far as his apologist, Marco Livingstone, who, in the
catalogue essay, compares the experience with that of being placed 'in the
perfect stillness of an eternal heaven by Fra Angelico', to take the point.
There is no deception: the means are obvious. Yet this great space, even as
we enter and recognise it, is not quite the Whitechapel we thought we knew.
It is bigger somehow, higher, more open and airy, yet, at the same time,
oddly more complete and enclosed.
Here hang these large canvases, 13 to the set and two more hors serie, with
their immaculate surfaces and their self-consciously bland and enigmatic
images. They are clearly untouched by hand, but the manner of their making
is not readily apparent. Only the catalogue can tell us that they have been
printed out on an ink-jet press, regulated by computer, the images amplified
from collage studies. It is at once frustrating and revealing that Head
never shows such preparatory material.
What are we to make of these blank, screen-like images, so gently curved and
subtly speckled? Again, only the catalogue will tell us that they derive
from 'the kinds of shapes used in packaging and presentation . . . Intrigued
that such shapes look comfortingly familiar but also odd in their synthetic
character, he built up a collection of them in the form of manufactured
objects, labels and printed matter, sometimes drawing the outline directly
from such things as plastic containers, at other times photocopying them and
redrawing them. Gradually refining the selection so as to eliminate the most
immediately recognisable forms, he arrived at a group of hybrid generic
motifs whose particular origins can no longer be identified.'
Upstairs, past the slide documentary of past work, and the 'Happy Eaters' in
the Gallery's cafe, we come to another total appropriation of the particular
space. The small New Gallery has been blacked out and ultra-violet lamps
installed to pick out the myriad coloured stick-on labels scattered across
the walls and ceiling. The trick is simple enough and the effect engaging,
as it were the darkest of nights and the stars bright in the firmament, 'the
floor of heaven thick inlaid with patinas of bright . . ' - well, yellow and
green and blue and red.
The Upper Gallery holds a selection of Head's work of the 1980s, and it is
here that his preoccupation with the synthetic product and detritus of the
modern, processed, computer-driven world is made clear. Here are the large
cibachrome photographs, produced to the highest gloss of contemporary
advertising, that take still-life as their ironical, impassive subject. Here
is a heap of plastic toys, pastel-coloured skulls that are really rubbers,
rockets, toy cars: and here a King Kong cityscape of transistor radios,
computers, product packaging, vibrators as skyscrapers.
Here too are the effluent and toxic landscapes, the cibachromes of what
might be pools or swamps filled with whatever we choose to throw away,
plastic bottle, strip and filler, unbiodegradable to the last button. The
charge is inevitable, but Head insists he is not an issues artist. 'It's not
straight-forward, and that's what makes it interesting. I am drawn to these
things. Close up, they have a strange physical beauty that I find compelling
. . . We can't pretend that this stuff doesn't exist.'
Further along hangs the 'Cow Mutation' painting, with which he won the John
Moores Prize of 1986. It is again a large canvas, but this time painted
directly and simply in black and white, the image derived from the cow motif
by the anonymous designer of the particular milk carton. And by degrees the
poor cow disintegrates in formal frenzy before our eyes. No issue there. The
series continues with such works as Prime Cuts, Deep Freeze and Replicator,
each apparently prettier and more disarming than the next in its
sophisticated simplicity, whites and pinks, violets and blues, so redolent
of late Matisse. It is only the imagery itself that gives us pause, images
of cells and organisms, mutant as may be, beneath the microscope. The large
green and black triptych at the end carries as its image a map of the world,
its continents and oceans breaking down in a desperate confusion. As I say,
no issue there.
Head, it seems to me, is very much an artist of his time and place,
fortunate in the sympathetic interest his work has elicited over the years,
by its very nature, in the eyes of those who command the public patronage of
the British art world. That of itself is no disqualification, and Head no
less an artist, of considerable refinement and intelligence moreover, for
the support he has enjoyed.
My feeling is only that he is as yet not fully the artist he is capable of
being simply because he has yet to trust himself fully to experience and
intuition, rather than, as hitherto, to idea and process. He is the victim
still of his background, Newcastle in the 1960s, under the influence of
Richard Hamilton, and the heresy that persists so destructively to this day,
that art, to be art, must be about ideas - as though ideas alone could make
a Titian, a Rembrandt or a Matisse. Idea and attitude are but the
straitjacket of the aesthete and the curatorial pedant, and Head, I should
have thought, too clever not to escape.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Marriages made in Brussels - Why EC
merger rules have found favour with industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The endowment of Brussels two years ago with power to vet large-scale
Community mergers has been an unexpected success for European business. The
Merger Task Force, the European Commission's mergers watchdog, has shown
itself capable of meeting the tight procedural deadlines set by the merger
regulation and a willingness to reach an accommodation with businesses where
possible.
This flexibility is reflected in the statistics. Of the 136 notifications
dealt with by the task force during its first two years, 103 were cleared
within one month and only 10 went to a full-scale, four-month, phase two
investigation. Of those, two were cleared, one withdrawn, and seven cleared
after modification.
Only one merger - the bid by France's Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia for
Canadian aircraft manufacturer De Havilland - has been blocked following a
phase two investigation, and that largely because of the fierce opposition
to it put up by Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner.
It took 17 years of negotiation and much political compromise to get the
merger regulation adopted.
Deciding which cases should be dealt with by Brussels and which should be
left to the national competition authorities proved one of the bigger
sticking points. Finally, it was agreed jurisdiction should be determined by
reference to the turnover of the companies involved.
If the combined worldwide turnover of the companies was more than Ecu5bn and
the aggregate EC turnover of each of at least two companies was Ecu250m or
more, then the case would go to Brussels. Mergers below these thresholds
would remain the exclusive jurisdiction of national authorities.
This represented a victory for Germany and Britain, the two EC countries
with the strongest national competition bodies and the most reluctant to
cede power in this area to Brussels. Other member states argued the
thresholds should have been set lower, bringing more mergers under Brussels'
control.
As a compromise it was agreed thresholds would be reviewed by the end of
1993 with the expectation that they would come down if Brussels proved
itself capable of handling a predicted 50 to 60 mergers a year. This year
promises a fierce debate on the issue between the member states and the
Commission.
Has the regulation been a success? Mr Michael Reynolds, head of City
solicitors Allen &amp; Overy's Brussels' office, says it is possible to
criticise individual decisions and there has been some inconsistency, for
example, in defining relevant product and geographic markets.
There has also been some concern over lack of transparency. Why for example
was the De Havilland merger blocked while Nestle's bid for Perrier was
cleared subject to certain undertakings? There is no doubt, however, that
deadlines have been met and the regulation has been a procedural success, he
says.
So will the thresholds come down in 1993? It seems industry would like them
to. If a case is borderline it is now quite common for businesses to ask
their lawyers to structure the deal so as to bring it above the thresholds,
Mr Reynolds says.
What industry likes about the merger regulation is the certainty it affords
 -the opportunity to obtain clearance for a deal after the initial one month
appraisal period, he says. This certainty is not afforded by national
competition authorities.
Professor Barry Hawk, head of the Brussels office of US law firm Skadden
Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom says industry is also heartened by the task
force's relaxed approach, reflected in the statistics.
If Sir Leon had remained in charge of competition, a toughening of the
regime could have been expected particularly after the De Havilland case.
But with a new competition commissioner, Mr Karel van Miert, in charge and a
new director of the task force, Mr Philip Lowe, taking over in March,
neither of whom has any background in competition regulation, the regime is,
if anything, likely to become even more relaxed, he says.
Mr Van Miert has already stated that strict competition principles will not
be the sole guidelines for EC antitrust decisions over the next two years
and that he wants to model EC policy more on the Japanese approach taking
into account industrial, environmental, regional and social issues. If the
net result is a further relaxation of the Brussels merger regime, industry
may lobby even harder for lower thresholds.
Sir Sydney Lipworth, outgoing chairman of the UK's Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, counsels caution, however. What industry likes so much about the
Brussels regime is the possibility of quick clearance of a merger. But EC
mergers and acquisitions activity has been at a low ebb over the past two
years. If M&amp;A activity were to pick up and at the same time the thresholds
came down increasing the number of mergers dealt with by Brussels, deadlines
might begin to slip and the procedural certainty could be threatened, he
says.
Whether the thresholds come down will ultimately be determined by the
politicians. A year ago when Sir Leon was still in charge and the
subsidiarity debate had yet to come to the fore a lowering of the thresholds
looked on the cards. With Mr Van Miert at the helm and the political climate
shifting against the ceding of more power to the centre, a reduction in the
thresholds is less certain.
If the Commission is set on reducing the thresholds there will be a price to
pay, Professor Hawk says. Germany and Britain, and to a lesser extent
France, are likely to oppose any reduction. Germany's price for agreeing to
a change would be the establishment of an EC mergers watchdog independent of
the Commission or conceivably an independent EC cartel office based on its
own Bundeskartellamt.
It is not clear whether the UK would support Germany in this demand.
Although not purporting to speak for the UK government, Sir Sydney has made
it clear on a number of occasions that while he thinks the body responsible
for investigating mergers should be as independent as possible he would stop
short of the single all-pervading independent competition body sought by
Germany.
Member states might also be prepared to agree to the thresholds coming down
in return for a number of amendments to the regulation itself, Mr Reynolds
says.
A strengthening of the exception which allows mergers above the threshold to
be referred back to member states on the grounds that they affect a distinct
national or regional market would be welcomed by Germany and the UK. Three
requests from Germany in the Varta/Bosch; Mannesman/Hoesch; and Alcatel/AEG
Kabel cases were all turned down. Only one merger Steetley/Tarmac has been
referred back under this exception and that was largely because a related
bid by Redland was already being investigated by the UK's MMC.
Most member states would also welcome a change in the EC's policy on
negotiating settlements which would allow the Commission to accept
behavioural undertakings in addition to structural changes.
And if Mr Van Miert is determined to extend his policy of considering
factors other than pure competition, several member states would like to see
those factors written into the regulation. A significant amount of political
horse-trading lies ahead.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Defending the mark of a true Champagne
 -Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Champagne producers have never been slow to to protect their appellation
against those who attempt to trade on its reputation.
The latest in a long line of legal cases to be heard by the English High
Court started yesterday. It concerns 'Elderflower Champagne', a
non-alcoholic cordial with added carbonated water, sold in green,
Champagne-shaped bottles with wired mushroom corks, by Thorncroft Vineyard.
At issue will be whether the consumer is likely to be misled into believing
this is real Champagne.
While Thorncroft will argue that no one could possibly make that mistake,
the Champagne producers believe they have ample evidence to show that people
will be misled. Although its reputation is well known, few people know what
Champagne really is - a unique sparkling wine produced only in the Champagne
region of France, they say.
There is also a principle at stake. If Thorncroft is allowed to market its
product unchallenged, others will follow and pretty soon the mark,
Champagne, will have been destroyed, passing into the vernacular like other
well-known marks before it, such as Gramophone, Hoover, Go-kart and Aspirin.
The hearing is expected to last five days.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Perrier workforce loses merger plea -
European Law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts by the Perrier workforce to challenge the European Commission's
decision allowing the Nestle/Perrier merger have suffered a setback
following refusal by the president of the Court of First Instance, Mr Cruz
Vilaca, of their application for interim measures. This was the first Court
ruling involving the 1989 EC merger regulation.
Following clearance of the merger by the Commission last summer the Perrier
workforce brought an application for judicial review. Pending the hearing of
their application they also requested suspension of the Commission's
authorisation decision and asked the CFI to order the Commission to require
Nestle not to reduce employment in the Perrier group nor to comply with the
undertakings given to the Commission which included the sale of Perrier
subsidiaries.
The CFI president dismissed the application for interim measures on the
grounds that the applicants had not proved sufficient urgency to justify
intervention by the Court.
The main reason for urgency relied on by the applicants was the threatened
redundancy of 740 employees during 1993 and the likelihood of further
redundancies following the sale of subsidiaries to a competitor, BSN,
France's largest foods group. They claimed the absence of a right of
reinstatement for unfair dismissal in French law meant that redundancy
constituted serious and irreparable harm.
In reaching his decision the president took into account the need to balance
the conflicting interests of the employees' representatives with those of
Nestle.
The president pointed out that, in fact, redundancies would arise only if
the more favourable methods proposed by Nestle for reducing employees
failed.
Moreover, there should be no risk of further redundancies as a direct result
of the Commission's authorisation decision itself or the conditions
requiring the sale of subsidiaries.
First, the merger regulation expressly states it has no impact on the
collective rights of employees. Second, the 1977 Acquired Rights Directive
precludes redundancy on the transfer of a business, including a transfer
resulting from a merger authorisation decision.
Judicial Review
However, the president rejected the Commission's claim that the main
judicial review application was inadmissible.
The applicants' main grounds for asking the court to annul the Commission's
decision include alleged infringements of the procedural rights of
recognised employee representatives of the companies concerned by a merger
and the failure of the Commission to respect fundamental social rights
recognised by Community law, including the social charter.
They also challenged the decision on the grounds of failure to maintain
effective competition in France, and the introduction of the concept of
'duopoly' or 'oligopolistic dominance' without legal basis into the merger
regulation.
Although the CFI president did not comment on the main grounds for judicial
review, his ruling contained observations on the policy objectives of the
merger regulation indicating the likely position which the CFI could adopt
in the context of the protection of employee interests in merger cases.
He accepts the Commission policy implemented during the first two years of
EC merger control that competition considerations are predominant in the
assessment process. But, he notes that in considering the effect of mergers
on the structure of competition in the Community, the Commission must place
its appraisal within the general framework of the achievement of the
fundamental objectives referred to in Article 2 of the EEC Treaty, including
that of strengthening the Community's economic and social cohesion.
According to the president, the Commission also acknowledges the correctness
of this approach. More interestingly, the Commission is reported as saying
that taking other effects of a merger into account would hinder achievement
of one of the general Treaty objectives and notably the development of
employment.
The Commission claims that neither the Perrier takeover nor the subsequent
sales of subsidiaries could harm any of these objectives.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Technology: Getting under the skin - Continuing a series on
drug discoveries / A look at the latest developments in dermatology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The skin seems superficially to be an easy target for the pharmaceutical
industry. It is more accessible than any other part of the body, and drugs
applied to the skin are relatively free of systemic side-effects.
Yet people suffering from skin disorders, estimated to make up 15 per cent
of the population at any given time, have been poorly served by medical and
pharmaceutical research. Few safe and effective treatments exist for
conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis or acne, which - although
rarely life-threatening - can make a misery of patients' lives for years on
end.
The outlook for the next few years is more encouraging, however. Several
large pharmaceutical groups are taking a renewed interest in dermatology.
And many emerging drug companies see topical applications - directly to
affected areas of the skin - as the fastest route to the market, because the
Food and Drug Administration is less concerned about side-effects than for
drugs that have to be swallowed or injected.
Skin disorders as a whole make up a valuable prescription drug market worth
about Dollars 6.5bn (Pounds 4.3bn) in 1992 and growing at more than 10 per
cent a year. But the dermatology market is highly fragmented compared with
other pharmaceutical fields, with no single drug selling more than Dollars
200m a year.
Among the international pharmaceutical groups, Johnson &amp; Johnson and
Schering Plough of the US, Roche of Switzerland and Schering AG of Germany
are current leaders in the dermatology market. But perhaps the most
ambitious is Sandoz of Switzerland. A relatively small player now, it has
dermatology sales of no more than Dollars 170m a year.
Sandoz has designated the skin as a priority business for marketing,
research and development. 'Dermatology is going to provide the most growth
of any area for Sandoz over the next five years,' says David Pearson, who is
responsible for international dermatology marketing at the company's Basle
headquarters. If Sandoz achieves its targets, it will become the world's
largest producer of skin drugs within five years.
The company's decision to focus on the skin was based partly on its
expertise in immunology, because psoriasis and some forms of dermatitis are
linked to dysfunction of the immune system. Sandimmun (cyclosporin A), the
immune suppressant used to prevent rejection of organ transplants, is one of
the few drugs capable of clearing up severe psoriasis. But it is a powerful
systemic medicine with potentially dangerous side-effects. Sandoz scientists
in Switzerland and Austria are now working to develop new cyclosporin
derivatives that patients can apply directly to the skin.
Psoriasis, which affects about 2 per cent of the population, results from
excessive growth of skin cells combined with inflammation. Like other skin
disorders, it can take several forms and in severe cases its lesions can be
life-threatening. Conventional psoriasis treatments, including coal tar
ointments, steroid creams and ultraviolet radiation, may bring temporary
relief but do not tackle the underlying causes.
Although the current market for specific psoriasis drugs is small - an
estimated Dollars 130m last year - psoriasis is a favourite target of
dermatological research. While cyclosporin A is a promising treatment for
severe cases, dermatologists are reporting encouraging results among
patients with mild to moderate psoriasis from Dovonex (calcipotriol), a new
derivative of vitamin D introduced in Europe two years ago by Leo
Pharmaceutical of Denmark.
Dovonex ointment is a potent inhibitor of skin cell proliferation.
Clinical trials at Leicester Royal Infirmary have shown that it is 'highly
effective' at improving psoriasis without toxic side-effects.
Derivatives of vitamin A, known as retinoids, can help to clear up another
distressing skin disorder, acne, which is caused by over-production of oil
by sebaceous glands in the skin. Mild acne - the spots that appear
temporarily in most teenagers - is often treated by applying lotions and
creams containing benzoyl peroxide to dry the skin or antibiotics to kill
the bacteria that can exacerbate the condition. But retinoids are the only
effective treatment for severe acne, which can lead to deep cysts and
permanent scarring. The most powerful retinoid is Roaccutane, developed by
Roche. It is taken by mouth and the side-effects, including birth defects in
pregnant women, are potentially so dangerous that in the UK its use is
restricted to hospitals.
Smaller companies developing novel drugs for skin disorders include:
Sphinx Pharmaceuticals of North Carolina. It has a topical psoriasis drug,
Kynac, in clinical trials. It is designed to inhibit a family of enzymes,
known collectively as protein kinase C, which act as molecular messengers
for skin cell proliferation and inflammation.
Agouron of California which has a psoriasis drug, AG-85, which in-activates
a different enzyme, thymidylate synthase, which is involved in cell
proliferation. Its first clinical test last year gave equivocal results; the
patients' psoriasis improved whether they were treated with AG-85 or
inactive liquid - an illustration of the way some skin disorders are
affected by psychological factors and may tend to respond temporarily to any
sort of attention. Agouron will carry out a second trial this year with
re-formulated AG-85.
Genta of California. It is developing genetic 'anti-sense' drugs designed to
treat skin disease at the point of origin by blocking the genes that control
proliferation and inflammation. These are not ready for clinical testing.
Meanwhile, to build up sales, Genta has filed new drug applications for five
conventional dermatological compounds.
Scotia Pharmaceuticals of the UK which is working on two separate
approaches: fatty acids and lithium salts. Its first prescription drugs,
Epogam (based on evening primrose oil) for atopic eczema and Efalith
(lithium succinate) for seborrhoeic dermatitis, are licensed to Searle for
sales and marketing.
Conventional pharmaceuticals are not the only approach to dermatology. Last
summer, a group of London dermatologists reported in the Lancet a clinical
trial of traditional Chinese herbal remedies - long used to improve skin
conditions. They found that drinking a tea made from 10 dried Chinese herbs
significantly improved the symptoms of patients with atopic eczema. 'An
understanding of the pharmacological basis for the beneficial effect is
limited,' they said.
Also, light-based treatments for severe skin disease may be due for a
renaissance. Ultraviolet rays have been used for decades in conjunction with
photosensitising chemicals but their effect is unpredictable and many
patients fear the side-effects of irradiation. Quadra Logic of Vancouver,
Canada, is now beginning clinical trials of a refined technique, called
photodynamic therapy: psoriasis patients are injected with a light-activated
drug, BPD, and exposed not to ultraviolet but to red light from a medical
laser.
The pharmaceutical outlook is promising for patients with skin disease
serious enough to be referred to a hospital dermatologist. Safe drugs to
provide relief from the milder forms of eczema and dermatitis - which can
still drive patients into a frenzy of itching - are a more distant prospect.
John Berthe-Jones of Leicester Royal Infirmary says the greatest unmet need
in dermatology is a treatment for pruritus (the medical term for itching).
Anti-histamines provide only slight relief. 'Itch is a symptom that
completely defies us,' he says. 'Above all, we need a drug that would block
its transmission from skin to the brain.'
The series continues next month by looking at advances in vaccines.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Technology: Beauty business fights flaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beauty-conscious consumers have taken to skin moisturisers in a big way, as
companies have widened their products' appeal by using an increasingly
advanced range of ingredients. But as well as boosting sales, this has also
led to sharper scrutiny from health regulators.
The facial moisturiser industry produced Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) of
sales in the US in 1992 - up by 10 per cent on the previous year, according
to Diana Temple, a cosmetics analyst with Salomon Brothers in New York,
while new product introductions rose by 14 per cent.
This month, Pond's by Unilever launches a new line of complex moisturising
products, priced to sell at between Dollars 5 and Dollars 12, well below the
high prices charged for other products in this market. Avon is introducing
Anew, a low-priced moisturiser with collagen acid, while L'Oreal's
Plenitude, the first mass-market product to contain sophisticated
ingredients like liposomes, has been expanding its market share.
The US Food and Drug Administration is far from pleased about the direction
the cosmetics companies are taking. It will soon examine the new products
for possible regulation. But its attention has been temporarily distracted
by the controversy over Retin-A, which some physicians claim can completely
offset damage caused by overexposure to the sun. In one case, the FDA
chastised several physicians for allegedly recommending the use of Retin-A,
approved only for use on acne, as a wrinkle eradicator.
Ortho, the Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary making Retin-A, responded by
repackaging the product under a new name, Renova, and filing an application
with the FDA to use the cream as an anti-ageing skin drug. But many of the
moisturisers on the market use a compound related to Retin-A in their own
products.
The active ingredient in both Retin-A and Renova is tretinoin, a synthetic
analogue of vitamin A, developed so it can be absorbed through the skin.
Many products use another vitamin A derivative called vitamin A palmitate.
The cosmetics companies insist that consumers need the innovative new
products for a long-lasting moisturising effect. 'Old-fashioned moisturisers
simply bind water to the skin's surface,' said Daniel Maes, vice-president
in charge of research and development for Estee Lauder.
Still, because of concern over possible regulations, cosmetics companies are
searching for alternatives to vitamin A derivatives. Estee Lauder has
introduced cerebrozides into its products. 'The superficial layer of the
skin loses its ability to retain water with age,' said Maes. 'The
cerebrozides are a complex lipid found in plants in China and they restore
this function.'
Besides the side-effects of vitamin A derivatives, the FDA is concerned
about products that penetrate deeply. These products often depend on
liposomes and niosomes, which coat the moisturisers' active ingredients to
carry them deeper into the skin. Many companies are struggling to find
moisturisers that have an impact similar to the deep-penetrating products
while affecting only the skin's most superficial layers.
It will not be easy to find a substitute for the vitamin A derivatives.
Lipids help restore the skin's capacity to create its own moisture, but
vitamin A derivatives perform a different function. As skin ages, the cells
in the skin start to experience abnormal activity, growing too fast or too
slow. Vitamin A palmitate slows the activity of hyperactive cells and boosts
the activity of under-active cells.
Like the proponents of Retin-A, the makers of products using vitamin A
palmitate claim the moisturisers can eradicate superficial lines. 'As the
skin cells stabilise and retain moisture, they get thicker,' said Maes. 'And
as the epidermis gets thicker, the superficial wrinkles disappear.'
Yet because of what the industry claims are striking results, manufacturers
are unlikely to relinquish the ingredient for some time. The market's growth
prospects are simply too tempting.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Calling lenders to
account - In spite of improvements, banks still fail small business
customers / A look at the commercial relationship in which normal rules do
not seem to apply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hire a car and the rental companies fall over themselves to win your
business and make you feel a valued customer. Hire money from a bank and
somehow the normal commercial relationship does not apply. The customer pays
 -though he will not be invoiced in advance - but is often left with the
feeling the bank is providing a favour and not a service.
Clearly banks are different from car hire companies. The commercial
relationship endures far longer; the product on offer is converted into
other, sometimes negative, assets by the customer; and, on top of their duty
to shareholders, banks have a responsibility to depositors.
The uneasy relationship between the banks and a sizeable minority of their
small business customers has provided fuel for an acrimonious debate which
has rumbled on for the past five years. It was given fresh impetus by the
publication last week of a new study* of the banks - the fifth in a series -
by the Forum of Private Business.
The forum, normally the most pugnacious of the small business lobby groups,
took pains to stress the improvements which have occurred and to emphasise
the need for a constructive debate.
The study, carried out by a team from Nottingham University, found that
there was no foundation to the oft-repeated claim that the banks had not
passed on base rate cuts to customers. There was also a greater
differentiation in the quality of service offered which the forum took as
proof the banks did not operate a cartel. Barclays ranked most highly for
the quality of service to small businesses while Lloyds lagged a poor
fourth.
But beneath this rather optimistic gloss the survey comes to some worrying
conclusions about the banks' performance. There are still 'substantial
weaknesses' in the banking relationship and indications that, in the event
of economic recovery, banks would not be well placed to respond to an
increase in demand for funds from businesses.
Bank charges, interest rates and the banks' demand for collateral remain
important constraints on small firms, said Martin Binks, head of the
research team. The publication of business charters and tariff cards by the
larger banks has helped businesses calculate their likely charges. But there
remains 'genuine pessimism' about the overall impact of the charters on bank
attitudes, the survey reported.
For reasons which were not clear to the researchers, the Scottish Banks  -
Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale - outshone their
English counterparts in the quality of service provided.
Possible reasons include the fact that the Scottish banks are smaller,
easier to manage and can afford to be more selective in their choice of
customer.
Most worrying, given the efforts the banks say they have made to improve
matters, was the view among small businesses that the quality of the banks'
service had declined since 1990.
The reason for this, according to Jane Bradshaw, head of small business
services at National Westminster Bank, was that the recession had obscured
the progress which had been made.
NatWest has increased training programmes to familiarise managers with the
problems facing small business, freed staff from administrative duties to
concentrate on customer relations and improved the service provided in
specialist areas such as franchising, Bradshaw points out.
However much the banks improve their services they will always suffer from
the fact that they have to refuse finance to some of the people who ask for
it, she says. And, she notes, any survey of banking issues will inevitably
highlight bank-related problems.
There may be some truth in this last assertion but the banks' usual defence
 -that the banking horror stories which have received publicity are
anecdotes without statistical significance - is no longer tenable. The forum
survey covered more than 6,000 businesses and provides a valid cross-section
of the small business community.
At the same time banks like NatWest claim that their own customer surveys
indicate very high levels of satisfaction. A survey on behalf of all the
main high street banks among start-up companies showed 92 per cent rated the
banks' service as quite or very good.
One of the most common complaints of recent months - that the banks have
reduced loan facilities across the board - is not confirmed by NatWest's
figures, says Bradshaw. In the 15 months to September 1992, NatWest
increased the overdraft facilities available to 39 per cent of its customers
and reduced them for only 22 per cent.
This view appears to be supported by the latest NatWest/Small Business
Research Trust survey which found that access to finance ranked only eighth
among the problems facing small firms, well behind issues such as lack of
turnover - the frontrunner cited by 44 per cent of small firms questioned -
and cashflow difficulties (12 per cent). Further light on this aspect of the
banks' behaviour will be shed by a Treasury review of the small business
loan market to be published in the next few weeks.
This finding is perhaps not surprising in a recession but many in the
business community are concerned that the banks will not be able to meet
demand for finance when the upturn comes. 'Managers are becoming more
risk-averse,' says Alastair Winter of the Bank Relationship Consultancy**,
one of a number of specialist consultancies which have sprung up to help
businesses deal with their bank.
The banks are poor at assessing risk and managers often seem unable to
distinguish between a sound and an unsound business proposition, says Philip
Doggett of Business Banking Review***.
The banks, for their part, are quick to point out that a banking
relationship is a two-way affair. The forum study found that 70 per cent of
small businesses were aware of the need to provide the bank manager with
timely and regular management information. How often this awareness is put
into practice is another matter but it does indicate an increased
sophistication on the part of businesses.
However hard the banks work on improving their services, they are operating
in a far more critical market place. They are large organisations and it
will take a long time to change traditional cultures. They can expect the
transition to be subjected to a painful, public scrutiny.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Taking the banks to task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business owners who would once have accepted the bank manager's advice
without question have become far more critical. They are now aware of the
need to manage the banking relationship. Points they should watch include:
If you are unhappy with your bank's charges check with the branch how they
are calculated. Errors are common and it is not unknown for a 0 to be added
to the interest rate or for penalty rates to be levied on the entire
overdraft and not just the excess.
If the manager cannot say how he has arrived at a particular level of
charges press for an explanation. This should be less common now the banks
have published customer charters and more details of their rates but it does
sometimes occur.
Negotiate on fees but do not forget that the bank has to make a profit too.
It makes sense to compare what your bank offers with the competition and use
this in negotiations.
Ultimately it may be worth changing banks but do not underestimate the
inconvenience involved. Make sure the bank you would like to move to will be
prepared to take on your account. Some managers are reluctant to take on
refugees from their competitors on the grounds that they may be
troublemakers.
Keep your bank manager informed about the progress of your business on a
regular and timely basis. This is more than a chore. It is a useful
discipline which will keep you more informed about your business. Make sure
the quality of your financial information is high and not just a few
jottings on the back of an envelope.
If you have bad news to impart make sure you have a plan prepared for
putting the problems right.
Keep a close eye on the terms and renewal dates of bank facilities so you
can plan your negotiating position ahead of the next renewal meeting.
Make sure you have a facility letter from your bank to cover any financing
you have arranged. Check its contents to see that it matches what you have
agreed verbally.
If you are required to provide personal guarantees make sure the amount
corresponds to the sum borrowed and that there is a time limit. Do not sign
unlimited, open-ended guarantees, it will restrict your freedom of
manoeuvre. Once a guarantee expires make sure the fact is recorded at
Companies House or at the Land Registry or you may have problems raising
loans in future.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Portrait of composer attracts Dollars 2.4m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RATHER battered portrait dating from the late 15th century and cautiously
attributed to the 'School of Bruges' sold for Dollars 2.42m (Pounds 1.59m)
at Sotheby's in New York at the weekend, way above its top estimate of
Dollars 600,000.
It was acquired for the Kimbell Art Foundation at Fort Worth, one of the
richest art galleries in the US.
The high price can be attributed to the celebrity of the sitter, the
composer Jacob Obrecht (it is probably the first realistic likeness of a
composer), and to the fact that Mr Dirk de Vos, the curator of the Bruges
Museum, is convinced that the work is by the celebrated Flemish artist Hans
Memling.
The picture was the highlight of an Old Masters auction that totalled
Dollars 12.4m, but which was nearly 23 per cent unsold. A still life with
fruit by Jan Davidsz de Heem also went far above forecast, making Dollars
1.45m.
In a sale of Old Master drawings at Sotheby's a sketch by the 18th century
French artist Fragonard of the garden of an Italian villa did well, selling
for Dollars 343,000.
The highlight of a Christie's auction of European works of art in New York
was a posthumous marble bust of the French soldier and strategist the Comte
de Guibert, commissioned in 1791 by his widow from Jean-Antoine Houdon. It
sold below estimate for Dollars 820,000.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Guide to jobs law planned: Waldegrave to define EC rules on
public service contracting-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government plans to publish a definitive explanation of how EC
legislation protecting the jobs and pay of workers in mergers affects the
contracting-out of public services, Mr William Waldegrave said yesterday.
Mr Waldegrave, the public service minister, was addressing a conference in
London organised by the Cabinet Office to involve business in the
government's market-testing programme. Doubts over whether the EC
legislation applies have cast a shadow over the programme, which will put
Pounds 1.5bn of work out to tender by the end of September.
A series of judgments in the European Court of Justice has extended the
scope of EC legislation to contracting out. Employment law experts warn that
companies which win contracts to provide public services are likely to be
covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
Regulations 1981, known as Tupe.
That would make it harder for them to sack workers and alter their pay and
conditions.
Mr Waldegrave told the conference that the Tupe regulations had not yet
hindered market-testing and would not in the future. He said he would look
at the recent Rask judgment, reported in yesterday's FT, which appears to
confirm that the legislation applies more widely than ministers have so far
admitted.
However, he warned that whether the regulations applied to any contract
depended on the particular circumstances of the case. Companies bidding for
work should take legal advice on whether they applied in each case.
Yesterday's conference - attended by more than 500 business executives  -
was picketed by Civil Service unions. Mr John Ellis, secretary of the
Council of Civil Service Unions, described the programme as the 'biggest car
boot sale ever held'.
The unions said they would oppose the market-testing programme, which
exposes the jobs of more than 44,000 civil servants to competitive
tendering. The CCSU said it would use the Tupe regulations to ensure
maintenance of Civil Service pay and conditions .
But Mr Waldegrave challenged the assumption that all contracting-out
involved cutting pay and conditions. 'Many existing transfers where Tupe
does apply have still proved worthwhile for contractors.'
The minister said that where the regulations apply, businesses would 'have
to be genuinely innovative about delivering services to give good value for
money while taking on the staff and their conditions of employment'.
The National Audit Office, the public expenditure watchdog, is to audit the
market-testing process to ensure fair and open competition.
Sir Peter Levene, the government's efficiency adviser, told the conference
that when existing staff bid for work in market-testing, they will be
expected to follow the same rules as private companies and include the cost
of all overheads in their bids. If the staff were successful with their bid,
they would sign a service agreement specifying standards to which work would
be performed.
A second market-testing conference will be staged on March 12, to
accommodate the overflow from yesterday's conference, which was almost 100
per cent oversubscribed.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Council reforms are challenged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT claims that its proposed reform of local government in Scotland
would lead to large cost savings have been challenged by Strathclyde
regional council, Scotland's largest local authority and the most likely to
disappear if the reform goes ahead.
A council working party says savings would be much less - and transitional
costs far higher - than consultants Touche Ross calculated in a study for
the Scottish Office.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Big rise feared on costs at Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTS AT British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp plant at Sellafield
could soar by 'several hundred million pounds' in the first decade of
operation, jeopardising its economic basis, a report commissioned by the
environmental campaign group Greenpeace said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox
writes.
The new attack comes during a fierce debate about whether the plant for
reprocessing 'spent' or used nuclear fuel, which has taken Pounds 2.8bn and
nearly 10 years to build, should start operation.
A government inquiry is considering whether the economic, environmental and
political reasons for reprocessing have changed so much since the plant got
the go-ahead that it should become a white elephant.
BNF said that the figures were 'pure speculation'.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Industry is accused over R&amp;D investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS are obsessed with cutting costs and fail to invest
sufficiently in research and development, a survey of more than 200 managing
directors and technical directors says today.
It warns that Britain is in danger of squandering improvements in
productivity and quality by not paying enough attention to product
development.
Computervision, the manufacturing design company that conducted the survey
of companies with more than 300 employees, said that most manufacturers
identified research and development as a cost rather than an investment.
A third of those questioned said that cutting costs was the most important
issue facing their business. Only 6 per cent saw customers' needs as the
most important issue.
Many manufacturers also had poor relations with the City.
More than 40 per cent of listed companies and 84 per cent of unlisted
companies questioned had no regular contact with the City.
Mr Garreth Evans, Computervision's managing director, said: 'Manufacturing
needs to improve relations with the City, move customer needs up the agenda
and raise its sights from an obsession with cost-cutting if it is to become
world-class.'
Lack of investment was the biggest obstacle facing UK manufacturers, he
said. 'Firms see themselves as vulnerable on research and development and
the use of advanced manufacturing technology relative to Germany's
performance.'
British manufacturers, however, had made substantial improvements in
productivity and quality. More than 75 per cent of companies identified
product quality as an investment priority.
Almost 70 per cent of companies were working towards or had achieved the
'total quality' management objectives established by the British Standards
Institution.
Relations with employees also had improved with 91 per cent of companies
meeting the workforce regularly, mostly through Japanese-style team
briefings.
Almost 75 per cent of manufacturers declared themselves fully prepared for
the single European market, with 89 per cent of companies already selling or
planning to sell goods in other EC markets.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Court told of Hatton 'backhanders'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DEREK Hatton, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, lobbied
Labour councillors in Liverpool to influence land deals in return for
illegal 'backhanders', the Crown Court at Mold, Clwyd, was told yesterday.
Mr Hatton, with Mr John Nelson and Mrs Hannah Folan, also former Labour
councillors, and businessmen Mr Roy Stewart and Mr John Monk, deny charges
of conspiracy to defraud the council.
Mr Alan Rawley QC, prosecuting, said three pieces of city-owned land had
been disposed of - two to Mr Monk and one to Mr Stewart - without being
advertised for tender. He said Mr Hatton prevailed on Mr Nelson and Mrs
Folan to make sure the businessmen got the land.
'Mr Hatton was rewarded handsomely for his efforts both by Mr Monk and Mr
Stewart, and some of the rewards flowed onwards to Mr Nelson and Mrs Folan,'
he said.
Mr Rawley described how Mr Stewart and Mr Monk became clients of Settleside,
a public relations company set up by Mr Hatton shortly before he ceased to
be a councillor in March 1987.
Mr Rawley said Mr Nelson had called for a council report on a piece of land.
But officers sent the document to a subcommittee, of which he was not a
member, which voted correctly for the land, a car park site, to be put out
to tender.
Mr Nelson ordered officers to telephone Mr Monk, who offered Pounds 10,000 a
year for a car park licence for the site. This was accepted by a
subcommittee. Mr Rawley said there had been no other offer for the land.
The case continues today.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Independent Ulster inquiry begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN international commission of inquiry seeking ways forward on Northern
Ireland begins three weeks of public hearings today in Belfast.
The commission is chaired by Professor Torkel Opsahl, an international human
rights lawyer and United Nations adviser. Other members include Mr Eamonn
Gallagher, the former EC director-general of Fisheries, and Lady Faulkner of
Downpatrick, a former BBC governor for Northern Ireland, whose husband Brian
was the last Stormont prime minister. The idea for the commission came from
Initiative '92, an independent non-political group formed two years ago by
Professor Simon Lee, a law professor at Queen's University, Belfast, and Mr
Robin Wilson, the editor of Fortnight, a local current affairs magazine.
It is funded by several charity groups led by the Joseph Rowntree Trust,
Barrow Cadbury, the Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust and the Nuffield
Foundation.
Prof Lee said yesterday: 'Our main aim is to broaden and deepen dialogue and
to prod the government and politicians into thinking of different ways
forward.'
Over the past eight months the commission has compiled more than 500 written
submissions from a broad cross-section of local public opinion, ranging from
Confederation of British Industry members to community-based groups.
Over the next two days it takes evidence from figures as diverse as Sir
Kenneth Bloomfield, former head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and
an as yet unnamed official of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Scottish reform costings disputed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT claims that its proposed reform of local government in Scotland
would lead to large cost savings have been challenged by Strathclyde
regional council, Scotland's largest local authority and the one most likely
to disappear if the reform goes ahead.
A council working party says savings would be much less - and transitional
costs far higher - than consultants Touche Ross calculated in a study for
the Scottish Office,
A Scottish Office green paper published in October proposes replacing the
nine regional councils, 53 district councils and three unitary island
councils with a single-tier structure. It made calculations on options
involving 15, 24, 35 and 51 unitary authorities.
Touche Ross said a 15-council structure would save Pounds 192m a year, 24
would save Pounds 120m, and 35 would save Pounds 55m. A 51-council
arrangement would cost Pounds 58m more.
Strathclyde says that reform would not lead to the big reduction in planning
and economic development costs envisaged by Touche Ross, and that savings in
central support services are overestimated. It says annual savings would
occur only if the government chose the 15-council model and would then only
amount to Pounds 71m. The other three models would produce higher annual
costs, with the 51-council structure costing Pounds 175m more.
The council says the consultants underestimated transitional costs,
including redundancy and residuary bodies' costs, and overestimated revenue
from property disposals.
Strathclyde says the transitional costs for 15 councils would be Pounds 333m
against the government estimate of Pounds 215m; for 24 councils it would be
Pounds 439m against Pounds 195m; for 35 councils it would be Pounds 476m
against Pounds 175m; and for 51 councils it would be Pounds 484m against
Pounds 159m.

FT  19 JAN 93 / People: Sir Robert Clark to chair bank boutique
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At 69, Sir Robert Clark, one of Britain's best-connected merchant bankers,
has finally got an investment bank with his own name on it. He has been made
chairman of Rauscher Pierce &amp; Clark, a London investment banking boutique,
being established by the Dallas-based firm, Rauscher Pierce Refnes.
The new boutique plans to marry Rauscher Pierce Refnes' strengths as the
leading investment bank in the US South West with the contacts of a group of
European investment bankers led by Sir Robert, who rose to prominence as a
merchant banker during his chairmanship of Hill Samuel from 1974 until it
was taken over by the TSB Group in 1987.
A former director of the Bank of England and vice chairman of TSB until
March 1991, Sir Robert is currently chairman of Mirror Group Newspapers,
vice chairman of SmithKline Beecham, and has a string of other directorships
including Shell Transport and Trading.
David Quint, a 42-year-old lawyer and managing director of the new firm,
says he has known Sir Robert for ten years having been introduced to him by
former Hoover boss Sir Peter Boon, a fellow director of Belden &amp; Blake, a
small US oil company.
Sir Robert and Quint visited three US regional firms before linking up with
Rauscher Pierce which has 25 offices around the US South West. The US firm
will have 25 per cent of the equity and Sir Robert will have 'almost the
same'.
Sir Robert said yesterday that it was nice to work 'for oneself for a
change' and he expected to devote about a third of his time to the new
venture. The advantage for the US parent is that its new European outpost -
it will also have a Zurich office - needs little capital and will have low
overheads. 'It only takes a couple of projects to make quite a difference,'
says Quint.
Sir Robert has recruited a couple of 'old friends' to his board - Richard
Butler, a former president of Paine Webber International, and James Ladner,
a Zurich-based investor and former executive vice president of Coutts' Swiss
bank. Rauscher Pierce will be represented on the board by David Smith, chief
executive, and Robert Brown, head of corporate finance.
*****
Pat Dyer, managing director - gases at BOC, has been appointed deputy
chairman of the BOC group. He will deputise for Patrick Rich, chairman and
chief executive, in a wide range of roles, allowing him to concentrate on
strategy and planning.
The group is also reorganising its divisional structure in an effort to
integrate its regional businesses more effectively and increase the spread
of its technology.
Chung Kong Chow, known in the business simply as 'CK', has been appointed to
the new position of group operating officer and chief executive of BOC
gases. He was previously director North Pacific gases.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont account of anonymous gift
'tenable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS SHOULD include anonymous gifts when they are registering their financial
interests, and should not simply regard ignorance of the donor's identities
as a reason for not admitting them, a cross-party Commons committee said
yesterday.
But the inquiry by the MPs' interests committee into complaints against Mr
Norman Lamont concluded that no action by the Commons should be taken
against the chancellor. The inquiry centred on Mr Lamont's failure to
declare the anonymous gift of Pounds 18,400 towards the legal costs of
evicting an unsatisfactory tenant from his London home
Its report said that in the absence of any clear ruling on the issue, Mr
Lamont's interpretation of the rules on interests was 'tenable'. He took the
view that he did not need to declare the gift because, as he did not know
its source, it could not be thought to affect his conduct.
Mr Lamont's aides shrugged off suggestions that the chancellor's judgment
had been criticised, but the report triggered renewed opposition attacks.
Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said that the
committee had 'let Mr Lamont off on a technicality', and Labour renewed
demands for the government to consult the Commons about new rules on
payments to ministers.
The committee issued a strong warning about anonymous gifts, saying they
'have the potential to be more compromising' to MPs and the public than
those where the donor is identified. 'Prudence suggests that a member of
parliament should not normally accept a gift or benefit profferred
anonymously,' it said. It also recommended that MPs seek guidance on which
payments should be registered.
The senior officials involved in deciding the Treasury's connection to Mr
Lamont's bill will be questioned by MPs tomorrow. The session with the
public accounts committee, which monitors government spending, will include
a rare appearance by the cabinet secretary, Sir Robin Butler.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clause four returns to opposition
agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S most sacred cow - the controversial clause four of its
constitution, widely interpreted as a commitment to state-ownership - is
soon to be drawn into the increasingly vocal and public debate over the
party's economic and industrial policies.
In spite of clear reluctance from the leadership to hold a potentially
explosive discussion of the clause, Mr Jack Straw is to publish a pamphlet
next month putting the case for its terms to be reworded.
Last week the shadow local government minister made his first tentative
attempt to put reform on the agenda by presenting his conclusions to a
meeting of the Tribune group - the soft-left grouping of the parliamentary
party.
Next month the Fabian Society will join the debate when it publishes a new
model constitution for the party that is expected to drop the clause in
favour of a new statement of essential aims and values.
However, only a week ago, Mr John Smith, the party leader, repeated his
scepticism over the value of a debate, telling Sir David Frost in a BBC
interview that it was a 'theological' issue of little importance on
electors' doorsteps.
Mr Straw nonetheless has indicated to shadow cabinet colleagues that he
disagrees with this view. He says that, while the clause itself may not be
raised, there is plenty of doorstep evidence that Labour is still perceived
as the party of nationalisation.
The clause, drawn up 75 years ago by Sidney Webb, led to a fierce split in
the party in the 1950s when Hugh Gaitskell, then leader, argued vigorously
for its abandonment against strong and ultimately successful opposition.
The clause's most contentious paragraph reads: 'To secure for the workers by
hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable
distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common
ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange . . . '
Defenders of the wording say that it is subject to wide-ranging
interpretation and does not represent a blanket commitment to state
ownership.
While some at last Wednesday's Tribune group meeting suggested that an open
debate could add a useful creative spur to reassessing Labour's goals,
others warned that it could be misinterpreted as the party abandoning its
core beliefs and 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater'.
Mr Straw yesterday said Labour should advocate a substantial scaling-down of
the British monarchy along the lines of the Dutch or Scandinavian models. He
told his Blackburn constituency that the current royal system 'with its
large number of participants and its emphasis on showbusiness has little
serious future'.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour split over Maastricht
tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EMERGING split in Labour ranks over tactics on the Maastricht bill has
given a boost to the government's hopes of defeating Tory opponents of the
treaty.
As government business managers gambled successfully last night on a vote to
force debate beyond 10pm, it emerged that prominent Labour pro-Europeans
have challenged their leadership's official policy of relentless tactical
opposition. Until now, Labour policy has been to join with Tory Euro-rebels
to oppose 'closure' motions that limit debate on hundreds of wrecking
amendments, in order to maximise disruption to the government's programme of
business.
But a number of pro-European Labour MPs are now warning that the party's
tactics risk undermining its European credentials while offering little
prospect of embarrassing the government. The divisions are expected to
emerge publicly tomorrow at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party.
In last night's vote on whether to press on with the debate, Labour again
opposed the government motion on the grounds that 'it is up to the
government to get its business through'.
But the support of all but one Liberal Democrat MP helped to ensure that the
government won the day by a margin of 33 votes (304-271). This left it free
to continue considering the bill into the night rather than calling a halt
to proceedings at 10pm.
Having made its point, the government moved just before midnight that the
debate on a group of amendments on industrial and commercial issues be
brought to a close. It won this 'closure' by a commanding majority of 238
votes (299-61).
Since Labour had made clear it would advise its MPs not to support the
substance of the first of this group of amendments if it came to a vote,
debate then moved to consideration of transport and energy issues into the
small hours.
Skilful government handling of the bill and the tacit support of smaller
parties have now allowed the government to win closure motions on three of
the 25 groups of amendments which must be debated in the committee stage -
with the transport and energy group representing the fourth.
The legislation is due to return to the Commons today for the second of
three consecutive days of detailed debate in its committee stage,
More than 85 Labour MPs last month signed a motion calling for the 'rapid
completion' of the treaty's ratification. Many of them now want the party
leadership to quietly abstain on closure motions as long as reasonable
parliamentary time is allocated.
The pro-European MPs believe that they can rely on the support of less
committed colleagues who have become exasperated at being forced to remain
constantly in the Commons simply to vote against closure motions.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Arrears of VAT rising, MPs told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARREARS OF value added tax have continued to rise in the past few months,
Sir Brian Unwin, chairman of the Customs and Excise department, said
yesterday.
Average daily arrears as a proportion of tax liabilities rose to 4.5 per
cent by November last year against 4.4 per cent 12 months previously and a
target of 3.8 per cent, Sir Brian told the Commons' public accounts
committee.
But he stressed that default surcharges levied against traders who
consistently did not pay had fallen since the year end from Pounds 132m to
Pounds 125m.
Half of the outstanding amounts were from traders which had gone bankrupt
and much of the remainder related to amounts of less than Pounds 200 each,
which were uneconomic to collect.
He told MPs that 2,200 jobs in the department would be subject to market
testing in the current year. There would be no testing in core functions
such as policy advice, tax assessment and determination of liability.
Debt collection would be subject to market testing, but Sir Brian said
careful controls would be installed by local offices to ensure there were no
risks of breaching confidentiality or generating conflicts of interest among
contractors.
He said the changes brought about in VAT administration by the creation of
the single European market should not increase collection costs, but might
increase fraud.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Businessmen back PM on team for
India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIALISTS yesterday endorsed the prime minister's decision to take
senior businessmen on his India trip next week - a move described from
Downing Street as part of efforts to create jobs and promote co-operation
between Whitehall and industry.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
who will be in the delegation, hailed the trip as symbolic while others said
prime ministerial involvement could help speed decision-making in India.
'To find a bit of prime ministerial time spent on promoting exports in a
very large but difficult market is something which cheers people up,' Mr
Davies said.
Businessmen from many of Britain's largest companies will accompany Mr
Major, who is travelling at the invitation of the Indian government.
Although not unprecedented, it is rare for prime ministers to take
businessmen on foreign trips.
The CBI told Mr Major at the end of last year that export promotion trips
should be higher on his agenda. The business leaders are expected to meet
counterparts in the country - and then report back to Mr Major and the
Indian prime minster.
If successful, Mr Major may consider taking businessmen on his other
overseas trips.
Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas and a member of the delegation,
said the prime minister's decision was a 'tangible expression' of the
government's willingness to work with industry. British Gas is involved in
several large projects in India including schemes in Delhi, Bombay and
Calcutta.
British Aerospace, whose chief executive Mr Dick Evans is going, said the
trip reinforced the seriousness with which UK companies took relations with
India, Britain's 20th largest export market.
The other industrialists are: Sir Brian Shaw, chairman, ANZ Grindlays Bank;
Mr Terry Harrison, chief executive of Rolls-Royce; Mr Norman Davis,

FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Discreet platform suits an
energetic advocate - The activities of the man behind the British Management
Data Foundation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO BE influential and discreet are among the main aims of the professional
lobbyist. On both counts, Mr Anthony Cowgill scores highly.
Mr Cowgill is director of the little-known British Management Data
Foundation, which represents 21 big UK companies. The foundation's chief
goal is to win better backing in Whitehall for the cause of manufacturing,
which many industrialists reckon the government did not take seriously
enough in the 1980s.
In the past three months the group - and other organisations putting similar
views - has seen its efforts at least partly rewarded.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, unveiled a modest package of measures to
help industry in the November Autumn Statement and Mr John Major has
stressed that the March Budget should follow similar principles. The prime
minister has talked about making the Civil Service more sympathetic to
industry.
Meanwhile, the Treasury is trying to foster better links with manufacturers,
partly to improve its knowledge of economic trends after its lack of success
in monitoring the longer than expected recession.
Mr Cowgill says: 'We are beginning to see a more receptive approach by the
government. And on the part of industry there has also been a change, with
less whingeing and more selectivity about the things it wants from the
politicians.'
The genial Mr Cowgill is a fit-looking 77, with a military manner stemming
from his 30-year career in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. He
left the army as a brigadier in 1969 to become chief industrial engineer
with Rolls-Royce, and set up the foundation in 1980, after taking over an
existing body that organised engineering studies.
He gradually made the foundation more concerned with broad policymaking,
though it continues to act as a forum for debate about specific industrial
issues, from robotics to accounting standards and energy pricing.
The foundation's main role is to set up meetings involving its member
companies and the government. There were about 40 such gatherings last year,
most of them receiving little or no publicity.
Normally these talks involve are senior managers rather than company
chairmen or main-board directors. The industry representatives do not have
to repeat company views, but say what they really think about specific
issues.
Mr James Plant, production executive at Wellcome, a member of the
foundation, says: 'It is more of a sounding board than a platform.'
In keeping with this goal of encouraging dialogue rather than pushing fixed
ideas, Mr Cowgill does not like to call himself a lobbyist. He prefers the
term 'illuminator of facts'.
Mr Cowgill describes his organisation - which provided him with a Pounds
35,000 salary last year - as a 'Mickey Mouse outfit'. He runs the foundation
from a converted garage in his Gloucestershire home overlooking the
Cotswolds.
Within the small world of people who know about it, the foundation is highly
rated. Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of Lucas, a member of
the foundation, says it is a 'well-meaning organisation out to improve
understanding'. Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI, another member,
says: 'It has provided people in industry access to people at high levels in
government they would not otherwise meet.'
Membership of the group costs Pounds 5,000 a year and is by invitation of Mr
Cowgill. It features a range of companies representing many sectors. In this
way, says Mr Cowgill, the group can be more representative of industry than
a trade association, while less unwieldy than a group such as the
Confederation of British Industry which represents hundreds of companies.
The foundation's full list of corporate members is: Allied-Lyons, Allied
Steel, Associated Octel, British Coal, British Gas, British Nuclear Fuels,
Ferranti, Greenalls, ICI, ICL, Lucas, Marks and Spencer, National Power,
National Grid, Nuclear Electric, PowerGen, Rolls-Royce, Shell UK, Simon
Engineering, TI Group and Wellcome. Cranfield Institute of Technology is a
member.
Perhaps the most important regular gathering is at 10 Downing Street with Mr
Gus O'Donnell, the prime minister's press secretary. He meets about 10
people from the group roughly once a quarter for an informal discussion.
These gatherings started about two years ago, and follow on from similar
meetings which Mr Cowgill arranged with Sir Bernard Ingham, who was
spokesman for Lady Thatcher when she was prime minister.
Other recent discussions have involved the Department of Trade and Industry,
the Employment Department and the Bank of England.
Mr O'Donnell says he passes on ideas from the meetings to Mr Major. He adds:
'The gatherings are a useful way to find out about how people in industry
see the economy, and for them to pass on grouses.'
According to Mr Malcolm Edwards, former marketing director of British Coal
and now an independent energy adviser, the most recent Downing Street
discussions had a big effect on influencing Mr Major to come out with
statements asking banks to reduce the cost of business loans by passing on
to customers a bigger proportion of recent base rate cuts.
Many of Mr Cowgill's associates say his personality vital to the
foundation's function. Mr John Collins, a former TI executive who is
director of design and manufacturing at Cranfield, says Mr Cowgill has
'extraordinary' energy and initiative. Mr Stuart Pratt, head of automation
at Rolls-Royce, says: 'He never forgets a name or a face.'
As for his own views about industry, Mr Cowgill thinks Britain has become
too involved with the rest of Europe and that politicians should spend more
time making sure UK businesses can compete on a global scale.
He says the government should refuse to sign the Maastricht treaty and was
delighted when Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism, which he
says was keeping the exchange rate and also interest rates at an
artificially high level.
'The members of the foundation know my views (on Europe), and I may annoy
those who think differently,' says Mr Cowgill. 'Sometimes I walk a
tightrope, especially when I am in a discussion with the government, but
normally I try to keep in the background and let others do the talking.'

FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Trident dockyard decision delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of an early decision on the contract for refitting Trident
submarines - for which the Rosyth and Devonport naval dockyards are rivals -
receded yesterday. Downing Street emphasised that there would be a period of
consultation when the government published its view and that the
announcement would not come until some time next month.
Previous postponement of the decision, originally expected last year, has
already highlighted its sensitivity. That was intensified by complaints from
Rosyth about unfair treatment of its bid for the contract. The work is
crucial to the long-term survival of both yards.
Officials denied recent reports of a cabinet sub-committee meeting due today
to determine the dockyards' future, and insisted that Mr John Major had not
yet taken a decision.
Babcock Thorn, the consortium which runs Rosyth, believes that Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, is recommending awarding the contract to
Devonport, with Rosyth being given some surface fleet work as a consolation
prize.
With fresh government emphasis on consultation, pressure on behalf of both
dockyards will continue after ministers have announced their preferred
course.
The Rosyth campaign will lobby parliament on Thursday, and has asked two
cross-party committees of MPs - on defence and Scottish affairs - to
investigate whether Rosyth was treated evenhandedly.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Flats face dearer terror insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OWNERS of flats in areas judged by insurers to be vulnerable to
terrorist attack could face sizeable increases in insurance premiums.
The increase, which could be up to Pounds 180 a year for a flat worth Pounds
200,000, may be necessary because insurers want to bring large blocks of
flats into a pool to cover terrorist damage, financed by a special charge on
policyholders.
The proposal is on the agenda at a meeting this week at which the
Association of British Insurers and the Department of Trade and Industry
will discuss details of how the pool will work. Insurers agreed last month
to establish the pool after the government said it would provide reinsurance
cover.  Following losses of Pounds 800m from an IRA bomb attack in April,
insurers announced in November that cover against terrorism would no longer
be made automatically to owners of commercial property.
It had been assumed that cover for residential properties would be
unaffected. Mr Tony Baker of the Association of British Insurers said,
however: 'Insurance companies want flats to be in the pool. They can't take
them on their own books.'
Mr Baker said yesterday that some leaseholders could be affected where the
freehold of their building was owned by an outside landowner.
Commercial policyholders will pay voluntary levies on top of existing
premiums to obtain cover through the terrorism pool. These levies will vary
according to the location and value of properties.
It is understood that up to Pounds 5m, most policyholders would face
increases of between 0.018 per cent and 0.09 per cent of the value of the
property depending on its location.
The rate would fall progressively to between 0.007 per cent and 0.023 per
cent for properties valued in excess of Pounds 500m.
Other issues on the agenda will include the liabilities of insurance
companies for any terrorism claims on policies bought before the exclusion
clause was introduced but which will remain in force until later this year.
Meanwhile, an industrial risk manager suggested that the charges for
properties based in central London were 'excessively penal'. Mr Alan Fleming
of the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce,
which represents more than 300 companies, suggested the cost of the scheme
should be spread more widely.

Plans for a six-lane road through Oxleas Wood in south-east London, one of
the capital's last pieces of ancient woodland, were called 'unlawful and
irrational' in the High Court yesterday. Nine residents hope to get
compulsory purchase orders declared unlawful. They say the road would
destroy rare habitats and bring pollution. The European Commission said last
week that Britain was to be pursued under EC law for failure to publish an
environmental assessment of the scheme. The High Court case continues today

THE LAW Society and the Bar have put together a package of cost-cutting

eligibility announced in the 1992 Autumn Statement.
The lawyers' proposals are calculated to save Pounds 43m - the savings in

MR TIM EGGAR, the energy minister, met industrial leaders yesterday to hear
their concerns about rising electricity prices. The meeting followed reports
that the government is looking at ways to enable large industrial users of
electricity to tap into the power system more cheaply.
British Steel, a member of the group, said that nothing had been resolved at
the meeting. 'If anything is going we would like a slice of it,' the
corporation said.
It added that it could not 'emphasise too much that we are paying 30 per
cent more for our energy than our non-UK competitors'.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Pilkington prices to increase 8%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the glass group, has told UK customers that its prices will rise
8 per cent from February 1. Its glass is used by the motor and construction
industries.
Glass prices have fallen sharply through the recession, and with volumes
declining as well, Pilkington's UK operations fell into loss. UK float glass
prices have fallen more than 20 per cent since September 1990 and last
summer the group cut its dividend.
Previous attempts to increase prices failed as imports undercut Pilkington.
Following the fall in sterling last autumn, however, Pilkington has started
to rebuild market share in the UK and is now more optimistic that a price
rise will hold.
Pilkington shares rose 4p to 111p yesterday.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Nationwide to close 58 estate agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE, the second largest building society, yesterday announced that it
is to close 58 of its 361 estate agency branches with the loss of 300 jobs,
after a year-long review of its estate agency business, John Gapper writes.
Nationwide said the move indicated its continued confidence in the rest of
its estate agency business, which last year lost Pounds 12m.
The society said it would see whether staff made redundant could be offered
jobs elsewhere, but it was not confident that many vacancies would be
identified. It said there were likely to be compulsory redundancies.
Mr Brian Davis, operations director, said the closure of loss-making
branches was a 'reaffirmation' of the society's faith in estate agency.
Chains of estate agents acquired by societies in the late 1980s have largely
made losses.
Mr Davis said the society was continually looking at its costs, although
Nationwide's cost-income ratio of 55.2 per cent - the sixth highest among
the 25 largest building societies - reflected its wide range of services. He
added that the branches identified for closure were not particularly
concentrated in any region.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Building society profits 'resilient'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES survived the downturn in the housing market better than
expected last year and will soon announce falls in pre-tax profits averaging
only 7 per cent, according to a confidential survey by stockbrokers UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
The survey found only a slight fall in profitability in spite of a 62 per
cent rise in the level of provisions for bad mortgage debts - from Pounds
1.2bn in 1991 to about Pounds 1.92bn in the year to December 1992. It
appears that profits were resilient in spite of earlier fears that they
would be badly affected by debt provisions. There had been concern that
several societies could be forced to merge or declare losses in the coming
results season.
Societies are thought to have weathered high levels of provisions by
widening the margins between the interest paid on savings products and that
received from mortgages, as base rates fell in the second half of the year.
Too strong a series of profit announcements from the societies over the next
two months could, however, provoke a public backlash because they have
already faced scrutiny from politicians over their widening of margins.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
said he could not comment on the results of the survey, but he expected the
industry to show strong profitability when the results were declared.
Mr Wriglesworth said the fact that many societies had largely maintained
profitability in spite of the rise in provisions showed the inherent
strength of the industry and the control societies exercised over margins.
Although the overall rise in provisions for the industry was found to be 62
per cent, the average rise per society was 80 per cent because smaller
societies have had to raise debt provisions by a greater amount.
The UBS Phillips &amp; Drew survey was compiled by asking societies to predict
their results on the guarantee of confidentiality.
Mr Malcolm Barr, Leeds president, told its annual meeting yesterday it had
cut the number of mortgage payers in arrears, helped by lower interest
rates.
He said long-term arrears were higher than a year before at the end of the
financial year on September 30. They now stood 2.5 per cent lower than a
year ago, however, and short-term arrears were 27 per cent lower.
The society has already announced that pre-tax profits fell by 20 per cent
after a rise in provisions to Pounds 105.3m from Pounds 44.3m in 1991.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Delay for equality in senior jobs forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN will need at least 25 years to achieve equality in British management
according to Lady Howe, who chairs Opportunity 2000, the private-sector
initiative to promote the position of women in industry.
Lady Howe, speaking at the launch of an initiative to promote flexible
working among managers, was responding to critics of Opportunity 2000 who
say it has been insufficiently forceful in changing attitudes.
She said attitudes were gradually changing and 'macho' management was
becoming rarer - but she added that it would still take 25 years for women
to achieve equality with men.
A survey on flexible work for managers found 76 per cent of respondents
cited childcare responsibilities as their reason for seeking part-time or
flexible work. The survey was sponsored by National Westminster Bank.
Mr Martin Gray, chief executive of the bank's branch business, said new ways
of working need not damage performance and that companies benefit from
retaining qualified staff. He said 1,200 staff and managers at NatWest
either work part-time, share a job or work from home, and that 120 people
had applied for the last management job that involved working from home.
Ms Helen Dawson of the Local Government Management Board warned that
momentum towards more flexible working in local government had been lost
because of pressures associated with contracting-out.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Ward jury told of missing documents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCUMENTS relating to the Pounds 5.2m allegedly stolen from Guinness by Mr
Thomas Ward, the US lawyer, went missing after his attorney went through
files on Mr Ward's transactions, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
The files were held in the offices of Mr Michael Dee, a Jersey-based company
administrator who looked after Marketing and Acquisition Consultants, a
company owned by Mr Ward, the court was told.
Mr Dee, a witness for the prosecution, said that in December 1986, Mr
William Dwyer, Mr Ward's attorney, had been allowed to review the files on
MAC. He was left alone in Mr Dee's offices for a hour or two to do this.
When Mr Dee next looked at the files there were 'one or two' documents he
could no longer find, he said.
These included a file note recording Mr Ward's instructions to transfer
Pounds 3m of the Pounds 5.2m to the Swiss bank account of Mr Ernest
Saunders, the former Guinness chief executive, he said.
A file note was 'in all probability' kept of Mr Ward's original instructions
to invoice Guinness for the Pounds 5.2m. After Mr Dwyer's visit, there was
no such note on the files, he went on.
Mr Ward is charged with the theft of the Pounds 5.2m from Guinness, and
single charges of false accounting and procuring the execution of a valuable
security in connection with the alleged theft. He denies all the charges.
Mr Dee said he had personally submitted the invoice to Guinness for the
Pounds 5.2m which Mr Ward claims was his success fee for assisting in the
company's successful takeover of Distillers in 1986.
Mr Ward, instructing Mr Dee, had told him the payment was for services he
and others had provided to Guinness during the takeover, he said.
The trial continues today.

27.1 per cent in the last quarter of 1992 compared with 13 per cent in the
previous quarter according to a survey by leisure consultants Horwath,
Michael Skapinker writes.
Although 72.9 per cent said they did not think the hotel industry had begun
to recover, this compared with 87 per cent in the previous quarter.
The number of hoteliers who were optimistic about the first quarter of this
year rose from 32 per cent to 35 per cent, while the proportion who were
pessimistic fell to 40 per cent from 47 per cent.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Regions showing signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Regional Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEAK recovery has started in the Yorkshire and Humberside region,
according to the latest survey of business performance by the region's
chambers of commerce.
Similar surveys in north-east England and Cumbria, and in the east Midlands,
also show a modest increase in sales and orders in the last quarter of 1992.
This repeats the experience of companies in north-west England, the west
Midlands and north Wales reported by regional chambers earlier this month.
Yorkshire and Humberside, with the largest regional canvass of companies,
said the return of sales and orders to the levels recorded just after last
April's general election could mean 'some economic recovery in 1993, barring
any minor setbacks'.
But in the north-east, the Northern Development Company and the Teesside and
Tyne and Wear chambers said business performance was still some way below
the levels achieved during the first half of 1992.
In the east Midlands, Mr Mike Hadfield, regional chairman of the chambers,
observed 'the fact that business confidence, although at the same levels as
12 months ago, is beginning to return'.
Despite the slightly improving commercial climate, the chambers of the three
regions are not optimistic about jobs.
'Business confidence is returning but consumer sentiment is still being
affected by mounting unemployment,' said Mr Peter Coles-Johnson, chief
executive of the Leeds chamber.
The three latest surveys, however, disclose improved export prospects,
especially in the north-east and Cumbria where, of 769 companies responding,
47.8 per cent reported higher sales and orders. Yorkshire and Humberside
chambers attributed the stronger export trend to devaluation but warned
that, given the slowdown in Germany, the region's largest export market,
this may not last.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Ministers study pay options for dentists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIONS ON how dentists should be paid, ranging from tinkering with the
much-criticised system to a radical restructuring of the dental health
service, were presented to ministers yesterday.
The review of dentists' remuneration makes no recommendations but sets out
possible improvements. It was launched by the government last July to defuse
a crisis that led to dentists threatening to leave the health service and a
vote to stop taking new NHS patients.
There will be long consultation before ministers decide how to proceed. It
appears the setting up of the review, chaired by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield,
former head of the Civil Service in Northern Ireland, has helped to defuse
the dispute between dentists and the government.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said after receiving the report that in
the past six months there had been a net loss of only 15 dentists in the
health service.
The review has underlined the lack of consensus both inside and outside the
dental profession on what should be done to upgrade the service and make it
more cost effective.
The only agreement seems to be that the status quo is unsatisfactory.
The options presented by Sir Kenneth include relatively minor changes to the
complex system under which the country's 18,000 dentists are paid by
reimbursement for practice expenses, fees for specific treatment, and bulk
payments for the number of patients signed up.
Radical reforms might include limiting treatment available under the health
service, or further restricting those eligible for free or subsidised dental
care. The report favours keeping free treatment for children, but not
neces-sarily for all pregnant women.

FT  19 JAN 93 / NCP chief executive 'spied on rival': Court hears that SAS
founder's firm was hired for industrial espionage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chief executive of National Car Parks hired a security firm started by
the founder of the Special Air Service to embark on industrial espionage
against Europarks, his main business rival, an Old Bailey jury heard
yesterday.
Europarks directors were followed to their homes, their dustbins were
searched for confidential information and a former woman Army captain
tricked her way into a secretarial job to gain access to business secrets,
said Mr David Paget, prosecuting.
Mr Gordon Layton, NCP chief executive, hired KAS, a security firm set up by
Colonel David Stirling, founder of the SAS, after Europarks began winning
lucrative contracts for car parks, Mr Paget said.
Mr Layton was concerned there was a leak from NCP to Europarks and wanted to
know how the company was getting business in the teeth of competition from
his own enterprise.
'The object . . . was so NCP could find out how Europarks worked, and
inevitably that information would be used for the benefit of NCP and place
at risk and cause loss to the business of Europarks,' he said.
At that time KAS was managed by Mr Ian Crook, a former Army colonel. When he
was out of the country Mr Simon Hewitt took over, Mr Paget said.
Mr Layton and Mr Hewitt both deny conspiring with Mr Crook, former Army
captain Ms Jane Turpin and others to defraud Europarks by dishonestly
acquiring information relating to its business affairs between January 1987
and November 1989.
Mr Hewitt also denies obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception in June
1989, when it is alleged he dishonestly obtained the opportunity for Ms
Turpin to earn money by working for Europarks.
Mr Crook is not facing charges as he lives in South Africa.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Xmas retail trade below estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE boost to retail trade in the last few days before Christmas failed to
lift December sales above levels of a year ago, the Confederation of British
Industry reports today.
The CBI distributive trades survey contradicts anecdotal evidence of a
pick-up to shop sales last month, showing instead that many retailers had a
disappointing Christmas.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said,
however, that the results were an improvement on recent months. Sales this
month were expected to be up on a year ago.
Sales are reported to have fallen on a year-on-year basis for three
successive months. In December the balance between retailers reporting an
increase in sales and those reporting a decrease was minus 4, compared with
plus 5 in December 1991. In November the balance was minus 9.
The CBI noted a marked discrepancy between the performance of big retailers,
which indicated that their sales were up, and small retailers - employing
fewer than 200 people - which did badly.
It also believes that consumers have become more discerning and may have
been waiting for the January sales before making significant purchases.
Specialist food shops, off-licences, bookshops, stationers and DIY retailers
were among those which suffered a particularly dismal month. Off-licences
said sales had declined significantly year-on-year for five successive
months.
Business was better for confectioners, tobacconists, newsagents, chemists
and clothing retailers, whose sales were higher than in December 1991. The
survey was conducted between December 16 and January 6. The CBI says its
findings suggest it is too early to talk of a sustained recovery in consumer
spending.
Mr Whittaker said: 'Consumers are cautious . . . The cuts in interest rates
in the autumn have not yet had their full impact on consumer spending.'
Economists expect official figures due tomorrow to show a small increase on
the month, but a more substantial rise - about 2 per cent - on the year.
The CBI reported that motor trades had the best month in December, with
sales increasing against expectations. Although sales for the time of year
continued to be poor, they improved on November, with sales of vehicles
increasing and sales of parts and accessories falling.
Wholesalers reported a year-on-year decline in sales for the third
successive month. The survey said they were able to reduce stocks in
December following cuts in orders placed with suppliers.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Key posts for rail sell-off are filled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yes-terday chose a lawyer and a former merchant banker for
two positions at the centre of its plans for implementing the privatisation
of British Rail.
They are Mr John Swift QC, an expert in competition law who is to become the
rail regulator, and Mr Roger Salmon, a former director at merchant bank NM
Rothschild who is to become director of passenger rail franchising.
Mr Swift, 52, will play a key role, ensuring that train operators -
passenger and freight - get fair access to the railway tracks at an
acceptable price. He will also be responsible for protecting rail
passengers' interests.
Mr Salmon, 46, who is now chairman of Cuff and Co, a family business, will
be responsible for franchising private-sector companies to take over the
operation of BR's passenger services and making sure they fulfil their
obligations once the franchises are awarded.
The latest appointments follow the government's decision last month to
install Mr Bob Horton, former chairman and chief executive of British
Petroleum, as vice-chairman of BR with special responsibility for setting up
Railtrack, the state-owned authority that will own BR's tracks.
Completion of these appointments emphasises the government's determination
to press on with rail privatisation in spite of sharp criticism of its plans
from the rail lobby, opposition parties and some Conservatives.
The last obstacle to the introduction of the necessary legislation appeared
to have been cleared yesterday when the paving bill completed its passage in
the Lords.
That means the government is on course to introduce the privatisation
legislation, known as the Railways Bill, to the Commons on Thurs-day.
Mr Robert Adley, chairman of the Commons transport committee which is
hearing evidence on the government's plans, intends to anticipate the bill
tomorrow by publishing an interim report of the committee's findings.
Mr Adley, a Conservative backbencher and railway enthusiast, has made no
secret of his hostility to the government's proposals. The report is,
however, expected to adopt a measured tone.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Court hears of Hatton 'backhanders'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DEREK HATTON, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, lobbied
Labour councillors in Liverpool to influence land deals in return for
illegal 'backhanders', Mold Crown Court, Clwyd was told yesterday.
Mr Hatton, with Mr John Nelson and Mrs Hannah Folan, also former Labour
councillors, and businessmen Mr Roy Stewart and Mr John Monk, deny charges
of conspiracy to defraud the council.
Mr Alan Rawley QC, prosecuting, said three pieces of city-owned land had
been disposed of - two to Mr Monk and one to Mr Stewart - without being
advertised for tender. He said Mr Hatton prevailed on Mr Nelson and Mrs
Folan to make sure the businessmen got the land.
'Mr Hatton was rewarded handsomely for his efforts both by Mr Monk and Mr
Stewart, and some of the rewards flowed onwards to Mr Nelson and Mrs Folan,'
he said.
Mr Rawley described how Mr Stewart and Mr Monk became clients of Settleside,
a public relations company set up by Mr Hatton shortly before he ceased to
be a councillor in March 1987.
Mr Rawley said Mr Nelson had called for a council report on one site, but
officers sent the document to a sub-committee, of which he was not a member,
which voted correctly for the car park site to be put out to tender.
Mr Nelson ordered officers to telephone Mr Monk, who offered Pounds 10,000 a
year for a car park licence for the site. This was accepted by a
sub-committee.
Mr Rawley said Settleside had an interest in the second car park site. He
said entries in Mr Hatton's diary, one of which read '1,000-H', related to
Pounds 1,000 in cash which Mrs Folan received after overriding a council
official's recommendation that the car park should go to tender.
The money was later shown to have been paid into the joint mortgage account
of Mrs Folan and a man with whom she was living.
A document found when Mr Hatton's premises were searched had figures which
he suggested showed Mr Hatton and Mr Monk sharing Pounds 500 a week from the
takings of one car park and Pounds 150 a week each from the other.
The case continues today.

OPTIONS ON how dentists should be paid, ranging from tinkering with the

Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said after receiving the report
yesterday that in the past six months there had been a net loss of only 15

cut in fees), but those who suggested a lot of dentists would behave

not necessarily for all pregnant women.
The report says that 'a greater concentration of available resources on
providing a smaller number of treatments could (subject to proper controls)
lead to a desirable shift in emphasis from quantity to quality'.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Lawyers propose legal aid savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW Society and the Bar have put together a package of cost-cutting
measures designed to replace the government's proposed cuts in legal aid
eligibility announced in the 1992 Autumn Statement, Robert Rice writes.
The lawyers' proposals are calculated to save Pounds 43m - the savings in
the legal aid budget that Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, has said he must
find to meet Treasury targets in 1993-94. Their proposals include:
A pay freeze for legal aid lawyers in 1993-94. That would save Pounds 15m
assuming the government had planned a 1.5 per cent increase in fees in
April.
Ceasing to pay for a solicitor's representative to attend court with a
barrister in most legal aid cases. At the moment all barristers must be
accompanied by a representative of the instructing solicitors. This could
save Pounds 9.1m in criminal cases, Pounds 3m in family cases and Pounds 2m
in other civil cases.
Removal of the need for lawyers to attend court for unopposed adjournments
in magistrates' courts. This could save Pounds 11.6m.
Removal of the need to pay for a junior barrister as well as a QC in a
substantial number of legal aid cases. This would save Pounds 1m.
Cost penalties on legally-aided matrimonial litigants where there is clear
evidence of an uncooperative approach to divorce or separation. This could
save Pounds 2m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party should take advantage of the new relationship emerging
between government and business and strike a 'socialist deal' with the
corporate sector, says a paper published today by the Institute for Public
Policy Research, the leftwing think tank.
Written by Mr Roger Warren Evans, regional property director for the J.
Sainsbury supermarket chain, the paper says the consumer society has shifted
power decisively towards the corporate sector while the process of
globalisation has drained it away from national governments.
The task for Labour, he says, is to reach a mutually beneficial
understanding with managers who have been alienated from governments of the
Thatcher era which refused to plan long-term investment.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Haiti military yields to UN over talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAITI'S military rulers have yielded to growing international pressure and
say they are willing to discuss the restoration of democracy in the country.
Until now, they have resisted efforts to restore the Caribbean republic's
elected president since a coup nearly 16 months ago.
The change in the military's position, indicated in a letter from General
Raoul Cedras, the army chief, to Mr Dante Caputo, a United Nations special
envoy, still leaves unclear whether the army leaders will agree to retire.
Their departure from the army is one of the persistent demands of Father
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's exiled president.
The military has made its apparent concession in response to the UN's
increasing role in trying to have Fr Aristide restored to the presidential
palace, following a year of failed efforts by the Organisation of American
States.
Diplomats in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, said yesterday that Gen
Cedras's decision - over the objections of Mr Marc Bazin, the army-appointed
prime minister - was the result of a growing realisation that the UN would
adopt stronger measures against the country, including the tightening of the
economic embargo.
Mr Caputo said Gen Cedras had agreed to the deployment of an international
observer force in Haiti, and to the start of discussions on ending the
crisis. Those discussions are likely to deal with the appointment of a
mutually acceptable interim prime minister and the conditions under which Fr
Aristide can return to the country.
Army leaders have previously insisted privately that Fr Aristide would not
be allowed back into Haiti 'under any conditions.'
Aides of the deposed president have said he wants the Haitian military to
accept an agreement brokered just under a year ago for the appointment of an
interim premier, which was scuttled when soldiers threatened legislators
before they could ratify it.
A solution of Haiti's political crisis will be high on the foreign policy
agenda of US President-elect Bill Clinton, who is concerned about a flood of
refugees. Both he and Fr Aristide have told Haitians to stay at home and the
US coast guard has tightened its cordon against refugees from Haiti.
Said one diplomat: 'To get the army to go along with any plan which will put
them out of effective control while restoring Mr Aristide will take some
doing.'

FT  19 JAN 93 / Cool campaign chief to take the trade reins - Nancy Dunne
examines the challenges facing Mickey Kantor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN he comes before the Senate finance committee today for his confirmation
hearing, Mr Mickey Kantor can claim one attribute possessed by none of the
other would-be US trade representatives. As chairman of the Clinton campaign
he took his seat on the roller coaster well before his rivals came aboard.
In fact it was Mr Kantor's cool leadership that helped guide the
president-elect through his worst crisis: the affair of Gennifer Flowers,
the candidate's self-described former mistress.
He is so trusted by Mr Clinton that it was surprising when the
president-elect selected others to oversee the presidential transition.
Instead Mr Kantor was given the chore of setting up last month's widely
applauded Little Rock economic conference, and he became the only campaign
official to be nominated for a cabinet post.
In Washington, where he is little known, the appointment was greeted with
some gloom as Mr Kantor has had little experience with trade. One of the
kindest remarks made of him since his nomination came from Mrs Carla Hills,
the current trade representative, who briefed him and called him 'a willing
learner'. Another senior US trade official dismissed worries: 'Trade isn't
exactly quantum physics, you know.'
Mr Kantor has been portrayed in the press as just another lobbyist, whose
long list of clients has included NEC, the Japanese electronics
conglomerate, Atlantic Richfield, Philip Morris, Occidental Petroleum, and
Martin Marietta. It has been suggested that Mr Clinton, who promised in his
new order to 'put people first', will continue to let corporate interests
hold sway in Washington.
Mr Kantor and his friends are likely to find this view ironic. Born in
Tennessee, he grew up during the worst school integration battles and became
an ardent civil rights supporter.
He began his career as a poverty lawyer, focusing on the rights of migrant
farm workers, and founded the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, which is
designed to teach discipline to urban teenagers. He was also a member of the
Christopher Commission, under the soon-to-be secretary of state Warren
Christopher, which was charged with recommending reforms for the Los Angeles
Police Department.
Mr Kantor began working for the election of liberal Democrats in California
in the 1970s, and supported former Governor Jerry Brown, later one of Mr
Clinton's opponents for the Democratic nomination. In 1974 he threw himself
into the campaign for former Vice-President Walter Mondale. Among
politicians he is seen as hardworking, tough and highly efficient.
He is also sometimes sharp-tongued; he criticised Mr Brown for 'giving
hypocrisy a bad name'.
His prestige was not boosted by the way in which Mr Clinton chose him as
trade representative. He was not included in the economic team, which was
the first batch of appointments, and was the last cabinet member to be a
named. This came in a last-minute flurry to finish all key appointments by
Christmas.
The post reportedly had been offered to Mr Ron Brown, who chose to be
commerce secretary and who announced at his confirmation hearing that the
Commerce Department would lead the way on trade policy.
Mr Clinton then met Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and promised
to appoint one person to take charge of completing side agreements on the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Clinton camp, perhaps realising that Mr Kantor had once again been
slighted, suggested that the person in charge would be Mr Kantor.
Congressman Kika de la Garza, chairman of the agriculture committee who met
Mr Kantor, said the new position could be akin to ambassador on Mexican
affairs in the State Department.
Intelligent and able as Mr Kantor may be as a legal negotiator, he still has
to learn the Uruguay Round portfolio. He is being urged by at least one
influential private-sector lobbyist to call for an overall reassessment of
the Round, during which he would consult with Congress, business groups and
US trading partners. He would then be able to ask for an extension of the
fast-track negotiating authority.
Mr Kantor is also likely to face pressure for an early decision on whether
or not to retaliate against Japan for its failure to abide by a
market-opening agreement on semi-conductors.
He will find much on his plate and many critics ready to pounce if he fails
to take a firm grip on the trade reins.

FT  19 JAN 93 / No rain falling on this parade: Washington is enjoying the
party despite Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE last time the leader of the 'out' party took over the White House,
national attention was divided. Jimmy Carter spent most of his last morning
as president hanging on the telephone, waiting to hear news from Tehran that
the aircraft carrying the US hostages had taken off.
In what was seen in the US as a last, cruel twist of the knife by Ayatollah
Khomeini, it was nearly two hours into Ronald Reagan's presidency before the
word was received in Washington.
There is a similar sense pervading Bill Clinton's inaugural week, with the
US-led coalition engaged in air raids and dogfights in Iraq, with President
Saddam Hussein continuing to blare defiance and with President George Bush,
looking grim and serious, tucked away at Camp David in Maryland's Catoctin
mountains, issuing his final orders.
Mr Clinton, indeed, might well set a record for a new president by having to
authorise more offensive action in a distant part of the world within hours
of moving into the Oval Office.
But the late night briefings by General Colin Powell and his more carefully
phrased public utterances on Iraq are not spoiling his party. If the first
two days are anything to go by, this may prove one of the more memorable
celebrations of the transfer of power.
Sunday's 'reunion' on the Mall, against the floodlit backdrop of the Lincoln
Memorial, was everything it was cracked up to be. Surely never has there
been a finer fireworks display, rattling windows all across the nation's
capital, while not even Mr Reagan, a product of Hollywood, could assemble
the galaxy of entertainment stars performing in a president-elect's honour.
Finally, Mr Clinton seemed to catch the sense that he was about to become
president. For once he was not operating on what has become known as Clinton
Standard Time, in which the timing of all appointments and engagements is
strictly notional. He was only four minutes late arriving at the Lincoln
Memorial from Charlottesville, Virginia, on Sunday and did not drop in for a
chat at McDonald's on his dawn run down Pennsylvania Avenue yesterday
morning.
Mr Clinton's words also matched the spirit of the moment. In a mercifully
brief speech, he invoked Lincoln's 'better angels of our nature' to guide
his presidency. Earlier, in Monticello, he was asked by a young boy what
cabinet post he would give Thomas Jefferson if he were alive. 'I'd make him
secretary of state, then Al and I would resign, so he could become president
again,' he said. Mr Gore, more predictably, talked of Jefferson's
environmental qualifications.
Yesterday was Martin Luther King Day, a national holiday in most of the
country. The great civil rights leader had delivered his immortal 'I have a
dream' speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and yesterday morning
Mr Clinton paid further tribute to him in an address at Howard University,
Washington's overwhelmingly black college.
His widow, Mrs Coretta Scott King, had her mind on something else yesterday
as she criticised the raids on Iraq. Perhaps it was her way of reminding Mr
Clinton that there is a real and troubled world out there that not even the
most fabulous of Washington parties can conceal for more than a few days.

FT  19 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Chile closes book on pioneering debt-swap
experiment - Foreign investors are now free to rethink their strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAPPILY for Chile's central bank the growth of direct foreign investment and
the strength of the economy have done away with the need for special
incentives such as debt-equity conversions. But the effects of the
pioneering scheme are still working their way through the Chilean financial
system.
The bank is expecting a significant increase in profit remittances this year
after relaxing the rules for foreign investors who acquired Chilean assets
through such swaps.
Contrary to expectations the central bank is relishing the prospect of a
wider current account deficit - forecast to double to 3 per cent of GDP in
1993 - to ease a dollar glut which is putting pressure on the exchange rate
and complicating monetary management.
Chile's net international reserves climbed from Dollars 6.6bn to Dollars 9bn
(Pounds 5.9bn) in 1992, enough to cover a year of imports and equivalent to
roughly half its foreign debt. The dollar bounty - product of a healthy
trade surplus and net capital inflows - was inconceivable during the lean
1980s, when Chile pioneered debt-equity swaps to lighten its foreign debt.
Between 1985 and 1991 Chile retired an estimated Dollars 10.5bn of foreign
debt through debt conversions, most into equity in Chilean companies.
To help nudge some of the dollar inflows out of the country the bank has
lifted all restrictions on the repatriation of capital and profits, subject
to a 3 per cent exit fee on the original value of the debt-equity swap.
Previously these investments were subject to a four-year wait for profit
remittances, while the capital was tied in Chile for 10 years.
However, remarkably few multinationals appear so far to be taking up the
offer. Unless a parent company is in financial straits at home,
multinationals have chosen to plough profits into their Chilean businesses,
which have been providing handsome returns. The central bank's 'very rough
estimate' for 1992 places net reinvested profits at up to Dollars 700m, of
which Dollars 400m correspond to debt-equity investments.
Another rough estimate places the stock of foreign direct investment in
Chile within the Dollars 10bn-Dollars 13bn range - roughly 30 per cent of
GDP. About Dollars 4bn of this was acquired through debt-equity conversions.
Bankers Trust, one of the earliest and most successful debt-swappers, has
also been the first this year to call in part of its investments. In January
Bankers Trust sold its majority stake in AFP Provida, the largest private
pension fund in Chile, to local investors for Dollars 53.1m. It originally
bought a 60 per cent share in AFP Provida for Dollars 9m in 1986, and later
sold part of this to Chemical Bank and the Bank of Tokyo. The three banks
say they will repatriate Dollars 44.5m abroad. The remainder will be
reinvested in their fast-growing life-insurance business.
The greater freedom conferred to debt-swappers has also prompted some
foreign investors to rethink their business strategies in Chile.
Citibank, which converted Dollars 145m of its own Chilean debt paper to
invest in forestry, fishing and mining ventures, has now put many of these
up for sale to expand its local financial services. Mr Carlos Fuks,
Citibank's general manager in Santiago, says all the proceeds will be
reinvested in Chile. Only a small portion of debt-swap profits will be
remitted, for the first time, in 1993.
Citibank took the unusual step for a bank of investing in new productive
ventures - the biggest was a Dollars 460m pulp mill in partnership with
Royal Dutch/Shell and Scott Paper of the US. Other foreign banks chose to
buy into local banks, life insurance companies and private pension funds.
Many built up stakes in Chile's privatised companies or simply gambled on
the stock exchange.
'It would have been more profitable to get into equities,' Mr Fuks reflects.
'In retrospect, our debt-equity swaps benefited Chile more than they did our
bank.'
Although debt-swaps were authorised freely to finance everything from the
Mormon church to Pepsi Cola bottling plants, perhaps the greatest impact of
the programme has been in the development of the pulp and paper industry.
Three new pulp mills costing Dollars 1.5bn have entered production since
1991. All of them included debt-equity conversions as a key part of project
finance. The New Zealand forestry group Carter Holt Harvey, which came to
Chile in 1987 with a Dollars 164m debt-equity deal, once described its
Chilean assets as its 'most profitable off-shore investment'.
Another New Zealand group, Fletcher Challenge, acquired a newsprint mill in
1987 using Dollars 130m of Chilean debt paper bought at a 34 per cent
discount.
Mr Bryce Whitcher, Fletcher Challenge's representative in Santiago, says the
discount made the transaction attractive and the risk acceptable.
'It is difficult to be certain whether any investment would have been made
without the debt-swap,' he says. 'There was and still is a strategic fit to
our other forest investments, but it may not have been of the size or at the
time of the actual investment.'
Despite its success, Chile's use of debt-equity swaps had detractors from
the start. Mr Ricardo Ffrench-Davis, a former central bank director of
studies, estimates foreign investors were subsidised to the tune of Dollars
1bn by buying Chilean debt paper at a discount on the secondary markets and
exchanging it at near face value for pesos in Chile.
'While it is true that swaps helped reactivate confidence and investment in
Chile, this was done at a very great cost to the country,' Mr Ffrench-Davis
says. 'No thought was given to which sectors of the economy would most
benefit from debt-equity conversions. The subsidy was handed out with no
criteria.'
Central bank officials say privately they never felt comfortable as
guardians of this huge subsidy for foreign investors. More than 300 swaps
were approved between 1985-90, and keeping tabs on all the money proved an
impossible task. The central bank knows of several cases of fraud which it
cannot prosecute due to lack of evidence. Nor have they wished to create
unnecessary hostile waves for the majority of bona-fide investors.
While Chile is closing this chapter, other countries in the region are still
actively using debt-swaps as an integral part of their privatisation
programmes.
Argentina has cancelled Dollars 12bn of debt through debt-equity conversions
in the past three years. Peru is also studying the Chilean model as it puts
its own privatisation programme into gear.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Clinton pledges continuity and change
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday promised both continuity and change
in his administration's conduct of foreign policy.
In a speech to diplomats at Georgetown University, his alma mater, he said
he would build on the successes of his predecessors 'in specific areas'. He
cited the Middle East peace process, nuclear arms control and proliferation,
the humanitarian operation in Somalia, the support for reform in the former
Soviet Union, and the creation of new and expanding markets around the
world.
'Yet, the world has changed in fundamental ways and we must change with it,'
he went on.
'We need to clearly state how we plan in the US to adapt our nation's
foreign policy goals and institutions to this new era.'
Mr Clinton said his foreign policy would be based on three pillars: first,
to make US economic security 'a primary goal' of foreign policy. 'We cannot
sustain an active engagement abroad without a sound economy at home.'
Essential to this was a system of global commerce 'rooted in principles of
openness, fairness and reciprocity.'
Second, US armed forces would be restructured to meet new and continuing
security threats. Prudent cuts in defence spending were necessary, but that
did not mean a lessening of US resolve. 'When necessary we will not shrink
from using force when all appropriate diplomatic measures have been
exhausted.'
Last, the US would encourage the spread of democratic values worldwide.
'Democracies do not wage war against one another. They make better partners
in trade and diplomacy. And, despite their inherent problems, they offer the
best guarantee for the protection of human rights.'
Specifically, Mr Clinton promised to work through the United Nations and
other international institutions to resolve contentious disputes.
'America cannot and should not bear the world's burdens alone,' he said,
'but the Gulf war and the humanitarian relief operation in Somalia
demonstrate what is best about the UN.'
Apart from the now obligatory warning to Iraq, his speech was essentially
another of the inaugural rites of passage and was not intended to break new
ground.
Nevertheless his insistence that prudent cuts in defence spending were
achievable serves as a reminder both to his domestic defence establishment,
which is resisting them, and to US allies, from Japan to Nato, that this is
one campaign promise that he intends to keep.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Ecuador seeks to entice investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECUADOR'S sweeping reform of investment regulations last week has opened all
sectors of the economy to foreign capital.
Direct foreign investment will be treated under the same conditions as
national capital and will no longer require prior government approval, while
profits can be freely expatriated and converted into hard currency.
Under the new law, which replaces one enacted in June 1991, all transfers of
company shares will automatically be approved by the Ministry of Industry,
opening the way for foreign acquisitions of domestic companies.
Mr Mauricio Pinto, minister of industry, commerce and fisheries and one of
the driving forces behind the new law, says sectors which have been
completely opened up to foreign investment include the public services,
banking, telecommunications and insurance.
Banking, for example, had been limited to 49 per cent foreign ownership.
While many observers of the Ecuadorean economy acknowledge that the new law
is a big step towards liberalising foreign investment, they are cautious.
Mr David Edwards, an economist at the US embassy in Quito, says some issue
have not been addressed by the regulations, including price fixing in the
pharmaceutical industry, weak copyright protection, and the macro-economic
climate.
While he does not see US investors rushing in to the Ecuador market, he says
US companies have expressed interest in the telecommunications industry.
He also expects Colombian and Venezuelan investors to buy majority shares in
Ecuador's banking industry; they have already acquired minority stakes in
recent months.
According to Mr Carlos de la Paz of the British government's Overseas Trade
Service, companies such as British Petroleum and British Gas, which left
Ecuador in 1990 and 1991 respectively, may now reconsider returning.
'Some British mining companies will be happy,' he says. Above all, he adds,
the new regulations are a sign that the government is heading in the right
direction.
One issue the new regulations do not address is the unequal tax structure.
While domestic companies are taxed at a flat 25 per cent, foreign companies
pay an additional 11 per cent on remitted profits and in some cases more.
Reforming the tax structure would require congressional approval, but Mr
Jose Villacis, an economist at the sub-secretary of commerce, expects a law
to be passed soon.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Uruguay Round talks await signal

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trade Negotiations Committee, the most senior negotiating body of the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, will today formally take stock
of the six-year-old talks on the eve of President Bill Clinton's
inauguration.
Resumption of talks now awaits a signal from the new administration in
Washington.
Although US and European Community negotiators did not make the necessary
breakthrough in their last-minute dash for the line before President George
Bush leaves office tomorrow, EC officials said yesterday there was a basis
for a Uruguay Round settlement.
'The beginning of March or some weeks beyond that is now a realistic working
hypothesis,' a senior EC negotiator said, referring to the March 2 deadline
for submission of a Uruguay Round pact to the US Congress under the
administration's current negotiating authority.
US officials have implied that, if President Clinton requested it, Congress
might be prepared to grant the talks an extension, although this could not
go beyond the end of May, when the negotiating mandate expires.
The Clinton administration would then have to seek a new mandate, which
would almost certainly mean changes to the Uruguay Round agenda and another
long delay before the 108-nation talks could be completed.
EC negotiators have consistently pressed for an early deal but might welcome
a short delay until after French elections in March. The French government
has threatened to veto the Uruguay Round package, which embodies a farm
trade deal it opposes.

Liberalisation of South Korea's rice market, as proposed in the Uruguay
Round of global trade talks, would threaten the survival of many of the
country's 6m farmers, a delegation from the country's National Assembly said
yesterday, writes Frances Williams.
Six deputies have been in Geneva to lobby key trade negotiators, as well as
Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, on South Korean opposition to 'tariffication without exception'. This
proposal would oblige countries to convert all farm import barriers into
tariffs, which would then be gradually reduced.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Legal basis for action is unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGAL status of the latest hostilities in the Gulf is confused by two
separate Security Council resolutions, which differ in form and content.
Resolution 687, passed on April 4 1991, embodies the formal ceasefire terms
imposed on Iraq by the UN at the end of the Gulf war. Iraq was required to
accept it, and did so, as the alternative would have been a resumption of
hostilities.
Violations of it amount to breaches of the ceasefire, and therefore the
powers which fought the war (with the authorisation of the Security Council
under an earlier resolution, No 678) consider themselves legally entitled to
respond to such violations with military force.
Resolution 688 deals with the internal affairs of Iraq. It was a response to
President Saddam Hussein's suppression of the uprisings in both south and
north that followed his defeat in the war. The attack on the Kurds,
especially, caused an outburst of revulsion and guilt in western countries
as well as serious alarm in Turkey, which found itself facing a refugee
crisis.
The Security Council condemned the repression and demanded that Iraq put a
stop to it, called for a 'broad dialogue' aimed at ensuring respect for 'the
human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens', and insisted that Iraq
allow international organisations access to all those who needed help in any
part of the country.
It did not, however, threaten any action to enforce these demands if Iraq
failed to comply with them. Western powers frequently refer to Resolution
688 to justify the military action they subsequently took, first to
establish a 'safe haven' for the Kurds in the north of the country, and more
recently to create a 'no-fly zone' in the south - the latter being supposed
to inhibit repressive activities against the Shia Moslem population, and
particularly against both refugees and indigenous inhabitants in the marshes
of lower Mesopotamia, close to the Iranian frontier.
But the text of the resolution contains no reference to any such action.
There has been intermittent talk of a new resolution to back up 688 and make
it enforceable. But so far none has been submitted.
Formal de-recognition of Mr Saddam's regime might be a necessary first step.
The US and its allies seem to be on stronger legal ground in taking military
action to deal with incursions across the Kuwaiti border, or with
obstruction of the UN inspection missions, verifying the destruction of
Iraq's non-conventional weapons facilities, than they were in proclaiming
the no-fly zones or in using military force to impose Iraqi compliance with
them.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Raids designed to give clear message -
Allies leave themselves a wide range of target options for future attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALL the signs of rapid military escalation, the three waves of attacks
against Iraq by the US and its British and French allies, in the space of
less than five days, were all characterised by their limited scale.
By not attacking some obvious targets, such as key military installations in
central Iraq, the coalition has reserved its options for further action
against a recalcitrant President Saddam Hussein.
The US has appeared anxious to demonstrate, particularly after the dubious
results of the first attack last Wednesday, that it can hit Iraq when and
where it chooses.
The weapons and targets have been the same as or similar to those of the
Gulf war air campaign two years ago. But operations that were combined
during the six weeks of attacks in early 1991 have been carried out
separately. The allies want their action to be clearly seen as a specific
response to Iraqi acts of defiance: movement of missiles in patrolled
regions, stalling over UN inspections and unauthorised forays into Kuwaiti
territory to retrieve material.
A further echo of the 1991 war is the combination of war-like rhetoric from
Baghdad and unwillingness in practice to engage the US-led allies in combat.
This is frustrating to attackers seeking to destroy air defences since their
tactics are geared to homing-in on targeting radars and to air-to-air
combat.
The main action yesterday morning was against two Iraqi air defence sites
where Wednesday's attack was incomplete: al-Najaf, on the 32nd parallel,
which forms the border of the southern no-fly zone, and al-Samawa, just
inside that line and further to the east.
The allies have clearly been at pains to try to measure their action to make
it commensurate with Iraqi challenges to UN authority and have also sought
to minimise the risk to their own personnel.
According to UK officials, 43 allied aircraft took part in yesterday's
action in southern Iraq, including 29 US and British attack aircraft and US
and French fighters.
This was considerably fewer than took part in last Wednesday's night attack
against eight sites. In neither action did the allies attack air bases
further to the north from which Iraqi aircraft have infringed the no-fly
zone in recent weeks,
The cruise missile attack on Sunday against an engineering complex outside
Baghdad, alleged to have produced nuclear-related equipment, is seen as
having more political than military significance, as a demonstration of US
fire-power. It involved more than 30 Tomahawk missiles fired from warships
in the Gulf and the Red Sea and was the only time these weapons have been
used, except in the Gulf war.
The decision to return to sites in southern Iraq can be seen partly as a bid
to restore US military pride after criticism over the failure to destroy
some of the targets last week.
The targets did not include the al-Amarah facility assigned to the RAF last
Wednesday. The RAF said yesterday that a headquarters building at Al-Amarah
had been completely destroyed by laser-guided bombs dropped by British
Tornados, and an intercept control facility was probably put out of
operation.
It remained to be seen if Iraq still possessed operational facilities of
this kind for co-ordinating its air defences in the south. Officials warned
that Iraqi forces would still be able to operate some anti-aircraft systems
independently of the centralised control systems.
Further attacks in the northern no-fly zone focused on surface-to-air
missile radars and anti-aircraft guns. This followed incidents in which
radars locked on to allied aircraft, including two UK Jaguars flying
yesterday on a reconnaissance mission from their base in south-eastern
Turkey, which also came under fire from anti-aircraft artillery.
An Iraqi MiG-23, shot down by a US F-16 in northern Iraq on Sunday, was the
second such incident, a MiG-21 having been downed on December 27.
Allied officials said they had no indication that Iraq had fired any missile
towards the Arabian peninsula. This followed one report yesterday morning
suggesting that a Scud missile might have been fired at the Saudi base of
Dhahran and been shot down.
Use of a Scud missile would constitute the most serious of any provocation
by the Iraqis in the recent confrontation. Under the terms of its 1991
ceasefire Iraq had to declare all its missiles able to reach targets more
than 90 miles away, and these were scheduled for destruction. However,
Baghdad is believed to be harbouring an unknown number of Scud missiles from
its previous Soviet-supplied stockpile.

INTERNATIONAL experts said yesterday they had no doubt that the
military-industrial plant near Baghdad hit by US cruise missiles on Sunday
was part of Iraq's nuclear programme.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that machine tools equipment made by European
companies was found by United Nations inspectors who visited the Zafaraniya
complex in 1991.
Mr Maurizio Zifferero, head of the United Nations team responsible for
monitoring Iraq's nuclear programme, said equipment at the complex was used
in the manufacture of calutrons, necessary for the electromagnetic
enrichment of uranium.
Iraqi officials have protested that the site, which comprises dozens of
factory buildings over a wide area, produced only fixtures, moulds and dies
and had no military significance.
Mr Zifferero, speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency
headquarters in Vienna, said that while factories on the site did turn out
such products, his inspectors had tagged for destruction heavy lathes and
milling equipment there. Those inspectors had visited the site four times.
He added that the site, along with the nearby al-Dijila complex, which
produced electronics components identified as being part of Iraq's nuclear
programme, was one of the six main centres in Iraq's project to develop
nuclear weapons.
'The Iraqis themselves have admitted to us that these tools had been used in
the manufacture of calutrons,' he said.
Mr David Kay, secretary-general of the London-based Uranium Institute and a
former chief UN nuclear inspector in Iraq, said yesterday he had visited the
Iraqi site on three occasions.
He described it as 'a very impressive and advanced machine tool layout'.
Western-made equipment included computer numerically-controlled machine
tools.
US officials described the site as a multi-billion-dollar complex which Iraq
would be unable to replace.
As well as finding equipment made by European companies at the site, the UN
inspectors who visited it in 1991 also found equipment bearing the name of
the British company Matrix Churchill.
According to a US government document obtained by the Financial Times, the
inspectors also found machinery made by a German company.
Mr Paul Henderson, former managing director of Matrix Churchill, said last
night the company did not supply any machinery from the UK for the Iraqi
nuclear programme. He said, however, that Iraq had manufactured lathes under
licence from Matrix Churchill. 'We had no idea where those machines went,'
he said.
The Matrix Churchill exports to Iraq from the UK, he said, were for use in
the manufacture of shells, fuses and a multiple rocket launcher project. Of
the Matrix exports, he said: 'I know where they went and I know where they
were installed and none of them went for nuclear.'
Matrix Churchill, which was owned by Iraq before it went into receivership
and was split up last year, has featured in politically sensitive court
cases in Atlanta and London.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Kuwait still rebuilding its armed
strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLASHES in the Gulf over the past week have highlighted the continuing
weakness of Kuwait's armed forces. They are still in the earliest stages of
rebuilding after the Gulf war two years ago and do not alone have the
manpower or equipment to mount a credible military deterrent to Iraq.
A pre-war total of about 25,000 armed forces personnel has shrunk to nearer
16,000 after Kuwait's military authorities ejected thousands of Bedouin, or
stateless Arabs, who made up the core of the army's fighters, judging their
loyalty to be suspect.
Although Kuwait's air force is being reinforced by the arrival of 40 F-18
jets ordered before the war, the undermanned ground force is equipped only
with 150 Yugoslav-built M84 tanks and little support equipment.
Recently-ordered M1A2 tanks from the US are unlikely to be in effective
service for up to two years, and Kuwait has still not decided on a large
contract for armoured personnel carriers. The country has no air defence
system of its own, relying for radar cover on US early-warning aircraft
operating out of Saudi Arabia.
However, western officials in Kuwait say there are ample forces in the
country to deal with any Iraqi aggression. Last week the US deployed a
1,100-strong US task force equipped with pre-positioned M1A1 tanks and
Bradley fighting vehicles. It also has 300 special forces troops on
exercises in Kuwait. A small Gulf force, including a Saudi Arabian armoured
brigade, is also still based in Kuwait.
Diplomats say that Iraq's remaining ground forces, which at best represent
40 per cent of its pre-war military strength, are tied up in northern Iraq
and in fighting with Shia groups in the south.
Several Republican Guard units are at present deployed around Baghdad.
'There's no way any force of any size could turn south and head for Kuwait,'
said one. Western officials also discount any threat from whatever Scud
missiles Iraq may have kept hidden.
Short of an outright invasion, the Iraqis could however still provide
niggling harassment at the newly demarcated border with Kuwait. This is
straddled by a 15km-wide demilitarised zone under the jurisdiction of the
249 unarmed officers of the United Nations. It is with this threat in mind
that the Security Council is considering whether to bolster, with armed and
possibly armoured forces, the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission contingent.
Neither reinforcements from Britain or France, or UN troops already in
Kuwait, would be likely to be deployed to police the border.

Turkey yesterday distanced itself from the US-led attack on Iraq, insisting
that allied aircraft from the Incirlik air base had acted in self-defence in
bombing anti-aircraft installations in northern Iraq, writes John Murray
Brown in Ankara. It maintained the mission was part of Operation Provide
Comfort, the coalition air umbrella to protect the Kurds north of the 36th
parallel. The issue is particularly sensitive for Mr Suleyman Demirel, prime
minister, who criticised in opposition Incirlik's use in the Gulf war.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ was at pains yesterday to show the world the civilian damage inflicted
by the allied missile attack on Baghdad two years to the day since the
beginning of the Gulf war, with President Saddam Hussein visiting the
injured in hospital. But his propaganda machine left the main point of
interest and the reason of Sunday's attack a mystery.
Three sites hit by missiles have been confirmed: the lobby of the Rashid
hotel in Baghdad was badly damaged, a house in the suburb of Karada was
half-demolished and a factory in Zafaraniya, 10 miles south of Baghdad and
the announced target of the allied attack, was hit.
Western journalists, despite being escorted to the two civilian sites, were
denied access to the factory at Zafaraniya. Described as a nuclear site by
the allies and a facility for manufacturing industrial equipment by the
Iraqis, an army official prevented an organised Ministry of Information tour
of the site, despite the fact it had been viewed by some journalists
immediately after the bombing.
'Yesterday was one day, today is another, he said.
The government took advantage of the high-profile Rashid bombing by holding
a funeral for the two people who were killed in the hotel.
Escorted by a ceremonial army brass band, a large group of dignitaries,
hotel staff and mourning relatives, the coffins of Ameriha Toma, a
receptionist at the hotel, and a female guest were marched to a burial site
to the accompaniment of a funeral dirge.
Soon afterwards, more than 1,000 delegates at the Sixth Islamic Conference,
who were removed to another hotel after the bombing last night, descended on
the hotel to conduct the day's proceedings, and Rashid staff attempted to
convey a sense of business as usual.
It was the same all over Baghdad. Iraq has been under seige in military and
economic terms almost continually since the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war
in 1980; coping in tragic circumstances has become a way of life.
However, a sense of despair was apparent after Sunday's attack, and
disbelief that the capital was once again under fire from the allies. At the
Karada site, where one woman was killed and her two daughters injured when
their house was hit by a missile, Dr Mohammad Dowee, a military doctor and
neighbour whose three daughters were injured by shattering glass, accused
the allies of not caring about Iraqi civilians.
'If people (in the west) saw the exact picture, they wouldn't agree with
what happened here. Killing ordinary Iraqis will not help enforce their
demands,' he said.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Opposition to Saddam forms a perplexing
mosaic - There are many rival groups, and the west is not sure about any of
them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE US and its Gulf war allies the most desirable outcome of the renewed
military pressure on the Baghdad regime would be the overthrow of President
Saddam Hussein. But that, too, would pose another acute dilemma for
Washington as it tries to assess the Iraqi opponents of the regime and their
chances of coming to power.
A Middle East analyst advising the incoming Clinton administration admitted
yesterday: 'US policy (on the Iraqi opposition) is that we have no policy,
basically because we don't know any of these guys.'
The complex divisions and rivalries within the ranks of the Iraqi opposition
reflect the frustrations of exile, the influence of regional powers and
Iraq's multi-cultural nature.
Iraq is an ethnic and religious mosaic. Since the days of Ottoman rule its
elite has been drawn from the Sunni Arabs who today occupy most high posts
in the ruling Baath party. Living mainly in the centre of the country around
Baghdad, they make up barely one fifth of the population.
A quarter of Iraqis are Kurds, who are Sunnis but not Arabs. Some 55 per
cent are Arab Shias, who share their religious traditions with Iran. The
principal holy cities of Shi'ism, Najal and Kerbala, are in southern Iraq,
where Ayatollah Khomeini, the spiritual leader of the Iranian revolution,
spent many years in exile.
During the eight-year war with Iran the Shias fought alongside fellow
Iraqis, but Mr Saddam, Saudi Arabia and the US all fear links between Iraq's
Shias and Tehran.
Iraq's two biggest Islamic umbrella groups, al Da'wa and the Supreme Council
for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri), form the backbone of resistance
to the regime in the southern provinces of Nazariya, Amarah and Basra.
Other than the Kurds, they are Saddam's only opponents with armed militias
inside Iraq. Both groups are Tehran-based and not natural allies of the US.
The London-based Iraqi National Congress (INC), founded in June last year,
is more palatable to the west and was able to claim a degree of de facto
recognition when a deputation met Mr James Baker, then US secretary of
state, last July.
The INC is a coalition of Kurds, liberal Shias and some moderate Arab
nationalists including former Baathist leader Mr Hani Fakaiki. Its programme
promises a single, democratic, multi-party Iraq but with Kurdish aspirations
recognised.
The INC wants wider western involvement in Iraq. It called last week for a
UN security zone in south Iraq, a tribunal to try Mr Saddam for crimes
against humanity, and direct UN responsibility for all humanitarian
assistance.
The INC's support within Iraq remains hypothetical. Iraq has changed since
many of its leaders were forced into exile, and a large part of the
population has been born since Mr Saddam became president.
The INC has tried unsuccessfully to co-opt the Islamic groups, who because
of their operations inside Iraq are unwilling to be marginalised in any
unified structure. Discussions are continuing but INC leaders remain
sceptical of the Islamic groups' commitment to pluralism. The Islamic groups
equally doubt the extent of concrete western support on offer to a unified
opposition.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have both derided the INC. Although hostile to Mr
Saddam, they fear the influence of the Shias and are suspicious of
democracy. Both governments have resisted the creation of a unified
opposition and sponsor small groups of Iraqi Arab nationalists whom they
would like to see in power.
In the north of Iraq some 50,000 sq km have been administered by Kurdish
guerrillas since autumn 1991, when Mr Saddam withdrew his administration and
imposed an economic embargo. A coalition of Kurdish parties has created a
fledgling state, elected a parliament, and hosted an opposition conference
in 'liberated Iraq'.
But the Kurds are short of food, fuel and spare parts. The Iraqi government
channels UN relief from Turkey through a checkpoint which according to the
Kurds allows only about 10 trucks a day to pass.
Mr Saddam has suggested resuming negotiations with the Kurds, which broke
down in 1991. He has offered to accept Kurdish autonomy with jointly
supervised elections within six months, and promised a share of revenue from
the Kirkuk oilfields.
Armed with only light weapons, the Kurdish guerrillas are in no position to
confront the 100,000 Iraqi troops in the region, and depend on allied air
cover above the 36th parallel. With Mr Saddam still in power and the
prospects for wider opposition co-operation at best uncertain, they face an
uncomfortable stalemate.
'Western policy towards Iraq is not comprehensive, it reacts to events,'
said Kurdish spokesman Mr Hoshyar Zebar last week. Initial pleasure among
the exiled opposition groups at renewed western military action was already
giving way yesterday to frustration that the Baghdad regime had barely been
scratched.

The Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, yesterday announced

from Bombay. The bank is channelling loans worth Rs4bn to farming, mainly
for machinery, and Rs6bn for purchases of heavy vehicles to ease a slump in
engineering. While the bank expects overall economic growth to reach about 4
per cent in the year to June 1993, it is worried this relies heavily on
exceptional expansion in agriculture, while other industry remains stagnant.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao yesterday appointed a new minister
to take charge of foreign affairs.
The appointment was part of Mr Rao's wide-ranging ministerial reshuffle
designed to bolster his authority in the wake of the Ayodhya crisis.
Mr Dinesh Singh will join the cabinet as external affairs minister, taking a
portfolio previously held by Mr Rao himself.
He is one of four new ministers; the others include Mr Pranab Mukherjee, new
commerce minister, who will strengthen the team responsible for the
government's economic reform programme.
The reshuffle was seen in Delhi last night as a successful bid by Mr Rao to
boost his influence in the cabinet.
But the new men were not expected to bring any immediate significant change
in the government's popularity as a whole, nor in its ability to deal
effectively with the crisis caused by the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque
and the ensuing violence.
Mr Dinesh, 77, is a veteran of the governing Congress (I) party who first
served as a minister in 1962. His appointment will bring into the cabinet a
representative from Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state.
It is here that the Congress party is in need of reinforcement, having lost
ground to the Hindu militant Bharatiya Janata party, whose supporters
stormed the Ayodhya mosque. Mr Mukherjee, 57, is moving to the Commerce
Ministry from being deputy chairman of the government's Planning Commission.
He replaces Mr P Chidambaram, who resigned over the Bombay security market
scandal. Mr Mukherjee, a former journalist, has served before in the
cabinet, including being finance minister in the early 1980s. The two other
new cabinet members are Mr A K Antony, minister for civil supplies, and Mr N
K Salve, energy minister.
In Bombay, businessmen struggled to bring offices and factories back to
normal working after the violence that left more than 600 dead and paralysed
the city for nearly two weeks, writes R C Murthy.
In the city's port, dockers struggled to clear a large backlog and make room
for ships waiting in the harbour. The Indian Merchants' Chamber, a leading
business body, says the city has lost Rs15bn (Pounds 339m) in industrial
production.
The worst-hit industry is leather, because many workshops are operated by
Moslems, who were the chief victims of the attacks of Hindu-led mobs.
Production is concentrated in Dharavi, India's largest slum, where scores of
businesses were burned and workers have fled. Mr H R Mallick, vice-chairman
of the Leather Export Promotion Council, said it would take months for work
to return to normal.
The city's jewellery and gemstone polishing industries were also badly hit
because workers were unable to reach factories. An international exhibition,
due to be held this week by the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council
was postponed.
Mr K R Subramaniam, a former president of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce,
expressed confidence that investment decisions would not be affected in the
long run. Britain is pressing ahead with plans for Prime Minister John Major
to visit Bombay while on a trip to India next week.

FT  19 JAN 93 / HK legislators voice fears on China talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of conservative Hong Kong legislators will today tell British
government leaders of their deep concern at the way Sino-British relations
have been deteriorating as the result of proposals for greater democracy in
the colony.
The legislators, members of the 17-strong Co-operative Resources Centre, are
expected to tell Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, that they would like to see a return to the policy of
'convergence' in relations between Britain and China.
Mrs Selina Chow and Mr Howard Young said yesterday their main aim was to see
a resumption of the dialogue between Britain and China, which would ensure a
smooth transition to the hand-over of sovereignty in 1997.
They were not asking for withdrawal by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor,
of his electoral reform package, the main cause of the trouble, but they
would like him to amend it.
'If the British government took the initiative to amend the proposals, that
might be the key to the reopening of the dialogue with China,' Mr Young
said.
The Hong Kong people, caught in the middle of the Anglo-Chinese quarrel, did
not relish the prospect of 'four-and-a-half years of needless arguments' at
their expense.
'At the end of the day, it is the Hong Kong people who have to live with the
consequences,' Mrs Chow said.
The legislators said that, while they thought Mr Patten had acted with the
best intentions, they believed 'he might not be getting the best advice'.
The western form of adversarial politics was not necessarily the best way to
handle the Chinese. 'To get more, you have to use persuasion,' Mrs Chow
said.

THE PHILIPPINES starts negotiations with the International Monetary Fund
tomorrow on a new programme aimed at pushing the economy towards a
high-growth plane.
Philippine negotiators, led by Mr Ramon del Rosario, finance secretary, and
Mr Jose Cuisia, governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, will be
seeking credits of more than Dollars 800m (Pounds 526.3m) under the IMF's
extended fund facility to support the country's 'growth-oriented' economic
programme designed to cover the next three years.
The programme is part of the government's plan for a growth of 4.5 per cent
in the economy this year, rising to double digits by 1998.
Because of a debilitating electric-power shortage, the economy grew by just
1.5 per cent in 1991 despite heightened optimism brought about by the
improved political environment.
The current economic stabilisation programme supported by the IMF involves
stringent ceilings on fiscal and monetary expansion. It is due to end in
March.
The negotiations are expected to be difficult. Early assessments of the
Manila programme indicate strong pressure from the IMF to scale down the
growth targets.
IMF analysts had noted that previous high-growth periods in the Philippines
were followed by balance-of-payments crises.
Owing to the heavy spendings on infrastructure allocated during the early
part of the growth programme, the strategy could fuel inflation later and
derail the ambitious scheme, according to some analysts.
However, the Philippine negotiators are expected to press for the programme,
because of the need for 'a more dynamic investment and overall output
performance'.
The officials feel that after meeting the strict criteria attached to the
current programme, the Philippines should be 'in a stronger bargaining
position' for the week-long negotiations.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Mahathir set for clash with sultans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MALAYSIA seems set for a constitutional crisis resulting from an
increasingly bitter confrontation between the government of Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the prime minister, and the country's nine sultans (hereditary
rulers).
Dr Mahathir yesterday brought constitutional amendments into parliament
which would abolish rights guaranteeing the sultans' immunity from
prosecution in courts. The amendments would prevent them pardoning members
of their own families and would relax rules on reporting of any royal
misdeeds.
The sultans issued a statement shortly before parliamentary proceedings
began rejecting Dr Mahathir's amendments, saying the future of the monarchy
in Malaysia was under threat.
Legal experts say the Malaysian constitution stipulates a majority of the
sultans, each of whom takes a turn as king, must give their consent to any
constitutional changes affecting the monarchy.
Dr Mahathir insists he has the right to push the amendments through
parliament. He rejects criticism that he wants to abolish the monarchy but
says the sultans must be made accountable for their actions.
The present stand-off originated in an incident late last year when one of
the sultans is alleged to have beaten up a sports official. The local media,
which had once avoided all adverse comment on the sultans, then began
fulsome reporting of other alleged royal misdemeanours.
Dr Mahathir insists most of the population firmly supports the government's
moves against the royalty, although the sultans are still regarded by some
sections of the community as an important symbol of the country's Malay and
Islamic identity.
The prime minister's critics say he is seeking to increase his executive
powers. Parliament is today expected to approve the government's amendments.
It is then likely the sultans will challenge the action in the courts.
That could lead to a long legal battle and possible unrest in the Malay
community as government and royalty vie for popular support.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Water row threatens to surface at Turkish-Syrian meeting

WATER, which has so often jeopardised Turkey's relations with its Arab
neighbours, again threatens to overshadow the talks in Damascus today
between Turkish premier Suleyman Demirel and Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad. It will be the first trip to Damascus for a Turkish leader since
1987, when Mr Turgut Ozal initialled a joint security pact and guaranteed
Syria a flow of 500 cu metres a second where the Euphrates crosses the
shared border.
Some success on the security front, especially where Turks see Syria's new
willingness to curb rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), has helped
pave the way for today's meeting. In April, Ankara revived the security
protocol. The two sides also agreed to restart trilateral water talks
suspended because of the war with Iraq. But relations continue to be marked
by mutual suspicion.
The Syrians will want to use today's talks to press the water issue, vital
for 60 per cent of the country's power generation. Turkey has announced
plans to start irrigating along the Harran plain from May, diverting more
water from the vast Ataturk reservoir.
The Syrians argue that under the existing protocol there is an implicit
undertaking for the Turks to negotiate a permanent water settlement once the
reservoir is filled.
Ankara continues to resist the linkage between Syria's backing for the PKK
and Syria's security concerns over Turkish control of the Euphrates River.

<TEXT>
CHINESE leaders, worried that the economy is overheating, have told banks to
tighten control on lending to industry, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji were quoted yesterday as telling
a banking conference that state-run banks this year must help cut money
supply and credit, the prime source of inflationary pressure.
Banks should 'control not only the size of loans but also issuance of
currency,' the official Xinhua news agency quoted Zhu as saying. The
comments highlight an urgent need for financial reform in China. The banking
system was designed to serve the needs of Stalinist-style central planning
and lacks the tools to fine-tune an emerging market economy.
Last year, banks ignored government-imposed loan ceilings and poured credit
into state-run industry, fuelling an investment boom underpinning 12 per
cent growth. Industrial output was up 20 per cent. Since two-thirds of state
industry is losing money, many loans will never be repaid.

FT  19 JAN 93 / European petrochemicals reform 'could save Dollars 2bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S petrochemical industry could save as much as Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.3bn) a year if it restructures, according to a confidential survey of 34
plants representing 75 per cent of European capacity.
The survey*, by consultants Chem Systems in London, demonstrates the current
plight of the petrochemicals and plastics sector. It estimates that even the
most efficient producers are generating a minus 5 per cent return on
capital. The worst producers are performing far worse than that.
The industry has been hit by a combination of slower than expected demand
growth and chronic overcapacity. The quickest and cheapest way to improve
the industry's cost structure is to concentrate the industry, eliminating
the smallest and least efficient plants. This would leave between eight and
12 producers but still ensure healthy competition, claims Mr Roger Longley,
a Chem Systems director.
Merely by reducing the number of polypropylene producers from 17 to 11 the
industry would save Dollars 250m a year, he argues.
The survey also demonstrates most petrochemical and plastics plants are
highly inefficient. If the most efficient European plant adopted the best
practice of other plants in terms of staffing, maintenance, overheads,
utilities, credit and logistics, it could make fixed-cost savings of Dollars
79 per tonne.
The worst practices in existing plants add up to more than Dollars 230 per
tonne higher than best practice. The difference between the worst and best
plant is Dollars 153 per tonne. This excludes differences in raw materials -
the few plants using liquid petroleum gas have a significant cost advantage
over those using naphtha.
The report adds that a properly integrated plant can create revenues worth
more than Dollars 100 per tonne of ethylene. It says few refiners integrate
their plants effectively.
'The bottom line message is clear and brutal,' says Mr Longley. 'Management
in almost every company has failed to address inefficiencies.'
The industry's ability to sort out its problems has been lessened since the
early 1980s, because about 20 of the least efficient plants were shut down
at that time, warns Mr Longley.
The position of EC manufacturers is likely to deteriorate as they face
increasing competition from imports.
The consultants also warn that imports could take 40 per cent of the
Ethylene Glycol market by the year 2000. European petrochemical
manufacturers face an additional problem with the build up of environmental
costs. It says the cost of complying with a carbon tax would add up to
Dollars 22 to the cost of ethylene produced and Dollars 34 to the cost of
high density polyethylene.
Chem Systems reckons European polyethylene could faced environmental costs
of up to Dollars 80 a tonne compared with importers.

FT  19 JAN 93 / EC backs Pounds 6.5bn loan deal for Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday approved an Ecu8bn (Pounds
6.5bn) balance of payments loan to Italy to bolster the Rome government's
efforts to control its huge budget deficit and overhaul the economy.
The loan, which is conditional on periodic EC reviews of the budgetary
programme, imposes an external discipline which the government of Mr
Giuliano Amato views as vital to winning political support at home.
Italy asked for the loan last October, partly to offset the loss of reserves
used to support the lira during the September crisis inside the Exchange
Rate Mechanism (ERM). Greece and Italy have received similar loans, but this
is believed to be the largest of its kind involving the EC using its own
guarantees to raise money on the capital markets.
According to the agreement reached yesterday in Brussels, Italy will be paid
the loan in four tranches of Ecu2bn, two to be paid this year no earlier
than February 1 and July 31 respectively; the last two will be paid in 1994
and 1995.
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, outlined a set of
conditions:
The ratio of Italy's debt to GDP will peak in 1994 to 112 1/2 per cent and
then begin to fall;
Italy will take further fiscal steps if the government's borrowing
requirements increase;
The government will pursue reforms in health, pensions, the civil service
and local finance; disbursement of the loan will be on 'performance not
dates', according to Mr Christophersen.
Italian officials said the loan should help pave the way for the re-entry of
the lira into the ERM 'as soon as possible', as part of the central bank's
efforts to replenish its reserves. But re-entry must be at a 'sustainable
parity' which would prove lasting, according to Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's
Treasury minister.
Mr Christophersen paid tribute to the Amato government's 'courageous
measures' to reform the economy, but it was his impression that Rome
favoured a step by step approach to the ERM: 'It is a little too early to
define a realistic exchange rate (for the lira).'
Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German ministry of finance, said
ministers were looking forward to seeing the lira return to the ERM, but 'on
a solid basis'.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Change looms for Italian politics: And politicians must
decide which way to jump
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTORAL reform in Italy has finally been removed from the level of mere
rhetoric.
Parliament now has to come up with proposals in the next two months or its
hand will be forced by a referendum to be held between April 18 and June 13.
In any event the legislation will have to respect the spirit of the
referendum proposals approved on Saturday by the country's constitutional
court.
This is the immediate effect of the court's historic ruling on 13
referendums, of which 10 were approved. But admitting the referendums will
have a much broader impact on the whole issue of reforming Italy's
institutional structure, put in place by the 1947 constitution. As one
commentator said: 'This is the end of the First Republic and the beginning
of the Second.'
The two most important referendums concern the abolition of the existing
system of proportional representation in favour of a first-past-the-post
system. Italy's electoral system was geared to a country emerging from
fascism into the cold war. Proportional representation was intended to
foster minority parties and discourage monolithic groups like the Communists
or disbanded fascists. But this has created 52 unstable coalition
governments and an unworkable fragmentation of parliamentary parties - with
no fewer than 16 represented after last April's general elections.
One specific referendum proposal is for 238 of the senate seats to be
elected by majority vote and the remaining 77 on the existing method of
proportional representation. Another extends the majority vote to
municipalities of over 5,000.
Although the proposal covers only majority voting for the senate and
municipal elections, all parties recognise that the principle extends by
implication to the more powerful legislative forum, the chamber of deputies.
Equally, the other referendums, which include the abolition of public
funding of political parties, will accelerate a general revision of the
existing institutional structure.
The need for change was emphasised by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro in his
inaugural address last May 28 when he took the unprecedented step of calling
for a special parliamentary commission.
The latter was formed in September from both houses of parliament and was in
part intended to head off the cross-party referendum alliance, led by Mr
Mario Segni, who already had before the courts his proposals for the Sentae
election change.
The politicians must now decide whether to work for an agreement in the
commission and produce proposals which head off the referendum - or wait
until after the referendum result is known. The latter course is most
likely. Time is too short, and enough politicians (like Mr Segni, the
Christian Democrat leader and Mr Claudio Martelli, the Socialist minister of
justice) believe their ambitions will be furthered by riding the referendum
wave, which will almost certainly triumph, given the discredit of the
traditional parties.
Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, candidly commented: 'We
would rather avoid the referendum, although frankly at this stage I fear we
cannot. Nevertheless, if the referendum is held we will be protagonists and
not be overtaken by the event.'
This suggests the Christian Democrats will try to ensure the referendum vote
is not a popular judgment on their role in government. Indeed it will be
surprising if every political party does not jump on the referendum
band-wagon.
But if this happens, it will merely speed the process of change and at the
same time encourage the nascent cross-party alliances.
With electoral reform pushed to the top of the national agenda absorbing all
the parties' attention, Prof Giuliano Amato's coalition government should
benefit. With the exception of the hardline Reconstituted Communism and the
Lombard League, no party now has an interest in ending his fragile coalition
until the lines of a new electoral law have been agreed and probably
approved by parliament.
On this basis the government has until the summer, and then it will be for
the politicians to decide whether to call early elections or expand the
government to obtain a broader consensus in order to introduce comprehensive
constitutional reforms.

Fighting between Moslems and Croats, theoretically allies in the war against

Bosnian Serb vote due today on an internationally brokered peace plan for
Bosnia, writes Robert Mauthner.
The battle around Gornji Vakuf, a town in south-west Hercegovina near the
Adriatic, appears to have been provoked by the Geneva peace process itself,
particularly the map tabled by the international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance
and Lord Owen.
Bosnian Croatian forces have attempted to consolidate their positions in
areas designated as Croat-controlled on the map which divides the proposed
future Bosnian state into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.

THE French national statistics office, Insee, yesterday announced that the
country's industrial output fell in November by 4.5 per cent, a sharp drop
that will further entrench economic recovery as the main issue in the
country's March election, David Buchan reports from Paris.
The exceptional decline was largely due to special factors causing a 12 per
cent fall across the range of energy production, including a refinery
explosion limiting oil output.
The Bank of France intervened to the tune of FFr156.2bn (Pounds 19bn) to
defend the franc in the seven weeks following mid-November and FFr16.66bn in
the first seven days of this year, according to the economic studies
department of state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais, Reuter reports from Paris.

FT  19 JAN 93 / European sales of new cars surprise makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in west Europe jumped sharply in December thanks to an
unexpected surge in demand in some of the biggest markets, Germany, the UK,
France, Spain and the Netherlands.
According to industry estimates west European new car sales in December rose
year-on-year by 18.7 per cent to 975,000.
Sales for the whole of 1992 were virtually unchanged at 13.5m. Figures for
several of the 17 markets across west Europe are still based on preliminary
estimates, but the strength of demand in recent months has confounded
carmakers' more pessimistic forecasts. According to industry estimates new
car sales last year were less than 0.1 per cent lower than in 1991.
The decline in sales in several European markets in the past three years has
been compensated for by the addition of eastern Germany, since mid-1990, to
the overall market.
Germany, the single biggest car market in Europe, again played a pivotal
role in December with an estimated sales increase year-on-year of 33 per
cent to 308,000.
The surge in December could depress sales this month, as purchases were
pulled forward to avoid the increase in valued added tax in Germany at the
beginning of January. The same happened in France, where new car sales were
an estimated 221,000, up year-on-year by 33.5 per cent. In the UK, sales
last month jumped by 37.1 per cent year-on-year to 79,900, although special
factors also distorted the picture.
Only Italy suffered a decline among the main volume markets in December with
a fall year-on-year of 6.4 per cent.
Across west Europe sales both in December and in the whole of 1992 were
higher than a year earlier in nine markets and lower in eight.
New car sales in the whole of 1992 were higher than a year ago in four of
the five leading volume markets, Italy, France, Spain and the UK - though
only marginally in the case of the UK - while the estimated decline in
German new car sales of around 5.1 per cent was much less than feared.
Most industry forecasts for 1993, however, suggest a decline of around 4 per
cent.
Japanese new car sales in west Europe fell last year by an estimated 4.8 per
cent to around 1.59m, reducing Japanese share to around 11.8 per cent from
12.3 per cent.
The Volkswagen group was the best-selling carmaker in west Europe for the
eighth year in succession, boosting
market share to a record 17.5 per cent from 16.4 per cent a year earlier.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Moscow missiles offer to Pretoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA will this week invite South African officials to Moscow for formal
talks on supplying Pretoria with converted SS-20 intermediate-range missiles
to launch nine space satellites. Moscow has informally offered to launch
South African observation satellites at one quarter the price of a western
launch.
A formal offer is likely to heighten concerns among US and European
companies in the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year commercial launch
business that they could be priced out of the market by the Russian space
industry.
Mr Yuri Milov, deputy director of the Russian Space Agency, said the design
bureau for the missiles, which are due to be eliminated under the INF
(Intermediate Nuclear Forces) disarmament treaty, had already elaborated
plans to convert them to civilian uses. But Russian authorities were anxious
to put South African inquiries on an official footing, to avoid accusations
of improper dealings with a nation that still faced western arms sanctions.
'Otherwise, the next thing we know the Americans will be screaming we are
proposing to supply South Africa with strategic weapons,' he said, recalling
recent US attempts to block Russia's sale of rocket engines to India for
satellite-launching.
Informal Moscow-Pretoria contacts have already come through the Bonn office
of the South Africa Foundation, a private-sector lobby group. Moscow had
offered launches at Dollars 10m each on SS-20s, Mr Rudolf Gruber of the SA
Foundation said. Similar launches cost Dollars 40m in the west.
The Ukrainian design bureau, which produced the much larger SS-18 long-range
missiles, due to be eliminated under the Start-2 treaty, was also trying to
find civilian customers. The SS-18 multiple warhead technology meant all
nine satellites could be launched together.

FT  19 JAN 93 / German politicians warn of budget cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SLOWDOWN in the German economy will mean an 'inevitable' increase in the
government's net borrowing requirement, as well as drastic savings through
cuts in tax allowances and reduced social spending, members of the ruling
coalition warned yesterday.
They hope to finalise plans for a substantial savings package, as part of
the wider negotiations for a 'solidarity pact' to finance German
unification, in top-level talks today.
It is expected to include the introduction of strict means tests to limit
social payments, such as children's allowances, to the poorest, and a
possible halving in the tax benefits available for home-buyers.
It will also attempt to limit the payment of unemployment benefit, to ensure
that the dole does not exceed wages available for those still in work.
The possibility of substantial cuts in social payments has aroused the anger
of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD).
If the package is rejected by the SPD, the government will still press ahead
and attempt to reach broad agreement with the trade unions and the
governments of the 16 federal Lander, according to leaders of the coalition.
Both Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrats (FDP), the minority
party in the coalition, and Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader
of the Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), took a hard line on the negotiations
yesterday.
Mr Lambsdorff said that there was a forecast shortfall in tax revenues for
the 1993 budget of DM5bn (Pounds 2bn), and an increased subsidy of a further
DM5bn needed for the Federal Labour Office - which pays unemployment benefit
 -as a result of the economic downturn. A further DM1.5bn had been promised
to Russia, partly for the accelerated withdrawal of troops from eastern
Germany, DM1.5bn for reintroduction of investment allowances in east
Germany, and DM4bn as direct federal subsidies for the eastern Lander.
That would make a total shortfall of some DM17bn, and Mr Lambsdorff said the
coalition partners 'still have to find another DM2bn or DM3bn'.
Mr Waigel said in Munich that social payments, including allowances for
children and new infants, would be subjected to stricter means testing, as
one way of cutting the budget burden in a socially balanced way - to meet
the demands of the SPD. However, both he and Mr Lambsdorff said that the
coalition would press ahead with the savings package, even if the SPD does
not agree.
Foreign companies seeking to invest in east Germany widely believe they
suffer discrimination compared with indigenous groups, according to a
report* published today, writes David Marsh.
The report, from the Anglo-German Foundation for the Study of Industrial
Society, says foreign companies can overcome this handicap by emphasising
the competitive advantages of foreign investment in the east.
Foreign companies have made up about 10 per cent of investment channeled to
east German through privatisation of state industry holdings since
reunification.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Russian managers given warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Fedorov, the new Russian deputy prime minister in charge of the
economy and finance, yesterday warned Russian industrialists that those
managers who did not improve their companies' performance would be fired and
replaced.
Mr Fedorov, now the senior government economic minister, stressed that the
new government must crack down much harder on inflation and on the budget
deficit than the previous government of Mr Yegor Gaidar.
He said that Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new prime minister, and his team -
largely inherited from Mr Gaidar - would be 'more decisive in the battle
against inflation'. In a direct criticism of Mr Gaidar, he said: 'The Gaidar
government was repeatedly accused of having a rigid monetary policy - but it
did not. Billions of roubles were poured into the economy.' A decree backed
by Mr Chernomyrdin and signed by him on the last day of 1992 to control
prices by extending profit controls on enterprises producing essential
foodstuffs had, he said, been rendered null and void. 'This government will
not try to extend controls on prices.'
The measures to be taken to restructure Russia's vast and generally
inefficient state sector appear to conform to the ideas put up by some
industrialists for a more active industrial policy by the state. This line
was endorsed by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, the Congress of
People's Deputies in December and, in a more muted fashion, by Mr Gaidar
himself.
Promising strong measures to combat unlimited credit advances to the
companies, Mr Fedorov said: 'If the state supports enterprises, it has the
right to get assurances that they will not exceed the resources given. Where
the companies are state property it is the privilege of the state to
reorganise those companies and to replace these managers accustomed to live
an easy life by lobbying for credits.'
Such a policy, he said, would mean that 'you do not need to close
enterprises'. However, he did not rule out bankruptcies of companies and
said that a 'bankruptcy agency' would be probably created to oversee those
companies which were no longer viable.
Acknowledging that there were serious differences between the government and
the Russian central bank, he said that Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central
bank chairman, would join the committee on credit policy set up under Mr
Gaidar to attempt to control the Bank's credit advances - an obvious attempt
to rein back the chairman.
Mr Fedorov said that the central bank's job was to 'strengthen the rouble,
not keep up production'. The bank should not, he said, relieve the
enterprises of their debt burden by paying off the accumulated debt every
six months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk announced yesterday that Ukraine and
Russia had reached a tentative agreement on division of the former Soviet
Union's foreign debts and assets, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev.
He said the proposal, agreed at meetings in Moscow on Friday, was now being
considered by the Paris and London Clubs of creditors.
Last week, the unresolved dispute between Ukraine and Russia over foreign
debt forced western creditors to call off debt rescheduling talks.
Unlike the other former Soviet republics, Ukraine has been reluctant to
accept the 'zero variant', according to which Russia would assume
responsibility for both debts and assets. Instead, Ukraine has pressed
Russia to disclose the full extent of the foreign assets of the former
Soviet Union and has expressed readiness to pay its share of the debt.
Ukrainian officials said that, according to the deal, Ukraine would
independently pay for a share of the foreign debt, a solution western
creditors have strongly opposed in the past, fearing that Ukraine will be
unable to meet its obligations.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Allies strike at Iraqi radar: Missile sites hit - Baghdad
says 21 dead / Russia wants Security Council meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON, MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS AT THE UN, BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED AIRCRAFT knocked out the remnants of Iraq's southern air defence
radar system during bombing raids yesterday, US officials said last night.
Iraq said 21 people were killed in the latest attacks in the country's two
'no fly' zones, but the US warned of further raids unless Iraq stopped
violating the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire.
In the first sign of a crack in United Nations solidarity, however, Russia
called for a Security Council meeting to consider the conflict.
The Pentagon in Washington said the daylight attacks by 69 US, British and
French aircraft were to 'finish the job' on radar sites and anti-aircraft
missile batteries missed in the air strike in the southern 'no-fly' zone
last Wednesday.
The latest raid left Iraq 'effectively' with 'no co-ordinated warning
system' for defences in the south, a Pentagon official said. Another
official added: 'The Iraqi air defence capability in southern Iraq is
neutralised.'
But three mobile anti-aircraft missile batteries in the south were not
attacked because they had been moved and the allies could not find them. US
officials said Iraqi missile batteries presented a constantly moving target.
'They set them up and take them down,' one officer said.
Defence officials said a US F-15 fighter apparently shot down an Iraqi
Mig-25 fighter over southern Iraq. If confirmed, it would be the third Iraqi
jet shot down by US aircraft for alleged violations of the no-fly zones
since December 27.
US aircraft also fired missiles at an Iraqi radar site in the northern
no-fly zone after the radar tried to 'lock on' to allied aircraft, and
allied jets bombed anti-aircraft gun sites.
The Pentagon claimed that Sunday's attack by about 45 ship-fired US cruise
missiles against a nuclear components factory near Baghdad was very
successful.
'We had certain key buildings in that complex that we wanted to hit,' a
Pentagon spokesman said. 'Some of those buildings are now standing only in
terms of external walls.'
But US military officials said one of their missiles was apparently knocked
off course by Iraqi anti-aircraft fire and struck the ground outside
Baghdad's Rashid hotel.
They said the 1,000-pound warhead on the Tomahawk missile did not explode,
but burnt, damaging the hotel. An emotional funeral took place yesterday of
two women receptionists who, the Iraqis said, died when the hotel lobby was
wrecked.
In calling for a new Security Council meeting on the crisis, Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said in a note to his US opposite
number, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, that action against Iraq had to be
'adequate' and 'flow from agreed decisions' of the council.
The note expressed concern for the deaths of Iraqi civilians and the safety
of about 100 Russians in Baghdad.
At the UN last night, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general,
intensified efforts to guarantee the inviolability of Kuwait's newly
demarcated border with Iraq by proposing to deploy up to 3,000 international
troops there.
The move was in response to a Security Council request that Mr Boutros Ghali
explore restoring the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (Unikom) to full
strength and, 'in an emergency such as this', rapidly reinforce the
operation.
It also follows deployment yesterday of a US battalion in Kuwait and a
Kuwaiti request for British and French troops.
The proposal may be discussed when the Security Council holds consultations
later today. However, the border issue appeared to be defused yesterday with
the removal of the last Iraqi police posts from the territory which has
reverted to Kuwait.
President George Bush, returning to Washington after a final weekend in Camp
David, said 'we did the right thing' in the latest round of attacks, the
third time in six days that coalition air forces have bombed Iraq. He
praised President-elect Bill Clinton, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
President Francois Mitterrand of France for their support.
Mr Clinton, in the midst of the celebrations to mark his inauguration as the
42nd US president tomorrow, said he fully backed efforts to make Iraq comply
with the UN Security Council resolutions.
Addressing diplomats, he said: 'I ask each of you to emphasise this point to
your governments.'
Iraq continued to insist that the exclusion zones were illegal. Baghdad
radio quoted vice-president Taha Yassin Ramadan as saying the US, Britain
and France were trying to divide up Iraq, violating its sovereignty.
Iraqi retaliation has so far been minimal. Air raid sirens sounded in
Dhahran and Kuwait yesterday on rumours that Iraq had launched some of its
remaining Scud missiles, but the Defence Department in Washington said there
was no evidence of any firing.
Iraq's information minister, Mr Hamed Youssef Hummai, said Iraq was prepared
to enter talks but would not be terrorised by air strikes.

FT  19 JAN 93 / UK bank losses blamed on government policies:
Leigh-Pemberton identifies 'errors' in 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISTAKES in economic policy in the 1980s were a significant cause of the
huge losses now being suffered by the country's banks, Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said last night.
His remarks come at a time when relations between the banks and the
government are strained. He did not address the Treasury's allegation that
banks are behaving insensitively in their dealings with financially
stretched small businesses.
But he expressly denied a claim being investigated by the Treasury that
lending margins have widened significantly.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who is due to retire in June, said poor credit
assessment by banks was also a factor in causing the loan losses. But he
absolved the Bank's supervision department of any blame. 'Supervisors . . .
cannot and should not second guess the management of individual
institutions,' he said.
He said the main role of the supervision department was to prevent damage to
the financial system. 'The UK banking industry is well-placed to absorb the
pressures of the longest and deepest recession in many decades.'
UK banks have suffered billions of pounds of losses on loans made in the
mid-1980s. Many of the bad loans were to property companies or were backed
by property collateral.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton, talking to the Chartered Institute of Bankers in
Scotland, said 'it was not surprising that banks sought to increase the
volume of their lending (in the 1980s) . . . it may well be that banks,
lulled by the strength and the persistence of the upswing, became less
sensitive to cyclical risks'.
He added: 'Many financial arrangements that had seemed reasonable in the
heady days of the 1980s, reasonable even against normal expectations of
cyclical behaviour, were fatally undermined by the length and depth of the
recession.'
He said the recession would not have been so deep if the government had not
allowed the growth rate immediately before to be excessive. 'The lesson for
policymakers is that we can never afford to take risks with stability . . .
we need, above all, a stable monetary environment, one in which policy is
geared to the achievement of price stability.'
Mr Leigh-Pemberton did not argue that banks were blameless for their loan
losses. He identified three lessons for them:
'Do they really pay sufficient attention to the lessons of history - for
example the property crisis of the early 1970s?'
'Did they really monitor the credit criteria which had served them well in
the past?'
'Were the incentives given to loan officers really appropriate, or did they
encourage new business at the expense of sound business?'
He lectured the banks on the need to attach the highest priority to the
'control and pricing of risk'. But he said the deregulation of banking and
financial services was 'irreversible and, in any case, desirable'.

FT  19 JAN 93 / Brussels cuts EC growth forecast to 0.8% in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday cut its forecast for growth in European
Community countries this year to 0.8 per cent from 1 to 1.5 per cent. It
laid most of the blame on the sluggish German economy.
EC finance ministers in Brussels reacted with an effort to talk up prospects
for an early cut in European interest rates, an accelerated growth package
and the view that the worst of the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism was
over.
In a joint statement, ministers reaffirmed their determination to support
member states participating in the ERM and issued an unusual statement
welcoming the new Irish government's decision to defend the punt's existing
parities with other ERM currencies. 'The Council believes this policy is
entirely justified,' ministers said.
Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, said the statement
reflected a joint belief that recent speculation against the punt, the
French franc and the Danish krone was unwarranted. 'Personally I believe the
worst is over,' he said, echoing similar statements last week by EC central
bankers.
Irish officials said they believed the punt had 'weathered the ERM crisis',
and were visibly pleased that EC finance ministers had agreed to Dublin's
request for a statement aimed at cowing speculators. But ministers were
guarded about an early return of the Italian lira to the ERM, despite
agreement on an Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.5bn) medium-term balance of payments loan.
At yesterday's meeting - the first high-level macroeconomic discussion at
ministerial level during the Danish presidency of the EC - the mood of
solidarity was damped by the gloomy growth forecasts produced by the
European Commission.
According to the Commission's projections, growth in the EC this year to 0.8
per cent will fall from 1.1 per cent in 1992. This is lower than last
month's Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development outlook which
forecast 1.2 per cent for the Community in 1993, and less than the
Commission's earlier guarded hopes of growth between 1 and 1.5 per cent.
The Commission said it expected Germany to remain flat, with France and
Spain each reaching a meagre 1 per cent. But the Commission said it expected
growth of 1.3 per cent in Britain in 1993 - marginally higher than the
Treasury forecast of 1 per cent.
Mr Christophersen said the improvement was a result of a gain in the UK's
competitive position following sterling's depreciation after its exit from
the ERM last September, as well as the British government's success in
fighting inflation.
Several EC ministers yesterday expressed polite hopes of an imminent cut in
German interest rates. Mr Christophersen - along with Mr Thor Pedersen,
Danish economics minister - expressed confidence that plans for a wages pact
between unions and employers in Germany coupled with proposals for a tax
rise in 1995 should pave the way for an early cut in Bundesbank interest
rates.
Ministers also agreed to accelerate plans for an EC growth package. A new
European Investment Bank lending facility to finance roads and
telecommunications in western and eastern Europe should be ready by the end
of the month.
A crucial element in the EC package is ensuring that member states live up
to their promises to promote growth through a shift from current to capital
spending, moderate wage settlements, and other measures to create jobs.

FT  19 JAN 93 / MPs voice fears of a drift to large-scale hostilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RENEWED military action against Iraq brought the first signs of unease
among British politicians yesterday over whether the western allies have
framed a coherent strategy to respond to President Saddam Hussein's defiance
of the United Nations.
But Downing Street, warning of the possibility of renewed attacks unless
Baghdad meets its UN obligations, rejected opposition suggestions that the
west should seek a further mandate from the Security Council.
Prime Minister John Major's support for the latest two strikes was endorsed
by Labour and Liberal leaders after government assurances that the attacks
were fully in accordance with international law and the terms of existing UN
resolutions.
A dozen leftwing Labour MPs opposed to the strikes failed to secure an
emergency parliamentary debate on the conflict.
But concern voiced by opposition spokesmen about the allies' long-term
approach to the Iraqi leader was echoed by some senior Conservative MPs
after a House of Commons statement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary.
Mr David Clark, Labour's shadow defence secretary, and Mr Menzies Campbell,
the Liberal Democrat spokesman, called for renewed debate in the Security
Council to secure the broadest possible coalition against Iraqi provocation.
Cautioning that the allies could be drifting towards another bout of
large-scale hostilities, Mr Clark said that they needed to re-establish a
coherent and long-term strategy towards Iraq.
Mr David Howell, chairman of the influential foreign affairs committee of
backbench MPs, added that military action should be underpinned by a
political and diplomatic strategy designed to bolster internal Iraqi
opposition. Mr Rifkind stressed that the three countries involved in the
latest strike were carrying out the will of the UN.
The cruise missile attack was a measured and proportionate response to
Baghdad's refusal to allow free access for UN weapons inspections teams.
Officials added that there was no need for the west to seek a renewed
mandate from the Security Council as long as its response remained
proportionate to Iraqi defiance.
But there was acknowledgement in Whitehall that if Mr Saddam does not back
down, it will be increasingly difficult to allow piecemeal escalation.
Mr Rifkind said repeatedly yesterday that military action was a last resort.
But he offered no other real options.
Mr Major is acutely conscious of the need to remain within a UN framework
and of the concern in the Arab world about the legitimacy of repeated
strikes.
He spoke no fewer than six times to outgoing President George Bush at the
weekend before final approval for the latest two strikes was given. But MPs
are no longer sure where military action is taking them.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Allies face border dilemma: Iraqis hail Saddam victor of the
Mother of all Battles, while tension grows along dividing line with Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAJOR-GEN Robert Frix, commander of the US task force in Kuwait, yesterday
denied his 1,100 troops would have any role in policing Kuwait's northern
border with Iraq. But as yesterday's reported killing of an Iraqi
'infiltrator' by Kuwaiti police showed, the newly demarcated frontier could
prove more than the 249 unarmed UN observers patrolling the border can fully
control.
Details of yesterday's skirmish remain unclear, but the Kuwait interior
ministry reported three 'infiltrators' had been accosted by Kuwaiti border
police. One was killed in subsequent shooting, one arrested and one escaped.
A western official said the incident occurred at Umm Qasr by the border, and
the three Iraqis were policemen.
The US troops have no present role on the border since it lies in a
demilitarised zone extending 10km into Iraq and 5km into Kuwait. Only 45
Danish troops in the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (Unikom) are permitted
side-arms, and their job is to guard Unikom's posts in Doha and at Umm Qasr.
Yesterday's shooting, not the first across this border over the past year,
shows Unikom is poorly placed to enforce a border the UN demarcated in
November last year but which Iraq has refused to acknowledge. Formally,
Unikom officers are there only to report violations of the Gulf War
ceasefire pact.
Capt Joe Gaffney, violations officer, says these have averaged one a day
since the end of the war, mostly through Iraqi or Kuwaiti police bringing
automatic weapons, rather than the side-arms they are permitted, into the
area, or from military overflights.
Unikom considers the four Iraqi incursions as serious violations, but they
do so largely because Iraq failed to meet the procedures laid down for them
to retrieve goods and structures they had been permitted to retrieve, with
the notable exception of the three Silkworm missiles several hundred Iraqis
took from a bunker at Umm Qasr.
Unikom's officers view more seriously Iraq's persistent refusal to move six
police posts from what is now Kuwaiti land, under the new demarcation which
has moved the frontier between 100m and 800m north into what Iraq regarded
as its territory.
The six posts, there since the end of the Gulf War and manned by at least 46
Iraqi police, lie in a line stretching west from Umm Qasr along the northern
stretch of Kuwait's 240km border with its hostile neighbour.
Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, described the continued manning
of the posts as a 'minor' matter to be worked out between Iraq and the UN.
But the police show no sign of moving. If they were to move north, it would
amount to Iraq's first acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the
UN-designated border. If the six police buildings stay, Unikom can do little
directly to move them.
Maj Gen Frix said his troops, who yesterday began moving their tanks,
artillery and fighting vehicles into the north-western Kuwaiti desert, are
there to deal only with anything which 'threatens our forces or the
Kuwaitis'. This, he said, would be 'major Iraqi troop movements in our
direction'. Problems in the demilitarised zone, were, he said, 'quite
frankly above us' - meaning a matter for the UN Security Council.
If the UN and the allies are determined to move the police posts, and Iraq
remains equally determined they should stay, the Security Council may have
to study changing Unikom's mandate in Kuwait and consider turning the blue
berets from observers into peacekeepers or even peacemakers.
Meanwhile, a line of Kuwaiti tanks has dug in south of the demilitarised
zone on full alert. By tomorrow, 1,100 troops from the US 1st Cavalry will
be conducting manoeuvres behind them.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Nissan UK's claim on franchise loss rejected: Arbitrators'
decision severe blow to Botnar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN UK, the former British importer and distributor of Nissan vehicles,
controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, has lost its claim for damages totalling
several hundred million pounds against Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker.
International arbitrators have ruled that Nissan Motor was justified in
terminating NUK's lucrative distribution franchise at the end of 1990 and
have dismissed NUK's claim for compensation.
The arbitration ruling is a heavy setback for Mr Botnar, the 79-year-old
chairman of both Nissan UK Holdings and Automotive Financial Group Holdings,
its associated company, which is one of the largest retail motor groups in
Britain.
An NUK spokesman said last night: 'Our reaction is one of disbelief that the
efforts of a major company like Nissan UK, that built up the franchise with
great success to the benefit of Nissan over 20 years, could be plundered and
the company destroyed without a penny in compensation.'
The arbitration was carried out under the rules of the Japan Commercial
Arbitration Association as stipulated by the 1971 distribution agreement
between NUK and Nissan Motor. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal in
London ruled that the case should be handled by the JCAA despite NUK
objections.
A warrant, issued by the Inland Revenue at the end of January last year, is
still outstanding for the arrest of Mr Botnar, who has controlled one of the
most profitable privately-owned business groups in the UK with profits of
Pounds 130m in the year to July 1991.
Mr Botnar was abroad when the warrant was issued and now lives in
Switzerland.
The trial is due to begin shortly in London of two of Mr Botnar's main
business associates, Mr Michael Hunt and Mr Frank Shannon, who were arrested
a year ago at the same time that the warrant was issued for Mr Botnar's
arrest.
Mr Hunt, deputy chairman and assistant managing director of NUK, and Mr
Shannon, a former NUK finance director, are charged with corporation tax
fraud related to the manipulation of NUK profits.
The unanimous ruling against NUK by the three international arbitrators  -
two from the US and one from Japan - ends one part of the complex,
long-running legal battle between Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest
carmaker, and NUK, its importer/distributor since the beginning of the
1970s.
NUK had built the Nissan franchise into one of the most lucrative automotive
businesses in Britain, accounting consistently for around 6 per cent of the
UK new car market from the mid-1970s to the end of the 1980s.
Nissan Motor said the three international arbitrators had ruled that NUK had
'violated' its distribution agreement with Nissan.
The main violation concerned NUK's transfer of shares in its car retailing
subsidiaries to the associated company, Automotive Financial Group Holdings,
without Nissan Motor's consent, and the subsequent transfer, also without
consent, of a 71 per cent stake in AFGH to the Luxembourg subsidiary of
Union Bank of Switzerland.
The NUK spokesman said last night that the UBS transaction was 'a complete
red herring' which Nissan Motor had known about 'from day one'.
The arbitrators ruled that the breakdown of business relations between the
Japanese carmaker and its former UK importer also justified termination of
NUK's franchise agreement.
'The behaviour of NUK with respect to its relations with Nissan Motor
Company, taken as a whole, constituted a compelling reason for the
agreement's termination and an alternative justification for termination,'
said the arbitrators.
The dismissal means that Mr Botnar has lost without compensation the main
substance of Nissan UK Holdings.

FT  18 JAN 93 / BA close to revised deal for a 20% holding in USAir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways is expected shortly to announce a revised partnership deal
with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier.
The companies could unveil a deal this week, following the inauguration on
Wednesday of President Bill Clinton, who criticised the original proposal
during his election campaign.
That partnership agreement - blocked in December by a US-UK government
dispute over liberalising air services between the two countries - would
have given BA a 44 per cent stake in USAir for Dollars 750m (Pounds 488m).
The new deal would give BA about 20 per cent, for an investment of Dollars
340m, and voting rights of about 20 per cent. BA, which last week apologised
for waging a 'dirty tricks' campaign against rival Virgin Atlantic and paid
out about Pounds 3.6m in damages and costs, confirmed yesterday that
discussions were continuing with USAir on some form of alliance. BA is
believed to have dropped its demand for a right of veto on important
spending decisions - a factor which hindered approval of the original
agreement.
The new deal stands a better chance of being cleared by the US authorities
than the earlier, more ambitious proposal. In pitching for a stake and
voting rights of less than 25 per cent, BA will hope the US Department of
Transportation will nod the deal through. In its initial proposal, BA argued
that its stake of 44 per cent would only carry a 21 per cent voting right,
but big US carriers objected.
These US carriers may well continue their campaign against the revised deal.
American, United, and Delta put intense pressure on the US government to
insist the UK opened up London's Heathrow Airport to more US airline
services in return for approving the original deal.
United said yesterday it could not comment on a new BA deal without knowing
the details. It said it saw any agreement between BA and USAir as a chance
for the UK and US to develop more liberal open skies policies.
BA and USAir would become closely integrated, carrying out joint marketing.
BA sees the alliance as the means to take advantage of deregulating markets
in Europe and across the Atlantic, giving it unrivalled access to the US
east coast compared with European competitors.

FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ottawa buys 15% of Hibernia
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN government has come to the rescue of the country's most
ambitious energy project by buying a 15 per cent stake in the Hibernia oil
and gas development off the coast of Newfoundland.
The purchase, which is likely to be reduced to 8.5 per cent, is in addition
to CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) in official grants and CDollars 1.7bn in
loan guarantees to attract private-sector participation in the CDollars
5.2bn project.
Ottawa had to intervene or let Hibernia die when no outside investors
stepped forward to buy the 25 per cent interest abandoned by Gulf Canada
Resources last year. Gulf, which advised its partners to mothball the
project, halted financial contributions last week when total spending on
Hibernia passed CDollars 1bn.
The government will cut its stake to 8.5 per cent once formalities are
completed for Murphy Oil of Arkansas to buy a 6.5 per cent interest. The
remainder of Gulf's interest will be split between two existing partners,
Mobil Oil Canada and Chevron Canada Resources. Petro-Canada will retain a 25
per cent interest.
The government has been under strong political pressure to rescue the
project which is widely seen as indispensable to the economy of
Newfoundland, where unemployment is running at about 22 per cent.

AT LEAST four British peacekeepers have been taken hostage by the radical
Khmer Rouge guerrilla faction in north-west Kompong Chhnang province, UN
officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
The men, part of a UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia naval observer
team, were abducted while on reconnaissance along the Sen river, they added.
Over the past two months the Khmer Rouge have taken scores of Untac
personnel hostage. Last month they threatened to execute prisoners.

FT  18 JAN 93 / German waste disposal industry under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JUST a few weeks ago, Germany's flourishing waste disposal industry was
reported to be one of only two sectors in the entire economy showing any
optimism about prospects for the coming year.
Today, the industry is under attack from two directions.
The feisty Federal Cartel Office in Berlin says it is opening proceedings
against the Duales System Deutschland (DSD), the nationwide rubbish
recycling venture, for seeking to extend its monopoly position from consumer
packaging to the business sector.
At the same time a leading parliamentarian has charged that the big
electricity utilities, led by RWE and VEW, are buying up small
waste-disposal contractors, and rapidly bringing the industry under their
control by the back door.
Caught in the middle are the 16 Lander governments who, it transpires, have
actually been encouraging the monopoly process. It was they who asked DSD to
extend its operations from house-to-house collection of packaging, into the
small business sector.
The cartel office says it has long been concerned about the monopoly
position of DSD in collecting and recycling consumer packaging. However, the
monopoly is effectively written into the packaging law passed by the
Bundestag last year, so the cartel office has been forced to accept it.
Since December, however, DSD has moved into the collection of packaging from
small businesses, hotels, restaurants and hospitals, which are not covered
by the packaging law. That is now the subject of the cartel action.
DSD, covering more than 600 of Germany's largest consumer manufacturers,
packaging companies and packers, runs the 'green point' system to organise
recycling of packaging. Companies pay a fee to print a green point on their
cartons and containers, which are then eligible to be collected and
recycled. Companies which are not signed on to the system are required to
arrange for the disposal or recycling of their packaging themselves.
'We tolerate the DSD monopoly in collecting household packaging, because the
legislature decided the system would not work otherwise,' Mr Jurgen Kiecker
of the cartel office said. 'We are not prepared to tolerate them moving into
the business area.'
The other charge against the industry has been raised by Mr Reinhard Gohner,
chairman of the constitutional commission of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats. He summoned a press conference to accuse RWE, the
Essen-based semi-state electricity utility, of leading a move to effectively
re-nationalise the waste disposal industry, sold off by local authorities in
the 1970s.
He said that RWE had bought 70 such contractors in the last four years.
The cartel office has also confirmed that it is concerned at the rapid
concentration of contractors collecting and processing waste on behalf of
DSD. But the degree of concentration had not, so far, undermined competition
in the industry.
'We are watching the situation closely,' Mr Kiecker said.

FT  18 JAN 93 / The world's no-win zones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The jury is still out over what exactly was achieved by last week's air
strike against military installations in Iraq. Taking out only half the
targets does not seem a particularly impressive achievement. The more
important question is, what did it achieve in strategic terms; or even, what
was it meant to achieve in strategic terms?
The 'new world order', which was supposed to be coming soon after the Gulf
war two years ago, is still obviously a long way off. Released from the icy
grip of the cold war, the international community is trying to do more than
in the past about some of the wrongs of the world. The problem is that
world-ordering is just as intractable as ever.
In Iraq, the west seems to be stuck with an ambiguous strategy that fails to
reconcile conflicting objectives. In the former Yugoslavia, it is hoping
against hope that the civil war can be brought to an end through trade
sanctions and diplomatic negotiations, because no one wants to accept the
alternative of military intervention on the ground.
Last week's air strike against Iraq was ostensibly to enforce the no-fly
zone south of the 32nd parallel. Yet the reasons for this no-fly zone have
by now become blurred. It was originally imposed to hamper Saddam Hussein's
repression of the Shias in the south. In reality such repression would
mainly be carried out by land forces; an air exclusion zone could not have
much effect. So is it now really being maintained to limit Baghdad's ability
to threaten Kuwait and the rest of the Gulf? To weaken his position at home?
Or what?
In any case, Saddam showed last week that he can easily stick the outside
world with the inherent contradiction between the UN's no-fly zone and its
need for freedom to fly its arms inspectors anywhere. Since the air attack,
he has said he would stop obstructing the arms inspectors; but it is obvious
that this bombing raid, as with other bombing raids, is not a durable
solution to anything, because it cannot be.
The situation in the former Yugoslavia is much worse. An apparent change of
heart by the Bosnian Serbs last Tuesday gave an unexpected reprieve to the
peace talks in Geneva; Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said he
accepted the constitutional plan put forward by Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen,
and undertook to try to sell it to his own supporters.
Having conquered so much of the territory of Bosnia, many Bosnian Serbs will
want to reject the plan. But if their answer is yes, then we shall face the
moment of truth. For the next stage in the negotiations would be the
allocation of territory to the various warring factions - Serbs, Moslems and
Croatians - and that is where the briar patch gets really thorny.
The patchwork of 10 quasi-autonomous provinces, proposed by Mr Vance and
Lord Owen, is an inherently bizarre recipe of contradictory principles.
Poised uneasily on the cusp between autonomy for the (ethnically-based)
provinces and the legitimacy of the state, it can hardly avoid rolling one
way or another, almost certainly towards disintegration and the effective
expansion of greater Serbia.
In principle, the plan concedes far too much to ethnic cleansing and
territorial conquest, which are widely condemned. An even more serious
problem in practice is that the Vance-Owen map would require the Bosnian
Serbs to surrender a substantial proportion of the territory that they now
effectively control.
If the Serbs do not agree to surrender the territory, the west will have an
interesting choice: either to let them keep what they have conquered, in
which case these negotiations will merely have served to endorse the Serbian
aggression and savagery; or else to make them conform to the Vance-Owen map,
which would mean a credible threat to deploy substantial international
forces on the ground. No prizes are offered for guessing the likely outcome,
since western governments are horrified at the idea of getting involved in
this dirty civil war.
Aspirations for a better world order will not disappear. The Gulf war was a
one-off event, unique in its black-and-white simplicity, unsatisfactory in
its political outcome and irrelevant to other situations. Yet that UN
performance set a precedent which continues to influence the mind-sets of
the members of the Security Council.
It may be exceedingly difficult to reproduce that precedent, however. First,
the US may be less politically inclined to take on the essential leadership
role. We do not yet know just how President Clinton will respond to the
latest spasm in the Iraqi crisis. But his election platform, with its clear
priority for domestic issues, suggests that he would be less likely than Mr
Bush to play the role of the global policeman.
In any case, the Gulf war already showed that the US can no longer afford to
exercise this role alone. The shrinking of US finances, and then of US
forces, mean that the growing demands for UN peacekeeping can only be met in
future if the Europeans are prepared to share the leadership and the costs.
In this context 'Europeans' means more than just Britain and France: it
means the Germans must play their part as well. The fact that the German
Social Democrats have blocked any easing of the limitation on the use of
German military force is a serious setback for the prospect of UN
peacekeeping.

FT  18 JAN 93 / A wake-up call from Laura Tyson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President-elect Bill Clinton's selection of Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson as
chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and his reliance on
economic advice from the likes of Labour Secretary-designate Robert Reich, a
lawyer by training, has angered many US economists. The Los Angeles Times
reported a mood of 'quiet fury' at this month's meeting of the American
Economics Association. Supporters and detractors of the Clinton appointees
have been insulting each other for weeks on the editorial pages of leading
papers.
In a typical intervention, Mr Robert Barro, a leading conservative economist
at Harvard, referred dismissively to Ms Tyson's 'scant academic
credentials'. Mr Paul Krugman, his liberal counterpart at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, claimed Mr Reich was a 'pop-internationalist' who
was ignorant of basic economic theory. Mr Krugman has more time for Ms Tyson
(who has an MIT PhD), but found himself in hot water after telling one
reporter she lacked analytical skills.
In preferring Ms Tyson to Mr Larry Summers, a Harvard economist on leave at
the World Bank, Mr Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Mr Krugman, all
of whom are committed Democrats with impeccable academic records, Mr Clinton
showed no respect for the profession's own pecking order. Yet claims that Ms
Tyson, a Berkeley professor, is unqualified for the post are unfounded.
The roll call of past CEA chairmen is actually rather undistinguished; it
excludes all of the most respected postwar economists, including giants such
as Paul Samuelson, Milton Friedman and James Tobin. The only true academic
star to get the job was Harvard's Martin Feldstein, but he resigned in
frustration when Ronald Reagan ignored his pleas for deficit reduction.
Most presidents have chosen ideologically compatible, middle-ranking
economists with an interest in public policy. Ms Tyson fits this bill
perfectly: she was a logical choice for Mr Clinton because she has written
extensively on trade and industrial policy and shares his prejudice that
government inaction, especially in high-technology sectors, has helped
undermine US competitiveness. By naming Ms Tyson, Mr Clinton also struck a
long overdue blow against male dominance of the economics profession; only a
handful of women have won tenured posts at the top ranking universities.
The overall balance of Mr Clinton's economic team, however, is harder to
defend. Doubts raised by Ms Tyson's appointment were exacerbated by the
naming of Mr Ron Brown as commerce secretary and Mr Mickey Kantor as US
trade representative. These lawyer-lobbyists have scant economic experience
and will sit on a National Economic Council (NEC) that includes Treasury
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, budget director Leon Panetta (both
lawyer-politicians), NEC director Robert Rubin (a lawyer-banker), Mr Reich
(a lawyer-author) and Ms Tyson, an economist who is sceptical of the
efficiency of free markets.
The problem lies less in any individual appointment than in the fact that
nobody at the highest level is a natural champion of market forces. Nobody
can be relied upon to make the counter-arguments against proposals, for
example, to subsidise particular 'strategic' sectors. While talented, Mr
Clinton's cabinet thus lacks the kind of economic anchor that might have
been provided by, say, Mr Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman,
at the Treasury or a highly respected 'mainstream' CEA chairman.
On the other hand, Mr Clinton is tapping a rich vein of talent at
sub-cabinet level: Mr Summers is getting the under-secretaryship for
international affairs at the Treasury; Mr Larry Katz, one of the brightest
young Harvard economists, is joining Mr Reich at Labour. Mr Joseph Stiglitz,
a leading theorist at Stanford, is expected to join the highly regarded Mr
Blinder as a junior member of the CEA. None of these 'stars', however, will
enjoy the influence or presidential access of Ms Tyson, who will rule the
roost as Mr Clinton's 'chief economist'.
Mr Clinton deserves credit for puncturing some over-sized economic egos. But
the controversy over his team runs far deeper. By relying heavily on the
unorthodox Ms Tyson and on self-styled gurus such as Mr Reich and Rhode
Island business consultant Ira Magaziner (who got a top White House post
last week), Mr Clinton is signalling his exasperation with the economics
profession, which he feels has shed little light on the long-run forces
undermining US productivity growth and living standards.
This is perhaps an error. But if the profession is misunderstood it has
nobody but itself to blame. It worships mathematical technique but pays
little attention to the behavioural and institutional forces at play in the
real world - which is too messy to model with tidy equations. It has lost
relevance by trying to pretend economics is a 'hard science' totally
divorced from such related subjects as politics, psychology and sociology.
It has lost its ability to communicate with the laity.
Ms Tyson doubtless appealed to Mr Clinton because she seemed more
knowledgeable about industry and less politically naive than her colleagues.
With any luck her appointment will serve as a wake-up call for economists
everywhere.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Monday Interview: Man who would be worker bee - Edouard
Balladur, potential leader of the next French government, talks to William
Dawkins and David Buchan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the courtly technocrat tipped to lead the next French
government after the March parliamentary election, says prime ministers of
France are like worker bees.
'An eminently frustrating function,' says 63-year-old Mr Balladur, quoting
from his latest book, Dictionary of Reform, as he holds forth in his elegant
office just down the road from the National Assembly. 'The prime minister is
like a kind of industrious bee, devoted exclusively to protecting and
feeding the president of the republic, the queen bee, to whom is attributed
every success and all that is good,' he explains.
Wisely, Mr Balladur refuses comment on the general belief in France that he
will run the right-wing government which the polls indicate will take over
from the Socialists after a decisive election victory. Even so, he
carelessly fails to stop himself slipping from the conditional into the
future tense when describing the policies the next government would, or
will, follow. The message is that, future prime minister or not, Mr Balladur
will set the tone for the next right-wing administration and has already
drawn up his action plan.
As finance minister in the last right-wing government in 1986-88, Mr
Balladur drew up the policy of delicate cohabitation with the Socialist
President Francois Mitterrand. So he will be well-qualified to run the next
cohabition government, and argues in his book that cohabition can even allow
worker bee prime ministers more margin for manoeuvre than in governments in
which prime minister and president are from the same party.
So what kind of man might the French get as the pivotal player in
government? Mr Balladur is nice but a bit dull. One could happily entrust
the family savings to him. He keeps himself to himself and is unfailingly
courteous, even to his political opponents - a sober contrast to the media
folk, entrepreneurs and academics who so interestingly spice the Socialist
team.
His origins and background are quite different to those of Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, the current prime minister, a Ukrainian working-class lad who
made his way from metal-working to the Matignon. Mr Balladur, born into a
rich banking family, is a brilliant product of the Ecole Nationale
d'Administration, the stable of the elite.
As former chief adviser to Mr Georges Pompidou, Mr Balladur was thought to
have held the government together during the former president's long
terminal illness, an experience he no doubt hopes will not be repeated with
the ailing Mr Mitterrand. The Pompidou experience has marked Mr Balladur in
that his ideas seem closer to the moderate pragmatism of his old boss than
the Gaullism of the RPR party to which he belongs.
Yet in one important way, Mr Balladur is also like Mr Beregovoy, another
former finance minister. They both appear most confident on their home turf,
economic policy. If the style is different, the underlying content of Mr
Balladur's policies are very similar to the Socialists, a mark of how
mainstream French politics has converged on the centre in recent years.
On matters such as the need to promote European construction, the defence of
the franc and the importance of preserving the rural economy, Mr Balladur
and the current government speak the same language. 'Today, the objective of
the EC is to organise our continent so that it is more responsible for its
destiny in monetary affairs, in commercial affairs - from where comes the
need to defend our vital interests in Gatt - and on the military and
diplomatic arena, from where we derive the need to develop political
co-operation,' says Mr Balladur.
He is thus about as pro-EC as it is possible for a Gaullist to be. This,
plus his good manners, might make him the least unacceptable candidate to Mr
Mitterrand with whom, after all, the choice of prime minister lies.
In the election run-up, Mr Balladur plays up his policy differences with the
Socialists, but they are mostly on domestic economic management. 'The budget
deficit risks being triple what we left in 1988, the state debt is double,
and the fall in taxes and charges necessary to put our country into good
condition for the single market has not been made. There is the difference
in our general ideas,' he says.
Yet Mr Balladur makes no promises about turning back record unemployment,
now close to 3m and a big factor in the Socialists' unpopularity. 'This will
be a difficult year in all European countries and we cannot hope to do
better than to try to stop the damage.' If western economies pick up at the
end of the year, unemployment might start to fall, but Mr Balladur says it
would be 'irresponsible' to make precise forecasts.
One of the toughest challenges facing the next government will be to
persuade voters that it has better solutions to unemployment than its
predecessor. 'It's not an intellectual difference, it's a question of
action. The real source of unemployment is heavy social security charges,
insufficient training and too rigid forms of work. We must act in all these
directions. It's one thing to say things, it is another to act on them,' Mr
Balladur says.
Here he calls for state backing for apprenticeships and more part-time
working - an area where he admits the Socialists have done well. Where he
does break new ground is to call for sharp cuts in high social charges and
taxes, which he says absorb the equivalent of half of gross domestic
product, a serious burden on economic activity and employment.
This would be funded by an ambitious privatisation programme, similar to the
FFr140bn wave of privatisations he organised in 1986-88, seen as one of the
Gaullist government's few successes. He is moderately confident that the
Paris stock market will be able to absorb heavy state asset sales in the
current difficult economic conditions. 'In 1986 I was told it would take 15
to 20 years to privatise the companies I had selected. In 14 months, I
privatised half of them . . . Today, the conditions are no doubt less
favourable. We shall see. It must be done and we will do it in the best
interests of the state.'
Mr Balladur is already preparing a list of privatisation candidates, which
he says will start with banks, insurance companies and industrial groups.
He sees no point in using privatisation income to curb the deficit in the
short term, even though he thinks the shortfall will be at least FFr100bn
(Pounds 11.7bn) too high this year at FFr230bn or FFr240bn, a long way over
even the Socialists' target. He would rather concentrate on tax cuts to
stimulate the economy and cut the deficit when that has been achieved. 'It
will be necessary to have a five-year plan for the recovery of public
finances to avoid debt becoming a factor in strangling activity,' he adds.
The other big challenge facing a right-wing administration will be to hold
the line against a diverse minority which wants to float or devalue the
franc to pave the way for a drop in French interest rates. Mr Balladur, an
early proponent of a single European currency, is a staunch defender of the
franc fort policy. Yet the right is more internally divided on the franc
fort policy than the Socialists, for which the right comes in for a lot of
teasing from the government.
'It is natural that there should be a debate. On the other hand, I am not
prepared to let the government get away with claiming that it is the
opposition's fault if there has been speculation against the franc,' says Mr
Balladur. He is convinced that devaluation would drive up long-term interest
rates - and hence the cost of industrial investment - as has happened in
Britain after sterling left the EMS, 'an operation from which we would have
nothing to gain'.
The overall impression is that France under a government run and selected by
Mr Balladur is likely to be less fun - less erratic - than the Socialists.
But Mr Balladur would certainly bring a steady pair of hands to a sensitive
period.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Attention on rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKETS' focus this week will clearly be on the prospects for reductions
in French and German interest rates, writes James Blitz.
The 15 basis point cut in German money market rates on January 7 has eased
tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism in the past ten days.
The French franc briefly traded above FFr3.38 on Friday, nearly five
centimes above its ERM floor. The Irish authorities have managed to cut
money market rates without endangering the punt, and the Danish krone is -
as yet - unscathed by the political crisis following Mr Poul Schluter's
resignation.
But there is a strong feeling in the market that the Bundesbank needs to
ease policy again, either this Thursday or at its council meeting on
February 4th, if tensions are not to return to the system.
A factor affecting the Bundesbank's decisions will be the talks on a
solidarity pact between the German government, opposition, employers and
trade unions to finance the soaring cost of German unification.
Members of Germany's ruling coalition government claim to have made 'huge
progress' in finalising proposals, and plans will be presented to the
parliamentary parties tomorrow.
Attention will also focus on whether the Bank of France now reverses its
recent rise in official interest rates, when it officially intervenes in the
domestic market today and on Thursday.
Short-dated interest rates are still at between 11 1/2 and 12 per cent, and
commercial banks are under growing pressure to pass these rises onto the
retail sector. The prospect of European interest rate cuts is certain to
give the dollar a firm underpinning, despite narrow range trading last week.
Mr Bill Clinton's inaugural speech as US President on Wednesday will be
closely scrutinised for any indications its gives of plans to improve the
country's economy with a fiscal stimulus.

<TEXT>
MR Bill Clinton takes over as US president on Wednesday amid signs that the
US recovery is gathering pace. This week brings few economic figures to
upset the new President although housing starts data on Friday are forecast
to be relatively subdued.
In November housing starts rose 1.5 per cent. Many economists now believe
that the boost to housing from record low mortgage rates has passed and any
increases in housing from now are likely to be more modest.
In the UK there are a number of important figures on the real economy.
Hopes are high that December's retail sales figures tomorrow will reflect
anecdotal evidence of a boost to sales over Christmas and reverse November's
0.1 per cent drop.
Later on in the week there are figures for unemployment, and industrial
output as well as two economic surveys. The British Chambers of Commerce
produces its quarterly economic survey and there is the monthly distributive
trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry.
Today: Belgium, EC finance ministers meeting in Brussels; France, November
industrial production (down 0.4 per cent); Canada, December advanced
departmental store sales (up 4 per cent on year); US, Martin Luther King
Day, some markets closed.
Tomorrow: UK, December PSBR (Pounds 3.5bn), CBI distributive trades survey;
Sweden, December trade balance (SKr3.2bn surplus); US, January 16 Johnson
Redbook; Canada, November wage settlement increases (up 2.4 per cent);
Australia, Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin released.
Wednesday: US, Bill Clinton's inauguration as president, Federal Reserve
releases Tan-book for February Federal Open Markets Committee Meeting;
Canada, November unfilled orders (down 0.6 per cent); UK, December retail
sales; Japan, November industrial production; Australia, November housing
finance.
Thursday: UK, December unemployment (up 35,000), November average earnings
(up 5.25 per cent), November unit wage costs (up 0.6 per cent in 3 months to
end November), November industrial production (up 0.1 per cent), November
manufacturing output (flat on month, up 0.5 per cent on year), British
Chambers of Commerce quarterly economic survey; Germany, regular Bundesbank
council meeting in Frankfurt, first round of banking sector wage
negotiations; Sweden, December CPI (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 1.7 per
cent on year); Canada, December CPI (up 0.1 per cent on month); US, money
supply data for week ended January 11, senate confirmation hearing for Laura
Tyson, nominee for CEA chair; Japan, wholesale price index January 1-10,
December money supply, December broad liquidity.
Friday: US, initial claims week ended January 9 (337,000), state benefits
week ended January 2, December housing starts (1.25m), December building
permits; Canada, November retail sales (up 0.3 per cent on month), November
wholesale trade; New Zealand, December trade balance; Japan, first quarter
Bank of Japan economic outlook, the Diet session convenes in Tokyo; Germany,
second round of government and OETV public pay talks.
During the week: Japan, December trade balance (Dollars 12.3bn surplus),
trade balance January 1-10; Germany, December wholesale price index (up 0.1
per cent), November retail sales (down 0.8 per cent), December producer
prices index (flat on month, up 0.6 per cent on year); Denmark, December
consumer prices index (down 0.3 per cent on month, up 1.4 per cent on year);

RESULTS DUE
PHOTO-ME INTERNATIONAL, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and
operator, is expected today to report a marginal increase in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 8.7m to about Pounds 8.9m.
Analysts will be interested in the degree of increased competition in the UK
from overseas companies, and the performance of new products such as novelty
booths, providing photos with celebrities such as Madonna.
Tomorrow, Eurocamp, the camping holiday company floated in July 1991, is
forecast to reveal pre-tax profits for the year to October of about Pounds
9.4m, up from Pounds 8.2m.
Lower interest payments, increased demand and broader markets - especially
Germany and the Netherlands - all lie behind the rise.
Yorkshire Tyne-Tees, the merged ITV company, should announce pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 17.5m for the year to September, with two months included
from Tyne Tees.
This would be a little below original estimates of about Pounds 19m, but
still a solid base to begin tackling its new franchise.
Anxiety about the preference dividend at Kunick, the fruit machines to
nursing homes group, seems set to prove unfounded at the announcement of the
annual results on Wednesday. The recent sale of 50 per cent of the nursing
homes business, reducing debt, should allow both a preference and a nominal
ordinary dividend.
Forecasts are for a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 3.5m, after some Pounds 6m
of exceptionals, against a profit of Pounds 12.4m.
The seasonality of Park Food Group's main business (selling Christmas
hampers) means it regularly reports pre-tax losses at the interim stage. A
smaller first-half deficit is expected to be announced on Friday, down from
Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 4m, For the full 12 months, forecasts of Pounds 9m
pre-tax, compared with Pounds 6.9m last year, are being revised upwards.

FT  18 JAN 93 / UK Gilts: Borrowing requirement is hard to ignore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard for the gilt-edged market to ignore the government's heavy
borrowing requirement. Another gilt auction looms, and market practitioners
are well aware they could see the issuance of as much as Pounds 1bn of
gilt-edged stock per week in the next financial year.
The impending flood of stock has left many in the market wondering just who
will buy these gilts. For many institutional investors, gilts represent only
a small proportion of their total assets, and few seem to be contemplating a
drastic change in strategy.
Mr David Shaw, bond director at Legal &amp; General Investments, points out that
'on valuation grounds, the (UK) equity market looks on the dear side both
intrinsically and against overseas equities. Only against cash and gilts do
(UK shares) look cheap. That cannot be good news for the government broker
who needs to sell Pounds 50bn of gilts in 1993-1994'.
Mr Shaw estimates that in 1992, only 24 per cent of UK institutions' cash
flow went into buying gilts, but he warns that 'the apparent burden on the
UK investment institutions is forecast to rise from Pounds 9bn in 1992 to
Pounds 28bn in 1993 . . . this would represent a diversion of 70 per cent of
their expected cash inflow for next year into gilts'.
To put that in perspective, he says, 'even during the funding crisis of the
middle 1970s those institutions' net new acquisition of gilts never exceeded
50 per cent of new cash inflows'.
So far, there have been few signs that UK institutions are contemplating a
dramatic shift in overall investment strategy. Those which are willing to
boost exposure to fixed income investments are focusing more on the European
and US bond markets rather than the UK government bond market.
Norwich Union says it expects the returns from the bond and equity markets
to be lower this year than in the 1980s. Its with-profits fund is invested:
55 per cent in equities, split with 40 per cent in the UK and 15 per cent
internationally; 25 per cent in fixed income, split 17 per cent in the UK
and 8 per cent in other bond markets; and 20 per cent in property.
Norwich Union says it is not planning to boost its exposure to the gilt
market, given the high returns it expects from the European and US bond
markets.
Other UK institutions tend to have a lower exposure to the gilt-edged market
than Norwich Union. Rothschild Asset Management has emphasised its
commitment to the international fixed income markets in view of the looming
recessions and poor prospects for equities under such economic conditions.
But it has also stressed its preference for overseas bonds rather than UK
government debt. The UK government's heavy funding programme is seen as a
serious concern, with the result that RAM feels more comfortable about
prospects for UK equities (given the hope of an economic recovery in the UK
and the positive effects of the sterling devaluation on corporate profits)
than for the gilt market.
It says the UK pension funds under management are invested with about 60 per
cent of the money in UK equities, 3-4 per cent in conventional gilts, 2 per
cent in index-linked gilts, 7 per cent in overseas bonds, and 22 per cent in
non-UK equities.
Mr John Cozens, assistant director of Prudential Portfolio Managers, says
PPM is underweight in gilts with less than 5 per cent of the total sterling
investments in UK government bonds, while it is slightly overweight in UK
equities, with about 85 per cent of sterling investments in UK shares.
These attitudes are hardly encouraging for the gilt market. Mr Shaw of L&amp;G
concludes that the government may have to reduce its funding requirement
considerably using various means including a temporary suspension of the
full funding rule and higher taxes.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Italian Bonds: D-Mark issue may boost treasury's confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY increasing its debut D-Mark Eurobond to DM5bn from DM4bn last week, the
Republic of Italy highlighted the level of interest in its paper, in spite
of uncertainties over the government and bankers' discontent about the
liquidation of the Efim state holding company.
The Deutsche Bank-led deal should give the treasury confidence to issue
further Eurobonds to reduce its over-dependence on the domestic bond market.
Economists have long called on Italy to diversify its borrowings in view of
punishing levels of lira interest rates. With the new government having
sought to cut spending and raise revenues through a L93,000bn (Dollars 62bn)
1993 budget reduction package, by far the bulk of the budget deficit now
comes from interest payments on past debt.
In the past three years, Italy has extended its debt profile. First seven,
then 10-year domestic bonds were introduced, to a warm welcome from
investors. The longer-term paper has allowed the treasury to improve debt
management by reducing its exposure to market every time a huge slice of
short-term bills has to be rolled over.
However, short-term paper of less than a year's maturity remains the
mainstay of the debt mountain. Only gradually will longer term domestic
issues, and, just possibly, more Eurobonds, bite into the stock of debt,
making it easier to manage, and, the authorities hope, cheaper to finance.
Last week's D-Mark deal showed it could be done. The current 5 percentage
point spread between five-year D-Mark and lira interest rates highlights the
appeal of borrowing in the German currency. True, there is an exchange rate
risk, but most economists believe the lira-DM exchange rate of around L925
seriously undervalues the Italian currency. The treasury could even come out
at a profit.
Borrowing D-Marks also allows the Italians to replenish their heavily
depleted reserves and perhaps build up ammunition for future defences once
the lira re-enters the exchange rate mechanism.
Tapping the D-Mark market could also help the Bank of Italy repay the
Bundesbank the L27,000bn in assistance given during last year's foreign
exchange turmoil, although some economists believe the bulk has already been
repaid.
A further boost to Italy's coffers could come with formal approval today
from EC finance ministers for an Ecu8bn multi-tranche balance of payments
loan, approved by the EC's monetary committee last week.
Mr Mario Draghi, the treasury's director-general, says Italy could raise up
to Dollars 15bn this year on the Euromarkets.
Mr Draghi stressed the Dollars 10bn to Dollars 15bn borrowing range was not
a fixed target, but would depend on market conditions and bankers' advice.
But with their first D-Mark deal successfully put away, the temptation will
surely be to press on.
Domestic political factors play an important part in that calculation. For
Mr Giuliano Amato's government, success on the international capital markets
has far wider implications than might be expected.
After the buffeting of the Efim affair and last year's downgrading of its
credit rating, Italian ministers have heralded the D-Mark bond as a sign of
restored confidence and recognition that Italy's finances are on the mend.
Hence bankers are wondering how the Italians will divide the rest of the
money they would like to borrow in 1993. More D-Mark issues are a strong
possibility, given the attractive terms for last week's Italy bond.
The conclusion is that Italy will launch many more transactions - when
virtually guaranteed of their success.

FT  18 JAN 93 / US Money and Credit: Period of uncertainty over policy shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOW level of US inflation pleased the Treasury bond market late last
week. But the market is in for a period of uncertainty until the Clinton
administration's economic policies take more concrete shape.
On Friday, when fresh data for December showed the consumer price index was
just 2.9 per cent for the whole of 1992, investors responded by boosting by
 5/8 the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue, bringing the yield
down to 7.34 per cent from 7.39 per cent the day before.
While on the one hand the inflation numbers imply more space for fiscal
stimuli if Mr Clinton goes ahead with his campaign pledge to bolster the US
recovery, the levels of both wholesale and retail inflation were encouraging
to bond investors since they were lower than the market expected.
As such they might provide more room for manoeuvre on the fiscal front if
the danger of significant reflation resulting from stimuli is deemed to be
not so great after all.
In addition, the market took heart as incoming Clinton administration
officials, led by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new treasury secretary, and Mr Leon
Panetta, the new director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
indicated that cutting the deficit was a top priority.
Mr Panetta, however, told Congress that President-elect Bill Clinton would
not be presenting a detailed budget plan until March.
This suggests that despite the fairly bullish tone of the market,
uncertainty will result from the tug-of-war between the deficit-cutting
advocates on the Clinton team and those favouring a fiscal stimulus spending
package.
Those who say a fiscal stimulus package is the priority, despite evidence
that the US economy is beginning to recover from recession and stagnation,
make the plausible case that the relative strength of the recovery is being
overestimated.
These advocates also note that employment growth is still lagging behind the
rise in output, and is likely to continue to do so in the absence of some
job creation policies.
The pro-stimulus camp also claims that a fiscal boost could help cure some
of the more structural problems of the US economy and thus be more than a
short-term measure.
A more realistic and powerful explanation for the Clinton camp's enthusiasm
for a fiscal stimulus package was offered by the market-watchers at Nomura
last week, who said it was 'simply political'.
It is of course true that Mr Clinton, who takes office this week with a
mandate to do something about the state of the US economy, will be keen to
show himself to be taking action.
But there are signs that the new administration could also launch a fairly
modest package that meets its political requirements, but falls well short
of the kinds of expectations raised by last year's election campaign.
Back on the deficit front, there will equally be a bonus for the Clinton
administration if it has the courage to increase taxes, perhaps on some
consumer goods or petrol.
But the applause for such a move could be louder on Wall Street than in
mainstream America. SG Warburg reckons that an announcement of such a tax,
or even of plans to study one, could knock as much as 50 basis points off
the long bond's yield, which at present levels would bring it beneath the 7
per cent mark.
Quite how the Fed's stance on interest rates will be affected by Mr
Clinton's economic policies is hard to say.
While this week's presidential inauguration will dominate headlines, the
bond market will be just as keen to see what Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve, has to say about monetary policy when he appears next
week before the Joint Economic Committee.

FT  18 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Japanese investors breathe life into
Euroyen market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A sell-off at the end of last year, the Euroyen bond market has come
back to life. Wider yield spreads have revived interest among Japanese
investors, who can now buy Euroyen bonds at attractive levels relative to
the domestic market.
At the end of last year, many European investors took the view that the
rally in the Japanese bond market had more or less run its course, and took
profits.
But with the Japanese economy still weak, and the widespread belief that a
further cut in the official discount rate is on the way, the market appears
to be better underpinned. Although Japanese investors have proved more
enthusiastic than European ones so far this year, expectations that the yen
will firm against European currencies over the year are encouraging European
demand.
More deals are expected to follow Sweden's Y100bn issue of five-year bonds
last week, which reopened the market for 1993. Portugal is planning to
launch an offering of five-year Eurobonds today. The issue, totalling up to
Y75bn, is arranged by Daiwa Europe and IBJ International. In addition, the
Asian Development Bank is taking bids for a Y50bn 10-year offering later in
the week.
Meanwhile, other European sovereign borrowers and several supranational
agencies are eyeing the market. The World Bank's next global yen bond
offering is also under preparation.
Sovereign and supranational borrowers typically hold funds in a variety of
currencies, often in the form of a pre-determined basket, in order to spread
their currency risk.
The attraction of the Euroyen market is that it currently offers very low
interest rates and can accommodate large funding operations.
The tiering of the Euroyen market has become more pronounced than in
virtually any other market. The market consists on the one hand of a group
of actively traded sovereign, supranational and government-guaranteed names,
bought by international investors.
The second tier is made up of Japanese companies which channel funding
through the Euroyen sector, because fees are lower than in the domestic
market.
Despite the Eurobond label, such paper, often structured deals tailored to
suit specific investor needs, finds its way back to the Japanese market.
There has been talk that the Japanese authorities, unhappy with the
practice, may seek to curb it.
However, with Japanese companies facing large funding requirements this year
to refinance their maturing equity-linked debt, the authorities may decide
the Euroyen market remains too valuable a source of Japanese corporate
financing to tamper with.
Meanwhile, poor swap opportunities have, for the most part, discouraged
foreign corporate borrowers from tapping the market.
Those borrowers in the top tier of the market are estimated to command a
premium of around 10 basis points. But dealers said the market offers the
most attractive funding levels to those sovereign borrowers which are not
the very top credits, since there is less differentiation based on credit
rating than, for example, in the dollar market.
In terms of absolute costs for borrowers, the Euroyen bond market has become
increasingly attractive, as interest rates fell last year. At the same time,
however, margins over the JGB yield curve for Euroyen bonds have widened, so
the benefit of the JGB market rally has been lessened.
For example, the World Bank's first global yen bond offering, launched last
March, was priced to yield 19 basis points below the 10-year Japanese
government bond. It now trades at a yield of around 30 basis points over the
JGB.
'For the top tier names, spreads have a cap of 30-40 basis points (over JGB
yields): at that level, Japanese investors enter the market,' said Mr Neil
Colverd, head of yen trading at Merrill Lynch.
However, unlike the dollar market, Euroyen spreads over the government bond
market do not necessarily provide an accurate means of valuation.
Around 95 per cent of trading in JGBs is concentrated in the current 10-year
benchmark, which consequently trades at a huge premium to other issues.
'Most other JGBs are very rarely traded, which, in effect, means that there
is no yield curve in the government market,' according to Mr Alexander
Mitcheson-Smith, an economist at Banque Paribas.
The revival of activity in the Euroyen market in the last year or so has
created a yield curve made up of actively traded Euroyen bonds, which can
now be used for pricing new issues.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Risk and Reward: Swap market goes into overdrive to keep
pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the Eurobond machine cranked up and running on all cylinders, the swap
market has been working overtime to keep up.
Spreads in the swap market have narrowed as a result - though even at the
end of last week, rates in several currencies were only just below levels at
which more borrowers could be tempted into the bond market.
Few of the recent headline-grabbing D-Mark issues are thought to have been
swapped into other currencies. Borrowers like Italy and Finland, which
between them have raised DM8bn so far in 1993, need the currency to
replenish reserves or repay the Bundesbank for its activities to support
their currencies.
There is one big exception in the D-Mark market: a spate of reverse floating
rate notes (close to DM1bn in all last week) aimed at retail investors who
want to gear up their bets on falling German interest rates. Virtually all
of this is likely to have been offset through the swap market.
Unlike the D-Mark, virtually all borrowing in Canadian dollars (CDollars
2.5bn of it so far this year) is prompted by arbitrage opportunities
presented by the swap market.
The arbitrage arises from the steady stream of domestic Canadian entities
willing to pay the fixed-rate leg of a swap transaction: Canadian mortgage
loans, for instance, are largely fixed-rate, and the banks which make such
loans are natural swap-market counterparties, exchanging their fixed-rate
payment streams for floating-rate ones.
The swap market operates between this domestic Canadian market and the
fixed-rate euro-Canadian dollar market, which is used by international
borrowers whose standing allows them to tap into international demand for
the Canadian dollar, but who are not natural users of the currency.
Canadian dollar swap spreads at the end of last week stood at 68-69 basis
points for five-year maturities, having slipped at the end of the week
before. Even at that level they remain attractive to Euromarket borrowers.
Sterling swap spreads also started the year at a healthy level. A belief in
some quarters that interest rates will rise again before too long has
prompted more demand from treasurers wanting to lock into fixed rates at
current levels. However, the prospect of another interest rate cut has also
kept most on the sidelines, waiting longer before taking the plunge and
moving back down the yield curve.
Five-year sterling swap spreads narrowed last week by between five and 10
basis points, reducing the attractiveness of Eurosterling.
As Canadian dollar and sterling swap rates have eased, borrowers turned last
week to another arbitrage to shave a little more off their borrowing costs -
the different shape of the swap and the underlying government bond yield
curves. In theory, the two should mirror each other: in practice, government
bond curves are dictated by certain benchmark issues, making them a less
efficient pricing mechanism for maturities which fall where there is no
benchmark issue.
The end of last week saw almost identical bond issues in the sterling and
Canadian dollar markets with maturities of just over five and a half years.
Priced off the five-year benchmark bonds, these issues take advantage of the
mismatching yield curves in both currencies during 1998. The swap curves
take full account of higher longer-dated rates for such maturities, while
the government bond curves do not. The three sterling borrowers who took
advantage of this are reckoned to have saved a net 5-10 basis points in
yield.

FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: A phoenix rises from the ashes
of Olympia &amp; York - The efforts being taken by the Reichmann family to build
a new empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A reborn Olympia &amp; York, centred on property management rather than
development, is starting to take shape amid the crumbling Reichmann family
empire.
Even as the Canadian property group struggles to win approval from creditors
for an CDollars 8.5bn (Dollars 6.6bn) debt-restructuring plan, the
Reichmanns are working hard to retain management contracts for buildings
which they developed and owned before O&amp;Y sought bankruptcy protection last
May.
Assuming the debt-restructuring goes through, the property management
business will be hived off to a new company called Olympia &amp; York
Properties. Most of O&amp;Y's other interests will remain under the existing
holding company, Olympia &amp; York Developments.
Four of 33 creditor groups have so far rejected the company's reorganisation
proposals, but they are unlikely to jeopardise the plan as a whole. The most
crucial vote on O&amp;Y's future, by its unsecured lenders, will take place on
January 25.
Under the restructuring plan, the Reichmann family will directly own 10 per
cent of OYP and have at least one director on its board. (The remaining 90
per cent will be held by O&amp;Y Developments which will be controlled for the
foreseeable future by a court-appointed administrator.)
The family will also retain a 20 per cent stake in whatever remains of O&amp;Y's
US buildings.
Most visible in the effort to rebuild the family business is Mr Philip
Reichmann, nephew of Mr Paul Reichmann, who masterminded O&amp;Y's growth during
the 70s and 80s into the world's biggest property developer.
Despite bids from other property management firms, Mr Philip Reichmann
recently persuaded a group of creditors to re-engage O&amp;Y as manager of First
Canadian Place, the group's 72-storey flagship building in Toronto's
financial district.
OYP is expected to be awarded management contracts for several other O&amp;Y
properties in Canada, even though it is on the point of having to relinquish
ownership of some of the buildings.
First Canadian Place creditors are among those who have rejected the
debt-restructuring plan; they are now free to seize the 2.7m sq ft building,
which was pledged as collateral on their loans.
According to a circular to creditors, OYP will be a 'solvent,
self-sustaining company'.
The cornerstone of its sales pitch will be the Reichmanns' experience as
property managers over the past 30 years. As a management rather than a
development company, it will require relatively little capital, and will be
starting off just as the North American commercial property cycle appears to
be inching upward.
Mr Chris Ridebock, a principal at Canadian real estate brokers J. J.
Barnicke, predicts there will be plenty of opportunity for the new company
to diversify into areas such as health-care facilities and suburban
industrial property, where growth is expected to be faster than commercial
property over the next few years.
OYP's parentage also has distinct drawbacks. For instance, lenders taking
over ownership of the world's biggest office building, at 55 Water Street in
Lower Manhattan, are unlikely to retain O&amp;Y to operate the building.
'We're just not satisfied with them,' says an official of the Alabama State
Retirement System, the biggest bondholder.
Prudential Assurance has already installed Enterprise Property Group, a
fast-growing Canadian company, to take care of the 45-storey Aetna Centre in
Toronto, which O&amp;Y handed over to Prudential last month.
While the Reichmanns used to own the buildings they managed, they will face
the challenge of dealing with a large number of outside owners, each with
its own leasing strategy and reporting requirements.
Mr Stuart Lazire, president of Enterprise Property, says that 'their
organisation had a pretty good reputation, but they were a developer, not a
service company. It's a whole different business that they're looking to get
into.'

holding

   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ESCADA, the troubled German fashion group, is to sell its stake in St John
Knits of the US by April, Reuter reports from Munich.
Escada, which last week declined to comment on reports that it planned to
sell its stake of 83 per cent in St John, said the deal should be completed
by April.
The fashion company plans to use the proceeds of more than DM100m (Dollars
61.7m), to offset losses in the 1991-1992 year.
It said in the year ended October 31 1992 it would suffer an operating loss
of DM20m at the parent company and one of just under DM23m for the group, of
which DM17m was due to currency changes.
Escada has been hit by the weak economy as well as by currency turbulence.
Founded by the late Mrs Margaretha Ley (she died in June last year) and her
husband Wolfgang in 1976, it was one of the great success stories of German
business in the mid to late 1980s.
The company was enthusiastically received when it came to the stock market
in 1986 and between 1989 to 1991 its sales doubled to DM1.36bn.
It added that it was still undecided whether the 83 per cent stake would be
sold to a group of investors, placed on the stock market, or sold to the
Gray family that founded the company.
St John, the high quality knitwear business Escada bought in 1989, has about
1,500 employees and turnover of Dollars 81m.
The company said group turnover was about DM1.4bn, up from DM1.36bn
previously.
Mr Hans Woetschaetzke, deputy chairman, said considerable value adjustments
had to be made, especially in foreign subsidiaries. Together with the
operating loss the total burden could be 'slightly above' DM100m, he added.
The company said it could not consider paying a dividend.
The goal is to break even in the year ending October 31 1993.

The state is retaining a 20 per cent holding in the airline while the
remaining 10 per cent goes to the company's employees.
Saturdays's auction was the second attempt at selling the ailing flag
carrier, which has only five operational aircraft but attractive
international routes.
In mid-December, Aeromexico was outbid by Peruvian shipping company Naviera
Santa in association with domestic airline Faucett, with an apparently
winning offer of Dollars 41m.
However, the privatisa-tion committee later declared the airline's sale null
and void, finding fault with details of the banking guarantees supplied by
both bidders.

<TEXT>
PARMALAT, the fast-expanding Italian dairy foods group, is buying 60 per
cent of Fejertej, a Hungarian dairy foods group, from the country's
privatisation agency.
The acquisition, which is Parmalat's biggest venture so far in eastern
Europe, is believed to have cost around L11.5bn (Dollars 7m). The group has
already set up a small milk and yoghurt venture in Russia, and has also
invested in the former east Germany.
Fejertej, which is one of Hungary's leading dairy products producers, has
sales of around L85bn and operating profits of around L6bn. The company has
1,000 employees, and a market share of around 90 per cent in the Fejer and
Komaron regions. Sales this year are forecast to rise to about L97bn.
Parmalat has the right to buy a further stake in Fejertej should its
employees not take up options to buy shares at discounted prices within the
next six months.
Parmalat, which will report its 1992 results early next month, has been
expanding substantially outside Italy in recent years.

queueing system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY has introduced new rules on foreign borrowing. The decree comes amid
concern over Turkey's growing foreign debt, which according to provisional
figures to September has risen to Dollars 56bn, up from Dollars 50bn at the
end of 1991.
The reform introduces a queueing system for all borrowing by government
affiliated agencies to prevent the treasury being crowded out by other
Turkish borrowers. Hitherto the system was applied only to loans which
carried a government guarantee.
Officials said the new rule was aimed at 'putting discipline back into the
market'.
The treasury is particularly anxious about the Ankara municipality. Rated
BBB by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, the municipality has
tapped both syndicated loan and bond markets to finance the Dollars 660m
construction of the city's underground system.
The treasury guaranteed the municipality's latest borrowing - a Dollars 220m
seven-year loan agreed before Christmas, the first tranche of a Dollars 455m
facility for the Metro. The loan carries an interest rate of Libor plus 2.6
per cent, with a participation fee of 2.72 per cent.
Bankers view such margins as generous and officials were clearly worried the
issue could be a very unfavourable benchmark for Turkish risk.
Part of Turkey's debt increase is due to disadvantageous cross rates,
particularly the weak dollar against the D-Mark, which added almost Dollars
2bn to the debt stock in the third quarter.

MUCH OF last week's international corporate activity involved strategic
acquisitions of businesses or stakes in them, writes Brian Bollen.
Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publisher, made its first purchase in Scandinavia,
buying Liber of Sweden, giving it a springboard for further purchases in the
region. Hanson's proposed swap of its US gold mining operations for the coal
business of Santa Fe Pacific will reinforce its position as the world's
second biggest private sector coal producer, if it goes ahead.
News that Tabacalera, Spain's state-controlled tobacco company, is
negotiating the sale of its Royal Brands food business to RJR Nabisco,
prompted United Biscuits to declare its interest in the company's biscuit
brands.
Miller Brewing of the US bought a 20 per cent stake in Molson Breweries of
Canada as part of a wider international alliance with Molson and Foster's
Brewing of Australia. Polygram, the Netherlands-owned music and
entertainment company, expanded its interests in Japan by increasing its
stakes in Nippon Phonogram and Polydor KK.
In telecommunications, Swiss PTT Telecom joined Uniforce, the joint venture
between PTT Telecom of the Netherlands and Sweden's Televerket, which
provides data transmission services to European-based multinational
companies.
Sweden's Spectra-Physics agreed to sell one of its US subsidiaries to
Massachusetts-based Thermo Instrument Systems to help reduce group
borrowings and focus on core business. Campbell Soup of the US said its
increased offer for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, was final.

FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Isosceles finance director to go
in board shuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the heavily-indebted parent of the Gateway food retail chain, is
to lose Mr Bob Nellist, its finance director.
According to one of the group's advisers, it was decided that there was no
need to have separate finance directors of Gateway and Isosceles. It is
expected that Mr Geoff Cooper, Gateway's finance director, will fill Mr
Nellist's position.
Mr David Simons, who recently joined as chief executive, is a former finance
director of Storehouse. Mr Simons replaced Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes who
has returned to his non-executive role.
The financial restructuring of Isosceles continues to be negotiated between
the company, its lenders and its shareholders. The group hopes to complete
the talks by the end of March.
The company, which has debts of about Pounds 1.3bn, recently agreed the
terms of a standstill arrangement with its lenders under which it will defer
interest on its loans and its capital repayments until May 28.
The banks have also provided additional working capital facilities. The
restructuring is expected to involve a sizeable debt-for-equity-swap, with
mezzanine lenders' and shareholders' interests diluted.

FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Butte agrees to ADollars 3.5m
bid for Australian subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUTTE MINING, which is claiming damages of at least Dollars 325m (Pounds
214m) in the US against more than 70 former directors, advisers and
investors, has agreed an ADollars 3.5m (Pounds 1.6m) offer for its 77 per
cent-owned Australian subsidiary, Perserverance Corporation.
The offer is from Central Queensland Gold Mine, which is 45 per cent-owned
by Waverley Mining Finance, the Edinburgh-based investment company, with
Westralian Resources Projects owning the rest. Waverley also owns 10 per
cent of Westralian and 7 per cent of Butte.
Butte and its other Australian subsidiary, VAM, have given irrevocable
undertakings to accept, subject to there being no higher offer for
Perserverance before CQGM's one of 12 cents a share becomes unconditional.
Perserverance and VAM, two small gold mining companies, were taken over by
Butte in 1990 and Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman of Butte, said if the CQGM
offer succeeded, Butte would have to write off about Pounds 12m in
connection with these acquisitions.
However, the deal would relieve Butte of certain guarantees and the proceeds
of the sale would be used to reduce indebtedness.
Mr William McLucas, managing director of Waverley, said the deal would
enable his company to get back most of a loan made to Butte.

FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Debt ratings lowered at
slimmed-down Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, the UK construction group, has had its debt ratings lowered by IBCA,
the credit rating agency, which cited the difficult trading environment.
Tarmac's long-term debt rating fell below investment grade, from BBB to BB+,
while its commercial paper rating dropped from A3 to B. Its commercial paper
is rated A3 by Moody's and P3 by Standard &amp; Poors.
The group is expected to announce substantial pre-tax losses in the year to
December 1992 after heavy exceptional charges.
According to IBCA, the Pounds 150m realised from disposals by December 1992,
and the further Pounds 100m expected in the 1993 financial year, could be
offset by a rise in dollar denominated debt and an anticipated cash outflow
arising from reduced contracting workloads.
'Although the group has made some progress in disposing of peripheral
activities and benefits from a relatively long-term debt structure, the
near-term outlook for its core business profitability remains poor, and
financial protection measures could well deteriorate further in 1993,' IBCA
concluded.

FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Reverting to old-fashioned
policies - The proposed flotation of Independent Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY has managed to float a UK general insurance company in more than 20
years, but the backers of Independent Insurance will try this spring.
The timing might seem surprising. After three years of record losses,
general insurers are not exactly flavour of the month among investors.
Many companies have been forced either to withdraw from or scale back their
involvement in the London insurance market, from which the Independent draws
about 30 per cent of its income. One reason is that they have been unable to
raise capital to support their businesses.
Yet in the six years since it was bought by the New Scotland Group from
Allstate, the US insurance group, the 88-year-old Independent has won
something of a reputation for bucking industry trends.
At a time when some illustrious rivals have recorded their worst losses,
Independent has consistently made profits.
Growth has been financed partly from internal resources, while shareholders
have also been tapped. It raised Pounds 10m, for example, in a rights issue
earlier this month.
Premiums have grown by more than 400 per cent since 1987, reaching an
estimated Pounds 130m in 1992. New Scotland Group, formed by a group of
Scottish businessmen with the backing of institutional investors, such as
3i, County NatWest and Foreign &amp; Colonial, has seen the value of its
original investment of Pounds 15m nearly double.
Four senior managers - Mr Michael Bright, Mr Robert McCracken, Mr Philip
Condon and Mr Alan Clarke - all recruited by New Scotland's founders, as
well as 170 staff, who together own 8 per cent of the company, have seen the
value of their shares rise.
Since 1991, Independent has been listed on the stock exchange under 535
rules, where trading is conducted on a matched bargain basis. It is now
making the move to a full listing, making its shares more marketable and
easing its access to fresh capital.
Life assurance, brokers, subsidiaries of foreign companies and the household
appliance insurer, Domestic &amp; General, have all obtained listings in recent
years, but Independent will be the first general insurer to float for as
long as most analysts and brokers can remember.
Detractors attribute the company's success to a policy of under-reserving
against claims that might emerge in the future. It is a charge that Mr
Bright, the company's managing director, vigorously denies.
He says that the reserves are low compared with the industry, but this
reflects Independent's superior underwriting.
Mr McCracken, general manager, says Independent pays claims more speedily
than its competitors. 'Our reserves have been more than adequate. You may be
able to get away with it for a year or two but it would be impossible to do
this for more than six years.'
Instead, Mr McCracken and Mr Bright insist that the reasons for the
company's success are relatively simple. On the one hand, it has taken a
fresh look at traditional management structures and technology. On the
other, it has rigorously adhered to conservative underwriting disciplines
and tightly controlled distribution,
Compared with its bigger and slower moving rivals, Independent has been
quick to introduce a less bureaucratic management structure. Pay has been
closely linked to performance and it has done without at least two layers of
middle management, providing for quicker communication and more efficiency.
Expenses have stayed relatively high. Operating costs reached 43.2 per cent
of net premium income in 1990, above the industry average. That figure
included heavy expenditure on new technology and has fallen to 37 per cent
in the first nine months of 1992.
Mr McCracken acknowledges that because of its approach to staff and
training, the company will inevitably have relatively high expenses. But he
says the effect has been offset by a more disciplined approach to
underwriting and much better underwriting figures.
Independent has eschewed the rush for market share, which was highly
fashionable among UK insurance companies as they adjusted to the more
competitive markets of the late-1980s.
Instead it has been selective about the risks it underwrites, concentrating
its business with a small group of brokers and spending more of its
resources on examining and surveying the risks it underwrites. 'Market share
is irrelevant.
While many other insurers have dispensed with surveyors and other expensive
technical staff, the Independent employs 50 surveyors and insists on
carrying out its own detailed surveys of the factories and offices which it
insures.
'We survey every single commercial risk before it goes on the books,' says
Mr McCracken. 'It's an old-fashioned discipline. Thirty years ago no UK
company would have dreamed of doing things any differently.'

FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: James Crean buys balance of
Valley Fresh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES CREAN has spent Dollars 5.5m, or Pounds 3.61m, to acquire the 50 per
cent of Valley Fresh Foods, of Turlock, California, that it did not already
own and over which it had an option.
The Dublin-based food, household goods and industrial equipment wholesaler
bought its original 50 per cent holding in Valley Fresh in 1990.
Crean said that the performance of the US processor and distributor of
branded chicken products had been 'very satisfactory' and that as a result
it had decided to exercise its option to buy the balance.
In the 1991 year Crean lifted turnover to IPounds 208.7m (IPounds 179.7m),
though pre-tax profits declined by more than IPounds 1m to IPounds 18.5m, or
Pounds 16.9m.
However, it said at the time of the results that the comparisons were skewed
by the investments in Valley Fresh and Egidius Janssen in the Netherlands in
1990 and by the consolidation of Valley Fresh's results into the 1991
accounts.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Gold stocks lose their lustre: Central banks are cutting
bullion holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold mining companies are casting a nervous eye at the world's central
banks. They are beginning to realise that the huge stocks of gold in the
banks' vaults, which they hoped were permanently locked away for protection
against some unimaginable disaster, are for sale after all.
The industry's fears intensified last week when the Dutch central bank
revealed it had sold a quarter of the gold in its reserves - 400 tonnes,
equivalent to more than 20 per cent of all the gold mined last year.
The world's central banks hold 35,000 tonnes of gold - a mountain that
dwarfs annual production of about 1,750 tonnes. It represents a substantial
potential new source of supply which threatens to depress gold prices
further, even though they are already near their lowest levels for seven
years.
The Dutch bank sold its gold towards the end of 1992. It was following the
example of Belgium's central bank which sold 202 tonnes earlier in the year.
Canada's central bank has been steadily reducing its gold stocks for 10
years, selling about 10 tonnes a month. Between them, these three banks
contributed more to total world gold supply in 1992 than output from South
Africa, the biggest producer.
'The gold market has been transformed,' says Mr Andy Smith, precious metals
specialist at the Union Bank of Switzerland. 'For 150 years central banks
built up a big buffer stock of gold which kept the price artificially high.'
But in recent years forces for change have emerged. Most important, gold
finally lost its formal role in the international monetary system when the
US authorities stopped exchanging it for dollars during the 1970s.
Central banks rarely change their policies quickly. But growing pressures on
the banks from their governments to earn a return on their reserves have
increased their willingness to reduce gold stocks which are earning no
interest.
Pressure to reduce bullion holdings has also increased because of the poor
investment gold has represented. Mr Ricky Hall, assistant general manager of
the Bank of International Settlements, the central bankers' bank, says that,
even at a modest compound interest rate of 6 per cent, gold bought 10 years
ago at Dollars 459.25 an ounce would be worth Dollars 823 an ounce instead
of today's Dollars 330.
Mr Smith, from UBS, estimates that if the reserves of the eight largest
holders, which together account for more than 85 per cent of officially
declared central bank gold, were invested instead in bonds at current
international interest rates, they would yield about Dollars 20bn a year.
Switzerland's reserves would yield more than Dollars 550 for each citizen
every year.
With this in mind, some central banks have started to 'mobilise' their gold
by lending some to the market. Up to 800 tonnes of central bank gold is on
loan to commercial banks and producers at any one time.
Producers have been keen to borrow this gold because with interest rates
typically only 0.5 per cent it costs much less than borrowing money, while
the banks are willing to lend when they are sure producers will be able to
repay from future mine output.
Recently, central banks began offering 'call' options on gold. As these give
the option holder the right to buy at a future date at a pre-determined
price they indicated the central banks' increasing willingness to sell
rather than merely lend.
Another indication of such willingness has been the use of metal from
official reserves to produce gold coins. Belgium, for example, began issuing
gold Ecu coins in 1987.
The first big outright sales of central banks' gold started last year. Until
then, their total holdings had remained fairly constant.
Mr Stewart Murray, chief executive of the Gold Fields Minerals Services
consultancy organisation, says there had been little change in the 1980s.
But he adds that 'the proportion of gold within total reserves has declined
because of the explosion in foreign exchange holdings and a weaker gold
price.'
European central banks, which own about 40 per cent of the world's official
gold reserves, have a special reason to reduce their gold stocks. Mr Smith
points out that moves towards a single European currency would reduce the
principal need for reserves - intervention in currency markets.
As a result, many bullion market analysts have been predicting that some
European central banks will seek to reduce their gold holdings before the
implementation of legislation for a new European central bank which may
require each EC member to deposit a proportion of its reserves with the
institution.
Such thinking seems to have been in the minds of the Belgian and Dutch
central banks.
Mr Smith points out that the sales did little to increase government income.
Only a very small proportion of the proceeds is transferable to ministries
of finance - and in both cases this represented less than 2 per cent of the
country's budget deficit.
The Dutch central bank said this week it had acted after 'several months of
deliberation' so, says Mr Smith, 'this was not a panic sale. It was
premeditated. It was strategic, not tactical.'
Mr Smith believes central banks may become net sellers of about 700 tonnes
of gold a year in the 1990s. He says: 'Selling gold will be just part of a
day's work for a central bank, not an admission that the financial world, as
investors know it, is about to end.' Investors in the gold market are
unlikely to feel reassured.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Taurus delay prolongs stamp duty on shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in UK shares face extra stamp duty costs of some Pounds 600m as a
result of another delay to Taurus, the paperless settlement system.
Brokers, registrars and others will today receive a letter from the London
Stock Exchange setting a new target date for the launch of the system
sometime in spring 1994 - at least six months later than the previous
September launch date.
The abolition of the stamp duty tax on share transactions, promised by Mr
John Major, then chancellor of the exchequer, in his Budget speech of 1990,
was tied to the launch of Taurus, partly because it would be-come difficult
to levy the duty under this new settlement system.
The latest delay is to allow more time for testing the system. With some 280
financial institutions planning to link into the Taurus network, the complex
testing process is not expected to be completed before the end of this year,
according to the Stock Exchange's letter.
The longer testing period was urged on the exchange by financial
institutions, which were concerned that not enough time was being allowed to
try out the most complex part of the system.
This element, which deals with rights issues, takeovers and other events
that affect shareholders' benefits, is not due to start full testing until
the summer.
The launch of Taurus will not follow until several months after testing is
finished, to allow for a full dress rehearsal - expected to take two months
 -and the need for final approval from the Treasury, as well as the
completion of audits of all the Taurus participants.
The development of Taurus is due to enter an important stage this week, as
the exchange's central settlement system is subjected to live testing for
the first time.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Potential buyer found for stake in Johnson Matthey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARTER CONSOLIDATED, the industrial holding company in which Minorco, the
investment vehicle of Anglo-American, holds 36 per cent, is in talks to sell
its Pounds 364m stake in Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group.
The 38.4 per cent stake is to be split, with one buyer acquiring just under
30 per cent of the share capital in order to avoid triggering a full bid for
the company. Charter owns 70,923,400 ordinary shares, which closed at 513p
on Friday.
Charter has been seeking a buyer for the stake for at least two years. It is
also in talks about disposing of the remaining stake of at least 8.5 per
cent.
The identity of the potential buyer of most of the shares has not been
disclosed but is believed to be a company in the same industry. 'Johnson
Matthey's key concern is that the purchaser bring something of commercial
value to the company,' said an official at Baring Brothers, adviser to
Johnson Matthey. 'It is most unlikely that the purchaser would be interested
in making a full bid for Johnson Matthey.'
Mr Jeffrey Herbert, Charter chief executive, noted that in spite of the size
of the stake, Charter is unable to control Johnson Matthey directly.
Industry analysts speculate that Charter will use proceeds from the sale of
its Johnson Matthey stake to buy out Minorco's holding in itself.
'At present it is not possible to say whether or not the current
negotiations will be successful,' Mr Herbert said. 'Nevertheless it is in
the interests of both Charter and Johnson Matthey to resolve the issue as
quickly as possible.'
Mr Gordon Thorburn, Johnson Matthey executive director of administration,
said the company had been kept fully informed of the plans, which would be
'very satisfactory' if the deal went through as discussed. One strong
shareholder would be exchanged for another, he said.
Johnson Matthey, which employs 6,000 people in 25 countries, is the world's
leading producer of platinum-based car anti-pollution catalysts. Last month
it announced a 3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 33.2m and
raised its interim dividend from 3p to 3.2p. It contributed Pounds 12.7m to
Charter Consolidated's first-half profits, up from Pounds 12.5m.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Economics Notebook: Time to appraise the role of the Group
of Seven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely has the world economy faced so many difficulties and rarely have
international policymakers appeared so incapable of dealing with them.
Inadequate growth, rising unemployment, the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks and the integration of the former Communist states into
the mainstream global economy pose challenges for governments in nearly all
industrialised countries. Businesses everywhere talk of globalisation and
interdependence. And yet nations have problems working together for a more
prosperous world.
The Group of Seven - the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy and
Canada - has become a forum for squabbles. It presents a sorry picture to Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, the incoming US Treasury Secretary, and Mr Lawrence Summers,
who is expected to become the senior US Treasury official responsible for
international affairs. Mr Bentsen indicated last week that he wanted to
revive the group. He could have a big task on his hands.
By last year, when it had become clear that the 1990s would be no easy
decade, there were hopes that adversity would foster solidarity among the G7
members. But whether on big issues, such as the Gatt trade talks, or
relatively small but important matters, such as a Dollars 700m (Pounds
460.5m) fund to make safe Soviet-built nuclear power stations, the G7 record
has been one of issuing fine sounding statements followed by no result, or
worse, a deterioration of relations inside the group.
It is as well the G7 is not obliged to issue an annual report on its
activities.
A year ago, finance ministers in Garden City, Long Island, pledged to
strengthen world economic growth. But no initiatives followed. Indeed, all
countries stuck to their existing policies.
In April, Russia topped the finance ministers' agenda, partly because the G7
could not agree how to foster growth. Perhaps nobody can have a coherent
answer to Russia's problems. But the G7's response of help for self-help has
been niggardly compared with the support provided by Germany for the former
east Germany.
Well before July's Munich world economic summit, it was clear it would
decide second-best solutions to the problems of sluggish global activity,
the Gatt talks and support for former Soviet republics and eastern Europe.
One aim of the summit had been to boost consumer and business optimism. A
week after the G7 leaders returned home, the Bundesbank raised its discount
rate, dealing a blow to confidence and helping to set in train last autumn's
crisis in the European Monetary System.
Munich showed how far the G7 member states had turned inwards. The US
administration was focusing on November's election. Economic slowdown and
political disarray were diverting Japan's attention. The EC countries'
preoccupation with the Maastricht Treaty had intensified after the Danish
referendum in June.
Indeed, the EC's problems and the EMS crisis overshadowed the September
meeting of G7 finance ministers which was held three days after sterling's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism and on the eve of the
French referendum on Maastricht.
Admittedly 1992 was an exceptionally grim year. But the G7 had been losing
muscle since the mid-1980s when the group achieved some success in
stabilising currencies.
Its efforts to control the dollar were successful largely because the member
nations' economic policy priorities coincided and worked with the grain of
the market.
The group has rarely proved capable of co-ordinating policies where
contentious domestic political issues are involved. The G7 has to assume
that the US Congress or the Bundesbank council will not listen to its
exhortations. Repeated declarations on the need for a speedy conclusion of
the Gatt trade talks have failed to bring the trade negotiators to
agreement.
A specific weakness sapping the G7's strength is the imbalance arising from
the increased strategic and political clout of the US relative to its
economic power. The US is now the world's one undisputed superpower. But its
share of world output has slipped to about a quarter from a half since the
second world war. A decade of deficit spending under presidents Reagan and
Bush has created constraints on economic policymaking.
The US aspires to lead in the G7. But its economic weakness results in its
policymakers usually producing ideas that require others to pay the bill.
The result has been acrimonious disputes over burden sharing between Germany
and the US in particular.
It may be, as Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the Bonn finance ministry,
suggested last week, that the vast changes in the world since 1989 have
simply overstretched policymakers, in that they are having to adapt to too
many problems in too short a time.
Another problem is that policymakers tend to be on different wavelengths.
They rarely work from internationally agreed common data and it takes time
to reach a common analysis.
A number of changes could improve the G7. One suggestion is to involve trade
ministers in G7 talks in the same way as finance ministers.
But perhaps the time has come for a more thoroughgoing appraisal of the G7.
Is it simply a fair weather system: something that countries can afford when
the going is easy, but are quick to dump when conditions get tougher at
home? How far can the group influence the global economy when it lacks links
with China and has only the loosest of ties to developing countries? Does it
make sense to include four members of the EC in the G7?
The jury is out on the G7. But fears that international economic and
political relations could begin to resemble those of the 1930s are reason
enough to hope that the international community can make more success of
co-operation. Otherwise, as Mr David Hale, chief economist for the
Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services, says: 'The world could drift
towards a cold peace more akin to the troubled years that followed the
Treaty of Versailles rather than the prosperity which followed Bretton
Woods.'

FT  18 JAN 93 / Reichmanns to focus on property management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Reichmann family is turning its energies to building a new property
leasing and management company out of the ashes of Olympia &amp; York
Developments, the developer which filed for bankruptcy protection last May.
Under O&amp;Y's debt-restructuring proposals, the property management business
will be rolled into a new company, Olympia &amp; York Properties (OYP). The
creation of OYP depends on creditors' approval of the plan, which covers
about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 6.8bn) debt.
The Reichmanns are concentrating on retaining management contracts for
buildings likely to be seized by creditors in the course of the
restructuring.
Mr Philip Reichmann, nephew of O&amp;Y founder Mr Paul Reichmann, recently
persuaded creditors of First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's former Toronto flagship,
to re-engage O&amp;Y as the building's operator, in spite of bids from other
managers.
About a dozen of O&amp;Y's 33 creditor groups have approved the restructuring
proposals while four have rejected it. The remaining meetings, including a
vote by unsecured creditors, are to take place over the next 10 days.
The Reichmanns face an uphill struggle to regain management of some of O&amp;Y's
most prestigious projects, including London's Canary Wharf.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Nissan UK's claim on franchise loss rejected: Arbitrators'
decision severe blow to Botnar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN UK, the former British importer and distributor of Nissan vehicles,
controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, has lost its claim for damages totalling
several hundred million pounds against Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker.
International arbitrators have ruled that Nissan Motor was justified in
terminating NUK's lucrative distribution franchise at the end of 1990 and
have dismissed NUK's claim for compensation.
The arbitration ruling is a heavy setback for Mr Botnar, the 79-year-old
chairman of both Nissan UK Holdings and Automotive Financial Group Holdings,
its associated company, which is one of the largest retail motor groups in
Britain.
An NUK spokesman said last night: 'Our reaction is one of disbelief that the
efforts of a major company like Nissan UK, that built up the franchise with
great success to the benefit of Nissan over 20 years, could be plundered and
the company destroyed without a penny in compensation.'
The arbitration was carried out under the rules of the Japan Commercial
Arbitration Association as stipulated by the 1971 distribution agreement
between NUK and Nissan Motor. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal in
London ruled that the case should be handled by the JCAA despite NUK
objections.
A warrant, issued by the Inland Revenue at the end of January last year, is
still outstanding for the arrest of Mr Botnar, who has controlled one of the
most profitable privately-owned business groups in the UK with profits of
Pounds 130m in the year to July 1991.
Mr Botnar was abroad when the warrant was issued and now lives in
Switzerland.
The trial is due to begin shortly in London of two of Mr Botnar's main
business associates, Mr Michael Hunt and Mr Frank Shannon, who were arrested
a year ago at the same time that the warrant was issued for Mr Botnar's
arrest.
Mr Hunt, deputy chairman and assistant managing director of NUK, and Mr
Shannon, a former NUK finance director, are charged with corporation tax
fraud related to the manipulation of NUK profits.
The unanimous ruling against NUK by the three international arbitrators  -
two from the US and one from Japan - ends one part of the complex,
long-running legal battle between Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest
carmaker, and NUK, its importer/distributor since the beginning of the
1970s.
NUK had built the Nissan franchise into one of the most lucrative automotive
businesses in Britain, accounting consistently for around 6 per cent of the
UK new car market from the mid-1970s to the end of the 1980s.
Nissan Motor said the three international arbitrators had ruled that NUK had
'violated' its distribution agreement with Nissan.
The main violation concerned NUK's transfer of shares in its car retailing
subsidiaries to the associated company, Automotive Financial Group Holdings,
without Nissan Motor's consent, and the subsequent transfer, also without
consent, of a 71 per cent stake in AFGH to the Luxembourg subsidiary of
Union Bank of Switzerland.
The NUK spokesman said last night that the UBS transaction was 'a complete
red herring' which Nissan Motor had known about 'from day one'.
The arbitrators ruled that the breakdown of business relations between the
Japanese carmaker and its former UK importer also justified termination of
NUK's franchise agreement.
'The behaviour of NUK with respect to its relations with Nissan Motor
Company, taken as a whole, constituted a compelling reason for the
agreement's termination and an alternative justification for termination,'
said the arbitrators.
The dismissal means that Mr Botnar has lost without compensation the main
substance of Nissan UK Holdings.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Miyazawa sets out strategy for Japan in Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, has promised to promote
democracy, human rights and the environment as part of a new strategy for
Japan in Asia.
In a much-heralded speech in Bangkok at the weekend during a South-East
Asian tour, he also announced plans for an international forum to
co-ordinate the development of Indo-China.
He indicated, though, that Japan's approach in Asia would remain pragmatic
and be unlikely to offend governments of whatever political complexion.
Mr Miyazawa singled out four policies important for Japan and the region: a
dialogue on security; enhancing economic 'openness' and growth; the
promotion of democracy, human rights and environmentalism; and co-operation
on Indo-China.
'Economically, the region continues to enjoy dynamic growth,' he said. 'This
Asia-Pacific region may indeed be acquiring a great potential to contribute
politically and economically to the peace and prosperity of the world.'
The so-called 'Miyazawa doctrine', in a speech entitled 'The new area of the
Asia-Pacific and Japan-Asean co-operation', is designed to solidify Japan's
relations with its Asian neighbours without antagonising the west, but it
contained few surprises for his south east Asian audience.
Referring obliquely to Japan's occupation of some Asian countries during the
second world war, Mr Miyazawa reassured his listeners that 'Japan shall
never again become a military power' and reiterated Japanese support for the
continuing US military presence as a stabilising force in the Pacific.
Noting that trade between Japan and the six-member Association of South East
Asian Nations had been expanding at 20 per cent a year, Mr Miyazawa appealed
for free trade, although he made no mention of Japan's reluctance to open
its rice market to Asian and American exporters.
For Asian governments sceptical about the benefits of democracy and
environmentalism, the most remarkable part of Mr Miyazawa's speech was his
call for environmental conservation and his assertion that 'to promote
democratisation and advance fundamental human rights is a universal task for
humankind'.
He added, however, that Japan would take 'the approach it deems to be most
pragmatic and effective in the light of each circumstance', and at a news
conference afterwards said hasty, hardline action against the military junta
in Burma would be 'counter-productive'.

FT  18 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to read the political signals coming from the meeting of
Volkswagen's supervisory board last week. Advance leaks suggested that
substantial cuts in the expensive German workforce were on the way,
particularly at the main Wolfsburg plant. Yet there was only a modest
reduction in VW's capital investment plans and a vague commitment to job
cuts worldwide. The most plausible interpretation is that the hard-headed
new chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, ran into opposition from the unions and
Lower Saxony government, both strongly represented on the board.
The company still intends to invest an average of DM9bn a year in the main
vehicles business for the next five years, while in 1993 and 1994 VW's cash
inflow is unlikely to exceed DM6bn. Even VW's balance sheet will look less
solid after such capital spending. And while work on the new Mosel plant is
being slowed, that must be set against a possible contraction in the German
car market of 20 per cent this year. Nor will job cuts in cheaper
manufacturing locations offset the high price of German production.
While the shares bounced after the meeting, Mr Piech's leadership will
eventually be judged by his ability to cut Wolfsburg's costs, freeing up the
cash flow needed for the ambitious international expansion plans. His
determination is not in doubt. The will of his opponents has yet to be
tested.

FT  18 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Prudential
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was rightly impressed by full-year new business figures from
Prudential. Even allowing for weak sales in 1991 while the sales force was
being reorganised, maintaining regular premium business and increasing sales
of single premium policies by one third must be counted a success. The Pru
would doubtless prefer to sell more regular premium policies, which yield a
higher margin and regular cash flow. But the reluctance of savers to make
long-term commitments is a fact of recession. More important, the Pru seems
to be holding its own against competition from bank assurance.
Sales figures from the likes of Lloyds Abbey Life and TSB last week
suggested that selling life assurance to bank customers is no less
vulnerable to recession. Lloyds Abbey's sales of regular premium business to
Lloyds Bank customers were up 7 per cent. That marks a notable slowing in
the rate of sales growth. TSB must be disappointed with a small decline in
sales, even allowing for the fact that its business is more mature. With
NatWest starting to peddle life assurance and TSB promising a sharper focus,
though, Prudential might expect stiffer competition. It remains an open
question whether new products - such as the successful Prudence Bond - and
better management will be enough to meet the challenge.
Even so, the immediate outlook for earnings is encouraging. Having tackled
the problems in overseas markets and general reinsurance last year, the
performance of the Pru's core UK business was almost the last remaining
reason for doubt. If lower interest rates and economic recovery encourage
savers to be more adventurous, Prudential looks well placed to benefit.

FT  18 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Government bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even allowing for sterling's ignominious exit from the European exchange
rate mechanism, a strong performance from French and German bonds this year
might still help support the gilts market. The fundamentals are encouraging
enough. Lower German interest rates are eagerly awaited in Paris. Even the
hawkish Bundesbank is close to admitting inflation is no longer the main
threat as the growth outlook has worsened. The worry is that European bond
markets have barely faced up to the scale of future government borrowing.
The German government's plan to issue short-term paper for the first time
might take some of the strain from longer-dated bunds. Having seen 10-year
yields fall by 1 percentage point since autumn, though, further gains will
be hard won. France offers better prospects. If the franc escapes
devaluation, the yield differential over Germany might be expected to
narrow. But France faces a borrowing requirement of similar proportions to
the UK this year. Even allowing for its enviable inflation record, that will
still affect long-term interest rates.
European yields may thus not fall far enough to make gilts look cheap. Since
10-year gilts currently yield barely 1.5 percentage points more than bunds
and 0.5 percentage points more than French bonds, they might quickly look
expensive if inflation is seen to be creeping back alongside recovery. With
so many European governments competing for funds, investors can afford to be
choosy.

FT  18 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson's hard choices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The issue of Dollars 1.25bn-worth of medium-term debt in the US domestic
market clearly shows that Hanson is still keen to borrow from a wide variety
of sources. It also helps cement into the company's balance sheet a
long-term structure with substantial dollar borrowings and even larger
sterling deposits. Running the company this way offers Hanson a number of
advantages. With US interest rates below those in the UK, sterling income
far outweighs the dollar debt costs. Holding sterling deposits outside the
UK also helps defer tax liabilities. But there are also risks, not least
that with the US arm more heavily borrowed than the UK, Hanson's overall
gearing will rise as the dollar appreciates against sterling.
Yet the reasons for the financial structure may go beyond short-term
financial gains. One way of looking at Hanson is to view the US business as
a group of highly-geared companies which is sweated hard to service debt.
Indeed, interest payments eat up about 30 per cent of US profits. By
contrast, the sterling cash pile comes in large part from the disposal of
assets and is available to finance acquisitions. Keeping the money on
deposit may have made sense through the recession, but as short-term
interest rates fall and recovery nears, real assets may offer better
returns.
Hefty write-offs in the past, however, may have left the company with
something of a problem. A cash acquisition accompanied by provisions or a
goodwill write-off would raise gearing sharply. So Hanson must either avoid
paying over book, or find more targets such as Beazer, Cavenham and Peabody
whose balance sheets are too modest about their assets.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Contract trouble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACTING-OUT of services in the UK, an important part of the reform of
Whitehall, appears to be threatened by the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981. These TUPE regulations
implement the EC Acquired Rights Directive, which guarantees the employment
rights of workers in mergers and acquisitions.
Judgments in the European Court of Justice have extended the scope of the
directive to contracting-out of public services. Where an undertaking is
deemed to have been transferred in such cases, the TUPE regulations apply.
The contractor is thus obliged to take over existing staff and to maintain
for a period their pay and conditions. In some cases, this is proving a
barrier to the rapid improvement in efficiency of contracted-out services.
Even where the TUPE rules turn out not to be a problem for the new
contractor, they cause damaging confusion at the bidding stage, since it is
often unclear whether a contract will count as a transfer of an undertaking
until after the contract is signed. A contractor who assumes TUPE does not
apply could end up with a loss-making contract if it does. If the bid is
framed expecting TUPE to apply, it will almost certainly be underbid by a
contractor who assumes it will not. This uncertainty could undermine the
government's programme for market-testing civil service work, to be
explained to a business audience at a conference in London today.
Ministers' response to the problem has been to ask the EC for a derogation
from the directive under the procedures decided at the Edinburgh summit for
enhancing subsidiarity. This is a sensible move but one without a strong
chance of success, given the age of the directive and Britain's isolation on
matters of social policy.
In the shorter term, the government's options are not attractive. It could
accept, implicitly, that TUPE does apply to public-sector contracting-out,
which would remove the confusion, but tend to entrench costs. Or it could
tell contractors that where a contract is unexpectedly judged to be subject
to TUPE, government will carry the costs.

Meeting up with an architect and a politician, a doctor claimed his
profession was older than theirs, saying: 'God performed a surgical
operation when he removed Adam's rib to create Eve.'
'You're wrong,' the architect objected. 'At least a week earlier, he'd acted
like any good architect in producing order out of chaos.'
'And who made the chaos?', the politician replied.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is Sir David Frost monopolising the cream of Britain's political talent
for his new Sunday morning TV show? First the prime minister, then the
leader of the opposition, and now the chancellor of the exchequer. One by
one they have made themselves available to be interviewed by the newly
knighted Frostie, before most people are awake
Norman Lamont escaped from yesterday's near 45-minute encounter without so
much as a graze. He had no problem ducking tricky issues such as whether he
should be taxed on the help he got paying his legal bills, or the
circumstances under which he would resign.
At least Frost didn't feed the bird-watching chancellor soft questions about
the Braer disaster. But then again, there was a marked lack of grilling
about unemployment, which will soon top the 3m mark.
Perhaps Britain's politicians have learnt something from the recent US
presidential election campaign where candidates made a point of avoiding the
tough TV interviewers, preferring to submit themselves to the persiflage of
chat-show hosts.
That being so, it would be sad if seasoned TV-types such as Jeremy Paxman,
Brian Walden and Jonathan Dimbleby were henceforth relegated to interviewing
political has-beens.

Eyebrows will surely be raised by Lord Hanson's giving one of his top
executives 20 months off to help Board of Trade president Michael Heseltine
to interfere in British industry, under the guise of a secondment to the
mechanical engineering 'sponsorship division'.
After all, Hanson was one of the fiercest critics of Hezza for precipitating
the downfall of the noble lord's heroine, Lady Thatcher, and has always been
regarded as on the laissez-faire wing of big business. The less government
interference the better, would seem to be his motto.
Is Britain's best-known predator turning a little pink? Or could it be that
the long-serving Ian Stewart, now 53, has been at a loose end since the
particular company he headed, British Ever Ready, was sold to a US pet food
firm last April?
It's hard to imagine Hanson operatives such as Tony Alexander or Tony Cotton
being given such a long leave of absence.

It is hard to believe that the poor old NatWest bosses involved in the Blue
Arrow affair were the only bankers who had trouble understanding what a bank
supervisor is saying, let alone thinking.
Fortunately, help is at hand. The Old Lady, the house magazine of the Bank
of England, has a few tips on how to get the most out of a conversation with
a bank supervisor. Rule number one: a banking supervisor never says yes.
Rather, he 'has no objection' to a particular suggestion - or,
alternatively, he 'takes comfort' from what is proposed.
It is also important to realise that a banking supervisor never says no. He
simply confines himself to expressing the fact that he is uncomfortable.

If any US newspaper might be expected to welcome a Democrat to the White
House, it is surely the principled and liberal New York Times. Not so,
however, if the editorials of America's most respected daily are a guide.
In rapid succession they have condemned the Clintons for sending their
daughter to a private school in Washington, virtually called on Ron Brown to
withdraw as commerce secretary because of his lobbying business, and said
nearly the same about designated attorney general Zoe Baird for having
employed illegal immigrants as housekeepers.
Yet a better summary of the paper's attitude to the incoming president may
be provided by two other strictures. One is that he should set about soaking
the rich and seeking ever bigger cuts in defence. The other is that
reuniting Fleetwood Mac for his Inaugural shows appalling musical taste.
Could it be that The New York Times has finally woken up to the fact that
Clinton is not a liberal? After all, Jimmy Carter wasn't either, and
Fleetwood Mac were at their zenith when he held sway.
As if that weren't enough, the paper is now suggesting that the
president-elect has been giving chosen Vice-president Al Gore the cold
shoulder, not only squeezing him out of consultations about senior
appointments, but even initially forgetting to invite the Gores to last
month's glittering Washington dinner party.
Who knows, the next thing Clinton forgets may be to invite The New York
Times to the White House. If so, the presidential honeymoon will be well and
truly over.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Making the customer do the work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Middle-level officials in any organisation tend to treat their clients as a
nuisance to be kept at bay. This is as true of private enterprise as of
government organisations. The short-term costs of exit from a long-standing
relationship with, for instance, a bank or building society are high; and
customers will put up with a lot of contemptuous treatment rather than make
the wrench.
The advent of the computer has made matters worse. Instead of this invention
being used to make life easier for customers, it has been used to pile extra
burdens on them. One of the worst examples is in standardised letters in
relation to annual renewals, which make the client look up information which
could much more conveniently be found by the organisation concerned. Too
many renewal forms say something like: 'If you have a standing order, do
nothing. If you pay by cheque, do X. Ignore this letter if you have already
paid.'
In other words the sender of the demand cannot even be bothered to scan his
records - which a computer could readily do - to ascertain the client's
status and whether he has paid. All the checking has to be done at the
receiving end.
This is breathtakingly unfair. Most of us do not have homes equipped as
offices. A cheque may have come out of various books kept in different
places; and we do not always have comprehensive lists of standing orders to
hand. If we ask our bank for such a list, it would take time and may carry a
substantial fee. Above all such research increases the amount of time
required for activities which are neither leisure nor work but that most
tedious of tasks - personal administration.
My most outrageous experience occurred after a five-day Christmas holiday in
Rome. On return I found a computerised letter from my bank stating that it
had not received payment on my credit card 'for over a month' thus 'leaving
the account in arrears to the extent of Pounds 12'. It went on to say that
it was 'not normally possible for a transaction to be authorised when an
account is out of order', and warning of the resulting embarrassments.
I was not aware of the outstanding sum, but of course a communication could
have been mislaid in the Christmas post. Despite the demand for instant
satisfaction and despite the likelihood of holiday delays, the letter had
been sent by second-class post. As I normally carry only one bank credit
card in addition to the more satisfactory American Express card, I
telephoned straight away, but received no reply after I had hung on for a
very long time - a possibility that compilers of computer letters never take
into account. Nevertheless I sent the required payment immediately and first
class, with an accompanying letter.
The deviser of the system did not have the courtesy or intelligence to allow
for time taken by his own organisation to process communications. Imagine my
indignation when a week later I received a second and more sinister computer
letter serving me with a default notice.
Small businessmen dependent on banks for finance have presumably far more
about which to complain.  Indeed I have been told that banks are very
careful before taking on disgruntled customers from their so-called
competitors.
British banks are behaving with all the ruthlessness that comes of weakness.
 Because their own profitability has been so undermined, they are taking it
out on their smaller customers.  Experienced observers tell me that the way
to get genuine competition at the lower end of the banking system would be
to unleash the building societies, who are still heavily restricted in most
of their lending to houses and property.
Unfortunately the Bank of England is so deperately concerned with rebuilding
bank profits that it is basically on the banks' side. But I will resist the
temptation to say everything is the fault of official policy.  It is up to
the victims of banks and other private or public bureaucratic oligopolies to
band together to fight back.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Social justice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party's Commission on Social Justice meets for the first time
today, to begin its ambitious work of devising policies for a fairer and
more just society. The commission has been compared to the Beveridge
Committee whose ground-breaking report 50 years ago provided a blueprint for
the postwar welfare state. Similarly, radical thinking is needed in the
1990s, with increasing numbers dependent on social security benefits and
equality of opportunity a sham for many.
The commission's chairman, Sir Gordon Borrie, has a remit to explore much
more than taxation and social security. But resolving Labour's difficulties
over tax and benefits is the most important task facing the commission.
At the last election, the centrepiece of Labour's programme was a commitment
to raise the state pension by Pounds 5 a week and child benefit to Pounds
9.95 a week. Welcome though these increases would have been to the least
well-off, they hardly represented the promised land. Yet because they had to
be paid to all pensioners and families, the cost was Pounds 3.5bn - needing
tax increases the electorate was not prepared to endorse. The lesson is that
benefits paid to everyone are ineffective in tackling poverty. They cannot
be high enough to meet real need without unacceptable taxation levels.
Universal benefits are also inefficient - too much money goes to those who
have no need of it. Fifty years ago, paying benefits to all pensioners and
families was a good way of targeting poverty. Today, it is no longer a
struggle for most parents to feed and clothe their children. And while many
pensioners depend on benefits, others have substantial income from
occupational pensions. Money going to affluent families and woopies
(well-off old people) could be better spent on those who struggle to make
ends meet.
Sir Gordon's commission must convince Labour that providing sufficient help
for those with the greatest need cannot be done with universal benefits.
Instead, means-testing must be used to target resources on pensioners with
inadequate occupational pensions, one-parent families and families with
low-paid bread-winners. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, appeared to
pre-empt such a conclusion at the launch of the commission by his support
for retaining the state pension and child benefit on a universal basis. Sir
Gordon should not be inhibited by this declaration, but instead should see
it as an indicator of the challenge his commission faces in changing
Labour's thinking.
One important step in winning acceptance for greater targeting will be to
address the justified fears of those who oppose more means-testing. In
particular, new ideas are needed to increase the take-up of means-tested
benefits - such as using computerised income tax records to target payments
to those in need.
Ways must also be found to preserve incentives to work and save, since the
withdrawal of benefits as income rises interacts with the tax system to
leave many individuals scarcely better-off than before. To ease this poverty
trap, the rate at which benefits are withdrawn as income rises needs to be
reduced. The present rules which penalise pensioners with capital must also
be changed if means-testing pensions is not to be a powerful disincentive to
save for retirement.
Breaking away from universal benefits is, of course, only part of the agenda
for social justice. The commission intends to investigate the underlying
factors behind poverty, including inequalities in health and education. And
it plans to probe the 'middle-class welfare state' which provides expensive
tax subsidies for those well-enough off to own a home. In all this, however,
the answer will be more means-testing, not less. Since the electorate is
unlikely to vote for higher taxes, more benefits for the have-nots must mean
less for the haves.
Unless scarce resources are targeted on real need, Labour's aim of creating
a more just society will remain illusory. The commission should think
radically and Mr Smith should listen hard.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Banks launch root and branch reform: UK banks are trimming
their high street presence and redesigning their remaining outlets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Geraldine Connolly has worked at the National Westminster Bank 'since we
sat on high stools under gas lamps and used quill pens'. But as each day
seems to bring news of branch closures, job losses and strikes in high
street banks, she wonders how much longer her employment will last.
Fortunately for Mrs Connolly, she happens to be sitting in one of the safest
seats in NatWest's 2,700 branches.
She is a cashier at NatWest's branch near Victoria Station in London. It is
an unusual bank. Posters of financial products are on display in the large
front windows; the manager has no office, but wanders around the large
open-plan service area; no screen protects Mrs Connolly. It looks more like
a shop than a traditional bank, where customers queue for services in a
narrow strip of space, peering through cashiers' screens at bank staff
sitting at desks processing paper. This is NatWest's vision of the future.
The bank is working towards two goals - to cut the number of branches and
change those that are left. In five years, there will be 55 such open-plan
branches in the West End of London - compared with 90 today, most of them
traditional. All processing will be carried out in two centres.
Other banks are making similar moves. Royal Bank of Scotland plans to cut
3,500 staff in five years through branch restructuring, and TSB is cutting
840 jobs in order to merge its banking and insurance operations. It has
upset staff so much that they staged a one-day strike this month, and
another is due this week.
By the end of the decade, many high streets will lack a stone-fronted bank
with a manager sitting imposingly behind a wooden desk. Instead, banks will
look like the shops around them. There will be fewer in suburbia. 'The high
street is still important, but some suburban outlets that used to be
valuable to us are less so now,' says Mr Bill Gordon, managing director of
Barclays' banking division.
The clearing banks acquired what Mr Gordon Pell, Lloyds Bank's Thames region
director, calls their 'bland, heavy' networks in three stages. First was the
formation of national clearing banks in the last century; then came the big
1960s mergers, such as the one between the Westminster and National
Provincial banks; finally came upgrading of sub-branches in the 1980s as
financial services proliferated.
The result was an array of branches in which money was stored, cheques
cashed, loans granted and paper shuffled. Staff were rotated around jobs to
teach them each task. The banks made money by taking deposits, and gaining
interest by lending it either on the financial markets or to businesses.
Their presence on every high street made them the natural place for families
to put funds.
But things have changed. The past decade has brought a number of financial,
social and technological developments which have been increasingly
disruptive:
Banks have faced growing competition for cash deposits from institutions
such as building societies. Many societies now offer a banking service.
Furthermore, societies have built market share with smaller, cheaper branch
networks. The Halifax, the largest, has just 750 branches and 20,000 staff.
Its ratio of costs to income is 43.5 per cent, compared with an average of
66.7 per cent for large British banks.
Technology is reducing the traditional British reliance on the cheque, and
shifting business towards electronic payment systems that do not require
branches. The number of cheques cleared fell last year after growing over
the past 25 years. The banks' Association for Payment Clearing Services
projects a big expansion in the use of teller machines to obtain cash, while
cheque encashment gradually falls.
As interest rates have declined since the UK's exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism, retail banking has become less profitable. The
banks calculate that base rates need to be at least 8 per cent to make
traditional branch banking worthwhile, but they fear a decade of lower
margins. Unless branches can be used to attract extra business, they are at
risk.
The banks are making lower profits because of badly judged corporate lending
in the 1980s. Combined with a fall in the number of financial transactions,
this has forced them to concentrate on lowering costs. Staff and premises,
which accounted for Pounds 12.6bn of the Pounds 16.6bn total operating costs
of large British banks last year, are obvious targets in the search for
quick cost-cutting measures.
Yet for all these difficulties, the banks have not so far chosen to abandon
branch networks. This is partly for negative reasons. It is hard to sell
old-fashioned branches, and the pace of staff cuts has to be slow enough not
to provoke the industrial action seen in TSB. There is also a fear among
banks that they risk their share of more profitable customers' accounts if
they leave suburban streets too rapidly.
Branch proximity is still the most popular reason for opening an account.
'It would be fine if you could get rid of a branch and keep customers, but
it's not that easy,' says Mr Rod Barrett, a bank analyst at Goldman Sachs.
Furthermore, knowledge of local customers helps managers to assess risk. An
analysis by Robert Fleming Securities found that the farther a business was
from a branch, the more likely it was to default on loans. 'Closing down
branches may be self-defeating, because the quality of business in your
remaining branches could worsen as a result,' says Mr Hugh Pye, a banking
analyst at Robert Fleming.
There are also positive reasons for keeping branches. Most banks believe
they can raise profits by operating their networks differently. By taking
the processing work out of branches, they can use the extra space to sell
products such as insurance policies. This the reasoning behind TSB's
insurance and banking merger, and NatWest's investment of Pounds 105m in a
new insurance subsidiary this month.
A lot of space can be freed by removing back-office work. The branches
traditionally allocated 80 per cent of space to staff, and 20 per cent to
customers. Data processing machines can now sort cheques more cheaply in
processing centres. Midland has gone furthest in adopting this strategy; all
processing is now done at eight district centres.
Most banks want to end up with 'clusters' of branches of different sizes
offering different services. Processing and business lending will be done in
a central branch, while the smaller branches offer retail services. In
Watford, nine Lloyds branches have been turned into one central branch
surrounded by five smaller ones. Businesses are served by managers by car
from Hemel Hempstead, six miles away.
But altering branches is expensive. Converting a branch which has a
traditional back office may cost about Pounds 250,000, and can run into
millions. Banks are faced with big bills at a time when capital is scarce.
To make such spending worthwhile, the new branches will have to produce
higher returns. Whether they do so depends on the reaction of customers.
There is already evidence that they may not respond well. In 1988, Midland
was a pioneer in dividing branches into different types to serve different
categories of customers. It is now reconsidering. 'The problem was that the
customers lost a focal point for Midland, and they got confused,' says Mr
Brian Pearse, chief executive.
Midland is now breaking some of the barriers it erected. It wants to ensure
that small business owners who visit a branch can also deal with personal
accounts. This sounds suspiciously like a traditional branch, as Mr Pearse
admits. But no bank thinks it will be enough just to do better what it has
always done. To justify the cost of retraining and refitting, more customers
have to use the branches.
Mr Peter Burt, Bank of Scotland's chief general manager, says this is a
stiff task because customers who travel a long way to visit a supermarket
will 'hardly cross the street' to enter a bank. 'To date, branches have been
profitable, but will they be an asset or a liability in 10 or 20 years'
time?' he muses. The bank branch may have been a staple of the British high
street for many years, but there is no guarantee it will last there forever.
