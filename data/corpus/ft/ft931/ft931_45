FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: BBC World Service - objective facts and no
sensationalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS E WHITTLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I endorse P H Ball's sentiments from the Netherlands (Letters,
January 8). By far the best radio programme is the BBC World Service -
listened to and respected by more people in the world than any other on
short wave.
The next best English language programme is surely long-wave Radio 4. It is
heard in many countries, from Norway through much of the EC to Ireland, a
catchment area of up to 300m people. I once heard the budget speech from the
Commons quite audibly at the Algarve, south coast of Portugal, on Radio 4
via a battery portable.
These two programmes must do much to present the UK point of view - a
valuable public service exercise on which to spend part of the licence fee
or household tax. Many of us (insomniacs, workers, drivers) listen to the
World Service through the night - the BBC could save (or spend) money
cost-effectively by broadcasting the World Service by day on an easily
received, all-UK frequency, instead of another news pro-gramme.
Let us have a broadcast source of objective facts, to match the FT in print,
rather than dramatised 'doom and gloom' sensationalism.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: An independent bank governor would avoid stop-go
policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LUIS GARICANO GABILONDO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Persaud argues re Bank of England independence that 'it is a
populist assertion that politicians cannot be trusted to stand above their
narrow political choices'. In so doing he forgets to apply to the problem of
the conduct of monetary policy the very same principles of rationality that
his economist training has taught him to use in other, 'non-political',
analysis of social behaviour.
The self interest of a government, call it narrow or not, is to win
elections. In order to do that, it must ensure that recovery comes at the
end of its mandate and recession (if there has to be one) at the start of
it. A central bank governor whose job depends on that outcome will do
everything to attain it, with the likely consequence of an inefficient
political business cycle. Conversely, a central bank governor named under a
statute that assures his independence and links his job and his salary to
the achievement of certain objectives democratically set by the parliament,
has every incentive to avoid such stop-go cycles and pursue his mandated
long-term objectives. This is neither populist nor insidious. Just rational.
Concerning the assertion that independence is no panacea it can only be said
that there is no such thing as a panacea in any sphere of life, least of all
central bank independence. But neither the failure of Sweden's Riksbank to
defend the Krona nor Margaret Thatcher's recession at the beginning of the
1980s, nor, least of all, Germany's current economic problems prove anything
at all in relation to the long-term objectives of monetary policy. As recent
research work has shown, over the last 40 years OECD countries with lower
inflation rates have, in all but one case (Japan), a de jure or de facto
independent central bank. This is the case in the US, Germany, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and Canada. On the other hand, countries with higher
inflation have suffered a record of government interference in the conduct
of monetary policy - as in Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, France and the
UK.
Last, there need be no problem of accountability provided the objectives of
central bank policy are democratically decided, that its governor and board
are democratically elected and that it has to present a yearly report to the
parliament in which its decisions are discussed and justified.

   From Dr GRAHAM HALLETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Persaud (Letters, January 7) dismisses the argument for central bank
independence as 'populist'. The question is whether the stability of the
currency is one of the 'framework' or 'constitutional' issues which should
be removed from the direct control of the executive, like the administration
of justice. Why not a comparable limitation of 'democratic accountability'
in fiscal policy? There are precedents for imposing constraints on
governments' ability to finance expenditure by borrowing or printing money.
The West German constitution originally contained a provision that the
federal government should not run a deficit on current, as against capital,
expenditure. It was - with hindsight probably unwisely - repealed in the
interests of 'Keynesianism'. There are admittedly difficulties of definition
involved, but many countries would have benefited from such a constraint on
'democratic accountability'.

Although it is being shown at an awfully inconvenient time, Germany Means
Business (BBC2, 5.00) is an absorbing programme about the nuts and bolts of
doing business in Germany. It is also guaranteed to make anyone who has
bothered to learn German ahead of the single European market, feel
deliciously smug.
Strange to relate, one still meets plenty of middle-of-the-road opera lovers
who still have not discovered Janacek. Heaven knows, there is a lot of him
about. Tonight there is another chance to discover his wonderfully tuneful,
endlessly inventive musical world - and at no cost to your pocket - with The
Adventures of Mr Broucek (Radio 3, 7.25), broadcast live from the Coliseum.
After 30 years of high quality investigative journalism, World in Action
(ITV, 10.40) gives itself a well-deserved pat on the back in a one-hour
special. Omnibus, old-timer among the arts programmes, has postponed its
scheduled re-showing of Ken Russell's celebration of Delius, 'A Song of
Summer' for a special tribute to Rudolf Nureyev who died last week. (BBC 1,
10.25).

FT  12 JAN 93 / Arts: London gets a diffused view of the Bolshoy - This
company needs full-length ballets to do justice to its talents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ludicrously hyped as 'the dance event of the century' - not even the
Bolshoy's stunning first visit to London in 1956 deserved those laurels  -
this appearance by Moscow's pride at the Albert Hall is an exercise both
welcome and exasperating. There is nothing especially notable about large
balletic spectacles. The Bolshoy has played in huge arenas before (though
not in Britain); Maurice Bejart took his troupe to vast sports stadia in
Berlin and Mexico, and even the tented Grand Place in Brussels. Under the
aegis of the Entertainment Corporation, the Bolshoy and the Kirov played
'popular' seasons - and very successfully so - in a tent in Battersea Park
and in halls in Dublin and in Islington. Ballet has also been well presented
at the Albert Hall: two decades ago we saw Festival Ballet with some Kirov
stars in fascinating performances.
What Derek Block, impresario of this present venture, has identified is a
public taste for the artistic gigantism that has lately produced arena opera
here, and which is seen in Moscow in the balletic spectacles at the Kremlin
Palace, and in Paris at the Palais des Congres and the Palais des Sports.
Since London can offer no stage suitable for the grandiose effects which are
part of the attraction of such shows - and it is worth recalling that the
Entertainment Corporation planned a theatre for just such events five years
ago - the Albert Hall has been converted for the occasion.
The result, as I saw it on Sunday night, is curious. The organ is hidden
behind a mock-up of the Imperial box at the Bolshoy Theatre, with a cluster
of surrounding loges to form a convex screen. The curtains of the box are
drawn back to suggest a distant false proscenium behind which pieces of
scenery can be placed and dancers can stand or make entries. The effect is
disorientating. Are we gazing at the box (if so, we are on stage at the
Bolshoy) or is the box back-stage for us to view as members of the public?
In front of this tease there projects a large apron stage which occupies
about half the promenade, while the orchestra takes up the remaining space.
Surrounding this on three sides is placed the audience.
The generous dance area, which will allow the Bolshoy style that freedom of
movement it knows at home, and the fine acoustic for the BBC Concert
Orchestra who are the musicians of the season, are a real advantage. But it
is one largely dissipated by two inescapable facts. Ballet is an art
designed for a proscenium arch. It is framed, shaped, focused by our view
through that magic opening. And choreography and dance interpretation are
orientated to the stage's confines, are created for a head-on view by an
audience and are conceived as having a central point of interest.
(Balanchine theorised about this, and identified problems attendant upon
peripheral dance activity).
In Sunday's performance, the choreography - spread over the stage so that
the encircling audience might feel that they were seeing the Bolshoy
dancers, and even the ballets named - was dispersed as if by the gales
blowing outside the hall. Action, dance-interest, characterisation, were
diffused. As an aid to incomprehension, the programme, like most of the
offerings in this season, comprised 'suites' abstracted from full-length
ballets. The cursory notes in the Pounds 10 souvenir books could be little
aid to understanding for new-comers to this repertory, and I infer that the
season seeks to bring in a fresh audience - whether for ballet or for the
idea of 'spectacle' is less clear.
The Golden Age suite comprised part of the ballet's second act, without much
indication of why Rita was by turns slinky and lyrical; the Corsaire suite
offered pirate dances, a first act duet, and part of the Jardin anime. The
Romeo and Juliet suite took us from the ball-room, by way of the balcony pas
de deux to the deaths of Mercutio and Tybalt and left us with Lady Capulet
behaving like Mrs Vincent Crummles. Abbreviation or bowdlerisation? Yury
Grigorovich has made every attempt to vary the direction of the dance-action
 -the Bolshoy's artists race down the aisles between seats, as well as from
the entrances provided by the stage, and manage to emote sideways - but
sight-lines must inevitably be curious, and the theatrical logic of the
performance uncertain.
The rewards - and I suppose the management's justification - of these
performances lie in the fact of the Bolshoy's power as a dance troupe.
Certainly the ensemble looks strong, youthful, and audiences can say they
have 'seen the Bolshoy'. Physically, yes. Artistically, I am less than
certain after this first evening. The genius of the Bolshoy has ever lain in
a double strength: in the impassioned energies of a style where academic
distinction was not swamped by an exultant manner that enabled emotion to
speak eloquently to us.
They danced - and we believed in the drama, and the dance. But to know these
qualities at their truest we need to see the troupe involved in whole
ballets, in the theatrical surroundings for which they were intended, and
focussed upon superb central interpretations. From Ulanova in Giselle and
Vasiliev in Spartacus, to Bessmertnova and Mukhamedov in Golden Age, and the
ensemble in Swan Lake, we have seen great dancers in major works of art. I
do not think for an instant that those days are gone for the Bolshoy, but
few of the interpretations I saw on Sunday night could triumph over the
surroundings.
The Golden Age principals looked coarse, unconvincing - though Alexey
Popovchenko, as the villainous Yashka, is clearly an interesting artist. I
hope that later performances will allow us to see something more from
Nadezhda Gracheva (whom we first knew as a student with the Bolshoy Academy)
than the blatant stylist - balancing inelegantly, legs at six o'clock - of
Corsaire. She has beautiful qualities, and hectic bravura clouds them. The
most touching interpretation came from Inna Petrova as a Juliet of
child-like sweetness and delicate grace, and it was the street brawl of this
Romeo suite, pouring over the thrust stage, that made the best choreographic
sense of the evening. Among the character performances I salute Yury Vetrov
as a wonderfully degenerate bourgeois in Golden Age, Gedeminas Taranda as a
pistol-packing brigand in Corsaire, and Andrey Buravstev as a bounding
Mercutio. About further programmes - and implications - I hope to report
soon.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Arts: Pelleas and Melisande - Opera in Chicago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something is stirring: more, surely, than the simple centenary of the
original Maeterlinck play. The present abundance of productions of Debussy's
opera suggests a deeper reverberation from one fin-de-siecle to the next,
the new version at the Chicago Lyric Opera does not want to tell us very
much about what the echo might be.
Robert Israel's designs helpfully suggest realistic people in a
non-realistic place: the suits and long dresses are sober; the palace of
Allemonde holds at a moment of shock, with a panelled drawing-room wall
about to topple into a forest of slender pillars, behind which a band of
ultramarine is an abstract sea under photographed clouds.
But the production, by Frank Galati, sentimentalises the action towards
exactly the kind of bourgeois anecdote Debussy wanted to avoid and has the
characters looking as if they've been mislaid by Noel Coward. Pelleas stands
around not knowing what to do with his hands; Melisande hunches her
shoulders in sobs at the end of the tower scene.
Slap against the literalism, however, is the doubling of the role of Yniold,
who is acted by a boy but sung by a woman, and not from the wings but right
there on stage, in costume, as if the lady were his nurse telling hime what
to say, while everyone else - and especially Golaud in the most crucial
scene of his jealousy - has to pretend she is not there at all. In a
different sort of production this could have been a powerful device; here it
is just awry.
Other strange mistakes include the restoration of a scene Debussy cut from
the play - that of the servants washing the castle, done in dumbshow during
the prelude and the dropping of symbolical objects from the flies: a golden
caravel when Pelleas and Melisande are watching a ship depart, or a horse to
bring home the point about Golaud's riding accident, or a Margritte-like
floating rock for Yniold's solo (here, of course, duo) scene.
Many of the production's problems may have to do with the vast scale of the
Civic Opera House, which makes it necessary for the singers to face the
audience squarely at all times in order to be heard. And heard they are.
Both Jerry Hadley and Faith Esham, in the title roles, created the proper
effect of a musical recitation, with every word audible, and every phrase a
union of melody and verbal sense.
Mr Hadley brought a lyric tenor's freshness to the upper shoots of his part,
and had no problems in the more baritonal territory.
Ms Esham had the natural purity needed for Melisande: a grace without
affectation, a voice
that swims. She also moved well and looked good, with the help
of excellent wigs. Victor
Braun affectingly presented Golaud's frustration with a
slatey gnash of desperation at moments of extremity; others in the cast
included Yvonne Minton with her Genevieve as generous as usual.
James Conlon, the conductor, seemed still to be feeling his way at the
opening night, though he too had his task made almost impossible by the size
of the theatre. Orchestral points have to be urged across, with the result
that it is difficult to maintain the often necessary sense of two tempos
happening at once, or to leap across the air from one shape to the next.
The most successful act was the fifth - perhaps just because it was the
last, or more likely because the musical situation here is one more simply
of a slow inevitability being rocked and racked by Golaud's urgent wish,
even at the last, to understand.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Arts: Veronese's 'Marriage at Cana' restored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paolo Caliari, called Veronese after the city of his birth, died in his
house at Venice in 1588, at the age of 60. High on the wall in the modest
back-street near S. Samuele, is an equally modest inscription: 'Paolo
Veronese', it runs, 'Sovereign Painter of Venice, Triumphant and Immortal
Master through the changing centuries . . .' Quite an epitaph in the city of
Carpaccio, Bellini and Giorgione - with Canaletto and Tiepolo to come - for
one who was but the junior of Tintoretto, who outlived him, and above all of
Titian, by some 40 years his senior who had died only ten years before.
So were the Venetians right about him all the time, and we so wrong? For
while his work has always been inescapable, in the great churches and
palazzi of Venice and all the major museums of the world, it has long been
more respected than truly celebrated, a phenomenon before which to stand
more in awe at his facility and scale than in astonishment and delight at
its proper qualities.
He is far from being alone in this respect, for sadly this modern age tends
to distrust, and so discount, the conspicuous demonstration of skill. How
flashy, decorative or self-indulgent, we say, and what a pity it is that
such an obvious talent does not take itself more seriously. The pure
hedonistic thrill of enjoying consummate mastery has long been lost on us,
and the loss is ours.
To stand now before the vast 'The Marriage at Cana', that Veronese painted
in 1563 for the refectory of Palladio's rebuilt S. Giorgio Maggiore, is to
acknowledge the gratuitous foolishness of the mistake. Some 6.7m high and
10m across, it is an astonishing object, carried through with, to us, an
unimaginably easy grace, amplitude and confidence. Veronese was 35 when he
did it, the first in a sequence of similarly vast banquet scenes ended, some
ten years later, with 'The Last Supper' for SS. Giovanni e Paolo, and with
Veronese himself hauled before the Inquisition to answer for his blasphemous
realism. That work, now in the Accademia at Venice, he judiciously retitled
'The Feast at the House of Levi', which got him off the hook.
'The Marriage at Cana' has enjoyed a chequered history - appropriated by
Bonaparte at the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797; rolled up and
shipped back to Paris, unpicked at the seams and split in two. Restored at
intervals ever since, it was packed off to Brest for safety during the war
of 1870 and nearly lost in a railway siding en route; left alone in the
Louvre from 1914 until 1918; sent off again in 1939, first to Chambord, on
to Montauban, then back to the Louvre in 1942. Now, after definitive
restoration that has kept it hidden since 1989, it is on view once more in
the Louvre's Salle des Etats, where it has hung since 1951.
Where once it suffered the turned backs of tourists crowding around the
'Mona Lisa', which has been removed elsewhere, it now rightly commands
something like the grand public space for which it was intended. On either
side hang other works of Veronese, and of his followers, along with related
works and documentary displays. But the great spectacle is supplied en face
by the full scale analytical X-ray photograph that, mounted, fills the far
end of the gallery.
Here, in an oddly expressionistic chiaroscuro, is revealed the technical and
practical history of the painting, the cuts and seams, the nails and struts
of the canvas and its supporting frame, the paint-loss and the repairs, and
all overlaid by the painting's vestigial architecture and the ghostly,
complex choreography of its figures. It is here, with the tell-tale traces
of what they call the pentimenti and repentirs, the underpainting and
changes-of-mind, that the art historians get so excited. Look, they say, a
viol has been shifted an inch or two, a head turned or dropped, an arm
raised, a leg swung nearer the vertical.
But it is hardly news that a work of art should change in the process of its
execution, that the amplification of a design should lead to modifications
of scale or visual emphasis, that the artist's first ideas of composition or
gesture should not be quite the best. Art was never a simple matter of the
original concept, fixed in an instant and forever.
For an artist, the astonishment and excitement felt before this
extraordinary work rest rather on the converse discovery that the changes
are so few and minor, matters of the merest adjustment and refinement.
Veronese would seem indeed to have got it more or less right first time. And
we return to the painting as it is, more alive than ever to what has been
done on the actual surface of the canvas - the marks made, the lightness of
touch and open vigour of the drawing - that together bring alive to us
across the centuries this vast, complex, ideal scene.
The music plays, the servants pass up and down, the hounds strain and fret
as they always did. Is the colour brighter than before, the brocades richer,
the cheeks of the guests more red, Christ's fixed outward gaze a little
warmer in its intensity? Perhaps it is. Something is always lost to a
restoration, to little obvious gain, save only that the work should survive
the longer. It is an old and unresolveable argument - a removal of a layer
of dirt or discoloured varnish here, the subtlest of glazes there. The
restorer's art was never precise, for all its present carapace of scientific
means and method.
'The Marriage at Cana' remains still a work of wonder and the greatest
beauty. 'What, they lived once thus at Venice where the merchants were the
kings,/ Where St Mark's is, where the Doges used to wed the sea with rings?'

FT  12 JAN 93 / People: Inchcape loses family ties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The retirement of Lord Tanlaw, 58, as a non-executive director of Inchcape,
means that the direct ties between the company and the family of James Lyle
Mackay, the first Lord Inchcape, have been almost completely severed.
Lord Tanlaw, the current Lord Inchcape's half-brother, joined the family
firm the year after its shares were quoted on the London stock market. After
six years in Calcutta and the Indian subcontinent, Simon Tanlaw was
appointed a director in 1966.
He became a non-executive director in 1971 after he was elevated to the
peerage. During his time at Inchcape he was involved in the group's merger
with the Borneo Company, which took it into vehicle distribution (now
Inchcape's biggest business) and also the creation of the Gray Dawes Bank.
Lord Tanlaw has decided to retire in order to devote more time to the
development of Fandstan Electric - his own group of railway engineering
companies. The current Lord Inchcape, 75, who headed the company between
1958 and 1982, remains life president but no longer has a seat on the board.

FT  12 JAN 93 / People: Sir Michael Edwardes squashes in another job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hi-Tec Sports, the sports shoe designer and distributor which has seen its
share price collapse from 208p last May to 30p currently, has lured former
British Leyland boss Sir Michael Edwardes on to its board as a non-executive
director. This follows the retirement of Gordon Dunlop, British Airways
finance director between 1983 and 1989, last November at the age of 64.
Frank van Wezel, chairman of Hi-Tec, says he had got to know Edwardes via
the latter's presidency of the Squash Rackets Association as well as of the
Veterans Squash Club of Great Britain.
'He has been very prominent in fighting to give squash a higher profile,'
according to van Wezel, who notes that 62-year-old Edwardes is these days on
the courts five times a week. Hi-Tec sponsors the British Open Championships
in squash.
Van Wezel says he goes for the Edwardes 'no-nonsense, direct approach' and
is looking forward to his contribution to company direction after what he
describes as Hi-Tec's annus horribilis.
After a year of bruising price wars in the UK market with Nike and Reebok,
van Wezel claims the order books are 'looking healthy again, and at a decent
margin. Sir Michael comes at a time when I feel we have hit the bottom'.
While Hi-Tec has traditionally had only one non-executive on its board, van
Wezel says he is now looking for a second outside director. 'We have all
read Cadbury. . .,' he says.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New EC food registration regulations due in July should comfort Parma ham
producers who last year failed to stop Marks and Spencer selling their
famous ham, according to London solicitors Lewis Silkin. The regulations,
similar to the French appellation controlee scheme for wine, offer
registration and certification to producers of cheese, sausages and beer
traditionally associated with particular areas. The most exclusive tag will
be Protected Designation of Origin followed by Protected Geographical
Indications and Certificates of Special Character.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Legal Briefs: Top rate league table calls for clarification
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US National Law Journal's recently published annual billing survey may
throw welcome light on the question of whether the UK's top commercial law
firms are the world's most expensive, charging more than Dollars 200 an hour
in excess of their Wall Street counterparts. The International Financial Law
Review 1000, which began the debate, credited partners in the most expensive
Wall Street firms with a top hourly rate of Dollars 350 an hour. According
to the NLJ survey, that appears a serious underestimate. The highest hourly
rates for partners in New York City firms were steady last year at between
Dollars 400 and Dollars 450, with some firms billing higher (Lord, Day and
Lord Dollars 475, for example).
The highest hourly rate reported to the NLJ was Dollars 500 charged by
senior partners at Atlanta's Kilpatrick &amp; Cody. The IFLR 1,000 figures seem
to reflect the top rates charged by partners in Los Angeles, Washington DC,
Dallas, and Chicago. Several Chicago firms (Winston and Strawn Dollars 450,
for example) now however charge New York rates.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Cement cartel court setback - Europan
Law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of First Instance has dismissed judicial review
applications challenging the legality of the Commission's competition
procedure against the EC cement industry. The CFI held the applications were
inadmissible as being premature.
The procedural challenges were brought by four cement producers or national
associations at an unusually early stage in the formal procedure initiated
by the Commission in November 1991.
On the basis of documents obtained during investigations of business
premises and following formal requests, the commission concluded that
European cement producers and certain national and international trade
associations were operating a cartel at national and international level to
share out member country markets, keep them separate, and limit imports from
within and outside the EC.
A statement of objections was sent to all parties, accusing them of
infringing EC competition rules.
It dealt with allegations concerning conduct at international level
separately from that at national level. Although it was a single document,
the full text was not sent to all 76 parties. The factual and legal
assessment chapters dealing with individual national markets were sent only
to producers and associations in the member country concerned. All parties
received the text dealing with allegations at international level plus a
full table of contents and a list of documents on the file indicating those
to which access was available.
The two main grounds for challenge concerned the Commission's infringement
of the parties' rights of defence, by refusing, first, to disclose all the
chapters of the statement of objections and, second, to grant them access to
all non-confidential documents in the Commission's file.
The refusal of full access to the file concerned two types of documents:
documents relating to national markets available only to those directly
concerned; and those documents relating to objections notified to the
parties which were, in the Commission's view, covered by the EC rules on
professional secrecy since they were obtained in the exercise of the
Commission's investigation powers and were not used against the producer or
association to which the objections were addressed.
The CFI restricted the case to the issue of admissibility. Following
established principles, the Court said that when a procedural step concerned
the rights of defence, it could only be overturned if it vitiated the final
decision taken at the end of the administrative procedure.
Only measures immediately and irreversibly affecting the legal situation of
the parties concerned could justify the admissibility of an annulment action
before completion of the administrative procedure. Even though they may
constitute an infringement of the rights of defence, Commission measures
refusing access to the file were merely preparatory steps the illegality of
which could be raised in appeals against the commission's final decisions,
while still providing sufficient protection of the rights of defence.
Full access to the file
More importantly, the Court clarified the scope of the right of access to
the file as a matter of substantive law repeating its interpretation of the
Commissions' policy on access to the file in its 1991 judgment in Case
T-7/89 Hercules v Commission:
'the Commission has an obligation to make available to the undertakings
involved in article 85(1) proceedings all documents, whether in their favour
or otherwise, which it had obtained during the course of the investigation,
save where the business secrets of other undertakings, the internal
documents of the Commission and other confidential information are
involved.'
The Commission may wish to use the opportunities afforded by its
administrative procedures to reconsider its approach to access to the file
in the light of the CFI's views. Moreover its interpretation of the rules on
professional secrecy as extending to all information obtained by the
Commission pursuant to its powers, and not used against a party, raises a
question of law which has not yet been decided by the Community judicature.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Revolution sweeps fees - The recession
has given the client the whip hand in terms of designing flexible charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In September last year Mr Philip Lacovara, general counsel of Morgan Stanley
&amp; Co in the US, sent this message to 85 law firms regularly used by his
company: 'We no longer want to assume that the typical matter will be
handled and billed on a time-based arrangement. Instead, the basis for legal
billing on new matters will be shifted from hours-based fees to more
flexible and varied 'value-based' engagements.
'Therefore outside counsel (law firms) will be expected to consider agreeing
to use various alternative billing methods such as fixed fees, fixed fees
plus a contingency, reduced hourly rates plus a contingency, blended hourly
rates, volume discounts and multi-stage billing.'
Morgan Stanley is not alone. Several American businesses are now sending
engagement letters or instructions to their lawyers, setting out what they
are and are not prepared to pay for.
Citicorp recently sent a 15-page letter to more than 100 firms which the
firms must sign if they expect work.
The Aetna Casualty and Surety Co of Hartford, Connecticut, now provides all
its outside counsel with a guide to alternative billing methods and requires
them to propose discounted hourly rates or alternative charging when
pitching for a piece of work.
British companies worried that they may be paying too much for legal
services should take heart. The recession has changed the market place.
Companies can now exert a greater influence on the legal services which they
purchase and on what those services cost.
The shift from a supply and asset driven environment to a demand-led one
means that the value of legal services is increasingly determined by the
client and not, as formerly, by a law firm's hourly charging rates
multiplied by time spent.
Most law firms accept the need to be flexible. Mr John Grieves, senior
partner of City of London solicitors Freshfields, concedes that the market
place has changed and that fees and methods of charging have become a
significant topic of discussion with clients during the last 18 months.
In the 1980s, the priority for clients and law firms alike was to complete
the transaction as quickly as possible. Human resources were at a premium:
get the people in and get the job done was the message; the cost was
secondary. Now, he says, costs are a priority: 'Clients want value for
money. We have to tailor our services to clients' needs.'
The new approach to fees sometimes called 'value billing' equates the amount
a law firm can charge for its services to the value placed on a particular
piece of work by the client. High volume, low value work which any number of
firms can do will be very price sensitive. The client is able to drive a
hard bargain. At the other end of the scale, work which is unique and of the
highest value to the client will be price insensitive as only a handful of
lawyers may be capable. Here the law firm has the upper hand and may charge
premium rates.
Value billing as a concept has been around for years, but a by-product of
the search for better value for money, and of the recession, has been the
development during the last two years of alternative methods of determining
fees.
Law firms recognise that, to give value, they have to respond to requests by
clients to determine a method of charging which is not so heavily reliant on
the hourly rates charged by individual lawyers working on a job and the
number of hours they spend on it.
Clients expect law firms to take some of the risk of ensuring services are
provided most efficiently. Alternative billing, or charging, is all about
who bears this risk.
The alternatives are in theory infinitely variable, limited only by the
willingness of the law firm to experiment. There are, however, several
commonly used alternative methods of billing which businesses may wish to
explore.
Fixed fees. A fixed fee for a job negotiated in advance. If the law firm can
staff a job more efficiently and reduce the time spent on the work to a
minimum, it will make a profit on the job. If it cannot, it will lose money.
The cost of inefficiency falls on the law firm, not on the client.
Fee caps. Setting the maximum a client will pay for a job, expressed as a
maximum fixed fee or as a maximum number of hours that the client is
prepared to pay for.
Result-based bonuses or success fees. These are related to whether the firm
achieves the outcome sought by the client or brings the job in below a
budgeted maximum. A firm agrees to a reduced fixed fee for the work or to
reduced hourly rates with an uplift or bonus for a successful outcome. The
lawyer and the client must determine what constitutes a successful outcome.
Bonuses can take several forms: a percentage of the fees or damages saved,
or of the profits from a successful transaction.
These types of result-based fee arrangements are sometimes called contingent
fees. They vary from the 'no win, no pay' contingent fee arrangements used
in litigation, in that the law firm always receives some form of basic
payment for the work whatever the outcome. Such contingent fee arrangements
for non-contentious work are not outlawed in the UK.
Budgeted fees or multi-stage fees. An overall budget is set for the job or
different budgets are set for stages of a job. Multi-stage fee arrangements
are generally related to transactional matters. Clients may agree that the
first stage of the transaction will be paid at a reduced hourly rate, which
will rise by an agreed percentage every time a trigger point or a different
stage of the transaction is reached.
Several alternative billing methods are still tied to the amount of time
spent on a job by the law firm and are really variations on the standard
practice of hourly billing.
The most common form of alternative rate billing is the blended rate: a
uniform hourly rate for all the lawyers working on the job, irrespective of
their level of seniority or experience. The blended rate will be agreed
between the law firm and the client before work starts and is generally
lower than the average hourly rate charged by partners and above the rate
charged by trainees or newly qualified lawyers. For the top City law firms,
an average blended rate might be somewhere in the region of Pounds
150-Pounds 160 an hour.
Discount billing calculates legal fees using reduced hourly rates for
lawyers working on a project. Firms may also agree to charge standard hourly
rates but offer a percentage discount on the final bill.
Some firms may also offer volume discounts where they will agree to work at
reduced hourly rates or to reduce the overall bill in return for a
guaranteed volume of work.
Premium billing is closely associated with bonuses and success fees. If the
project is successful, the firm will charge fees higher than its standard
hourly rates. If the transaction falls through, the firm charges reduced
rates. Premium rates are often calculated as a percentage of standard rates.
Companies are likely to find that their lawyers are prepared to discuss most
forms of alternative charging arrangements. If they are not, the client has
the option of taking his custom elsewhere. The recession has given
businesses the whip hand in the fees debate.

FT  12 JAN 93 / People: Sherlock takes to the road
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Sherlock, who resigned suddenly from Bass last year, has been picked
to succeed Jack Mather as chief executive of NFC. Mather, chief executive of
the transport and logistics company since 1984, is retiring for health
reasons. He underwent heart surgery three years ago and told the board last
year he wanted to step down early. Now 56, he will leave after next month's
annual meeting.
Sherlock will be the most senior outside appointment to NFC's board since
its employee led buy-out from the government in 1982. According to James
Watson, the chairman: 'The culture (of employee ownership) will be
preserved, but Sherlock will be bringing in a new perspective; he is a man
of great energy.'
Sherlock, 47, started with Bass in 1972 and joined the board in 1988. He
built up Bass's leisure division before moving to the company's Holiday Inns
hotel operations in the US. He resigned in October, apparently unhappy with
the change.
One of his first jobs will be to take part in NFC's annual strategic review
which is just getting under way, although Watson says NFC's broad strategy
is well established and no big changes are likely.
After leaving Bass, Sherlock was appointed a non-executive director at
Allied Leisure last November.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Technically Speaking: Catching the pornographers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MEDIEVAL alchemists had succeeded in turning base metals into gold, what
is the betting they would have blown the proceeds in the local brothel?
Humans seem to have an irrepressible urge to turn technologies developed for
noble uses to baser ones. An obvious example is the videorecorder, developed
to free people from the tyranny of broadcasting schedules, but now a primary
tool of the pornographer. Satellite television is another.
And when virtual reality - advanced computer simulations which encourage
viewers to believe they are a part of the scene depicted - made its debut
some years ago, what caught the public imagination first was the prospect of
electronic sex.
Although this is a futuristic example of the potential use of computers in
the sex industry, there is growing concern about a much less esoteric
phenomenon - the dissemination of pornographic material either as computer
diskettes or over computer networks.
Computer pornography is not a new issue; in the early days of personal
computing there was justifiable outrage over the dissemination of crudely
drawn computer games with sexist and racist themes. What is new, however, is
the quality of the images that modern technology makes possible and the ease
with which they can be disseminated, especially where young people are
involved. Diskettes can be swapped in the playground; computer bulletin
boards can be accessed by home computers. Regulation is difficult, if not
impossible.
John Ashley of Greater Manchester Police, a specialist in obscene
publications, says there is no pornographic image, still or moving, which
cannot be captured on floppy disk or disseminated over a network. The
computer pornography now being distributed in the UK seems to be coming from
the traditional sources - the US and the Netherlands.
Is there a real problem and if so how serious is it? Yes, and very serious,
according to Catherine Itzin of Bradford University whose book Pornography
has just been published by Oxford University Press, and who is chiefly
concerned with its social effects.
It is certainly serious enough for the Law Specialist group of the British
Computer Society, the chartered institution for information technology
specialists, to have set up a consultative group to examine two questions:
first, are there technical answers to the problem of regulation? Second,
what are the legal implications of pornography in this form and are changes
in the law required?
The BCS, aware that what is pornographic can often be a matter of opinion
rather than fact, is directing the thrust of its campaign towards the
protection of young people. That computers have become a medium for
pornography is not in itself of any more significance than the more
traditional use of books or films. But computing has special
characteristics.
Ron McQuaker, BCS vice president responsible for professional affairs,
argues that a diskette is unlike a magazine or a videotape; its contents are
not obvious and it can be protected by passwords; it can be programmed to
self-destruct if the wrong key is used.
Furthermore, parents, who may well have encouraged their children to become
computer-literate, are less likely to be aware of the uses to which their
home computers are being put.
Ashley and Itzin believe it is impossible at present to regulate computer
pornography. Ashley, indeed, does not foresee any technical developments
which will improve matters. His approach is to prosecute when he can, and he
believes it has a salutary effect.
There is no real answer, technical or otherwise, to the issue of pornography
apart from changes in social attitudes. In that sense, Itzin's approach may
have more long-term influence than that of the BCS. But a technical trap for
pornographers might open the possibility of catching virus writers and
others who misuse computer systems. It is an avenue of research well worth
exploring.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Technology: Under siege - Massachusetts is fighting to
maintain its position as a high-tech centre amid fierce competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As competition intensifies in the US to attract job-creating industries, the
high-technology sector is being wooed from coast to coast. States like
Michigan, Rhode Island, Texas and North Carolina are keen to lure companies,
while the traditional centres of Massachusetts and California are striving
to hold their own.
High-tech companies, which offer good pay and usually pose little risk to
the environment, are seen as particularly desirable additions to a local
economy. Regional and state governments promise everything from tax breaks
to rail links to convince these companies to locate within their borders.
This is good news for companies in sectors such as software,
telecommunications and biotechnology. But Massachusetts fears it may become
a casualty of the battle. With an economy based largely on high-technology,
the state has much to lose. Its redoubled efforts to maintain a hold on this
area will be closely watched by competing states and high-tech companies
alike.
In the heady 1980s, the computer sector in Boston led a growth surge so
buoyant that it was confidently dubbed the 'Massachusetts Miracle'.
Companies in fields such as computers, telecommunications and environmental
technology came to account for some 15 per cent of employment (excluding
support industries).
Overnight stars like Digital Equipment Corporation and Wang were the best
known of the many new computer groups lining Route 128 north of the city. By
the end of the decade, the area produced more computer chips than Silicon
Valley.
During the last few years, though, New England's computer bubble has burst.
The failure of Wang and troubles at Digital have highlighted the
difficulties facing the industry, and the once thriving Route 128 is now
little more than an old highway lined with empty offices. Since 1984, some
44,000 jobs have been lost in Massachusetts' computer sector, which now
employs 287,000 people.
The pain of the industry's floundering has been partially countered by the
emergence of non-electronics sectors. As in California, biotechnology
companies have helped Massachusetts to fill the yawning job gap left when
many computer companies closed their doors. Jobs in biotechnology have risen
from virtually nothing to 14,000 in the past seven years, but still account
for only 0.5 per cent of employment, though the total health sector
(including biotechnology) makes up 13 per cent.
The possibility of losing the high-technology battle was brought home to the
state a few months ago when one Massachusetts-based biotech group,
Alpha-Beta Technology, announced plans to build a Dollars 31m (Pounds 20m)
manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, which provided favourable tax breaks.
'I think areas like Northern California and Massachusetts had become very
complacent about high-tech,' says Patrick Leonard, president of
Massachusetts-based Cambridge Biotech Corporation. 'Successful marketing
from states like North Carolina has forced them to wake up and that's great
for the biotech industry.'
Massachusetts still has reasons to feel confident. Many of the elements
which triggered the growth of the computer sector, such as high educational
levels and plenty of venture capital, have been successfully fed into
biotechnology. Home to two of the most prestigious universities in the US,
Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the state offers
formidable advantages to high-technology companies in the research and
development phase.
'Most of the high-technology companies started in Boston were formed with
technology ideas out of academic research at Harvard and MIT,' says Garen
Bohlin, chief financial officer at Genetics Institute, founded by two
Harvard professors. Finally, the universities provide entrepreneurs for the
industry. Attracted by the quality of life in Massachusetts, many graduates
opt to stay in the area.
Over the last five years, MIT graduates alone founded more than 100
high-technology companies in the state. Another advantage for the
biotechnology sector is the large number of excellent hospitals in the area.
'The well-developed health industry is especially helpful when we move to
clinical tests,' says Geoffrey Cox, senior vice-president of Genzyme
Corporation, which recently dropped plans to leave the state.
Massachusetts has successfully transferred many of these resources from the
computer sector to biotechnology. Some biotechnology companies have begun to
retrain former computer workers. 'There is a lot of overlap, and not only in
skilled workers. A lot of the equipment and infrastructure used in the
computer industry, like clean rooms, is quite relevant to biotechnology,'
adds Cox.
Another resource shift has been in the area of venture capital. 'A great
deal of venture capital in the state has moved away from computers towards
biotech,' says Ken Bate, chief financial officer of Boston-based Biogen.
'Boston has always been dependent on high-tech industries, and is much more
entrepreneurial and risk-oriented than other cities in the US.'
But Massachusetts' success in R&amp;D does not necessarily translate into jobs
in high-tech manufacturing. 'Massachusetts is a high-wage state,' said Bate.
'So at that stage, it faces stiffer competition from other regions.' This
presents a big problem for the area. 'We can't build an economy on research
alone,' says Massachusetts governor William Weld. 'We have to capture the
manufacturing, the marketing and the sales staff, too.'
To prevent the loss of more biotechnology manufacturing facilities, the Weld
administration has announced several new initiatives. Among them are a
capital gains tax phase-out and other tax breaks, and assistance in getting
around bureaucratic laws.
Whether Massachusetts will succeed in its battle to hold on to biotechnology
may still be doubtful. Other states are sure to give the region a run for
its money and have enjoyed some success in luring companies away, as the
Alpha-Beta example shows. One thing is sure - the biotechnology industry
will enjoy the fight.

HDTV-compatible video cassette recorder in the Japanese domestic market by
autumn this year.
Huge investment in research and development of HDTV by Japanese companies,
and the increasing volume of HDTV broadcasting in Japan, have so far
translated into very limited sales of HDTV sets, largely due to the
prohibitively high cost of models already on the market.
The cheapest HDTV set so far on sale in Japan is a Y1.3m (Pounds 6,800)
model from Sony. Other versions, labelled 'Hi-Vision', are half-way houses
between HDTV and conventional TV, using simplified decoders which produce
picture quality better than ordinary TVs but not up to full HDTV standards.
JVC says production costs for its new HDTV will be much lower because of the
development of a smaller, simpler but fully-functional decoder requiring
fewer integrated circuits. The new sets will go on sale in Japan later this
year, priced at less than Y1m, the level at which industry analysts have
predicted that sales for home use will take off. However, supplies will
reach the shops too late to take advantage of the boom in HDTV sales
predicted in the run up to the wedding of the Japanese crown prince this
summer.
The HDTV video recorder is also to be sold cheaply enough to break into the
mass market, at around Y600,000. Using technology known as W-VHS, the
machine splits HDTV signals to record them on double-track metal tape. The
company stresses that in addition to making high-quality HDTV recordings, it
can also play back existing VHS format recordings, and can record two
conventional TV programmes simultaneously on the double-track tape.
JVC claims the videos will also be compatible with the next generation of
HDTV broadcasting systems being planned around the world, not just with the
current Japanese Muse format.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): The best places to go for
help and advice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Where can the smaller company turn for advice and funding?
Advice and help with exports can be sought from the larger chambers of
commerce with international expertise (notably London, Birmingham and
Manchester) or from organisations such as the British Exporters Association
(Tel 071 222 5419) and the Institute of Export (071 247 9812).
A number of banks still have smaller exporter schemes (see table) though not
all local managers may be aware of them. There are also a number of what are
known as credit policy managers - companies which buy their credit insurance
from, for example, NCM and then sell it on in smaller amounts. These include
Credit Management Resources (081 647 8833), Clear-a-Debt (081 683 0141) and
Intrum Justitia (0789 415181).
An exporter may make a direct approach to one of the factoring companies for
a quotation. Most of the larger factoring companies are bank-owned.
Rates for export factoring services are typically 1-1.5 per cent for
administrative charges plus 0.5-1 per cent for credit which the factor buys
in from the insurer. Details of the main factoring companies are available
from the Association of British Factors and Discounters (071 930 9112).
Companies could approach NCM direct (0222 824000) though it would not
normally take on a company with exports worth less than Pounds 100,000, or
Trade Indemnity, another leading credit insurance group (071 739 4311).
Several of the general insurance brokers have export credit insurance
departments while the largest specialist broker is the Credit Insurance
Association (071 235 3550). Smaller exporters are unlikely to have the
volumes of business needed to justify using a broker. However, CIA would
normally expect clients to have export turnover of Pounds 4m or more, says
James Larkin, a director.
Exporters of this size could expect to pay premiums of 0.5 per cent of
turnover though this could be lower for higher volumes of business or higher
in high-risk markets. The level of premium charged would reflect the
customer's competence in administering his export business, the credit
rating of customers and the countries in which he does business.
The very small exporter might find all of these routes barred, in which case
he will need to deal on a cash basis with customers (only possible if he has
a strong market position) or by means of credit card payments. Letters of
credit could be used but they are a cumbersome and costly process for
smaller deals and do not provide complete insurance against loss.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Credit where it is due -
The plight of small and medium-sized companies which need export finance is
raising increasing concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mike Smith expects to sell about Pounds 500,000 worth of second-hand plastic
production machinery this year, 90 per cent of it overseas.
Smith says he has never had a default from a foreign customer but, because
much of his equipment goes to 'risky' countries, he cannot obtain export
credit insurance and nor, therefore, export finance from his bank.
Fortunately for Smith, who sells to Egypt, Sri Lanka, Poland, India and
Yemen, the owner of the company which ships his machinery has been willing
to finance these export deals. The shipper, who does a lot of business with
the safer US market, has export credit cover from NCM Credit Insurance, one
of the main providers of this form of insurance and so is able to extend
cover to Smith's riskier destinations.
'This means I get export credit cover indirectly but I pay a higher premium
for the funds than I would for a bank overdraft,' says Smith. He is also
concerned that as his business grows he may no longer be able to call on all
the funds he needs from this source.
In recent months the British government has given signs of wanting to make
conditions easier for UK exporters. Richard Needham, junior trade minister,
told the Institute of Exports last month that the government wanted to
ensure there was adequate insurance cover at competitive premiums while an
extra Pounds 700m of export credit guarantees were announced in the November
autumn financial statement.
But industrialists and organisations which advise exporters remain deeply
concerned at the poor level of support for exports. Most attention has been
focused on the plight of large manufacturers of capital goods but the
position of small and medium-sized businesses is, if anything, even worse.
'The current scenario is not remotely user-friendly,' says Campbell Dunford,
chairman of the London Chamber of Commerce's export finance committee.
'Export support has been allowed to wither away on the grounds that we must
get rid of subsidies.'
Ian Campbell, director general of the Institute of Export, says: 'We are
very concerned about the level of finance available to small firms.'
While smaller companies in France and the Netherlands have increased their
share of visible exports during the 1980s there is no evidence of a similar
increase in the UK, according to the latest NatWest Review of Small Business
Trends.
Detailed data on small firms' export performance is lacking but there is no
evidence that a campaign launched by the British Overseas Trade Board in
1987 to encourage small companies to export more has had any impact.
The creation of the Single European Market has produced a wave of government
publicity about the need for British companies to increase exports but
practical difficulties abound. 'It is not enough to make exporters aware of
the opportunities of the single market without helping them to do something
about it,' says Arthur White of Capital Financial Services, a Chislehurst,
Kent consultancy.
Recent changes in government policy may even have damaged the ability of
British firms to export. The privatisation of the Export Credits Guarantee
Department's short-term business - providing credit for up to two years - by
means of a sale to NCM, the Dutch private credit insurer, has raised fears
that rates will rise and some areas become uninsurable. But Colin Foxall,
chief executive, denies that NCM has become 'ruthlessly commercial' and says
80 per cent of NCM's 6,000 customers export less than Pounds 1m a year.
In addition, a decision to relate premiums for ECGD medium-term cover more
closely to risk has pushed up premiums.
But equally damaging have been sharp and unpublicised cut-backs in the
commitment of the banks to providing export finance for smaller companies,
revealed in a survey* today in the magazine Export Today.
The survey shows that five of the leading UK banks have withdrawn their
small exporter schemes over the last two years while Exfinco, a specialist
in this field, shut down.
'There has been a huge unacknowledged reduction in the ability of the banks
to provide support for exporters,' comments Dunford. The banks have run down
the departments providing export help for smaller companies, leaving
customers to the mercy of branch managers, many of whom lack specialist
expertise. Some banks have begun referring export customers to their
factoring subsidiaries.
National Westminster Bank withdrew its smaller exporters scheme in mid-1992
after suffering losses, though the scheme had signally failed to appeal to
customers with only nine signed up over the five years it was operating.
NatWest is now working on a new initiative, says Andy Nemes, regional
executive responsible for international trade.
It wants an off-the-shelf scheme with low administrative costs and a
standardised method of assessing credit risk.
But it has learned that providing export credit insurance is not enough to
guarantee against losses.
Most insurance schemes cover only 90 per cent of the risk while there are
many reasons why cover may be rendered invalid: customers may forget to
provide details of transactions to the insurer; exceed their credit limits;
make deliveries outside the agreed dates; or fail to report payment delays.
The bank must then try to recoup losses from its customer.
The only one of the big clearing banks to have maintained its smaller
exporters scheme is Barclays. It has nearly 500 customers in the scheme,
designed for companies exporting up to Pounds 2m. It provides export
finance, normally at rates below standard overdraft rates, and 100 per cent
credit cover for a 2 1/2 per cent fee, reducing for volumes above Pounds
200,000.
Barclays, like many of the other banks which still run special schemes for
small exporters, takes out block cover with NCM, effectively retailing this
on to its own customers.
NCM itself reinsures 98 per cent of its risks in the commercial market. The
government still guarantees cover in certain high-risk markets regarded as
being in the national interest but it does not provide the blanket guarantee
previously available to ECGD's short-term operations. This has reduced the
value of NCM cover in the eyes of some of the banks.
But the recession and a growing volume of losses - up 170 per cent over the
past five years - has reduced the willingness of the reinsurance market to
provide cover. NCM acknowledges that the market is tighter than it has been
though it says it has had no problems gaining reinsurance cover. Others are
not so sure. 'The government believes the private sector will provide
reinsurance cover but there is not enough,' says Campbell.
The difficulties involved in raising export finance mean that many small and
medium-sized companies finance their exports from their overdraft and
without insurance cover. This does not appear to be a sound basis for an
export-led recovery.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs extend outside interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Baker has used the nine months since he left the cabinet to
become a non-executive director of one blue-chip British company and an
adviser to two more.
The new register of members' interests, published yesterday, reveals that
the Conservative MP for the Surrey constituency of Mole Valley has joined
the board of Hanson, the multinational conglomerate.
A former minister for information technology, Mr Baker has also signed up as
an adviser to Cable and Wireless - the communications group chaired by his
former cabinet colleague Lord Young - and to ICL, the computer company.
His entry in the new register indicates that he has further supplemented his
portfolio of interests with directorships of Torrey Investments Inc and the
UK-Japan 2000 Group.
The register - which logs members' interests as at December 1 1992 - covers
nine classes of interest including directorships, sponsorships and
shareholdings as well as overseas visits where the cost has not been wholly
borne by the member or public funds.
Another former cabinet minister who has taken on a new outside interest is
Mr Tom King, previously defence secretary, who has become a director of
Electra Investment Trust.
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, became chairman of the
National House Building Council in June 1992. He continues to list a
directorship of Group 4 Securitas, which manages Britain's first privately
managed remand prison at Wolds in Humberside.
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, has become a development
adviser to the China Investment and Development Fund and to Kleinwort Benson
China Management.
The number of MPs who are Names at Lloyd's of London, the troubled insurance
market, has fallen below 50, but still includes a number of ministers. Mr
Robert Banks, Conservative MP for Harrogate, notes for the first time that
he resigned from Lloyd's in 1989. Ms Jacqui Lait, Tory MP for Hastings and
Rye, indicates that she resigned from the market in December 1991.
Several MPs who have entered parliament since the last register was
published have declared ties to prominent companies.
Mr Barry Legg, Tory MP for Milton Keynes South West, is a consultant to
Hillsdown Holdings, the food group in the news recently for paying to
landscape a pond in the grounds of agriculture minister Mr John Gummer's
country house.
Others include Mr Bernard Jenkin (C Colchester North) who advises Legal and
General, the insurance group; Mr Peter Ainsworth (C East Surrey) who is a
consultant to SG Warburg Group; and Ms Judith Chaplin (C Newbury) who is a
consultant to Kleinwort Benson Securities and parliamentary adviser to the
Institute of Chartered Accountants.
Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool, lists a trip to the Democratic
party convention in New York in August last year, at which the visitors'
programme was funded by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank.
Among select committee chairmen, Sir Malcolm Thornton (education) has become
parliamentary consultant to the Littlewoods Organisation, while Sir Jerry
Wiggin (agriculture) continues to list consultancies to both British Sugar
and Sears. Mrs Marion Roe (health) has visited the Seychelles and Angola to
monitor elections.
In June, MPs backed new procedures to ensure those elected to the
chairmanships of Commons committees do not have business interests likely to
conflict with their parliamentary duties.
The register, which is available from HMSO, weighs in at 90 pages against
106 pages last January, and costs Pounds 1.35 less at Pounds 15.25.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Decision today on cash gift to
Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont, the Chancellor, is expected to escape direct criticism
when the Commons' members interests committee agrees a report today on a
Pounds 18,000 donation he received from an unnamed donor, Ralph Atkins
writes.
However the committee is expected to call on MPs to in future resist
accepting anonymous donations or, if they are accepted, to declare them in
the register of members' interests.
Mr Lamont's entry in the register published yesterday reads 'nil'.
The committee also believes ministers cannot expect different treatment from
backbenchers. A draft report by Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, Tory chairman,
makes no explicit reference to the help Mr Lamont received towards the legal
costs of evicting an unwanted tenant and which provoked a political row last
year. But it says that a loophole in rules on registering interests has
emerged.
No clear guidelines have been set down before for anonymous gifts and the
committee's draft report is believed to say that no exception should be made
for donations to MPs from central party funds. But there may be more of a
case for an MP accepting help from a constituency party.
Meanwhile, the Commons public accounts committee will meet tomorrow to
consider a National Audit Office report on the Pounds 4,700 contributed by
the Treasury towards Mr Lamont's fees. Mr Robert Sheldon, PAC chairman, is
to make a statement afterwards.

PRESSURE within the IRA for an end to violence is growing, Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday.
Leaders of the republican terrorist organisation knew no British government,
either Labour or Conservative, would talk to those who resort to violence,
Sir Patrick said.
He said talks on the province's future would resume once the new Irish
government was in place. The last initiative collapsed in November.

THE ASYLUM and Immi-gration Appeals Bill, aimed at accelerating and
simplifying the decision-making process in asylum cases, was moving towards
completion of its remaining stages in the Commons last night.
During the debate, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, told MPs that only
one in 20 of the applications for political asylum in Britain dealt with in
1992 proved to be well founded.
In the committee stage last month the government bowed to pressure from Tory
backbenchers by agreeing to water down proposals which would have removed
the current right of appeal for relatives of British residents refused entry
into Britain for short visits.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Budget 'split' played down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWNING Street sought yesterday to dispel reports that Mr John Major was at
odds with Mr Norman Lamont over the need for tax increases in the March
Budget, Philip Stephens writes.
But the prime minister's aides did nothing to damp speculation that Mr Major
intends to take a leading role in deciding the shape of the eventual
package.
The judgment of cabinet colleagues is that Mr Major will be much more
cautious than the chancellor about any measures that might abort economic
recovery.
The aides said Mr Major would have his first substantive discussion with the
chancellor over the outlook for the economy and public borrowing tomorrow.
Mr Lamont will report on the conclusions of the Treasury's Chevening
weekend. Mr Major is likely to emphasise his concern that the budget should
underpin industrial confidence and investment.

<TEXT>
CROSS-PARTY support for legislation to prohibit snooping, whether by
electronic surveillance, telephoto lenses or trespass, was mounting
yesterday following the widespread leaking of the Calcutt report on press
behaviour.
But MPs were divided over whether the government could or should set up a
powerful statutory press complaints tribunal with recourse to the courts -
reportedly the most formidable proposal by Sir David Calcutt QC.
The cabinet, which will discuss the report on Thursday, is divided on the
question. While Mr John Major, Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Kenneth Clarke are
understood to favour action, others have doubts about the feasibility of
devising effective legislation.
For Labour, Ms Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary, expressed concern
that the leaks did not reveal any moves to balance right-of-reply provisions
with guarantees on the right to know.
Accusing some Fleet Street editors of 'hysterical' reactions to the report,
she said there was now much support across the country for statutory
restraints on the press.
She supported the private member's bill tabled by Mr Clive Soley, Labour MP
for Hammersmith, to set up a body to enforce the right of reply, targeted
chiefly at protecting private citizens.
But she expressed doubts about the possibility of effective legal restraints
without a freedom of information act to protect press freedoms.
Opinions among Conservatives were divided. Backbenchers have expressed anger
at press intrusions into the private lives of the royal family, and at the
coverage of recent events involving Mr Norman Lamont and Mr David Mellor.
But several have cautioned that the government must take care before
launching a vendetta against newspapers, many of which offered loyal support
to the party during the last general election.
Labour backbenchers are concerned, however, that the leaking of the Calcutt
conclusions might undermine Mr Soley's bill, which will have a second
reading on January 29. Mr Soley said he believed the leak would increase
cross-party backing for the bill.
Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, confirmed last
night that he had written to Sir David Calcutt in December saying that the
Princess of Wales had been 'participating in the provision of information
for tabloid editors about the state of her marriage.'
Lord McGregor said the actions of the Princess 'seriously embarrassed' the
commission, which had issued a statement condemning coverage of the royal
marriage after being assured by Buckingham Palace that the Princess was not
involved in any leak.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM backs reform of teacher training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL reform of teacher training to switch responsibility away from
universities and colleges to schools is being pushed by Mr John Major as
part of his strategy to give new momentum to his domestic political agenda.
The prime minister is backing a return to proposals which would reduce
sharply the role of conventional teacher-training institutes in favour of
classroom-based experience in primary schools.
The plan is seen in Downing Street as the last piece in an policy jigsaw
designed to reverse irrevocably the 'progressive' and theory-based approach
to education adopted by successive governments during the 1960s and 1970s.
Mr Major considered the proposals at the two-day review at Chequers of his
domestic agenda which ended yesterday. Downing Street said afterwards that
renewed impetus for the government's education and health reforms were among
the key priorities.
Whitehall officials said Mr Major favoured the most radical of the options
being looked at by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, in a
wide-ranging review of the structure of teacher training.
It would in effect reverse the present system under which classroom
experience plays a relatively small part in an academically driven training
structure.
Last year Mr Patten appeared to backtrack on plans to shift more training of
secondary school teachers into the schools. He dropped plans to impose a
ceiling of one fifth on the college-based component of courses for the
postgraduate Certificate of Education and substituted instead a limit of one
third.
But the education secretary is said to be sympathetic to the idea of a
complete overhaul of the different system which applies to many primary
school teachers. Their training - based on the Bachelor of Education degree
 -is tied much more closely to courses at colleges and universities.
Such courses have long been a bete noire of those on the right of the Tory
party, where they are seen as responsible for the progressive trends in
education which have allegedly lowered standards in the nation's schools.
Mr Patten, who is expected to complete his review by the spring, is looking
at proposals which would switch the basic responsibility for primary school
training to individual schools or to groups of schools. Those specially
designed schools would then 'buy in' academic training by sending trainees
to the existing institutes.
Officials acknowledge that the scheme would create a range of problems, not
least because many of the country's primary schools, which total almost
20,000, are not large enough to take on training responsibilities.
But they insist that the problems are soluble. The screening of potential
candidates, for example, could be transferred from the existing institutes
to a centralised organisation. Training could then be focused on larger
primary schools which would receive extra funding or on groups of schools
operating in consortia.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge on orders for railway stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government last night announced steps to ensure that orders for new
railway rolling stock do not dry up because of the privatisation of British
Rail.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told the all-party Commons transport
committee that new arrangements would be introduced before privatisation to
develop a market in leased rolling stock for BR and private operators. These
should ensure that new orders are placed before current orders for the new
Networker trains are completed in 1994.
Critics of rail privatisation have warned that a hiatus in orders for new
rolling stock because of the uncertainties over the future of BR could
damage the UK rolling stock industry, which employs 30,000 people.
Plans to allow BR to lease Pounds 150m of passenger coaches in 1994-95 and
1995-96 have been brought forward one year. This means that orders can be
placed in 1993-94, and BR has been asked to draw up a shopping list. A
discussion paper will set out options for creating a leasing market for
railway rolling stock once privatisation begins.
The key, according to ministers, will be to ensure that the risk on any
leases lies with the private sector. If the public sector bears the risk,
the investment must be counted against the public sector borrowing
requirement under UK public accounting rules.
Alternative routes for the high-speed rail link between London and the
Channel tunnel were submitted to Mr MacGregor by British Rail yesterday.
Mr MacGregor is expected to announce his preferred route in March and open a
period of public consultation.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs hear of heavy sales to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN sold more machine tools to Iraq between 1987 and 1989 than
manufacturers in the US, Italy and France put together, Mr John Major told
MPs last night.
In a written answer to a question originally tabled on November 24 by Mr
Phillip Oppenheim, Tory MP for Amber Valley, Mr Major indicated that British
machine tool sales to Saddam Hussein's regime totalled nearly Dollars 93m
over the period in question.
That compared with Dollars 42m-worth of equipment sold by Italy, Dollars
16.8m by France and Dollars 11.7m by the US. British sales peaked at more
than Dollars 63m in 1988, the year a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war was
agreed.
When called upon in the past to defend sales of possible dual-use equipment
such as machine tools, government officials have argued that if Britain did
not agree to export the goods, other countries would.
The government appointed Lord Justice Scott to head an independent judicial
inquiry into arms sales to Iraq in the wake of the Matrix Churchill affair.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: IRA tactics futile, claims Mayhew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE within the IRA for an end to violence is growing, Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday.
Leaders of the republican terrorist organisation knew no British government,
either Labour or Conservative, would talk to those who resort to violence,
Sir Patrick said.
He added: 'There is no way out. I believe the Provisional IRA's leaders
increasingly realise this, and many of them wisely want to stop.'
Sir Patrick's comments, which voiced publicly what the Northern Ireland
Office has long sought to argue in private, followed a speech before
Christmas setting out the benefits that would arise if terrorists in the
province renounced violence.
He wants to portray himself as a neutral referee between aspirations of
Unionist and nationalists aspirations while keeping pressure on terrorists.
Sir Patrick said fresh political talks on the province's future would
re-start once the new Irish government was in place. The last initiative
collapsed in November.
Speaking at the Belfast Rotary Club, Sir Patrick said that security forces
had to strike a balance. Those calling for even tighter security, had to
consider, whether, 'they are content to see all normal, commercial life
strangled, to say nothing of the implicit but unjustifiable condemnation of
the entire Catholic community.'
But he said the IRA faced, 'further fruitless years . . they feel driven by
their dead and by those 'behind the wire'. I must tell them that unless they
abandon violence there will be more dead, more lives spent behind the wire,
and another blighted generation.'

FT  12 JAN 93 / Building boost predicted for next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CONSTRUCTION activity is expected to decline again this year
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
reaching a low point in the second half - but will rise modestly next year
as house building recovers with the slow improvement expected for the
economy, the joint forecasting committee for the construction industries
predicted yesterday.
The committee estimated that output had fallen 6 per cent last year to
Pounds 29.9bn at 1985 prices, and it expected a further 2 per cent fall this
year followed by a 1.5 per cent rise next year.
The forecast, published by Construction Forecasting &amp; Research, is the first
the committee has compiled independently of the National Economic
Development Office, which was abolished last month.
The forecast estimated that the value of new work fell 11 per cent between
1990 and 1992 to Pounds 17.8bn at 1985 prices.
The fall last year was estimated at 4.5 per cent compared with the 7.5 per
cent fall forecast six months ago. The change is due to a much higher
estimate of output for social housing and a revamped assessment of the
workload in the private industrial sector.
The committee pointed out, however, that expressing the reduction in the
volume of work in 1985 prices masked the figure for loss of work in current
prices. 'It is the latter which matters to firms large and small right
across the country, and it is estimated at 20 per cent in the past two
years,' it said. 'This highlights the extent to which the recession in the
industry has forced prices down.'
A further 4 per cent downturn in new work was forecast for this year, with
another considerable fall in private non-residential construction only
partly offset by increases in housing and public non-housing output. New
work was predicted to rise by 1 per cent next year based on further
increases in housing output.
The committee commented that the sole measure in the government's Autumn
Statement that benefited construction was the release of Pounds 750m to
housing associations to buy 16,000 homes by the end of the financial year.
The forecasts for this year show variations between construction sectors.
Public and private housing output were both predicted to rise 10 per cent
this year and 11 per cent and 12 per cent respectively next year.
The outlook for private commercial work remained gloomy, the committee
believed, mainly because of the surplus of offices.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Thorny questions for pension group: The issue of surpluses
is taxing the review body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURPLUS in a pension fund might be compared to the rise in the value of a
house, Professor Roy Goode, chairman of the committee reviewing pensions
law, suggested yesterday.
And a bank should no more be expected to surrender some of the value of its
collateral than a member of a pension scheme should be expected to surrender
some of the value of his collateral, he suggested.
Such a surplus could be seen as the employees' guarantee that the promised
pension-fund benefits would be delivered, he said.
'When a scheme is ongoing, is not the surplus the security for future
pension payments?' Prof Goode asked.
The comparison was made during public hearings yesterday when the committee
questioned Sir Brian Corby, president of the Confederation of British
Industry.
Prof Goode's remarks may offer some insights into the line the Pension Law
Review Committee could take in tackling two of the thorniest questions
facing government policymakers. First, how far should the law go towards
protecting the expectations of scheme members? Second, once contributions
have been made to a fund, to whom do they belong?
The CBI has indicated that employers will resist legislation preventing them
extracting surpluses for their own benefit. The future willingness of
employers to sponsor the kind of final-salary benefits which prevail in the
best occupational pension schemes 'depends on the kind of recommendations
you make', Sir Brian told the committee.
But he indicated that the CBI saw merit in some of the complaints voiced by
employee groups about the present legal framework for pension funds. For
instance, he said, there was an argument for the view that scheme members
had some right to surpluses.
'Employees who have contributed to a scheme should expect as a matter of
good practice to participate in a contributions holiday,' he said, referring
to the common practice of employers halting their contributions to pension
funds when there are big surpluses.
Moreover, he said, it was good practice for larger pension schemes to
include employee representation on the board of trustees. But the CBI
opposes legislation to impose either of these changes.
Prof Goode said that the message received so far by his committee, both from
pension-scheme members and plan sponsors, is that no one wants legislation
which discourages employers from making pension provision. But the point at
which employers will throw in the towel and cut off benefits remains
unclear.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Too much stress 'bad for business'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PART OF the secret of a healthy workforce may be encouraging staff to work
less hard, a director of Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, ICI's drugs division, said
yesterday.
Mr Barrie Thorpe, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals production director, told a London
conference on mental health at work that establishing sensible workloads for
staff was one way the company had tackled stress-related illness.
He said a letter had been sent from the Zeneca Pharmaceuticals chief
executive officer to departmental heads. It said: 'If work takes up more
than a reasonable proportion of an individual's time over too long a period,
the business is unlikely to benefit in the long run.'
It added that while some stress is good for both individuals and the
business, leading to job satisfaction, motivation and good performance, 'too
much or inappropriate pressure on people who are unable to cope with it is
bad for them and bad for the business'.
The letter drew attention to the importance of hobbies and holidays, adding:
'The sensible planning and allocation of work within your department is a
vital factor in maximising efficiency.'
Mr Thorpe said some senior executives had felt threatened by the idea that
employees might be told to work less hard, and there had been 'genuine fear'
that company performance could be affected. 'It will come as no surprise to
those involved in organisational development work that this was not the
case,' he added, 'and indeed it seems likely the reverse occurred.'
Earlier, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, told delegates: 'A
company of 1,000 employees can expect between 200 and 300 with depression
and anxiety in any one year, and one suicide every decade.'
Mrs Bottomley, who underlined her commitment to the policy of providing care
for the mentally ill in the community rather than in institutions, said:
'Six million people suffer from mental illness each year. It is as common as
heart disease.'

FT  12 JAN 93 / North-east shows signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS THAT the economy of north-eastern England is heading for an upturn
have been supported by the 1992 survey of the results of companies based in
the area, published yesterday by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm.
Of 17 plcs in the region that announced results covering the year as far as
September 30, 12 reported increased turnover and 10 increased pre-tax
profit.
Excluding Barratt Developments, the housebuilder, the aggregate pre-tax
profit of Pounds 231.7m in the results of the companies for 1992 was 10.2
per cent up on the previous year.
Including Barratt, which turned a loss of Pounds 105.9m reported in 1991
into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 11.3m in the year to June 30 1992, the
increase was 146 per cent. Excluding Barratt, turnover rose 6.5 per cent.
The survey suggests that the long-term decline in the number of plcs with
headquarters in the region - a trend which has aroused concern about a loss
of decision-making power - has stabilised.
The survey says that the impact of the recession in 1991 was demonstrated
strikingly by a 51 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 111m from
Pounds 227m in 1990.
Problems at Barratt and MTM, the chemicals producer, were significant
factors. But increased dividend payments in 1991 by 13 of the companies  -
including four which recorded lower 1991 pre-tax profits - were a clear
statement of confidence.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Consumer credit growth slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER borrowing rose only modestly in November, indicating that people
are still cautious about taking on new debts.
Official figures released yesterday showed that consumers borrowed a net
Pounds 15m from lenders in November, substantially down from the Pounds 76m
borrowed in October.
The increase in the November figure disappointed economists' expectations of
a more substantial rise.
The latest figure took the total rise in credit in the three months to the
end of November to Pounds 31m compared with net repayments of Pounds 13m in
the three months to the end of August.
The small rise in November supports evidence that interest rate cuts in
September and October failed to stimulate a rapid recovery in consumer
spending. Retail sales figures out last month showed that November was a
poor month for retailers.
The Treasury pointed out that the latest credit business figures do not
reflect the most recent cut in interest rates - which took place in mid
November. It added that consumers appeared to be borrowing at a 'steady
rate' while making a 'prudent reduction' in their debts. The seasonally
adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office also show that in
November the amount of new credit advanced to consumers by finance houses,
building societies and credit cards which are part of the Visa or Mastercard
system was Pounds 4.01bn - slightly higher than in October when it was
Pounds 3.83bn. The credit business figures do not include mortgages and
account for only about 15 per cent of total private-sector debt.
The sluggishness of consumer borrowing in recent months underlines
expectations for a slow economic recovery as consumers, worried by rising
unemployment, continue to make debt repayment a priority.
A breakdown of the latest figures shows a sharp fall in net lending by
finance houses, small net repayment on loans by building societies and no
change in the amount of debt outstanding on credit cards.
Commenting on the figures, Mr Michael Saunders, economist at Salomon
Brothers said: 'In the coming months, consumer credit could rise slightly as
the effects of recent mortgage rate cuts feed through to household budgets,
but credit will remain sluggish compared with the surge in credit that
occurred during the 1980s.'

FT  12 JAN 93 / Effect of benefits move 'hard to assess'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNRELIABLE figures for the take-up of social security benefits make it
impossible to tell if there has been any improvement since the system was
reformed five years ago, the Department of Social Security said yesterday.
Government officials believe the first figures since the reforms of 1988
show no evidence of any significant change in take-up levels. But the
department said different benefit rules and the poor quality of statistics
meant comparisons were 'not meaningful'.
The results are a setback for ministers who had hoped the reforms, which
were intended to increase the targeting of benefits and make claiming
easier, would lead to noticeable improvements.
The figures took three years to compile - about 18 months longer than normal
because of the backlog of work facing DSS statisticians.
Plans for a new 'family resources survey' sponsored by the department should
lead to more accurate figures later this decade.
Yesterday's results show that, in 1989, 90 per cent of available cash was
claimed and that 80 per cent of people entitled to income-related benefits
claimed them.
For housing benefit, 83 per cent of those entitled to claim are estimated to
have taken up the benefit - suggesting a slight rise on figures for 1987.
Similarly, take-up figures for family credit suggest a small increase to
about 57 per cent compared with the family income supplement it replaced.
Take-up of income support, at about 75 per cent, apparently fell in
comparison with its predecessor, supplementary benefit.
Labour described the figures as very disturbing, especially after fierce
criticism of the social security system by the National Audit Office.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Change proposed for workplace childcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVISION of childcare by employers remains scarce, but there may be a trend
towards targeting it according to the needs of the business, the independent
research group Incomes Data Services suggests.
Its study of 22 organisations says many employers allocate childcare places
on a first-come-first-served basis. It points out that this has drawbacks:
'Nursery provision is expensive and only a limited number of places will be
available. From the employer's viewpoint it is preferable to target this
expensive benefit where it would have the most impact.' The study says
Midland Bank allocates nursery places according to staff skills while
Sainsbury, the supermarket chain, gives priority to retail staff.
Employers also look at social factors such as the needs of single or
disabled parents.
IDS says that employers have a variety of approaches, which 'range from
full-scale workplace nurseries and childcare allowances to holiday
playschemes for school-age children and some referral services to help
working parents identify suitable childcare facilities'.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Road in City row is put on sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE controversial scheme to redevelop the Mappin &amp; Webb site near the Bank
of England has moved a step nearer after a decision by the Corporation of
London to sell Bucklersbury, a road adjoining the site, Vanessa Houlder
writes.
The future of the road has attracted attention because of a dispute over its
ownership and because of opposition to its closure, which is necessary for
the proposed redevelopment of the site.
The corporation's agreement in principle to the sale of Bucklersbury, likely
to fetch around Pounds 300,000, may help it reach an early settlement in a
dispute over the road's ownership.

FT  12 JAN 93 / BCCI High Court hearing postponed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH Court hearing to consider whether a meeting should be called in the
UK for creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
has been postponed until Friday.
Touche Ross, the UK liquidator of BCCI SA, one of the two banking arms of
BCCI, has asked for a court direction about whether a creditors' meeting
should be held to elect a liquidators' committee. BCCI SA, which carried out
much of its business in the UK, has about 140,000 creditors.
Mr Christopher Morris, the senior UK liquidator of BCCI, said an undertaking
to hold a creditors' meeting had been given before the formal liquidation
took effect. 'Only after giving that undertaking were the true attendant
problems of doing it totally evident,' he added.
'Obviously we wish to comply with our undertaking. The purpose of going to
court on Friday is to explain those difficulties connected with calling a
meeting and to seek the court's directions on certain matters connected with
the meeting. It's not to try and avoid the undertaking.'

FT  12 JAN 93 / Warning on funds for elderly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUNDING problems in providing residential care for the elderly are likely to
become 'significantly worse' when the government's community care reforms
are introduced in April, the charity Methodist Homes for the Aged said
yesterday.
Methodist Homes, one of Britain's biggest charitable providers of
residential care, warned that 'both the quality and the availability of
appropriate care may be under threat' from lack of funding.
Funding through social security payments to accommodate elderly people in
residential homes has risen from Pounds 10m in 1979 to about Pounds 2.5bn.
Methodist Homes says government support has nevertheless not kept pace with
actual care costs. The charity spends Pounds 400,000 a year subsidising
social-security-funded residents in its homes.
Methodist Homes said the problem was likely to worsen after April, when
councils become responsible for assessing individuals' care needs. There
will be greater emphasis on providing domiciliary rather than residential
care.
'Some local authorities have indicated that charges for residential care
should be in line with income support levels, despite the fact that
residential care in the future is likely to be reserved for more dependent
elderly people who will need a higher level of care,' said Mr David Wigley,
chief executive of Methodist Homes.
'Other local authorities are indicating that they will be prepared to pay
higher charges, but still short of the true cost of providing care for very
dependent people.'
Methodist Homes says it will not drop its standards of care but fears
private sector providers may be forced to. The charity says the need to
continue subsidising residents means it will abandon plans to build new
facilities unless it can raise an additional Pounds 3m over the next three
years. homes in

FT  12 JAN 93 / Freshfields heads league of takeover advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESHFIELDS, the City of London solicitors' firm, has emerged as the leading
adviser to companies and financial advisers involved in UK public takeovers
in 1992.
The firm was involved in 14 UK public bids with a combined value of Pounds
4.94bn, according to a league table ranking lawyers by the value of
takeovers in which they acted as advisers.
The table produced by Acquisitions Monthly magazine shows that the four
leading firms finished the year comfortably ahead of the rest. Norton Rose
was second for its role in 14 deals with a combined value of Pounds 4.54bn,
Linklaters &amp; Paines third with 15 deals worth Pounds 4.47bn and Clifford
Chance fourth with nine deals worth Pounds 3.89bn.
All four owe their rankings to their involvement in either the Pounds 3.7bn
Hongkong and Shanghai/Midland Bank deal or the Pounds 3.1bn merger between
Reed International and the Dutch publisher Elsevier.
Freshfields' top ranking confirms its position as the leading mergers and
acquisitions law firm, having finished second in 1991 and first in 1990.
The firm has strong links with merchant banks and acted for financial
advisers in six deals worth Pounds 1.54bn last year. Notably, it acted for
Barclays de Zoete Wedd on Tomkins' Pounds 933m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall
and for Baring Brothers on TI's Pounds 469 takeover of Dowty.
Slaughter and May, by contrast, slipped to seventh place last year after
finishing first in 1991.
The 20 most active UK law firms - acting for companies as opposed to
financial advisers - were involved in 92 UK public takeovers in 1992 with a
combined value of Pounds 23bn compared with 145 deals worth Pounds 15bn in
1991, 200 deals worth Pounds 24bn in 1990 and 263 deals worth Pounds 137bn
in 1989. This demonstrates the steep decline in merger and acquisition
activity since the end of the 1980s.

<TEXT>
MR GORDON LAYTON, chief executive of National Car Parks, yesterday denied
taking part in a conspiracy to defraud rival company Europarks.
Appearing at the preliminary hearing of an Old Bailey trial expected to last
several weeks, Mr Layton and Mr Simon Hewitt, a security specialist, pleaded
not guilty to conspiring between January 1987 and November 1989 to defraud
Europarks by dishonestly acquiring information relating to Europarks'
financial affairs.
Both men are alleged, along with two former Army officers, to have sought
the information with the intention of using it for the commercial benefit of
NCP, putting Europarks at risk.
The court dealt with legal argument yesterday after the jury was sworn in.
The trial is expected to open formally next week.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Court plea on pit pay fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINERS FROM two of the 10 collieries that are closing under the government's
pit closure programme lost a court action yesterday to win bonuses on top of
basic pay, Richard Donkin writes.
The case was brought by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers on behalf of
miners at Silverhill and Cotgrave pits in Nottinghamshire, where coal
production has stopped.
The union argued that miners at the two pits, and at eight other collieries
facing closure, should be given bonus payments and shift allowances as well
as basic pay for the period they have been laid off.
The union believed that, had the court action been successful, miners at all
10 pits could have claimed up to Pounds 2,000 in back pay from the time
production stopped last year.
The payments would not have affected redundancy terms because British Coal
has agreed to base calculations on the period up to the closure
announcements in October, when men would have been receiving bonuses.
Mr David Prendergast, UDM vice-president, said the union was disappointed by
the decision 'and we are considering grounds for appeal'.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Auntie sent to management school: The BBC faces a reshaped
bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AUNTIE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
as the BBC has been affectionately known for many decades - has been sent to
management school. Mr John Birt, the new director-general, yesterday set out
a 35-page blueprint on how to turn an institution famed for its bureaucracy,
and once likened to the Indian Civil Service, into 'a model public service.'
There will be 'focus, devolution of responsibility and involvement', Mr Birt
promised. There was a need to clear away territoriality, red tape, confusion
of purpose and strategy and organisation charts 'criss-crossed confusingly
with dotted lines'.
Mr Birt said he wanted an institution where managers never stifled
initiative or enterprise, where bureaucracy was a dirty word and where
'fudge and fix-it, hostile leaking and secretive and manipulative behaviour
become techniques and tactics of the past'.
To realise his dream, Mr Birt set out a programme for change and
reorganisation and announced new recruits to the board of management,
including Mr Bob Phillis, the chief executive of Independent Television
News, who will become deputy director-general, and Ms Liz Forgan, director
of programmes at Channel 4, who will be managing director of BBC Network
Radio. Mr Birt also announced the creation of a number of new committees.
The main structural changes include:
The streamlining of the corporate centre so its main job is to set strategy,
define policy and monitor performance.
A new directorate bringing together resources, engineering and services.
Separating programme production from commissioning and scheduling in
television and radio to reflect the move to independent producers.
A single directorate covering World Service Television and World Service
Radio.
A new, separately managed archive unit to hold the rights to BBC programmes.
Normally, these rights would be exploited by BBC Enterprises, the commercial
wing of the BBC.
Apart from his role as deputy director-general, Mr Phillis will be
responsible for World Services activities until they are merged. A new
managing director of BBC world services will report to him as will the
managing director, resources - a directorate to be run by Mr Bill Dennay
until his retirement this spring.
Mr David Hatch, managing director of BBC Radio, will become adviser to the
director-general and Mr Tony Hall, as managing director, news and current
affairs, and Ms Patricia Hodgson, as director of policy and planning, will
join the board of management.
A programme strategy review will be set up next month, chaired by Ms Forgan
and helped by Mr Alan Yentob, the BBC2 controller, to produce and publish a
programme strategy for the corporation. A programme of 'market testing of
support services' will begin, and the establishment of a review of best
practice in working methods will be followed by productivity targets.
Mr Birt is also instituting an annual performance review in every area of
activity to make the BBC more efficient and accountable.
'The annual performance review will be the flywheel that drives the BBC and
keeps us alert and self-questioning about everything we do,' he said.
Mr Ron Neil, managing director of regional broadcasting, will lead a group
to recommend how the annual performance review should work in practice and
implement it.
Managing directors will examine the scope for rationalising programme
departments in radio and television - the bi-media approach - and within the
next few months a commercial policy framework for the BBC will be published.
Asked if the new committees were not the very essence of the bureaucracy he
had vowed to end, Mr Birt said: 'Bureaucracy is what you have when you have
very unclear lines of responsibility.
'You need people to sit astride a wide range of functions. It was very
necessary in the eastern bloc because of the absence of anything else. All
we are doing is clarification.'

FT  12 JAN 93 / Court told of 'simple' Pounds 5.2m Guinness theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR THOMAS Ward, the US lawyer and former Guinness director, laid the ground
for the theft of Pounds 5.2m from the company after its successful takeover
bid for Distillers in 1986, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Opening the prosecution at the start of the final Guinness trial, Mr Victor
Temple alleged that Mr Ward sought and obtained the co-operation of Mr
Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman and chief executive, who lent
his direct assistance to the dishonest enterprise.
Mr Ward faces one charge of stealing Pounds 5.2m from Guinness and single
charges of false accounting and procuring the execution of a valuable
security in relation to the alleged theft. He denies all the charges.
Mr Temple said Mr Ward and Mr Saunders had been friends and confidants for a
number of years. Mr Ward was Mr Saunders' principal adviser and had joined
the Guinness board in January 1985.
After Guinness won its bitter takeover battle with Argyll to take control of
Distillers, the company had to pay its advisers.
Mr Temple said the chances that any particular invoice would be checked were
remote and both Mr Ward and Mr Saunders were sufficiently powerful to be
able to deflect any queries that might arise.
This allowed the two men, doubtless motivated by greed, to put into effect a
simple, clever and effective joint enterprise to steal the Pounds 5.2m, he
said.
Through the submission of a false invoice the money was paid to Marketing
and Acquisition Consultants, a Jersey-based company controlled by Mr Ward.
Guinness's strategy during the takeover was decided by a committee of three
directors - Mr Saunders, Mr Ward and Mr Olivier Roux, the company's finance
director.
Mr Temple said Mr Roux would appear as the prosecution's principal witness.
There would be a 'head-on clash' between his evidence and Mr Ward's version
of events, he told the jury.
The trial, which is expected to last about three months, continues today.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Installations at 30,000 a week: FT Satellite Monitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW installations of satellite dishes last month ran at more than 30,000 a
week for the first three weeks, Continental Research said yesterday.
The monthly FT Satellite Monitor produced by Continental shows a total of
120,000 new sales and rentals of satellite dishes during December.
However, there was a large drop from nearly 250,000 householders in November
who said they would definitely install satellite television to 68,000 last
month, although 1.89m householders said they probably would.
Continental Research, which has interviewed more than 4,000 adults every
month for nearly four years, believes 2.596m homes have satellite dishes.
This figure - which does not include homes receiving satellite channels by
communal aerials or cable television - shows little overall growth. This is
because Continental has this month removed 120,000 from the total to reflect
the fact that the satellite which served the defunct British Satellite
Broadcasting was switched off last month.
Continental believes the total of those receiving satellite channels by any
means is 3.098m.
Barb, which produces the official television ratings in the UK, believes
that on January 1 there were a total of 2.297m homes with satellite dishes
in the UK, 299,000 fewer than Continental estimates.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a substantial stake in BSkyB, the
largest satellite broadcaster in the UK.

INVESCO MIM, the fund management company, is under investigation by
regulators and expects to face disciplinary proceedings.
In a letter sent yesterday to shareholders in City and Commercial Investment
Trust, an investment trust managed by Invesco MIM, the directors of the
trust said: 'The directors of City and Commercial. . . have discussed with
Invesco MIM an investigation which the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (Imro) is undertaking with Invesco MIM. The outcome of this
inquiry is unknown but it is considered likely that it will result in some
form of disciplinary process against Invesco MIM.'
City and Commercial shareholders are shortly to approve a reorganisation of
the investment trust, which is approaching its wind-up date. The
investigation and probable disciplinary proceedings are considered material
information which must be given to shareholders.
The information was not disclosed in the original prospectus sent to
shareholders in December, but City and Commercial's directors decided to
release the information after taking legal advice.
Officials at Invesco MIM would not comment yesterday. The investigation is
believed to involve a general review of all the company's internal
procedures and controls, and to have begun about a year ago.
Imro is believed to have notified Invesco MIM in the second half of last
year that it was likely to be the subject of disciplinary proceedings.
In October 1991 Invesco MIM was fined Pounds 75,000 by Imro for poor
administration of personal equity plans. It is also the subject of a writ by
trustees of the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme, a portion of whose
assets it managed, in connection with the disappearance of more than Pounds
11m in assets via unusual stock lending deals.
Last autumn Invesco MIM became the first UK fund manager to pay compensation
to shareholders for mismanagement of an investment trust in its charge. It
paid Pounds 9.5m to shareholders in Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust.
The compensation stemmed from Invesco MIM's decision to invest Pounds 43m in
a troubled company and its failure to disclose the extent of that investment
to Drayton's shareholders and directors.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Rules change will help film industry cut tax bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FILM-MAKERS will be be allowed to apply new techniques of accounting to help
reduce their tax bills under guidelines issued by the Inland Revenue
yesterday.
An updated statement of practice for the film industry shows that it will be
able to write off costs against tax far more quickly than current
regulations permit, and to improve cashflow.
The statement lays down rules first promised in the 1992 Budget. They are
designed to boost the British film industry and to bring it in line with the
more generous tax allowances permitted in other countries.
It provides details of what expenses will be eligible for accelerated
relief, and the time limits on applying for tax relief under the new
arrangements.
The statement permits pre-production or preliminary expenses to be written
off pound-for-pound against tax as they are incurred.
Previously these could be set against tax only when a decision had been
taken on whether a film would be made, which could be one or more tax years
later.
To be eligible these preliminary expenses must be reasonably said to have
been made to enable a decision to be taken on whether or not to go ahead
with the film.
The statement also allows film companies to write off all production costs
in three years at 33.3 per cent a year. That compares with the previous 25
per cent a year of remaining costs for capital expenditure, and over the
life of the film for revenue costs.
Film companies wishing to adopt the new methods must make a claim in writing
to the local inspector of taxes within two years of the completion of the
film.
To be eligible films must be qualified as British or EC-based by the
Department of National Heritage under the 1985 Films Act.
The film industry has in the past said that it is at a disadvantage to other
sectors because it has to incur so many costs long before it receives the
revenues on films. That has made it extremely difficult for independent
companies to operate.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Scotland wins Pounds 12m Mitsubishi factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Electric, the Japanese consumer products group, is to set up a
Pounds 12m factory in Livingston, West Lothian, to make air conditioners.
The 95,000 sq ft plant will employ 200 people.
It will open early next year, bringing to 1,700 the number of people
Mitsubishi Electric employs in Scotland. The Japanese company makes video
recorders at Livingston and televisions at Haddington, East Lothian. Its
Apricot Computers subsidiary manufactures personal computers at Glenrothes,
Fife.
Mitsubishi Electric's other European plants are in Dublin and Croydon,
Surrey.
The plant will manufacture air conditioners for the European market. As
Britain is not a strong market for air conditioners the Scottish inward
investment body, Locate in Scotland, regards Mitsubishi Electric's decision
to choose Scotland as a coup.
Sir Peter Parker, chairman of Mitsubishi Electric UK, said Scotland had been
chosen 'because we feel at home here'.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Unreliable benefit figures mask system's efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNRELIABLE figures for the take-up of social security benefits up make it
impossible to tell if there has been any improvement since the system was
reformed five years ago, the Department of Social Security said yesterday.
Government officials believe the first figures since the reforms of 1988
show no evidence of any significant change in take-up levels. But the
department said different benefit rules and the poor quality of statistics
meant comparisons were 'not meaningful'.
The results are a setback for ministers who had hoped the reforms, intended
to increase the targeting of benefits and make claiming easier, would lead
to noticeable improvements.
The figures took three years to compile - about 18 months longer than normal
because of the backlog of work facing DSS statisticians.
Plans for a new 'family resources survey' sponsored by the department should
lead to more accurate figures later this decade.
Yesterday's results show that in 1989, 90 per cent of available cash was
claimed and that 80 per cent people entitled to income-related benefits
claimed them.
The discrepancy between the two figures is almost certainly because many
non-claimants would have been entitled to only small amounts.
For housing benefit, 83 per cent of those entitled to claim are estimated to
have taken up the benefit - suggesting a slight rise on figures for 1987.
Similarly, take-up figures for family credit suggest a small increase to
about 57 per cent compared with the family income supplement it replaced.
Take-up of income support, at about 75 per cent, apparently fell in
comparison with its predecessor, supplementary benefit.
The DSS, however, says the figures for income support are unreliable while
estimates by the Policy Studies Institute, the independent research body,
suggest a higher take-up of family credit than recorded in the department's
estimates.
Comparisons with the pre-reform regime are particularly difficult because
statisticians cannot assume the same margin of error from year to year.
However, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, yesterday described
the take-up figures as encouragingly high.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Business clients still critical of banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are still 'substantial weaknesses' in the relationship between banks
and their small-business customers, says a survey published yesterday by the
Forum of Private Business, the lobby group.
Poor communication between banks and small businesses may make it difficult
for enterprises to raise funds for expansion when the economy recovers,
according to the survey of more than 6,000 businesses.
Forty per cent of business owners said the banks did not understand small
companies.
Scottish banks won a more favourable rating from their customers than their
English counterparts. Barclays won the highest marks among the English
banks, while Lloyds scored lowest.
The survey by Nottingham University said banks were starting to
differentiate their services more. It found no backing for claims that banks
had not passed on the benefit of cuts in base rates to small companies.
In spite of banks' efforts to improve relations with small companies by
drawing up charters or codes of practice, there was no change in the issues
highest on businesses' concerns - account charges, interest rates and the
need to provide collateral.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Resistance to job relocation 'growing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEE resistance to job relocation is growing, mainly because of the
difficulties of selling homes and the reluctance of partners to give up
their jobs and move, according to a survey published yesterday.
Nearly 40 per cent of the 251 companies surveyed said a working spouse
'presented a key inhibitor to relocation'. A third mentioned concern about
children's education and just more than a quarter quoted family ties and
roots as reasons for reluctance to move with the company.
Ms Sue Shortland, head of the Confederation of British Industry's relocation
group, said: 'The issue of the working partner will increase with more women
working and more dual-income families.'
She added that it was not only the temporary loss of income that caused
problems but also the damage to the partner's career, promotion and income
potential.
The current property price slump is the most serious barrier to relocation.
As many as 44 per cent of the sample said inability to sell their home
inhibited them from being moved to another part of the country by their
employer.
The survey, published by the CBI and Black Horse Relocation Services,
suggests that employers are not doing all they can to deal with the
relocation problems of their workers. While four out of five companies
sampled said they were trying to resolve the difficulties of moving home
with financial assistance, fewer than a third were doing anything to help
working partners find a new job.
When asked how employees' needs for relocation support would change in the
next three years, as many as 24 per cent said the requirements of working
spouses would become more important while 10 per cent mentioned the slump in
the property market and a further 7 per cent 'negative equity problems'.
More than half of the companies surveyed were in the manufacturing sector.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Argentina whets foreign appetites: Companies rush to pick up
pieces of a dismantled public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Argentina dismantles almost its entire public sector, foreign companies
are diving in to pick up the pieces.
In little more than three years, the government has privatised 51 companies,
raising Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in cash, cancelling Dollars 12bn of
foreign debt and transferring Dollars 1.3bn of financial liabilities to the
buyers of privatised companies. It has also won commitments from the
companies' new managements for investment programmes averaging Dollars 4bn a
year up to the turn of the century.
In doing so, it has attracted respected international companies to run
privatised corporations which have suffered from a lack of investment and
years of neglect. British Gas distributes gas in Buenos Aires, France
Telecom operates the telephones in the northern half of the country and
Chilean companies generate electricity.
Foreign companies' incursions into Argentina, an economy suffering
hyperinflation a little over three years ago, often reflect wider
international strategies. British Gas, which holds 29 per cent of Metrogas,
the new Buenos Aires gas distributor, aims to expand substantially its
overseas operations, which contributed 10 per cent of the group's 1991
profit of Pounds 921m.
Mr Peter Lehmann, who headed the Metrogas acquisition, says Argentina
represented an unusual opportunity to enter a large but under-developed gas
market. Metrogas, with forecast annual turnover of Dollars 600m, will be
among the world's larger distribution companies, yet it also offers
significant growth opportunities.
Improved maintenance, billing, and marketing techniques at all privatised
companies can easily yield profits well in excess of the 12-16 per cent
yield on Argentine government debt, the benchmark investment.
The risks are still substantial, particularly if today's reasonably stable
economy suddenly deteriorated. However, buyers think the government has set
the prices they can charge high enough to fund investments and has also
linked them to the dollar, reducing inflation and devaluation risks.
Foreign investors also hope that participation of a wide group of foreign
companies reduces the risks of any arbitrary rule changes for foreign
companies. One foreign executive said: 'A government will think twice before
intervening in a way that could upset foreign governments.'
However one big early privatisation is already in trouble. The national
airline, Aerolineas Argentinas, was privatised in 1990 - before a raft of
changes to clean up the privatisation programme introduced by the
reform-minded economy minister Domingo Cavallo. Spain's state-owned Iberia
took 30 per cent.
Government officials are now threatening to scrap the sale and start again
from scratch because they say Iberia is not running Aerolineas properly.
Last July, the government also had to take the place of Iberia's minority
local partners when they failed to come up with the capital they were
committed to inject into the struggling company.
This has heightened concerns that the Argentine companies active in the
privatisations as minority partners have paid too much for their assets and
are financially overextended. This is denied by the companies.
Mr Roberto Roca, president of Techint, a big industrial group, says he is
not overstretched despite having spent Dollars 533m on large minority stakes
in a railway, highway toll concessions, a steel mill, an electricity
generator, a telephone network, oilfields and a gas company. He says
Techint's debts of Dollars 450m are only one-third of the group's net worth,
but does expect to increase debt by Dollars 100m a year.
Mr Oscar Vicente, vice president of Perez Companc, Argentina's largest
industrial conglomerate, says his company doubled its net worth to Dollars
1.9bn by buying Dollars 876.9m-worth of state assets. All the same, he says
Perez Companc only took on debts of Dollars 350m, and promises that gearing
will always remain 'exceptionally low'.
Although the trade unions, while subdued, are still powerful, dealing with
the legal and regulatory systems could be the privatised companies' biggest
problem. Argentina's civil service has never shown much honesty or
competence, and the concept of regulatory bodies independent of government
policy is alien.
The government has created regulatory agencies to supervise the telephone,
gas and electricity services. However, only the telecommunications
regulatory commission is actually functioning. The gas and electricity
regulators have not all been appointed yet.
The agencies are meant to be independent of government and their boards
appointed for fixed terms. Yet in 1991 Mr Cavallo sacked the entire
telecommunications commission board for incompetence, replacing them with
his own appointees.
The privatisation process still has some way to go. The government will soon
begin floating off residual minority shareholdings in privatised companies,
worth an estimated Dollars 2bn.
And this year will see the beginning of the biggest privatisation of them
all: the sale of 70 per cent of YPF, the national oil company and
Argentina's largest company, worth in total over Dollars 8.5bn.
There is a growing debate over the government's decision to sell YPF as a
single unit, rather than breaking it into separate business units as it did
to ensure competition in the electricity and gas industries.
There is one big government asset that is not on the privatisation agenda -
at least in the foreseeable future: Banco de la Nacion Argentina, the
government-owned commercial bank and the country's largest financial
institution. Officials say they need it because it enables them to oversee
and put pressure on the private financial system.
This is an explanation received sceptically by some in Buenos Aires, who
believe that now that the central bank is independent, the government still
wants an arm for discreet borrowing and financial support operations.

FT  12 JAN 93 / US court rejects Mozer plea deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US government prosecutors said yesterday they would proceed with a formal
indictment against Mr Paul Mozer, the former head bond trader at Salomon
Brothers, the Wall Street brokerage house, on charges relating to
allegations that he submitted false customer bids in auctions of government
securities.
The decision to pursue the indictment follows yesterday's rejection by a New
York judge of a plea agreement drawn up by Mr Mozer's lawyers and federal
prosecutors.
Mr Mozer was due to plead guilty yesterday morning to two felony counts of
making false statements to government authorities about fake bids he
submitted at a February 1991 auction of Treasury securities.
A last-minute hitch over the wording of a document filed by the US attorneys
along with the plea agreement, however, brought the proceedings to a halt.
Mr Stanley Arkin, Mr Mozer's lawyer, argued that language used in the
document, which outlined the background to the case, had not been part of
the plea agreement and could be interpreted as a more serious charge of mail
or wire fraud.
Mr Mozer's lawyers were especially worried that if they accepted the
contents of the document they would be putting themselves at a disadvantage
in a number of private civil suits.
When Mr Mozer's lawyers and the prosecutors were unable to come up with a
new agreement yesterday, Judge Robert Patterson ruled that there were still
too many issues outstanding for him to accept the plea bargain. One of those
issues was the question of whether Mr Mozer could still face an indictment
on criminal anti-trust violations.
Unless the two sides can reach a new agreement the judge's decision means
that Mr Mozer will have to defend himself against criminal charges while
also facing several private civil cases, as well as a broader civil suit
filed last month by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleges
Mr Mozer submitted false bids in seven Treasury auctions, and that he
violated record-keeping regulations, committed fraud, and indulged in
insider-trading.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Judge refuses to drop fraud charges against Clifford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW YORK state judge yesterday refused to dismiss a fraud and bribery
indictment against Mr Clark Clifford, the 86-year-old former US defence
secretary, in connection with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
(BCCI) scandal.
Mr Clifford's lawyers had made the request because of his heart condition.
But Judge John Bradley said the medical testimony was 'conflicting' and the
trial of Mr Clifford, and of Mr Robert Altman, his law partner, should go
ahead on February 15.
The judge concluded that Mr Clifford was 'trying to manipulate the criminal
justice system to his own advantage,' but left open the possibility of
delaying his trial by separating it from Mr Altman's.
Mr Clifford and Mr Altman resigned in August 1991 as chairman and president
of First American Bankshares, a leading Washington bank, and were charged in
New York last July with fraud, bribery and allegedly concealing from US
banking regulators their knowledge of BCCI's secret control of First
American.
Judge Bradley dismissed broader conspiracy charges against Mr Clifford, on
the grounds that the legal time limit had expired.
Referring to the remaining criminal charges, the judge said that after
reading 9,500 pages of the underlying Grand Jury minutes he had the
impression 'that the evidence of guilt is overwhelming'.
The judge said Mr Clifford had an obligation to appear on Thursday in New
York for a pre-trial hearing, but could waive his right to appear on health
grounds.
Mr Clifford's lawyers have been trying for months either to delay the trial
or have the case dismissed. But aides to Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan
district attorney who has spearheaded BCCI prosecutions in the US, have
argued that Mr Clifford should stand trial.
Both he and Mr Altman also face a separate indictment in Washington on
charges of allegedly lying to federal banking regulators about their
knowledge of BCCI's secret ownership of First American.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Perot's return fires talk of White House ambition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROSS PEROT yesterday relaunched his grassroots national political
organisation, United We Stand America, by inviting anybody willing to pay
Dollars 15 to sign up as a member.
Just 10 weeks after capturing the votes of nearly one in five Americans as
the independent candidate in the presidential election, the Texas
billionaire said the organisation's aim was closely to monitor the
performance of the new administration and Congress in cutting the budget
deficit and improving the nation's economic and social infrastructure.
Mr Perot has adopted a low profile since November but his Dallas press
conference yesterday marked the start of a round of television talk shows,
and which will inevitably revive talk about his ambitions for 1996.
He insisted the organisation would remain non-partisan. However, a US
syndicated newspaper column yesterday raised the possibility that Mr Perot
could contest the 1996 election on the Republican ticket.
The Evans and Novak article, admittedly speculative, noted a recent meeting
in Philadelphia between Mr Perot, Mr Robert Dole, the Senate minority
leader, and Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican, during which
Mr Perot spoke of 'revitalising' the opposition party.
'Since another third-party Perot run for president would scarcely revitalise
the GOP,' the columnists wrote, 'the inference from the meeting is that the
lifelong political independent from Texas might don Republican colours'.
Mr Perot and Senator Dole are on reasonably good terms. Mr Dole is also
engaged in a struggle for hegemony in the Republican party, particularly
against the group of 'bleeding heart' conservatives led by Mr Jack Kemp, the
outgoing housing secretary with naked presidential ambitions.
Mr Kemp, along with Mr William Bennett, the former education secretary, and
Mr Vin Weber, who resigned as a congressman last year, will today set up a
political organisation designed, in part, to appeal to Perot voters. Mr
Bennett told Evans and Novak: 'We should ignore him and go for his people.'
Mr Perot, whose animosity towards President George Bush was conspicuous last
year, yesterday declined to speculate on his longer term plans. He was,
however, critical of the nomination of Mr Ron Brown as commerce secretary
because of his career as a lobbyist. Mr Brown might be 'a fine man,' he
said, but he represented all 'we know to be wrong' in Washington.

FT  12 JAN 93 / IADB launches Latin America investment fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The InterAmerican Development Bank yesterday launched its much-delayed
Multilateral Investment Fund to promote private sector investment, financial
market deregulation and other economic reforms in Latin America, writes
Nancy Dunne.
President George Bush proposed a Dollars 1.5bn fund in June 1990 as part of
his Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. He envisaged that the US, EC and
Japan would each give Dollars 500m over five years to get the fund
established. Contributions, however, have totalled less than Dollars 1.26bn.
Although Japan has pledged its Dollars 500m, Europe has been less generous.
Spain is contributing Dollars 50m, Germany Dollars 30m, Italy Dollars 30m,
France Dollars 15m, Portugal Dollars 4m.
The US Congress has authorised Dollars 90m for the first year, rather than
the Dollars 100m requested by the president. Latin American countries are
contributing the rest.
The fund will have three separate facilities. One will provide technical
assistance to identify and implement policy changes needed to boost the
private sector. A 'human resources' facility will lift productivity by

FT  12 JAN 93 / Nicaragua devalues to lift economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NICARAGUA has devalued its currency in an attempt to boost the economy and
raise exports.
The US dollar will now fetch 6 rather than 5 cordobas, ending almost two
years of a fixed exchange rate. This represents a devaluation of 16.66 per
cent for external purposes, using the International Monetary Fund's method
of calculation. The cordoba will slide to a year-end target of 6.30 to the
dollar.
The devaluation was provoked by last year's anaemic growth of 0.5 per cent,
lower-than-expected coffee prices, and delays in promised US aid. It was
accompanied by measures to stimulate foreign and domestic investment, and
higher tariffs on imports of luxury goods.
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro heralded a shift in economic policy
when she told the National Assembly that social issues would be a priority
of the government this year and partly blamed her austere economic policies
for rising poverty and unemploy-ment.
Economic policy would, in future, be aimed at 'reactivation in solidarity
with the poor, unemployed and the population affected by Nicaragua's
drought,' she said.
The fixed exchange rate, coupled with a balanced budget, had helped
Nicaragua reduce inflation from 7,000 per cent in 1990 to 3.8 per cent last
year. But per capita income has declined for the past nine years, and some
60 per cent of the adult population is underemployed or jobless.
The shift in economic policy may be intended to appease the left-wing
Sandinista party, on whose support Mrs Chamorro depends and which has been
critical of the government's orthodox economic policy. Over the weekend Mrs
Chamorro appointed three Sandinistas to her cabinet.
The conservative coalition that helped Mrs Chamorro to office, and which has
since been bitterly critical of her reconciliation with the Sandinistas,
formally abandoned her over the weekend and boycotted the opening of the
National Assembly.
On Saturday, Vice-President Virgilio Godoy led a march through Managua
demanding Mrs Chamorro's resignation.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Hong Kong delays plans to increase democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Chris Patten's proposals for greater democracy in Hong Kong are
unlikely to be put before the local legislature until the end of next month,
increasing the time available for legislators to draw up any alternatives.
The Executive Council, Mr Patten's highest advisory body, begins its
deliberations on the legislation today. Its consideration could last a month
or so, far longer than had been generally assumed.
Moreover, according to one government official, the Executive Council's
blanket approval for all the proposed reforms cannot be taken for granted.
'You cannot assume it goes to LegCo (the Legislative Council) as proposed,'
he said.
'The Executive Council could advise that the proposals need amendment,
although I would be surprised if they were changed.'
The general expectation in Hong Kong was that the Executive Council would
approve the legislation at today's sitting.
This would have cleared the way for the package to be introduced into the
Legislative Council in the first week of February.
The suggestion that the Executive Council may want to spend up to three
sessions considering Mr Patten's legislation is bound to raise expectations
that the governor's proposals might be altered to make them more acceptable
to China.
Beijing has ruled out accepting an Executive Council or LegCo-induced
solution to its objections to the governor's plans.
Beijing claims it will be satisfied only with the complete withdrawal of Mr
Patten's proposals.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UN resolution on the new border
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A resolution running to 34 operative paragraphs, approved on April 3
1991, the UN Security Council called on the secretary-general 'to lend
assistance to make arrangements' with Iraq and Kuwait to demarcate their
boundary, writes Our UN Correspondent in New York.
The Council so decided to guarantee the inviolability of that boundary and
'take as appropriate all necessary measures to that end in accordance with
the Charter'.
After a series of meetings in New York and Geneva, the UN Iraq-Kuwait's
boundary demarcation commission, set up under the resolution, announced that
physical demarcation of part of the border was completed last November.
The commission decided that the line should be moved north effective on
January 15 - next Friday. But a map of the proposed changes has not yet been
issued. However, a commission official said yesterday that at the widest
point the loss of Iraqi territory under the proposed changes amounted to no
more than about 700 metres.
A flight-exclusion zone north of the 36th parallel was imposed on Iraq after
the Gulf war, mainly to protect the oppressed Kurds. Coalition members
invoked Security Council Resolution 688 of April 1991 which demanded that
President Saddam Hussein stop oppressing his own people. The resolution did
not threaten force. But last week, in giving Iraq 48 hours to withdraw
anti-aircraft missiles from the no-fly zone imposed on the south to protect
the Shias, the US, UK and France warned of an appropriate, decisive response
if Baghdad did not comply.

<TEXT>
TOP Bombay industrialists including Mr J R D Tata, Mr Ramakrishna Bajaj and
Mr S P Godrej yesterday urged the Indian government to declare a partial
emergency and allow the army full control of India's commercial capital
which was paralysed by violence for the seventh day running, leaving at
least 175 people dead and more than 700 injured.
The industrialists, along with leading citizens such as Mr Nani Palkhiwala,
the eminent jurist, and veteran film actor Dilip Kumar, said in a statement
that the situation in Bombay was 'totally out of hand' and that 'criminals,
monsters and beasts in the form of men had taken over the city'.
They urged that Bombay be declared 'a gravely disturbed area,' and that 'any
delay in taking such a step would be a crime against the nation' since the
'democratic process of the government had failed'.
Mr Sharad Pawar, the defence minister, ordered troops to suppress widening
Hindu-Moslem bloodshed. Extra forces were rushed to Bombay, a city of 12m,
and convoys of heavily-armed soldiers imposed an uneasy calm in some areas
worst affected by the dramatic flare-up.
A cloud of smoke hung over the city as the fire services fought to control
flames consuming the shops, houses and vehicles set alight by rampaging mobs
in several parts of the city.
Banks, the stock exchange, shops and offices remained closed, many of them
for the fourth day as panic gripped the city. Hundreds of residents, mostly
industrial workers in the worst-affected areas, fled their homes to catch
trains out of Bombay. Two special trains to Gorakhpur and Calcutta evacuated
homeless people.
Government officials said additional army and paramilitary troops would be
sent in to reinforce the security forces which took up positions in 25
riot-ravaged areas yesterday.
The International Federation of Working Journalists has condemned the
attacks on Moslem journalists and newspaper offices in the past two days.
The city has been tense since last month's nationwide riots triggered by the
destruction of Ayodhya mosque by Hindu zealots in which more than 1,200
people died.
But the new flare-up appeared to have been deliberately fanned by Hindu
political groups trying to push prime minister P V Narasimha Rao into an
early general election, political sources said.
Leaders of the opposition Janata Dal party courted arrest in New Delhi
yesterday, demanding the dismissal of the Maharashtra and Gujarat state
governments for failing to control the violence in Bombay and Ahmedabad.
The situation remained tense in Gujarat with the death toll in the state
reaching 57, with seven more reported yesterday.
Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, president of the militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata
party (BJP), reiterated his party's commitment to build Hindu temples on the
site of the demolished mosque in Ayodhya, and at two other places, Kashi and
Mathura, in northern India where Hindus claim Moslem conquerors destroyed
temples to build mosques.
Mr Joshi and other BJP leaders were released from a month's detention
yesterday. The BJP, India's largest opposition party, will meet this morning
to chalk out a future political strategy.
The Hindu party is most likely to demand an early election, claiming that Mr
Narasimha Rao had lost the confidence of the people following the events at
Ayodhya.
England's opening one-day cricket international against India in Ahmedabad
on Saturday has been called off by the Board of Control for Cricket in India
because of the violence.

FT  12 JAN 93 / US Marines in crackdown on Somali gun bazaar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US MARINES closed down a big gun bazaar in Mogadishu yesterday, continuing
an unofficial policy of arms reduction in the chaotic country.
About 900 Marines in armoured vehicles sealed off the sprawling Bakara
market, which sprang up after the overthrow of President Mohamed Siad Barre
two years ago. 'We have seized a large number of weapons,' said Major Ken
Roberts. 'We feel we have taken a significant number of weapons off the
streets and out of the market.'
The Marines' action came as Somali warlords agreed in Addis Ababa to declare
a ceasefire and start stripping their militias of heavy weapons, a move
which further strengthened the tentative peace agreement taking shape in the
Ethiopian capital.
Although the ceasefire is unlikely to end fighting in Somalia - rival gunmen
in Mogadishu clashed for about half an hour last night - the agreement could
mark a significant step down the long road to peace.
At the UN-sponsored talks in Addis Ababa 15 clan-based factions committed
themselves to handing over all heavy weapons to a monitoring group, to be
composed of UN troops, until a legitimate Somali government is formed.
The warlords and faction leaders also agreed to move militias into camps
outside the main towns by March 1 in preparation for complete disarmament;
to establish a register for all civilian weapons; to free all political
prisoners; and return confiscated property to rightful owners.
Delegates have already agreed to convene a national reconciliation
conference on March 15 which will write a national charter and create an
interim assembly and government. Talks were still deadlocked yesterday,
however, on who should attend the conference, which will have extraordinary
power to chart Somalia's political future, including the thorny issue of
choosing an interim president.
Diplomats and observers in Addis Ababa say they have sensed a new mood of
realism among the warlords in the past five days. They say the warlords are
increasingly aware their power, based on monopoly of heavy weapons and food
aid, is disintegrating.
Intensified efforts by foreign troops at what US officials describe as 'arms
reduction,' rather than disarmament which has been publicly ruled out by
Washington, have clipped the wings of the militia bosses.
Many Somalis, however, have criticised the way the United Nations has
allowed the warlords to tie up a deal aimed at preserving their illegitimate
power rather than opening up the peace process to clan elders, intellectuals
and exiled politicians. They question whether any deal struck by
increasingly desperate faction leaders will be able to deliver a lasting
solution to the country's woes.

ANGOLAN rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, in a defiant radio broadcast, told
followers yesterday he was still at his post in his stronghold, Huambo, and
his Unita forces were still battling government troops, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg.
'It is a lie that my house is in MPLA (government) hands,' Mr Savimbi
declared over his group's radio, The Voice of the Resistance of the Black
Cockerel.
The battle for Huambo, Angola's second most important city, has been raging
for three days, with little independent information reaching the outside and
both sides issuing wildly conflicting claims.
Diplomats in the capital, Luanda, believed yesterday that the government had
the upper hand and most Unita troops had retreated to the outskirts of the
central highlands city.
An army communique on Saturday said government troops had captured Mr
Savimbi's headquarters near Huambo airport.

THE Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday all Middle East peace
talks would be suspended until Israel reversed the expulsion of more than
400 Palestinians, but Syria argued some negotiations should continue, Reuter
reports from Cairo.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said at a meeting of Islamic states in
Dakar: 'The solution of the Palestinian deportees will be the assurance of
the continuation of peace talks.' Asked if this meant there would be no more
talks until the Palestinians returned home, he said: 'Definite.'
The PLO delegation gave the same message to an emergency Arab League foreign
ministers meeting in Cairo. 'All depends on whether the deportees are
repatriated,' said Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, the equivalent of the PLO's foreign
minister. 'It would be impossible for the Palestinian delegation to
participate in these negotiations so long as the deportees remain deported.'
But Syria, which held out for four decades against direct peace talks with
Israel until changing tack two years ago, made it clear it saw too much at
stake to threaten to pull out now. Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syrian foreign
minister, told the Cairo meeting multilateral peace talks could be suspended
because Israel stood to gain from them. But, he said, bilateral talks, in
which Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians are negotiating treaties
with Israel, were too important to Arab interests.
Israel expelled the Palestinians to south Lebanon claiming they supported
Islamic groups which had killed five Israeli soldiers. Lebanon has refused
to accept them.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister at the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (Miti), said yesterday the Japanese economy would begin to
recover in the autumn at the earliest as official figures showed that deep
cuts in industrial investment are continuing unabated.
Machine tool orders last November were 29.8 per cent down on the same month
in 1991, with orders from the automobile industry down 43.8 per cent,
according to the Machine Tool Builders' Association.
Orders for general industrial machinery last November were 39.4 per cent
below the same month in 1991, with exports down 84 per cent, according to
the Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers.
Mr Hatakeyama said Japanese industry had divided into three groups in the
past five months: industries such as cars, semiconductors and home
appliances in which shipments were down by about 10 per cent; video
recorders, computers and air conditioners where shipments were 20 per cent
down; and those such as machine tools where the falls had reached about 40
per cent.
He disclosed that, over the past four months, 75 industries had applied for
government subsidies to help them cover the cost of retraining or
transferring laid-off workers at about 80,000 factories.
This is still well short of the level of subsidies reached during the
downturn in the mid-1980s caused by the appreciation of the yen, when 161
industries were given employment subsidies.
Mr Hatakeyama would not be drawn on whether the economy would need an
additional fiscal stimulus to recover. However, he noted that the recently
agreed budget for 1993, which provides for a meagre 0.2 per cent increase in
overall public spending, was far less stimulatory than the original budget
for 1992 combined with the Y10,700bn (Pounds 57bn) emergency package
announced last August.
Private sector economists believe it is almost certain there will be another
supplementary budget later this year as well as measures to front-load
public spending by bringing forward commitments from the second half of the
year.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Keidanren, the Federation of
Economic Organisations, stepped up employer pressure on the government to
take further measures by calling for another emergency package, combining
tax and interest rate cuts, if the economy fails to revive by the end of
March.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Saddam pushes UN resolve to the limit: Further allied
attacks on Iraq would allow Mr Saddam to reinforce his political posture as
the only Middle Eastern leader willing to stand up to the world's largest
military power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Saddam Hussein's recent actions suggest that he is moving from the
merely provocative to the almost reckless in his challenges to the United
Nations and the US-led Gulf war alliance.
He has chosen to test the resolve of the UN in three ways. First, by sending
aircraft and surface-to-air missiles into the exclusion zone south of the
32nd parallel. Second, by refusing to allow UN inspectors to fly into
Baghdad to continue their search for weapons of mass destruction. And third,
by sending hundreds of Iraqis across the newly demarcated border with Kuwait
to carry off missiles, weapons and other equipment.
Any one of these actions could be taken as a sufficiently serious breach of
the post-Gulf war UN resolutions to warrant a military response. Taken
together the three provocations indicate that the Iraqi leader is prepared
to withstand air strikes by the American, British and French forces based in
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.
The Iraqi leader's response last week to the ultimatum for removing
surface-to-air missiles from the air exclusion zone revealed what an
apparently risky game he was playing.
Baghdad continued its belligerent statements right up to the deadline last
Friday night and ultimately relied on US electronic surveillance to decide
that the missiles had been moved to positions where they no longer posed a
threat. The Iraqis left themselves no other avenue for retreat and
subsequently denied they had bowed to US demands.
They have embarked on a scarcely less reckless course by refusing UN weapons
inspectors the right to fly into Baghdad in their own aircraft. Last August,
President George Bush was believed to have been ready to order air strikes
if Iraq refused a request by the weapons team to visit ministries in
Baghdad.
At the last moment the UN team did not file the request and confrontation
was postponed, but shortly afterwards Washington decided, in conjunction
with Britain and France, that action had to be taken to protect the Shia
population in the south against further attacks by the Baghdad regime. By
blocking the UN team from even entering Iraq, Mr Saddam will be well aware
of the possible response.
Against this already tense background, the incursion by Iraqis into the
border area near the port of Umm Qasr, part of which reverts to Kuwait under
the redrawn border, was sure to set off even louder alarm bells. In part it
can be explained by the provision for Iraq to remove some of its equipment
before the new border comes into effect, but seizing a range of weaponry as
UN observers watched made the incursion wholly political in its effect.
In being so provocative Mr Saddam would appear to have calculated that
whatever the outcome, his own position within Iraq need not be weakened. As
was seen from the Gulf war, a massive military defeat did not seriously
weaken his grip on power.
Further allied attacks on Iraqi military installations, such as were
threatened last week, may not prove any more effective in achieving the
Western aim of forcing a change of regime in Baghdad.
On the other hand, they would allow Mr Saddam to reinforce his political
posture as the only Middle Eastern leader willing to stand up to the world's
largest military power at a time when there is widespread regional anxiety
about the danger of Iraq being split into three.
With over 400 Palestinians stranded by Israel in southern Lebanon in
defiance of a UN resolution and Islamic nations meeting to protest at the
suffering of Bosnian Moslems, the Iraqi-inspired crisis in the Gulf is also
well timed to highlight the contrasts in US attitudes.
If Mr Saddam calculates that he has not too much to lose by provoking
President Bush during his final days in office, he must also reckon that he
has a chance of harvesting bigger political gains by facing down the allies.
There is an undoubted perception in the Gulf, including Iran, that Mr Bill
Clinton will be less ready to order American armed forces into action than
Mr Bush. Arab and Iranian officials have absorbed the simplistic headline
messages that Mr Clinton will be devoting the greater part of his energies
to resolving domestic, economic issues.
But the single most difficult calculation to be made about Mr Saddam is how
vulnerable he feels to Iraq's mounting economic difficulties when added to
the knowledge that he cannot indefinitely sustain a situation which denies
his forces access to large parts of the country.
As his refusal to withdraw from Kuwait demonstrated, Mr Saddam is a gambler
whose calculation of the odds defies normal bookmaking mathematics. He might
think on this occasion that he is placing a quite modest bet which, for him
at least, is likely to pay some sort of a dividend.
1992
End-July: Iraqi troops surround Shia strongholds in south after intensifying
air attacks on the rebels.
August: Iraq continues delaying tactics over UN inspections, and concern
grows among western allies over the Shias. On August 26, the US, UK and
France declare an air exclusion zone in southern Iraq to protect the Shias
from air attack.
September/November: Confrontations between Iraq and the allies quieten as
the US presidential election campaign moves towards its climax with the
victory of Bill Clinton. December 27: US aircraft down Iraqi warplane in
southern air exclusion zone

FT  12 JAN 93 / HK delays democracy legislation

<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Chris Patten's proposals for greater democracy in Hong Kong are
unlikely to be put before the local legislature until the end of next month,
increasing the time available for legislators to draw up any alternatives.
The Executive Council, Mr Patten's highest advisory body, begins its
deliberations on the legislation today. Its consideration could last a month
or so, far longer than had been generally assumed.
Moreover, according to one government official, the Executive Council's
blanket approval for all the proposed reforms cannot be taken for granted.
'You cannot assume it goes to LegCo (the Legislative Council) as proposed,'
he said.
'The Executive Council could advise that the proposals need amendment,
although I would be surprised if they were changed.'
The general expectation in Hong Kong was that the Executive Council would
approve the legislation at today's sitting.
This would have cleared the way for the package to be introduced into the
Legislative Council in the first week of February.
The suggestion that the Executive Council may want to spend up to three
sessions considering Mr Patten's legislation is bound to raise expectations
that the governor's proposals might be altered to make them more acceptable
to China.
Beijing has ruled out accepting an Executive Council or LegCo-induced
solution to its objections to the governor's plans. Beijing claims it will
be satisfied only with the complete withdrawal of Mr Patten's proposals.
However, there has been a marked change in the tone of recent Chinese
criticism. Over the past week, senior Beijing leaders have sought to
reassure the colony about China's confidence in Hong Kong's future,
especially its economy.
Some have emphasised the need for what LegCo decides to accord with the 1984
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law - Hong Kong's
mini-constitution which comes into force in 1997.
This appears to raise the possibility of China accepting Mr Patten's
legislation if Legco amends it sufficiently.

<TEXT>
ANGOLAN rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, in a defiant radio broadcast, told
followers yesterday he was still at his post in his stronghold, Huambo, and
his Unita forces were still battling government troops, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg.
'It is a lie that my house is in MPLA (government) hands,' Mr Savimbi
declared over his group's radio, The Voice of the Resistance of the Black
Cockerel.
The battle for Huambo, Angola's second most important city, has been raging
for three days, with little independent information reaching the outside and
both sides issuing wildly conflicting claims.
Diplomats in the capital, Luanda, believed yesterday that the government had
the upper hand and most Unita troops had retreated to the outskirts of the
central highlands city.
An army communique on Saturday said government troops had captured Mr
Savimbi's headquarters, a villa known as 'the White House' near Huambo
airport, and his supporters were fleeing.
Diplomats in Luanda, reached by telephone, also said that after two weeks of
fierce fighting the two sides might be nearly ready to negotiate again.
The Unita leader said in his broadcast that his organisation was ready to
talk to the MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) whenever
the MPLA wanted.
Diplomats said Unita and the government had already held talks at military
commander level which indicated talks at a higher level could be on the
cards.
One western diplomat told Reuters that the city of Sumbe, south of Luanda,
had been mooted as a venue.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Japanese companies 'feel overstaffed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY Japanese companies believe they are overstaffed, according to an
official survey published yesterday, raising the possibility that the
Japanese social contract based on lifetime employment could come under
strain.
The survey of 18 industries, conducted last month by the Ministry of Labour,
found that the steel, electrical appliances, securities and information
service industries felt that they had too many staff on their payrolls.
This mounting concern about overstaffing marks a significant shift in
Japanese employers' attitudes. Six months ago, most employers were concerned
that Japan's slowing birthrate was creating a structural labour shortage by
reducing the rate of growth of the labour force to less than 1 per cent a
year.
However, senior officials at the ministry believe some companies may soon be
forced into taking drastic action to cut employment costs, including
compulsory retirement programmes for older workers, if the economic downturn
persists beyond the first three months of the year.
This raises the prospects of more Japanese companies in hard-pressed sectors
such as electronics following the lead of companies such as Pioneer, the
audio equipment maker, which recently announced plans for the early
retirement of a small group of managers over the age of 50.
Although moves such as Pioneer's may make only a small dent in employment
costs, they send a powerful message to younger workers that their future
security is no longer automatically guaranteed.
Over the past few months most Japanese companies have deployed a variety of
measures to reduce employment costs without resorting to redundancies,
including cutting bonuses and overtime hours, freezing recruitment and
laying off part-time workers.
However, with most companies facing their third year of declining profits,
many are under pressure to improve profitability through a more aggressive
approach to cutting employment costs.
Nevertheless Japanese companies are not about to adopt western methods of
management which can involve sharp cuts in employment to reduce costs during
a recession.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUSH administration forecasts of the gains to be derived from a completed
Uruguay Round were attacked yesterday by the Economic Strategy Institute, a
Washington think-tank. It estimated the US economy could lose Dollars
36.3bn-Dollars 62.4bn per year.
The report will provide ammunition for the many Clinton supporters who
oppose any Gatt deal at all or want numerous changes made in the Dunkel text
 -the list of compromises proposed by Gatt chief Arthur Dunkel.
The ESI projects an annual increase in the US trade deficit of between
Dollars 32.3bn and Dollars 37.2bn. It scoffs at an early administration
claim that a Gatt deal would have resulted in a Dollars 125bn increase in
domestic output in 1991 alone. This would have required Dollars 500bn in
increased investment, it says, and about 8 per cent of all US manufacturing
would have had to be converted from low- to high-value added activity in one
year.

FT  12 JAN 93 / World Trade News: EC and US go for broke on cutting tariffs
 -Negotiators zero in on stumbling block to Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE reduction of tariffs and other barriers to imports of goods
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a traditional focus of international trade talks - has now become the key to
success or failure of the six-year-old Uruguay Round.
Agreement between the US and the European Community on a tariff-cutting
package is needed to provide the framework for duty reductions by other
participants in the 108-nation Round. But negotiators believe progress in
this area could also induce Washington to soften its demands elsewhere in
the negotiations, especially regarding anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
actions, in the interests of a speedy settlement.
The race is on for at least the broad outlines of a Uruguay Round accord
before US President-elect Bill Clinton takes office on January 20.
His untried and inexperienced trade policy team will not be in a position to
conclude the necessary agreements before the US administration's negotiating
authority expires on March 2, thereby setting back the timetable for the
talks yet again.
However, trade officials in Geneva admit they face an uphill struggle in
their attempt to secure a framework tariff deal by Friday, when senior trade
negotiators meet to review progress in the Round. This is partly because the
tariff negotiations are enormously complex as they involve changes in
tariffs on thousands of individual items.
The main reason that the US-EC discussions on industrial tariffs have made
such little progress over the past two years is because the two sides differ
fundamentally in their approach to and implementation of tariff-cutting.
Washington wants to achieve the Uruguay Round target of a one-third cut in
tariffs mainly by a selective lowering of duties, including a number of
sectors in which the major traders would agree to reciprocal duty-free
access.
The US zero-for-zero list covers pharmaceuticals, construction machinery and
medical equipment, to which the EC has agreed, along with harmonisation at
low levels of duties on chemicals.
There is also agreement in principle to phase out tariffs on steel, though
the US is making this conditional on reaching a still-contentious
multilateral steel agreement that would also eliminate most state subsidies
for steel producers.
However, Washington is having little success in persuading the Community to
go along with zero-for-zero agreements for paper and wood products,
non-ferrous metals, electronics, fish and alcoholic drinks.
The revised US tariff offer presented to trading partners last Friday
amounts to cuts averaging just over one third - but this includes
zero-for-zero deals the EC and others have not agreed.
The EC dislikes this sectoral approach to tariff cutting, stating that it
contradicts the essence of trade bargaining - the trade-off between
concessions in one area against gains in another.
'Zero-for-zero deals are unbalanced by definition,' says one senior EC
negotiator, because the sectors put forward are always the ones which most
benefit the demander.
The EC wanted the negotiations to adopt a formula approach, in which all
tariffs would be reduced but high ones would come down more steeply than low
ones.
This would have simplified the talks greatly , but the US refused to accept
a formula, largely because it does not want programmed cuts in very high
tariffs on textiles and other sensitive goods.
These 'tariff peaks', which for textiles range up to 36 per cent, have been
a principal target of EC negotiators, who have offered harmonised tariffs on
textiles with a maximum duty of 12 per cent.
Officials from the US argue that they are prepared to cut high tariffs on
textiles, ceramics, footwear, glass and dyestuffs, provided they have a
satisfactory zero-for-zero package.
However, the EC says it is not prepared to concede more zero-for-zero deals
unless Washington puts its 'tariff peak' cards on the table.
Even then, Brussels could face problems in agreeing, say, duty-free entry
for electronics goods, where the EC's 14 per cent tariff on semiconductors
helps protect what remains of a European chip manufacturing presence from
American and Asian competition.
When the US and EC settled their farm trade spat at the end of November,
they also agreed to aim for a 'maximum package' of tariff cuts going well
beyond the one-third Uruguay Round target. Now that target, while
achievable, is probably the maximum on offer.
And even if Washington and Brussels reach a market access agreement between
themselves, the Uruguay Round cannot end until all participants have drawn
up tariff schedules.
Though concessions swapped between the two biggest traders are automatically
generalised through the operation of the Most-Favoured-Nation clause of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (requiring Gatt members to offer all
countries the most favourable trade terms available), there are many goods
they do not trade between themselves.
Thus, if the US cuts tariff peaks on textile products of interest to the EC,
it need not offer similar cuts on textile products which matter to third
world exporters.
Developing countries, which are themselves under pressure to cut their
generally higher tariffs, say the results of the market access negotiations
will be decisive in determining whether the overall Uruguay Round accord is
acceptable.

<TEXT>
TARIFF negotiators from some 20 countries involved in the Uruguay Round of
global trade talks met yesterday to take stock of progress towards a tariff
accord, following inconclusive talks over the weekend between the US and
European Community, writes Frances Williams.
'It's hard to be optimistic - we just don't seem to be making progress,'
said an EC official after the meeting in Geneva which reviewed the
electronics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and textiles sectors.
The Community claims that the US offer to cut high tariffs on textiles, a
critical area for many developing countries as well as for the Community, is
'absolutely minimal'. Among its demands, Washington wants Brussels to agree
to eliminate tariffs on electronics goods, which it has so far refused to
do.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, was due to meet senior negotiators from a few key countries last
night to assess prospects for a rapid conclusion of the round.

FT  12 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US motor giants seek curb on Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US motor industry wants a 25 per cent tariff imposed on two categories
of imported vehicles in an attempt to intensify pressure on Japan to reduce
its Dollars 33bn automotive trade surplus with the US.
The US already imposes a 25 per cent tariff on imported trucks, and the big
three US motor companies - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are seeking
to extend this tariff to multi-purpose vehicles or 'people carriers', such
as the Toyota Previa and the VW Eurovan, and to four-door leisure/utility
vehicles, such as the Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero and the Range Rover.
The chief executives of the three US companies met President-elect Bill
Clinton last week when they discussed the automotive trade deficit, which
accounts for two-thirds of the US trade deficit with Japan.
Mr Robert Eaton, chairman of Chrysler, told the Automotive News World
Congress that 'the first economic act' of the new administration should be
extension of the truck tariff.
This would 'send an important signal to Tokyo' and could be 'the first step
towards a realistic new trade agreement between the US and Japan', he said.
Extending the 25 per cent tariff to MPVs and four-door leisure/utility
vehicles would be aimed at Japanese imports, but there is concern at both
Rover, the UK vehicle maker, and at Volkswagen of Germany that their
vehicles in these categories could also be hit. Rover exports its Range
Rover and Land Rover Defender vehicles to the US, while VW sells its Eurovan
MPV.
Land Rover increased its sales in the US by 28 per cent last year to 4,234
units, while VW sold 2,679 of its Eurovan/Vanagon ranges.
Any extension of the US tariff to four-door leisure/utility vehicles would
pose severe problems for Rover's plan to launch its Land Rover Discovery in
the US next year.
Imposition of the tariff would require a reclassification of MPVs and
four-door leisure/utilities as trucks in place of their present status as
cars. There is only a 2.5 per cent duty on cars imported to the US. Japan
has removed all import tariffs on motor vehicles, but US car makers consider
there are stiff non-tariff barriers to trade with Japan.

ITOCHU, the Japanese trading house which buys cotton yarn from India, has
decided to take a stake in Patspin India. The company, based in the southern
state of Kerala, makes cotton yarn for export only.
Itochu will be nominating a director on the Patspin board. Mr BK Patodia,
director of Patspin, said Itochu would buy 11 per cent equity of Patspin for
Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000).
The Japanese company has undertaken to buy most of Patspin's yarn production
for overseas distribution. Kerala's state government is also taking 12 per
cent of the company's equity.
The Patspin plant, with a capacity of 26,208 spindles, will start production
in July. Mr Patodia said company plans included producing higher value-added
knitting yarns.

FT  12 JAN 93 / France tones down its Bosnia camps threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, DAKAR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday moderated its threat to use force to liberate Bosnian
prisoner camps single-handed, but reserved the right to do so as a last
resort if the United Nations failed to sanction international action.
Mr Pierre Joxe, defence minister, said a suggestion by Mr Roland Dumas,
foreign minister, that France was ready to act alone and use force 'was
misinterpreted'.
'What Dumas said, and what President Francois Mitterrand says is that France
is available if the United Nations decides on action and is ready to go
ahead together with others,' Mr Joxe explained.
Mr Bernard Kouchner, health and humanitarian affairs minister, will shortly
lead a delegation to Bosnia to examine camps there and report back to the UN
to demand a mandate to use force, said an official of the Elysee Palace. He
will also negotiate the liberation of prisoners where possible.
The government fully accepted there is for the moment no UN mandate to use
force to back up the French-inspired UN resolution voted last month which
demands the closure of the detention camps, said the official.
The Security Council would have to vote a new resolution if force was to be
used to free the prisoners.
President Mitterrand, who under the constitution is head of the army, would
prefer to act with a UN mandate, but did not exclude acting independently,
the official added. France was seeking a UN decision within days and felt
the plight of prisoners was so serious that action should be taken
independently of the deadlocked Geneva peace talks.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, yesterday said he did not
believe France would unilaterally intervene in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and
clearly hinted it would undermine the UN's peace efforts.
Meanwhile, the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, yesterday denounced
the French proposal as an 'election stunt'. Mr Karadzic also criticised the
role of the French commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Gen Philippe Morillon.
The Bosnian government yesterday said it had requested the replacement of
Gen Morillon, and the Sarajevo commander, Egyptian General Hussein Abdel
Razek. Bosnia had previously said it had lost confidence in Gen Morillon and
his staff, following last Friday's assassination of deputy prime minister
Hakija Turajlic while under UN protection.
The Organisation of the Islamic Conference yesterday backed a call by
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic for armed intervention if Serb forces
continued to shell Bosnian Moslems, Reuter reports from Dakar.

Britain will today consider reinforcing its 2,400 troops in Bosnia to
coincide with the expected introduction of a UN-backed no-fly zone, Philip
Stephens reports from London. Prime Minister John Major will meet cabinet
colleagues to discuss options to strengthen the force's security.
Officials said options included heavier equipment for ground forces, and
sending the aircraft carrier Ark Royal to the Adriatic.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Bundesbank call to cut public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY must act quickly to cut public spending or risk even greater strains
on the economy, a leading member of the Bundesbank policy-making council
warned yesterday,
The necessary cuts would be hard to implement, given that the German people
had become used to ever-increasing public spending, Mr Otmar Issing, the
Bundesbank's chief economist, told industrialists in Wurzburg. But cuts were
essential in view of German reunification costs and the size of
public-sector debt. Postponement would add to the economic costs of measures
which were ultimately unavoidable.
His comments come as the government is engaged in talks with unions and
employers over a 'solidarity pact' designed to help Germany overcome the
current downturn. Within the next few week, it must also find DM13bn (Pounds
5.3bn) spending cuts as part of a supplementary budget.
Analysts said Mr Issing's speech was designed to show further, significant
interest rate cuts were not a foregone conclusion after last week's 15
basis-point cut in short-term money market rates.
The persistence of inflation meant more demands were being made on the
German economy than it could meet, Mr Issing added. Wage costs had risen out
of line with productivity. The 9.5 per cent rise in unit labour costs over
the past two years had left an unmistakable mark on prices.

FT  12 JAN 93 / France tones down its Bosnia camps threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday moderated its threat to use force to liberate Bosnian
prisoner camps single-handed, but reserved the right to do so as a last
resort if the United Nations failed to sanction international action.
Mr Bernard Kouchner, health and humanitarian affairs minister, will shortly
lead a delegation to Bosnia-Hercegovina to examine the camps there, and
report back to the UN to demand a mandate to use force, said an official of
the Elysee Palace. He will also negotiate the liberation of prisoners where
possible.
The government fully accepted there is for the moment no UN mandate to use
force to back up the French-inspired UN resolution voted last month  -
number 798 - which demands the closure of the detention camps, said the
official. The UN security council would have to vote a new resolution if
force was to be used to free the prisoners.
President Francois Mitterrand, who under the French constitution is head of
the army, would prefer to act with a UN mandate, but did not exclude acting
independently, she said. France was seeking a UN decision within days and
felt the plight of prisoners was so serious that action should be taken
independently of the deadlocked Geneva peace talks, said the official.
The government's announcement is likely to worry some of its less military
intervention-minded allies and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary
general, who is keen to keep the peace talks going.
However, the move is likely to go down well in France, just as the
government is seeking ways of reducing the defeat it faces in the March
parliamentary election. The civil war receives regular detailed coverage in
the French media, for which human rights are a strong and constant theme,
and the alleged rape of female prisoners by Serbian soldiers has provoked
national outrage.
A human rights group, International Action against Hunger, said Socialist
Party chief, Mr Laurent Fabius, the former prime minister, Mr Michel Rocard,
and other French politicians and intellectuals would hold a demonstration in
Geneva on Thursday against 'ethnic cleansing' by Serbs.
Both the left- and right-wing are broadly keen for western military
intervention in Bosnia, though Mr Pierre Joxe, the defence minister was said
to be angered at the threat to act alone. Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, former
Socialist defence minister, added yesterday: 'One must not be in too much of
a hurry to risk the lives of our soldiers.'
Meanwhile, the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, yesterday denounced
the proposal as an 'election stunt'. Mr Karadzic also criticised the role of
the French commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Gen Philippe Morillon, who Mr
Dumas said had briefed him on whether the military means existed for such a
plan.
The Bosnian government yesterday said it had requested the replacement of
Gen Morillon, and the Sarajevo commander, Egyptian General Hussein Abdel
Razek. Bosnia had previously said it had lost confidence in Gen Morillon and
his staff, following last Friday's assassination of deputy prime minister
Hakija Turajlic while under UN protection.

<TEXT>
THE German government's continuing reluctance to participate as a full
member in the United Nations could prevent the UN from being a truly
international organisation, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations
secretary general, said in Bonn yesterday.
In a series of strongly-worded statements to government officials, Mr
Boutros Ghali said money was no substitute for Germany's limited involvement
in the UN.
Although Germany is the third largest contributor to the UN, accounting for
8.9 per cent of the organisation's budget, it is constitutionally prevented
from participating outside the Nato area in any military role, whether in
peace-keeping or peace-enforcement.
It is able to participate in UN-backed aid programmes for countries emerging
from war or disaster.
Germany has sent a medical team to help the UN in Cambodia and has provided
aircraft and pilots for UN relief flights to Bosnia and Somalia.
'We don't need so much money. We need real participation on the ground.
'Without full diplomatic, military, economic, and political involvement from
Germany, the United Nations will not become a stronger organisation,' Mr
Boutros Ghali said.
He dismissed the suggestion that some countries, for historical reasons,
were afraid of Germany playing a military role in the UN. 'There is no fear
of this,' he said
But the country's main political parties remain divided about how the
constitution should be amended, and the extent of Germany's future military
role in the UN.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Agreement on constitution is vital to settling the crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A POLITICAL settlement of the Bosnian crisis now hinges very largely on the
capacity of the three warring factions to agree on a constitution for
Bosnia-Hercegovina. Though disagreements on other aspects - such as the
precise frontiers of the provinces or constituent parts into which the
country is to be divided, and the conditions for a cessation of hostilities
 -are still deep, it is generally accepted that these would be easier to
solve once a constitutional accord was reached.
In spite of participants' statements to the contrary, there can hardly be
doubt that progress has been made since the two co-chairmen of the Geneva
conference on the former Yugoslavia achieved their minor miracle this month
in persuading all the warring factions to sit down at the same negotiating
table. That feat was capped by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen in gaining the
acceptance of the three parties - the Bosnian Moslems, Serbs and Croats -
for their constitutional and military plans as the framework and basis of
the negotiations.
The linchpin of the 10-point Vance-Owen constitutional plan is its first two
principles: that Bosnia and Hercegovina shall be a decentralised state, with
most governmental functions carried out by the 10 provinces into which it
will be divided; and that the provinces shall not have any international
legal personality and may not enter into agreements with foreign states or
international organisations.
Those principles, endorsed by the Bosnian Moslems and Croats, have so far
been rejected by the Bosnian Serbs, who rightly believe the plan would end
their dreams of becoming part of a Greater Serbia.
Anxious not to be blamed for a breakdown of the talks and to present himself
as a constructive participant in the peace process, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, has put forward his own eight-point constitutional
plan, a cleverly-worded document which, at first sight, has many
similarities with the Vance-Owen proposals.
It is clear, however, that the Serbian principles do not explicitly endorse
the creation of an independent and sovereign state of Bosnia-Hercegovina,
nor its division into 10 separate provinces.
Instead, Mr Karadzic has proposed 'a composite state', made up of 'three
constituent peoples as its three constituent units', a definition which
would permit the Bosnian Serbs to set up their own state within
Bosnia-Hercegovina, as a first step, and ultimately to merge with Serbia
proper.
A good part of yesterday was spent in bilateral negotiations aimed at
finding common ground between the two constitutional plans.
One thing is clear, however. Conscious of the fact that they are acting
under a mandate from the UN and EC, Mr Vance and Lord Owen insist they will
never agree to a solution which does not provide for a sovereign
Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose territorial integrity is guaranteed and whose
constituent parts will not be allowed to join another state.
Whether Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, in Geneva to participate in
the talks, will want, or be able, to pressure Mr Karadzic to bridge the gap
between the two positions is the great question.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Czech and Slovak protests at VAT's impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE introduction of value added tax by the Czech and Slovak republics at the
start of the year has caused confusion and unexpectedly high price
increases. A public outcry may force the Czech and Slovak governments to
reintroduce price controls.
The Czech government will review the results of VAT introduction this week
and the Slovak authorities say they may reimpose price controls on food.
In the Czech Republic, prices have risen by an average of 20 per cent
overnight, though in some cases individual items in local shops have
increased by considerably more. A pensioner living on the outskirts of
Prague said her local shop imposed a three-fold increase in the cheapest
type of bread.
The press has criticised both shopkeepers and the government, and trade
unions have threatened to strike unless the government takes action to
reverse the recent price rises.
Many shops were closed in Prague last week as managers adjusted prices in
line with the new VAT rates, which range from 6 per cent, for services and
basic foods, to 23 per cent for other goods. But lack of information about
the tax and how to implement it, and the temptation for shopkeepers to raise
margins, caused much larger increases than expected.
Many shop managers appear simply to have added the new VAT rate to the old
prices, which included the now abolished purchase tax, thereby doubling the
tax. VAT is expected to raise prices on a wide range of goods, including
food, electrical appliances, construction materials, and services. The price
of other products should fall, especially those such as coffee, cosmetics,
some clothing and jewellery, which were formerly taxed at 40 per cent as
luxury goods.
The prime minister, Mr Vaclav Klaus, said last week he would not reintroduce
price controls, and government officials called on people not to buy
products which had been excessively marked up. One newspaper said this was
like asking people not to eat, and called for urgent government action.
Lidove Noviny, a Prague daily, blamed the government for failing to break up
key monopolies which it said were responsible for the price rises.
Officials now admit the possibility of reintroducing some price controls if
prices do not come back down.
Shopkeepers argue many shops will go bankrupt if they are forced to reduce
prices. They say rising wholesale prices, rent and running costs in city
centres are outstripping earnings. VAT was introduced simultaneously in
Slovakia, but businessmen say there are discrepancies on how the rates are
applied in the two countries of the former Czechoslovak state. They also
complain procedures have become more cumbersome now there is a border
between the two countries.
Confusion about new customs regulations are causing delays at borders.
'There's no customs union and you have to go through the same procedures as
if you were importing from Germany,' says one manager of a large foreign
company. For example, he says, VAT must be paid in Slovakia on goods
produced there, to be claimed back at the Slovak border, then paid again on
the Czech side, and cleared through Prague.

Thousands of Slovaks, confused over the fate of their money, staged a rush
on banks yesterday to get rid of Czechoslovak banknotes, Reuter reports from
Bratislava. In an unusual response to monetary uncertainty, Slovaks queued
for up to three hours at banks in Bratislava - not to withdraw cash but to
deposit it. Others changed crowns into western currency.
Behind the rush to the banks, officials said, were fears that banknotes
issued by the defunct Czechoslovak federation might be worthless or be
difficult to convert once a currency union agreed by the Czech and Slovak
republics collapses.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Sweden plans more spending cuts: Minority government in
Stockholm seeks to save another Pounds 1.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S minority coalition government yesterday proposed a further SKr12bn
(Pounds 1.1bn) in spending cuts for 1993-1994 and outlined an ambitious
programme to eliminate the country's structural budget deficit by 1998.
The measures, contained in the budget for the year beginning July 1, bring
total savings for 1993-1994 to SKr17bn and mean the government has announced
cuts of SKr85bn since the start of 1992.
Nevertheless, the government still expects a budget deficit of SKr162.3bn
next year, which is 11.2 per cent of GDP and only SKr36bn less than this
year's SKr198.3bn. It hopes that a combination of more cuts, restricted
public consumption, and economic growth will remove the structural part of
this by 1998, leaving a remaining deficit of less than SKr40bn.
Government critics suggest the calculations may prove too optimistic, with
the country still in recession, unemployment rising and a continuing crisis
in the banking sector. In addition, a forecast that GNP will grow by 3.2 per
cent a year between 1995-1998 may prove hard to meet.
But Ms Anne Wibble, finance minister, said Sweden was poised to emerge from
recession, with an export-led recovery starting to take effect next year,
when GDP is predicted to rise by 1.6 per cent.
She said next year's budget did include a provision for supporting the
banking system. However, she declined to quantify the amount for fear of
jeopardising the government's negotiating position. She also declined to say
when Sweden might return to a fixed exchange rate following the krona's
enforced decoupling from the Ecu in November.
The measures need to be supported by either the Social Democrats or the
right-wing New Democracy party to get through parliament, and both parties
were critical of the proposals yesterday. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social
Democrat leader, called the budget a 'catastrophe'. This helped to unnerve
the markets, even though the budget's contents were broadly in line with
expectations. The bourse ended down 0.6 per cent.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Carton-board 'cartel' check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN carton-board makers have been given 14 weeks to respond to
allegations they are operating an illegal cartel, or face fines from the
European Commission.
Industry officials said yesterday they received letters from the Commission
last week detailing its objections to alleged price-fixing, and setting a
deadline for replies.
The Commission raided 15 companies across the EC in April 1991, after the
British Printing Industries Federation (BPIF) complained the manufacturers
had co-ordinated price rises across Europe. All the main EC producers were
involved in the original inquiry, including subsidiaries and sales agents
for non-EC companies in Sweden, Austria and Canada.
Officials said they believed the Commission had since narrowed its inquiry,
but declined to give details. The Commission refused to comment. It is
allowed to levy fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover on companies involved
in price-fixing, but these are usually reduced if the groups have ended
anti-competitive practices.
Carton board is high-quality card used in packaging cosmetics, food and
other products. The BPIF, members of which print directly on to carton
board, said yesterday it had not been in contact with the Commission since
lodging the complaint two years ago, and had not spotted any further
instances of alleged co-ordinated price rises since 1991.
The Commission is pursuing an alleged cartel of 76 cement makers and
associations. A number of the companies and federations failed just before
Christmas to gain more information about the Commission's objections to the
alleged cartel.
Commission officials claim the cement companies were trying to delay a final
decision in the case, which may come later this year.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Inquiry to study tighter rules on oil tanker routes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SEPARATE inquiry into the Braer disaster is to consider stricter
regulation of oil tanker movements off the UK coast in order to avoid a
repetition of the environmental damage caused after the vessel ran aground
in the Shetland Islands last week.
The government said yesterday that Lord Donaldson, former Master of the
Rolls, will head the inquiry. The marine accident investigation branch of
the Department of Transport has already begun to investigate the causes of
the disaster.
The Braer continued to be battered by hurricane-force storms yesterday,
which caused further damage to more than half of the vessel's oil tanks
which were all leaking heavily into the sea. Hopes of recovering any of the
Braer's oil before it caused further pollution were diminishing last night
as storms continued.
Captain Geert Koffeman of Smit Tak, the Dutch salvage company handling the
Braer, said: 'We can never be sure we will recover any oil. There is no
guarantee, but we are doing our best.' He indicated that the ship could
break up within days in some of the worst weather conditions experienced in
the Shetland Islands.
The Department of Transport's Marine Pollution Control Centre said it had
still received no reports of major quantities of oil coming ashore.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said that important breeding
colonies for shag and black guillemot could be wiped out by the oil spill.
The tanker's US-based operator, Bergvall and Hudner, yesterday promised a
'substantial' contribution to the wildlife clean-up costs on the Shetland
Islands. Company officials believe the bill for the clean-up could run into
'hundreds of thousands of pounds'.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary,
underlined in the House of Commons the government's determination to ensure
that the 'polluter pays'.
Mr MacGregor said the Donaldson inquiry has been called 'to advise whether
further measures are appropriate and feasible to protect the UK coastline
from pollution from merchant shipping. Due consideration should be given to
the international and economic implications of any new measures'. He made a
cautious response to demands for unilateral action by the UK to restrict oil
tanker movements in the English channel and other areas where a collision or
other accident would be likely to have disastrous consequences.
While stressing that the Donaldson inquiry would be free to make the
recommendations it thought appropriate he suggested that concerted action
based on an international agreement was likely to produce the most effective
results. Mr MacGregor envisaged that Lord Donaldson would be joined by
specialist assessors in conducting the inquiry, and said that, if necessary,
they would be able to make an interim report on proposals requiring urgent
implementation.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said it should be made clear
to all oil companies and carriers of hazardous materials that it was
'totally unacceptable' for them to take dangerous routes which, while
cheaper and quicker in commercial terms, were potentially more damaging and
dangerous.
In a renewed attack on the wide use of flags of convenience, Mr Prescott
accused some countries of 'prostituting their flags for a few pieces of
silver' to enable shipowners 'to use second rate vessels, with second rate
crews, following second rate practices'.

FT  12 JAN 93 / BA to pay Virgin Pounds 610,000 in 'dirty tricks' case:
Branson claims 'total vindication' after High Court settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD BRANSON and his Virgin Atlantic airline yesterday won near record
libel damages of Pounds 610,000 at the end of a two-year 'dirty tricks'
legal battle against British Airways.
In scenes of high theatre outside the High Court, Mr Branson claimed
'complete and total vindication' for his company which had accused BA of
trying to put it out of business.
In charging BA with going 'beyond any limits of commercially acceptable
practice', Mr Branson listed details of his rival's campaign to discredit
Virgin. These included:
The illegal use of Virgin Atlantic computer information.
The poaching of Virgin passengers by bogus Virgin representatives.
The shredding of documents relating to Virgin activities.
The spreading of hostile and discreditable stories to destabilise Virgin.
BA, which will also have to pay about Pounds 3m in legal costs, apologised
'unreservedly' to Mr Branson in court for alleging that Virgin Atlantic, in
claiming BA was conducting a 'dirty tricks' campaign, was only seeking
publicity.
The settlement represents a deeply embarrassing climbdown for BA and for
Lord King, the airline's chairman, and is intended to avoid a long and
potentially even more damaging libel action at a time when BA is in the
midst of an ambitious international acquisition strategy to become a global
airline.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, said his
airline was taking steps to ensure 'regrettable incidents' undertaken by BA
employees did not occur again.
In a special message to BA staff intended to bolster morale, Sir Colin said
the 'overwhelming majority' of the airline's workforce had no involvement
whatsoever in the campaign against Virgin. He urged them not to be
distracted by the publicity surrounding the affair.
BA accepted it had impugned Virgin's good faith and said it hoped to build a
new and less confrontational relationship with Virgin.
After the court hearing, Mr Branson claimed some people within BA had been
frightened by the competitive challenge posed by his much smaller airline.
He also demanded that BA directors give a full explanation of a separate,
covert operation targeted at Virgin and carried out, he alleged, by private
investigators.
He warned Virgin would not hesitate to take new legal action if it became
the victim of further unfair, competitive practices. 'We now wait to see
whether the leopard has changed its spots,' Mr Branson added.
In the agreed statement read out in court, BA emphasised that the company's
directors were not party 'to any concerted campaign' against Mr Branson and
his airline. But yesterday's court proceedings were prolonged by argument
concerning the role of Mr Brian Basham, a City public relations consultant
employed by BA, in the affair.
The settlement agreed by the two airlines named Mr Basham as the man
responsible for conducting a campaign to plant 'hostile and discreditable
stories' about Virgin and Mr Branson in the press.
Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr Basham's counsel to have his
client's name deleted from the settlement statement, the court heard that Mr
Basham denied the document accurately reflected his actions.
He told the court in a written statement that 'at no time did I act without
the knowledge or approval of the British Airways Board'.
His statement also said he tried to discourage BA from spreading
'disparaging and unsubstantiated rumours' about Virgin and Mr Branson.
Under the terms of yesterday's settlement, BA and Lord King will pay Mr
Richard Branson Pounds 500,000 damages with an additional Pounds 110,000
payment to Virgin Atlantic.
BA will also pay all costs, estimated at about Pounds 3m.
Before departing in a taxi down Fleet Street, leaving behind him an agitated
mob of photographers and reporters, Mr Branson said outside the High Court
he bore no grudges against Lord King.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UN condemns Baghdad's defiance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council early today condemned Iraq's removal by force of
military equipment from the Kuwaiti side of the demilitarised zone and
demanded its immediate return for destruction.
In a strongly-worded statement, the council called yesterday's Iraqi
intrusion into Kuwaiti territory - the second in two days - a 'direct
challenge' to the UN and a clear-cut defiance of the world body.
It warned Baghdad of 'the serious consequences that will flow from such
continued defiance' of UN mandates. However, the UN's condemnation came in
the form of a non-binding statement by Mr Yoshio Hatano of Japan, the
current UN president, and no fresh punishment of Iraq was announced.
The statement was read out by Mr Hatano after it was approved, then revised
and approved again in closed-door deliberations.
The Security Council meeting followed warnings from Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the UN secretary general, that violations and threats against Kuwait
could not be tolerated and demands from the US for 'steps that can be taken
to ensure that Iraq complies with UN resolutions'.
A UN spokesman in Kuwait said about 150 Iraqis had crossed the border
yesterday and dismantled several warehouses. Up to 500 had been involved in
the seizure of arms from four weapons bunkers on Sunday. Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein is also defying the UN by refusing to allow UN inspectors to
fly to Baghdad to continue their search for weapons of mass destruction.
While the UN talks were under way, there were indications of further
movements of Iraqi missiles in both the northern and southern allied-imposed
no-fly zones in Iraq.
But Mr Robert Gates, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, said it was
too early to decide whether the weapons still threatened allied aircraft.
The US has already threatened military action if Mr Saddam again orders
surface-to-air missiles and radars into the southern air exclusion zone
below the 32nd parallel.
Last night's UN statement noted a stipulation last November that military
equipment in six bunkers in the former Iraqi naval base at Umm Qasr, in
Kuwaiti territory, should be destroyed by or under the supervision of the UN
Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (Unikom).
The council demanded that any future Iraqi retrieval mission should meet the
terms set out by Mr Hatano last Friday.
The statement also affirmed the council's guarantee of the inviolability of
the Iraq-Kuwait boundary recently redrawn by a UN commission.
The council stressed that Unikom facilities at Camp Khor should be inviolate
and subject to the exclusive control and authority of the UN.
The council asked Mr Boutros Ghali to explore urgently possibilities for
restoring Unikom to full strength and consider 'in an emergency such as
this' the need for rapid reinforcement as well as any other suggestions to
enhance the effectiveness of the mission.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, warned that he was 'losing patience' with
Baghdad. Officials said he would not rule out a military response to the
latest Iraqi actions. He will discuss the options with other ministers this
morning. But UK officials played down suggestions of imminent strikes
against Iraqi forces, stressing that any action would be agreed first at the
UN.
Baghdad yesterday maintained its defiant public stance, with Mr Ali Hassan
al-Majeed, defence minister, insisting that Iraq would free itself from the
no-fly zones. He pledged that Iraq's national sovereignty would be fully
reclaimed and US military aggression defeated.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Big pension law changes unlikely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's pension law review committee is unlikely to recommend
sweeping changes that might deter employers from making pension provision,
the committee's chairman signalled yesterday.
Professor Roy Goode also said he hoped to mitigate the effects of tougher
pension regulation by recommending simplification of the many, often
conflicting, regulations that govern occupational pensions.
'The consensus expressed across the whole range of respondents to our
consultative paper was a desire to see to it that the baby is not thrown out
with the bath water,' Prof Goode said in an interview with the Financial
Times. Pension scheme members as well as sponsors had expressed that view,
he said.
The committee was unlikely to recommend, however, that the current regime
remains unchanged.
As a result of responses to its initial paper, issued last autumn, he added,
the committee had expanded its review to include ways to simplify the
administrative burden for employers. The pensions industry has long
complained about the tax treatment for schemes which contract out of the
State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.
The committee is unlikely to take the line urged by employers' groups which
would give employers unequivocal use of pension fund surpluses. Prof Goode
said the panel might take the view that surpluses belonged neither to
employers nor scheme members but served to guarantee payment of promised
benefits.
The committee is also examining ways to guarantee the enforceability of
trust law which currently governs pension fund administration.

FT  11 JAN 93 / School for young blacks in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN inner-city educational project that has successfully motivated young
black people to study and obtain qualifications is fighting for survival
because of financial problems.
A total of 300 pupils aged between eight and 18 are studying voluntarily
during evenings, weekends and holidays at the Chapeltown and Harehills
Assisted Learning Computer School in Leeds, and a further 400 are waiting
for a place.
The school, set up in 1987 by Mr Brainard Braimah, a Ghanian teacher, to
tackle low educational achievement among local black children, has seen four
of its former students go to university and dozens obtain GCSEs.
The winding-up last year of the Leeds Task Force, a government inner-city
initiative, cost the school its main source of funding.
A final grant of pounds 25,000 - matched by equal sums from Leeds City
Action Team and the city's Training and Enterprise Council - was expected to
last until March 31, but will be used up by next month, leaving the school
in urgent need of pounds 7,000 to survive until April and uncertain of its
funding next year.
Mr Braimah last week held discussions with the City Action Team, which
coordinates government department's inner-city efforts in Leeds and Bradford
and later this month will meet the Tec. But he is not hopeful they will be
able to fill the gap.
Income generated by the school's commercial training wing is not yet
sufficient to replace grant aid, he says. Leeds City Council and the Home
Office already provide support, and Unisys, the computer company, has
donated pounds 100,000 of equipment and free maintenance.
Mr Braimah believes young black people underperform educationally because of
low expectations and lack of encouragement, home support and role models.
The school combines computer-based lessons in maths, English and science
with more traditional methods - pupils learn tables and are set homework.
Computer games are not allowed.
'This project does not just take these youngsters off the streets but lets
them realise the responsibility they owe to society,' he said.
The project has four full-time staff including Mr Braimah and 10 part-time
teachers. All pupils attend one formal two-hour tuition session a week and
can work outside school hours. During school holidays, says Mr Bramiah, many
are queueing outside when the doors open.
The City Action Team and Leeds Tec said funding for next year had not yet
been determined, but both praised the school.
Mr Jeremy Walker, chairman of the City Action Team, said: 'They have been
particularly impressive in the way in which they appear to be able to
motivate young people to improve their education performance.'

FT  11 JAN 93 / Radio 3's false response to Classic FM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer choice is a subtle matter. Where products are fairly standardised,
then a modest number of rival companies and models is usually enough to meet
it, so long as markets are contestable - that is, newcomers can enter to
stir them up.
But when it comes to complex, compound products such as television and radio
channels, the matter is different. Each channel is a unique product.
Consumer choice is further limited when for technical reasons the number of
channels is restricted and we are concerned with minority tastes, such as
that for 'classical' music (which, of course, includes romantic, baroque and
much else).
In these circumstances, public policy has a role. If I could insert a credit
card in a slot to obtain a music station of my choice, I would gladly do so.
But under present technology, radio transmission of music of high
reproductive quality has to be financed by taxation (ie the licence fee) or
by advertising.
The UK music listener now has a choice between the BBC's Radio 3 and the
new, private enterprise Classic FM. On balance, the change is for the
better. The challenge of Classic FM has livened up Radio 3, persuaded its
announcers to adopt a less funereal tone and above all given listeners a
choice if they do not like Radio 3's offering at a particular time.
Nevertheless the results are not as good as they could have been; and there
have been some unnecessary losses. It is well known in other spheres that a
duopoly can acquire many of the features of a monopoly. When there are only
two producers, each tends to acquire most of the features of the other, as
consumers of soap powder know only too well.
The problem has been the quality of the Radio 3 response, which fits all too
neatly with the soap powder model. Classic FM has made no secret of its
popular bias. In the mornings especially, pieces are usually short, single
movements; there are many interruptions, not only for advertisements and
news bulletins, but for telephone calls from listeners, competitions and so
on. The result is better than this recipe suggests; and new recruits have
been won for serious music. Moreover, at evening peak hours, there are full
concerts without such breaks, consisting of classic performances of works by
Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and many others, which Radio 3 would have found
beneath its dignity to provide so frequently.
Nevertheless, if the listener is to have a real choice in the mornings,
Radio 3 should concentrate on providing something different from Classic FM.
This is not a time of day for very esoteric programmes or avant-garde music.
But at least the listener who is not in the mood for chat and bitty pieces
should be able to hear continuous works of music without the interruption of
the spoken voice. There are many other spoken-word channels from which he
can get his fill of that.
Instead, however, Radio 3 has gone from the esoteric to the populist
extreme. Its morning offering of weather reports, plugs for BBC programmes,
interviews and fragmented music is hardly to be distinguished from Classic
FM's. Indeed, the BBC change began before the new station started, no doubt
as a pre-emptive effort. Thus the listener is deprived of genuine choice and
the BBC is deprived of its justification for using tax finance.
Above all, there is no escape from the incessant news bulletins. I do not
know what is worse: to hear identical repetitions of identical news
bulletins or to hear items reshuffled and reworded to create a false
impression of novelty.
The moral is quite simple, and it applies too to the rethinking of BBC
television services, where much greater sums are at stake. This is that the
job of publicly financed channels is neither to provide what the commercial
networks can perfectly well provide, nor to cater for very tiny groups of
high-minded people, but to cater for the choices of sizeable minorities
whose tastes cannot yet be supplied through normal market forces. This is a
difficult doctrine for public servants to comprehend, but do so they must.

FT  11 JAN 93 / People: . . and Wheatley joins Babcock's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineering group Babcock International, which last summer said it wanted to
achieve a better balance of expertise on its board, has invited Alan
Wheatley to join as a non-executive director, in the first of two or more
such appointments it intends to make in coming months.
Wheatley, 54, the new chairman of 3i and a former senior partner of Price
Waterhouse, has known the chairman of Babcock, Lord King, for some while.
'But these things are done in a much more formalised way these days and the
chairman and deputy chairman spent some considerable time considering the
sort of person we wanted,' says chief executive Oliver Whitehead.
Whitehead points out that Wheatley, with his City contacts, 'fills an
obvious gap' following the death of Rocky Stone, a former Smith New Court
director and a leading light in the Industrial &amp; Commercial Finance
Corporation, who had been on the board of Babcock since 1966 and who died
last April.
The chief executive says his own 'personal preference' would be for an
industrialist as the next non-executive director, but that that search is
not very far advanced.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Single Market Watch: France and Germany seal deals just in
time - Two financial services links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO related Franco-German financial services deals have come to fruition at
a symbolic moment: just in time to catch the opening of Europe's single
market. On December 30, shareholders in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs
(AMB), Germany's second biggest insurance group, finally approved the
DM1.9bn (Pounds 780m) sale of a majority stake in BfG Bank, Germany's sixth
biggest bank, to France's Credit Lyonnais.
At the same time, they voted to allow Assurances Generales de France (AGF),
the large French state-owned insurance company, to have full voting rights
over its 25 per cent stake in AMB.
The timing of the vote - reached only after last-minute uncertainties
threatened to unhinge the transactions - was highly appropriate.
These interlinked cross-border deals are flavoured with a dash of
opportunism. But they are driven fundamentally by the opportunities provided
by the single market.
AGF will be able to participate in the reshaping of the German insurance
market. And Credit Lyonnais will become the only foreign institution to own
a large commercial bank in Germany, fulfilling a long-standing ambition to
break into Europe's largest market for financial services.
Significantly, international jostling to take advantage of forthcoming
German liberalisation has been almost exclusively a Franco-German affair.
Despite the UK's pretensions to pre-eminence in financial services, British
banks and insurance companies have been on the sidelines.
Germany's insurance market, Europe's biggest, with annual premiums worth
DM180bn is set for considerable changes from 1994 onwards as European
Community directives take effect.
The directives will free commission structures in many hitherto protected
sectors. Domestic institutions have already started taking positions in
anticipation of these changes.
Deutsche Bank, the country's biggest bank, has bought large stakes in two
insurance companies. Allianz, the market leader, is in the process of
restructuring its domestic operations.
Liberalisation should in theory provide opportunities for other European
insurance companies. Building operations from nothing is difficult, however,
mainly because establishing a distribution network is prohibitively
expensive.
The most reasonable approach is thus to buy - or wield influence over - an
existing insurance company. Opportunities here are limited and AGF's deal
with AMB - expected by analysts to lead eventually to full control - will
give it the biggest stake in the German insurance market of any foreign
company.
If the deal between the insurance companies ended harmoniously, the path to
completion was paved with confrontation. Until last summer, AMB regarded
AGF's stake-building as hostile. The German company's strategy for Europe
centred on a loose cross-marketing agreement with Fondiaria of Italy and
Royal Insurance of the UK, from which AGF was excluded.
The basis for the two insurance companies' reconciliation was that AGF would
help find a buyer for BfG. This it did, by bringing in state-owned Credit
Lyonnais.
The transaction thus closed an important chapter in AMB's troubled venture
into banking, which started with the purchase of a majority stake in BfG
Bank over five years ago.
The BfG purchase gives Credit Lyonnais around 200 branches in the east and
west of Germany. Credit Lyonnais shares the BfG management's view that BfG
is leaner and fitter than many of its domestic competitors after drastic
rationalisation.
AGF's tactics in its battle for AMB are being adopted by Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP), another state-controlled company which is AGF's
arch-rival in France. UAP is fighting for control of Colonia, one of the
largest German insurers, and also recently took a 37.4 per cent stake in
Nordstern, another large German insurance company.
In this tussling for market share on the continent, British insurance
companies are playing a much more low-profile role.
However one senior French insurance executive believes the basic reason may
be cultural. 'It is difficult to imagine any co-operation with a British
company,' he says dismissively. 'It is a question of mentality. The British
are convinced they are better than the continental Europeans, and simply
cannot work with them.'

FT  11 JAN 93 / Pits rescue may need power levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is examining closely a plan to add a special levy to
consumers' electricity bills to try to resolve the damaging public row over
pit closures while avoiding new costs to the hard-pressed exchequer.
The levy option has been welcomed by some senior ministers as a way of
keeping some of the 31 threatened pits open while reinforcing the the
government's claim that the mines are uneconomic.
It is also believed to parallel a similar scheme being drawn up by the
Commons trade and industry committee whose report on the coal industry is
expected later this month.
A senior official close to the trade and industry department's coal industry
review cautioned last night that the levy was only one of a number of
possible solutions to the pit-closure controversy. But he conceded that it
neatly resolved many of the political obstacles to a compromise solution.
Figures under discussion suggest that a time-limited subsidy of Pounds 10 a
tonne might be necessary to keep the pits viable while their productivity
was increased to meet a target price of Pounds 36 a tonne.
The levy would be aimed at financing the estimated Pounds 700m a year cost
of providing a Pounds 10-per-tonne subsidy while not adding to government
expenditure. A precedent already exists with the levy imposed on electricity
bills to finance nuclear energy costs.
Three draft reports by Boyd's, the Pittsburg mining engineers, consultants
Caminus Energy, and Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, are nearing
completion. They will give ministers an analysis of the viability of the
threatened pits, the general market outlook, and the relative
competitiveness of British Coal.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is also awaiting the
report of the Commons trade and industry committee before tabling a white
paper outlining government proposals.
Under European Community rules, any increase in fuel subsidies could mean
subsidy cuts for other fuels. This is because the UK is using its allowed
fuel subsidies in full on nuclear power and renewable energy.
Today Lord Parkinson, the former energy secretary, will warn against further
government intervention in the coal industry. Speaking in a BBC TV Panorama
programme, he will argue that industrial action by miners made it
'absolutely inevitable' that the electricity industry would seek to
diversify.
On the same programme Mr Neil Clark, the British Coal chairman, says that
even if the government takes all the steps the corporation is seeking he
cannot envisage more than 15 pits surviving in the long term.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the troubled US computer maker, has moved
to strengthen its management by appointing three extra members to its main
executive committee. This brings to six the number of executives in the
group's top management team, which reports directly to IBM's board, and
provides more direct representation for several of its business units.
Joining the committee are Mr Robert LaBant, Mr Ned Lautenbach and Mr Patrick
Toole. The existing members are Mr John Akers, chairman and chief executive,
Mr Jack Kuehler, president, and Mr Frank Metz, chief financial officer, on
the committee
The expansion of the committee is the latest move in a broad restructuring
of IBM's operations. The appointments also fuel speculation as to who may
succeed Mr Akers as chairman, if he retires as expected at the end of next
year. Mr LaBant is among the favourites for the top job, according to IBM
insiders.
Mr LaBant is a senior vice-president and general manager of IBM North
America. Mr Toole, also an IBM senior vice-president, is in charge of
manufacturing and development. Mr Toole oversees IBM's mainframe computer,
data storage, networking, printer and software operations.
Mr Lautenbach, IBM senior vice-president will take on a newly-created role
as the contact executive at IBM headquarters for IBM World Trade, the
company's international marketing and sales operations. He was formerly
president of IBM Asia Pacific. He has been replaced in that post by Mr
Robert Stephenson, also an IBM vice-president.

FT  11 JAN 93 / People: Sankey joins Pearson board . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vernon Sankey, who took over as chief executive of Reckitt &amp; Colman at the
beginning of last year, is joining the board of Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, and becomes the publishing, banking and industrial group's
ninth and youngest non-executive director.
John Hale, who was managing director of Pearson between 1983 and 1986, is
retiring at the next agm, when Sankey will also replace him as chairman of
the audit committee.
Lord Blakenham, Pearson's chairman and chief executive, says: 'We felt we
needed an experienced director who not only belonged in a younger age group
but who was capable of chairing the audit committee when Hale goes'. He adds
that, as with previous non-executive appointments, the group had engaged
headhunters in an extensive search, prescribing strong international
experience as an important selection criterion.
Sankey, 43, joined Reckitt &amp; Colman in 1971 from Oxford. Since 1989 he had
been group director responsible for the North American operations of the
household products, toiletries and food company, before returning to the UK
to succeed John St. Lawrence as chief executive. Earlier in his career he
had also worked in Denmark and France. He says it is his first, and will for
the moment be his only, non-executive directorship. 'These things take time
if you are going to do them properly.'

FT  11 JAN 93 / Ford plans luxury car for world market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US carmaker, is considering the development of a new medium-sized
luxury car as its next world car programme in North America and Europe. The
programme would include a version for Jaguar, its UK luxury car subsidiary.
The programme opens the possibility of building a car under the Jaguar name
for the first time outside the UK, although Jaguar's preferred option would
still be to assemble the vehicle at its main Coventry plant.
The scope of the project underlines Ford's determination to integrate Jaguar
closely into the group, and follows its decision last year to build a new
Jaguar engine range at Ford's engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales.
Last week, the company unveiled the Ford Mondeo in Europe as part of its
first world car project to replace the Ford Sierra in Europe and the Ford
Tempo/Mercury Topaz in the US.
Since its takeover by Ford three years ago, Jaguar has planned to develop a
smaller luxury sports saloon for introduction in the late 1990s to rival
products such as the BMW 5 Series and aimed at more than tripling its
production by the end of the decade.
Mr Louis Ross, Ford vice-chairman and chief technical officer, said this car
and a replacement for Ford of Europe's Ford Granada/Scorpio executive car
were under consideration as derivatives of a possible new Ford world car
project, code-named DEW98.
A version for North America would be a so-called 'near luxury car' that
would extend Ford's traditional Lincoln luxury car range and give the US
carmaker a product with which to compete in North America against Japanese
and European luxury car imports such as the recently unveiled Lexus GS 300,
the Infiniti J30, and the BMW 5 Series.
The DEW98 project is not a confirmed programme, and the company has not
decided where the European derivative versions would be built.
Mr Ross said an important aim of the project was to integrate Jaguar more
closely so that its new smaller car would have a common chassis platform
with Ford. 'Jaguar must get interchangeability of platform.'
BMW, the German executive and luxury car maker, announced plans last year to
build its first car plant in the US, and Mr Ross said the new Jaguar range
could also be built in North America.
'It is possible to build it in the US. It would not take anything away from
Browns Lane (Jaguar's Coventry assembly plant)', as this would be additional
volume, he said.
Jaguar's preferred option was to build the car in Coventry, said Mr Ross,
but it was still 'an open issue . . . they are not adamant, they are willing
to consider'.
The marketing impact on the Jaguar brand image of not building the car in
the UK would 'depend on how good the vehicle is', said Mr Ross. 'The ideal
would be to build it in the UK . . . but you must get the same cost
structure and quality in Europe and in the UK.'
He said that it should be possible in the DEW98 programme to maintain '50-60
per cent commonality' of components among different model derivatives while
ensuring unique styling, appearance and suspension.

FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: ASC reviews Fletcher insider
probe result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian Securities Commission (ASC), the federal corporate watchdog,
is considering the results of an insider trading inquiry into Fletcher
Challenge, the New Zealand conglomerate.
The investigation follows volatility in Fletcher's share price between June
and December, which coincided with the disposal of more than NZDollars 1bn
(USDollars 510m) of assets.
The investigation was initiated by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and
carried out in conjunction with the New Zealand Stock Exchange and the
corporate regulatory authorities in Wellington.
The ASX said the report was a 'routine' result of its normal monitoring of
share price movements.
Fletcher Challenge said it was confident no breaches of securities
legislation had occurred. All asset disposals had been widely publicised in
advance, and the market had been kept informed. Fletcher put a large number
of assets up for sale in mid-year after its shares came under selling
pressure, mainly because of investors' concerns about its operational
performance and high level of debt.
Asset disposals included the Rural Bank, sold to the National Bank of New
Zealand for NZDollars 450m, and a stake in the NZ Natural Gas Corporation,
sold for NZDollars 305m.
Fletcher shares fell to a record low of ADollars 1.24 in Sydney on November
20, but recovered to ADollars 1.68 on November 30, one day after news of the
Rural Bank sale.
In October, Mr Hugh Fletcher, managing director, suggested the low share
price could lead to a takeover. 'I would not be surprised if some corporate
started buying the company; there are billions to be made in buying Fletcher
Challenge at this level.'
Fletcher said it had no plans to set up an internal inquiry into the asset
sales.

FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: BP looks set to achieve Dollars
1.5bn disposal target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum already appears to be more than half way to achieving its
1993 target of raising Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) through sales of non-core
assets.
The UK oil company is believed to have reaped Dollars 1.7bn from similar
disposals in 1992, slightly ahead of its target for last year of Dollars
1.5bn.
The cash raised will be used to reduce the group's borrowings of around
Dollars 16bn. Gearing at the 1992 year end is expected to be over 90 per
cent. BP cut its dividend last year and announced it would shed 20,500 jobs
around the world by 1995 in a drive to reduce costs.
The group has received indicative bids in the region of Pounds 200m-Pounds
250m for its consumer products division, of which the main part is the
Manchester-based Robert McBride. The division, which has annual sales of
around Pounds 300m, is part of BP Nutrition which BP put on the block last
year.
SG Warburg is compiling a shortlist of bidders, believed to include several
financial institutions. However, completion of this transaction is still a
couple of months away.
The first sale to be completed this year is likely to be that of BP's
consumer food group to Sara Lee, the US textiles, food and consumer products
company, for about Pounds 70m.
This disposal is expected to be followed by the completion of the Dollars
456m sale of BP's 49 per cent holding in the Olympic Dam mine in southern
Australia to Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American
Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa. Both of these deals were agreed
last November.

<TEXT>
TOTAL, the French energy group, is withdrawing from Canada as part of moves
to sharpen the focus of its international operations.
Total will receive about CDollars 180m (USDollars 140.7m) from the sale of
its 53 per cent stake in Total Canada Oil and Gas of Calgary.
It has sold its 18.8m shares to an underwriting syndicate led by Nesbitt
Thomson, a Canadian broking company, for CDollars 9.75 a share.
The French group is concentrating its international efforts on oil and gas
properties in Colombia and Indonesia. It has also recently been granted
concessions in Burma and Algeria.
Total will make a handsome profit from the sale of its Canadian subsidiary,
which was spun off from Colorado-based Total Petroleum North America in
mid-1991 at CDollars 5.75 a share.
Total Canada's business centres on exploration and crude oil and gas
production, while Total Petroleum's focus is downstream refining and
distribution. The Canadian company's investment rating has benefited from
aggressive exploration programmes in Saskatchewan, Alberta and British
Columbia.
Total Canada earned CDollars 6.1m in the first nine months of last year on
net revenues of CDollars 57.7m.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Savoy head dismisses speculation of Forte bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GILES SHEPARD, managing director of The Savoy Hotel, yesterday dismissed
speculation of a renewed bid from the Forte group following news that his
board could not rely on the support of a key investor in any takeover
battle. 'What has been said does not alter anything one iota,' he said
yesterday.
Mr Shepard was responding to reports that a trustee of the Swiss-based
Fondation Pour la Formation Hoteliere, which controls 5.7 per cent of
Savoy's voting shares, had insisted decisions made by the trust could not be
'based on loyalties and personal friendships'.
'A trustee has to say he will do what is in the best interests of the
trust,' Mr Shepard said.
In 1989 Forte - which holds 42.5 per cent of the Savoy votes - agreed not to
buy Savoy shares for five years and promised to give a year's notice of any
bid, in return for a seat on the board.
However, recent events may encourage Forte, which failed in its attempt to
take over the hotel in 1981, to rethink its contract. The death of Savoy's
anti-Forte chairman, Sir Hugh Wontner, in November was followed by the
collapse of St Anselm, the property company, which owned 4.29 per cent of
Savoy voting shares. The shares are now in the hands of receivers Cork
Gully, and could be up for sale.
Mr Shepard said the agreement with Forte still held. It was legally binding,
he said, and 'I think honourable people would always stand by it'.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Radio 3's false response to Classic FM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer choice is a subtle matter. Where products are fairly standardised,
then a modest number of rival companies and models is usually enough to meet
it, so long as markets are contestable - that is, newcomers can enter to
stir them up.
But when it comes to complex, compound products such as television and radio
channels, the matter is different. Each channel is a unique product.
Consumer choice is further limited when for technical reasons the number of
channels is restricted and we are concerned with minority tastes, such as
that for 'classical' music (which, of course, includes romantic, baroque and
much else).
In these circumstances, public policy has a role. If I could insert a credit
card in a slot to obtain a music station of my choice, I would gladly do so.
But under present technology, radio transmission of music of high
reproductive quality has to be financed by taxation (ie the licence fee) or
by advertising.
The UK music listener now has a choice between the BBC's Radio 3 and the
new, private enterprise Classic FM. On balance, the change is for the
better. The challenge of Classic FM has livened up Radio 3, persuaded its
announcers to adopt a less funereal tone and above all given listeners a
choice if they do not like Radio 3's offering at a particular time.
Nevertheless the results are not as good as they could have been; and there
have been some unnecessary losses. It is well known in other spheres that a
duopoly can acquire many of the features of a monopoly. When there are only
two producers, each tends to acquire most of the features of the other, as
consumers of soap powder know only too well.
The problem has been the quality of the Radio 3 response, which fits all too
neatly with the soap powder model. Classic FM has made no secret of its
popular bias. In the mornings especially, pieces are usually short, single
movements; there are many interruptions, not only for advertisements and
news bulletins, but for telephone calls from listeners, competitions and so
on. The result is better than this recipe suggests; and new recruits have
been won for serious music. Moreover, at evening peak hours, there are full
concerts without such breaks, consisting of classic performances of works by
Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and many others, which Radio 3 would have found
beneath its dignity to provide so frequently.
Nevertheless, if the listener is to have a real choice in the mornings,
Radio 3 should concentrate on providing something different from Classic FM.
This is not a time of day for very esoteric programmes or avant-garde music.
But at least the listener who is not in the mood for chat and bitty pieces
should be able to hear continuous works of music without the interruption of
the spoken voice. There are many other spoken-word channels from which he
can get his fill of that.
Instead, however, Radio 3 has gone from the esoteric to the populist
extreme. Its morning offering of weather reports, plugs for BBC programmes,
interviews and fragmented music is hardly to be distinguished from Classic
FM's. Indeed, the BBC change began before the new station started, no doubt
as a pre-emptive effort. Thus the listener is deprived of genuine choice and
the BBC is deprived of its justification for using tax finance.
Above all, there is no escape from the incessant news bulletins. I do not
know what is worse: to hear identical repetitions of identical news
bulletins or to hear items reshuffled and reworded to create a false
impression of novelty.
The moral is quite simple, and it applies too to the rethinking of BBC
television services, where much greater sums are at stake. This is that the
job of publicly financed channels is neither to provide what the commercial
networks can perfectly well provide, nor to cater for very tiny groups of
high-minded people, but to cater for the choices of sizeable minorities
whose tastes cannot yet be supplied through normal market forces. This is a
difficult doctrine for public servants to comprehend, but do so they must.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Sewerage services in Buenos Aires
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Argentinian government has awarded the 30-year concession to run Buenos
Aires' water supply and sewerage services to the AGUAS ARGENTINAS
CONSORTIUM, led by Lyonnalse des Eaux-Dumez.
Strategy and documentation for this first water privatisatlon in South
America were prepared by Obras Sanitarias De La Nacion (OSN) assisted by a
specialist team from UK consultant Halcrow.
Unsuccessful bids were made by UK-based consortia headed by Thames Water
International Services Holdings and North West Water International, though
the Aguas Argentlnas group retains a UK interest through a five per cent
Anglian Water stake.
The city's water supply services are to be upgraded and expanded. Extensive
investment in civil engineering and electromechanical works is expected.
Capital investment will include rehahilitation of two water treatment plants
serving 2.5m people and 1m people respectively, potable water trunk mains
and tunnels and rationalisatlon of the distribution network throughout the
city.
Sewerage works will include the construction of entirely new sewage
treatment facilities to serve a population in excess of 8m, involving
screening, primary and secondary treatment. There will also be an extensive
upgrading of the sewerage network and new trunk sewers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW coalition government will take office in Ireland this week and will
have to confront the country's most serious currency crisis since 1986, when
the punt was last devalued.
The government is likely to be formed tomorrow following a vote in
parliament to elect a new prime minister. The Labour party last night gave
its seal of approval to the coalition programme, paving the way for a
government to be formed.
Fianna Fail has been running a minority, caretaker government since the
general election last November, in which no party won an absolute majority.
The two parties reaffirmed this weekend that they would continue to support
the no-devaluation policy of the outgoing government. Prime Minister Albert
Reynolds said the punt 'would not be devalued and would maintain its
existing parity within the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism'.
The punt is none the less expected to come under renewed pressure in the
currency markets this week, despite an increase in overnight lending rates
to 100 per cent by the central bank on Thursday.
Two of Ireland's leading building societies have warned, however, that they
may be forced to raise mortgage rates this week if the currency and interest
rates crisis continues. Many analysts believe a further mortgage rate
increase would deal a crippling blow to the economy and force the government
to devalue.
Last week Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, expressed disappointment
with his EC colleagues for failing to tackle the ERM crisis and called the
German agreement to support the French franc a 'sweetheart deal' which had
not been made available to the other currencies in the central band of the
ERM.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Monday Interview: Inside job will make a change - Derek
Lewis, director-general of the UK prison service, speaks to Raymond Snoddy
and John Willman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Derek Lewis, chairman of the UK Gold satellite television channel, was
chosen as new director-general of the prison service, no one could resist
referring to Porridge, the classic prison comedy, as the link between two
worlds.
For Lewis was the man who had set up the channel, which is based on repeats
of BBC and Thames Television programmes, including Porridge.
The appointment sounded like fiction itself. Could a television executive be
taking on one of Britain's most intractable social problems without having
visited a court or a prison; a man whose only knowledge of the subject came
from the media?
In fact, Lewis had only been a television executive for a few months -
successfully taking on the job of raising Pounds 35m for UK Gold and getting
it on air two months ago, before planning to move on.
For 14 years he was a senior executive at the Ford motor company, then in
charge of planning at the Imperial Group in pre-Hanson days, before becoming
finance director and later chief executive of the Granada Group in charge of
motorway services, television rental, computer services and Granada
Television.
But even so, how did someone who knew about cars, motorway service stations,
rental, computer services and television, but not prisons, become
director-general of the prison service and the home secretary's chief
adviser on prison matters?
The call came in August, when Lewis was still struggling to raise the
finance for the new television channel. It came from Saxton Bamfylde, the
headhunter which specialises in persuading private-sector executives to take
large pay cuts to work in the public sector. 'More clout, less dosh,' is how
the company puts it.
He was asked the usual question: did he know anyone, 'and by the way, you
wouldn't be interested yourself?'
'My initial reaction was that I wasn't sure if it was the right job at all.
It sounded like the proverbial bed of nails. But I was persuaded to go and
have a talk to them,' says Lewis, 46, who will be paid Pounds 125,000 a
year, plus a performance-related bonus said to be 35 per cent of his salary.
It is vastly more than the salary of his predecessor, the much admired Joe
Pilling, but still represents a significant pay cut.
The main question that preoccupied him was why he should want a job that, no
matter what he did, would probably leave everyone unhappy - prisoners and
prison officers; the public, which alternates between concern about security
and inhuman treatment of prisoners; and the politicians, who wish the
problem did not exist.
'What persuaded me was that there was an opportunity to effect real change -
not to get everybody absolutely happy with what the prison service is doing,
but to persuade the majority of those constituencies that it was much better
than it had been a few years before,' he says.
The television executive has been portrayed as the privatiser of the prison
service - the hired hit man of Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, who met
Lewis twice before the appointment. 'I think that is the way many people are
likely to see me. It would be a misjudgment. I came to this job without a
brief to implement large-scale privatisation,' he says.
'My brief is to effect the sort of quality of improvements in the service
demanded by the Woolf inquiry, which followed the 1990 Strangeways prison
riot, and to deliver better value for money.'
At least the new director-general of the prison service - and the future
chief executive, when it becomes the Prison Service Agency in April - in
England and Wales has now been been in jail. Four jails to be precise. He
was struck less by the banging of doors and the turning of keys than by
their complexity as social institutions and the relatively positive
atmosphere.
His diverse industry experience will be necessary to run a system with an
annual budget of Pounds 1.5bn, responsibility for 41,000 inmates and staff
of 36,000. He will be able, for example, to draw on his experience in
managing operations such as motorway catering and TV rental shops, where
standards of service have to be set and maintained across a geographically
dispersed network.
In such circumstances, managerial autonomy within an agreed framework is the
key to service quality, according to Lewis. He plans to continue the moves
towards autonomy in the prison service, giving the people running the
prisons more responsibility. Greater autonomy over recruitment and purchase
of catering produce are likely.
He will also be in charge of the programme to contract out aspects of prison
management - two establishments are already managed by private companies,
and bids have been sought for the management of the reconstructed
Strangeways. He sees this as a tool for improving the service rather than an
end in itself. He notes that this has already produced improvements in the
difficult industrial relations environment.
The 'nothing can be done' argument about prisons and prisoners, he believes,
is giving way to a feeling that quite a bit can be achieved, particularly in
tackling drug addiction and easing the difficult transition from captivity
to freedom.
Much can be done, he believes, to alleviate prisoners' main concerns, such
as improving visiting arrangements and facilities, allowing them to serve
sentences closer to families, ending slopping out (in the prisons where
there are currently no proper toilets) and providing more varied menus
within tight budgets.
His priorities will include encouraging greater responsibility and
accountability, determining the role of the private sector and, in answer to
one of the findings of the Woolf report, providing more visible leadership.
At the end of his three-year term, which could be extended to five years, he
would like to have implemented the main recommendations of the Woolf report,
and have done something to reduce reoffending rates from the current 70 per
cent. He also hopes to have changed the prison service to such an extent
that people will visit the UK to see how prisons should be run.
His success will depend as much on his function as policy adviser to the
home secretary - who will inevitably be looking for results - as on his
management skills. He acknowledges that there are severe political and
financial pressures on the service. But he says that steering through those
will the same as managing a public company through external events such as
takeovers, new legislation and changes in the marketplace.
Challenges are important to Lewis: he left Ford because he did not want to
be on a 'single track in a single industry'. He left Granada because he had
little choice: he became what many saw as a scapegoat for the anxiety over
the future of the group caused by worries over its investment in British Sky
Broadcasting and the loss-making move into computer services, both now seen
as money spinners for the company.
He sees his departure from Granada as one of the vicissitudes of business
life. (His compensation, at Pounds 590,000, was the sort of sum his new
charges would rob a bank for.)
As a result of the Granada setback, Lewis has had 'one very exciting job
running a TV station and, second, the opportunity to do this (run the prison
service)'.
And, yes, he does like watching Porridge.
In real life, however, he will not only have to deal with Fletcher, the
prisoner, and Mr McKay, the prison officer. There is also Mr Clarke, the
politician, and dealing with him could be the most difficult task of all.

FT  11 JAN 93 / The unstoppable Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the grandiose trumpetings of the glorious achievement of the single
market, this does not really seem a very cheerful new year for Europe. The
European Community's programme for monetary union is being swept on to the
rocks by speculative forces; the continent is gripped in a seemingly
interminable recession which in some cases may yet be deepening; many of its
governments are in trouble, and most of them deserve to be; and then there
is the barbaric war in Yugoslavia.
If the Maastricht treaty seemed a year ago to offer a bold and ambitious
vision of the future, the excitement it generated seems now to have been
destroyed by the onslaught of reality.
The mood of Euro-pessimism is not shared by Mr Lester Thurow, one of
America's leading celebrity economists. Mr Thurow is not merely convinced
that European integration is unstoppable, and will lead inevitably to
monetary union by the end of this decade; he also expects that Europe will
be the world's dominant economic force in the 21st century.
Behind these predictions, set out in his latest book*, there is one
fundamental assumption. The world will comprise three economic blocs based
on managed trade, centred on Europe, America and Japan, rather than a
completely open global economy. These three blocs will be pitted against
each other in a strategic economic struggle in which Europe is likely to
come out on top.
Perhaps Mr Thurow extrapolates too fast: he implies the Uruguay round is
bound to fail, and that therefore Gatt is dead. Yet even if this actual
negotiation succeeds, it is difficult to believe western industrialised
countries can indefinitely accept the political consequences of a totally
free global market, either for their domestic wage levels or for their
social security systems.
The key to victory in the coming three-way economic struggle, according to
Mr Thurow, will be the ability to adapt to the new challenges. Here is the
unexpected twist in his analysis. Japan and America both have enormous
strategic strengths, but both of them will have difficulty in adapting.
Europe will have the best chance of coming out on top, he thinks, because it
will not be able to avoid making the necessary changes.
America must reduce consumption and the deficit and increase investment; it
must reform its abysmal school system; and it must downgrade financial
short-termism and upgrade concern for human resources.
Japan must convert from export-led growth to domestic-led growth (because
the rest of the world will compel it) and accept all the consequences of a
regional market in the Pacific, including freedom of movement and
investment.
The European Community has two imperatives: it must go to the end of the
logic of economic integration; and it must embrace the emerging market
economies of eastern Europe.
Each of these challenges will be very difficult to meet. The key difference,
in Mr Thurow's analysis, is that Europe cannot avoid doing what is required.
'In the end the Europeans will do what is necessary to complete the
integration of the countries now in the Common Market . . . not because they
are wise and far-sighted, but because they have no choice . . . History and
human nature tell us that it will be far easier for the Americans and the
Japanese to avoid doing what they must do if they are to win.'
It is easy to predict that America will procrastinate before its hard
choices, because that is what America has been doing for several decades.
Japan, on the other hand, has proved remarkably dynamic and adaptable, and
may continue so. Where Mr Thurow is most provocative is in his assumption
that the European Community must pursue the right strategy, of integration
and enlargement, because it has no alternative.
A Euro-pessimist might feel events were pointing in the opposite direction.
The Maastricht treaty has been voided of much of its significance, the plan
for monetary union looks in ruins, and the existing exchange rate mechanism
is in danger of being destroyed by the markets. Negotiations to admit new
members from Efta will start soon, but the benefits of a larger market could
easily be offset by decision-making paralysis.
A Euro-optimist could make a different analysis. The storms that have been
battering the European Monetary System are essentially salutary, because the
system in its present half-way house is inherently unstable, and the
financial and political stress thrown up by market pressures merely prove
the need to strengthen it.
If the ERM does fall apart, the member states could revert to flotation. But
the case for eventual European monetary union (Emu), as a component part of
the single market, remains as strong as ever. Strengthening the system so as
to make it less vulnerable will not be easy; but it is likely to be less
unattractive to the core states than free floating or exchange controls.
Even if Emu were put on a back burner, that would not invalidate the much
broader array of convergent interests that have driven the European movement
for the past 40 years. Each phase of integration will be politically more
stressful than the last. But since it is virtually impossible to imagine the
core states wanting to put the process into reverse, one must suppose they
will gradually solve the difficulties of going forward.
On one point Mr Thurow must be right: the Europeans may go forward; or they
may go backward; what they cannot do is avoid making choices.

FT  11 JAN 93 / The solution is value added tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be fascinating to see how Mr Bill Clinton copes with America's
fiscal mess. President George Bush's final budget projects deficits of
Dollars 300bn or more for as far as the eye can see. And these figures
assume a freeze on discretionary spending in cash terms from 1995 onwards.
On more credible assumptions, the deficit could soar to more than Dollars
400bn towards the end of the decade. The US thus faces a gaping - and
seemingly permanent - hole in the budget, equivalent to perhaps 4-5 per cent
of national income.
A gap of this size means that Mr Clinton cannot possibly honour all of his
campaign pledges. He cannot apply a short-term economic stimulus, halve the
budget deficit over four years, sharply increase federal investment
spending, and reduce the tax burden on middle-income families.
With economic recovery apparently more firmly established and retailers
basking after a bumper Christmas, you might think the short-term stimulus
would be dropped without hesitation. But Mr Clinton's advisers are aware
that consumption cannot run ahead of incomes indefinitely. They were
doubtless disconcerted by Friday's employment figures, which confirmed how
pitifully few jobs are being created. Employment is such a delicate issue
that Mr Clinton may feel he has to cover himself with a modest stimulus
package - including an investment tax credit and accelerated infrastructure
projects - even if the annual cost is restricted to only about Dollars 20bn.
The longer-term imbalances are far trickier to handle, in part because Mr
Bush indulged in his own, unsung brand of Clintonomics. In the past four
fiscal years, federal spending has risen nearly 30 per cent, about twice as
fast as revenues. This surge is not fully explained by growth of
'entitlements' such as federal healthcare (up 63 per cent). Mr Bush also
spent generously on programmes dear to Mr Clinton's heart. Spending on
education and infrastructure, for example, have gone up by 38 per cent and
34 per cent, respectively. This is far ahead of broad price indices which
have risen by about 15 per cent over the four years.
Mr Clinton will thus be forced to scale back plans for additional spending.
This will be no bad thing. Infrastructure experts are already telling him
that, with Mr Bush's transport projects coming on stream, it will be
difficult to spend the extra Dollars 20bn a year promised during the
campaign. But even if Mr Clinton scales back his spending plans, the fiscal
dilemma remains. Given the range of social problems he hopes to tackle, he
seems certain to spend more than allowed for in the final Bush budget. And
he will not cover the excess by taxing the top 2 per cent more heavily.
Moreover, Mr Clinton will not quickly be able to announce a scheme for
capping the fastest growing portion of the budget - entitlements such as
federal health spending. This will be feasible only after lengthy
negotiations on national healthcare reform are completed, which may take a
year or more. And the fact that Mr Clinton wants greatly to expand
healthcare coverage means that the savings from new spending controls may
prove disappointing.
He thus seems to be left with only two courses of action. The soft option is
to argue that Mr Bush left the shop in such disorder that a big reduction in
the deficit over four years is, regrettably, impossible. A populist Mr
Clinton would promise to hold the deficit at about the current level and
explain that it would still fall steadily relative to national income.
If the cyclical recovery takes hold, the economy may well grow at an annual
rate of near 3 per cent over the next four years, which would bring down the
jobless rate, considerably brightening the public mood. With prosperity
seemingly restored, voters would probably forgive Mr Clinton for failing to
reduce the deficit. But such a populist manoeuvre would ignore the crying
need to raise the US national savings rate and be a cruel deception in the
longer term. If Mr Clinton puts the nation's economic health first, he will
not delay budgetary action yet again.
Pushing ahead with the tough reforms needed to reduce the growth of
entitlement spending is essential. But Mr Clinton also needs to build public
support for new sources of federal revenue. There is obviously a strong case
for a higher tax on gasoline but the political opposition to a sizeable
increase would be intense. It would be easier to raise taxes a little on a
wide range of commodities.
The bold course would be to establish a bipartisan commission to assess the
case for a national value added tax. A broad VAT levied at about 7 per cent
would raise more than Dollars 150bn, enough to make a real dent in the
deficit.
Enactment of a VAT would reverse a decades-long slide in the relative share
of consumption taxes, and belatedly move the US into line with other
industrial countries, none of which could finance social programmes without
the tax. It would be a levy on spending rather than income and thus minimise
the disincentive effects on capital formation and growth.
Deficit hawks on Wall Street would be delighted: the mere announcement of a
VAT commission might slice half a point off long bond yields. And come 1996,
Mr Clinton could claim to have dealt in statesmanlike fashion with the most
pressing economic problem of his time.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Conflicting factors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR'S exchange rate against the D-Mark will be swayed by conflicting
forces this week, writes James Blitz.
Pushing the US currency upwards are growing expectations that the Bundesbank
will aggressively ease monetary policy next month, narrowing the
differential between US and German interest rates.
Undermining the currency, however, are concerns that the upturn in the US
economy is still not as strong as expected.
The Bundesbank's decision to cut its money market dealing rate has probably
given the dollar a firm underpinning for the next week or two. The recent 15
basis point cut in the fixed rate repo, to 8.60 per cent, has been well
received by the markets, pushing the dollar as high as DM1.6490 in European
trading on Friday.
However, dealers will be watching the next two Bundesbank council meetings
to see whether the central bank follows last Thursday's move with another
cut, either in money market rates or the officially-posted Lombard and
discount rates.
This week, in particular, dealers will be watching progress in the talks on
the German wage round and budget deficit. A successful conclusion to these
talks would make it easier for the German central bank to ease policy again
next month.
Last Friday's poorer-than-expected figure for US employment may give the
dollar a slightly weaker tone, however.
The non-farm payroll figure in the US is still seen as one of the best
indications of the strength of the country's economy.
It tends to have a strong impact on dollar trading for several days
afterwards.
The latest figure, for December, proved something of a disappointment in
Friday afternoon trading, rising by 64,000 on the month, when dealers had
been looking for a rise of more than 100,000.
The US weekly jobless claims figures on Thursday will therefore be watched
particularly closely.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Economics: Higher UK input prices expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL INDICATORS on UK inflationary pressures are published this week with
producer prices figures on Tuesday expected to show another rise in raw
material and fuel prices in December. However, the increase was probably not
as sharp as in November when sterling's devaluation had a severe impact on
the index. Then input prices rose by 2.4 per cent month-on-month, taking the
annual rate of increase to 4.1 per cent.
The effects of a weaker pound on commodity prices still linger and a rise of
one per cent on the month is forecast for December. In spite of this,
producers are not expected to pass the higher costs onto consumers and the
annual rate of output price inflation is forecast to increase only slightly.
Credit business figures today may add weight to anecdotal, and some
statistical evidence that retail sales are recovering. However, many UK
economists remain sceptical about the strength of the apparant upturn,
believing that private consumption will be restrained by continuing job
uncertainty and heavy personal indebtedness.
In Germany retail sales figures for November are forecast to have fallen by
just under 1 per cent, confirming that the hoped-for rise in retail sales
after the temporary income tax was lifted in July never materialised.
Other highlights of the week follow. The figures in brackets are the median
of economists forecasts from MMS International, a financial information
company.
Today: UK, November consumer credit (up Pounds 50m), House of Commons
returns from Christmas recess; Norway, November CPI (flat on month, up 2.2
per cent on year); Canada, November new housing price index (up 0.1 per
cent), November motor vehicle sales (up 0.4 per cent), December housing
starts (170,000); Australia, November retail trade (down 0.7 per cent).
Tomorrow: UK, December producer prices index - input (up 1 per cent on
month, up 6 per cent on year), output (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 3.4 per
cent on year), excluding food, drink and tobacco (up 2.4 per cent); France,
December consumer price index (up 0.1 per cent on month, up 2.1 per cent on
year).
Wednesday: Germany, first estimate for 1992 GDP - West (up 1.2 per cent on
year), first estimate GNP - WEst (up 0.9 per cent on year); Norway, December
trade balance excluding ships and oil platforms (NKr4.5bn surplus); UK,
Committee stage of Maastricht treaty resumes until January 14; October
labour income (up 0.2 per cent on month).
Thursday: US, December retail sales (up 0.7 per cent), excluding autos (up
0.5 per cent), December PPI (up 0.1 per cent), excluding food and energy (up
0.2 per cent), initial claims week ended January 2 (323,000), state benefits
week ended December 26, money supply data for the week ended January 4,
December monthly M1 (up Dollars 3bn), M2 (up Dollars 1.8bn), M3 (down
Dollars 5.2bn).
Friday: UK, December retail prices index (down 0.3 per cent on month, up 2.7
per cent on year), excluding mortgage interest payments (up 3.7 per cent on
year); Netherlands, December CPI (flat on month, up 2.9 per cent on year);
Spain, December CPI (up 0.4 per cent on month, up 5.4 per cent on year); US,
December CPI (up 0.2 per cent), excluding food and energy (up 0.2 per cent),
November merchandise trade balance (Dollars 7.5bn deficit), November
merchandise exports (Dollars 38.5bn), imports (Dollars 46bn), December
industrial production (up 0.3 per cent), December capacity utilisation (79
per cent), November business inventories (flat), December real earnings;
Canada, November merchandise exports (down 2.3 per cent on month, November
merchandise imports (up 2.3 per cetn on month), November trade balance
(CDollars 800m surplus); Japan all markets closed.
During the week: Germany, November trade balance (DM4.3bn surplus), November
current account (DM1bn deficit), November retail sales (down 0.8 per cent),
December wholesale price index (up 0.1 per cent); Spain, November M4 (up 11
per cent on year).

FT  11 JAN 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMKINS, the conglomerate which has just bought Ranks Hovis McDougall, the
bakery, milling and baking company, is expected to report today interim
profits of Pounds 47m, up from Pounds 43.7m. Earnings per share are expected
to be up 8 per cent. Tomkins is expected to be enjoying the beginnings of
recovery in the US where it has extensive manufacturing operations.
Wednesday sees interim results from Dixons Group. They will depend on how
the electrical retailing group chooses to treat the Pounds 10m property
development profits. Assuming they are not taken at the pre-tax line,
taxable profits of about Pounds 10m are expected, against last time's Pounds
17.5m. Good growth in the UK retail side will lift profits to Pounds 20m
(Pounds 16m), while in the US, losses will also grow to Pounds 14m (Pounds
11m). Its comments on Christmas trading which falls in its second half, will
also be of close interest.
The Rank Organisation, announcing preliminary results on Thursday for the
year ended October, is expected to reveal unchanged trading profits for its
managed businesses. But lower profits are expected at Rank Xerox, its
photocopier joint venture, while profits from its 50 per cent stake in the
Universal Studios theme park in Florida should be significantly higher. This
adds up to group pre-tax profits slightly lower at Pounds 245m (Pounds
250.5m). The total dividend should be unchanged at 31p.
First Leisure is reporting preliminary results on Wednesday for its
financial year ended October. Pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from
Pounds 30.4m to between Pounds 30.6m and Pounds 32m. Assuming Pounds 30.6m,
earnings will fall to 15.5p (15.67p) after a higher tax charge, and a 10 per
cent rise in the total dividend to 6.25p is expected.
Securicor, the security and parcels delivery group, is forecast to unveil a
sharp jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 33m to Pounds 54m for the year on
Thursday.

FT  11 JAN 93 / French Bonds: Trading subdued after 'battle of the franc'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RELIEF in Paris was almost audible. Last Thursday, after the Bundesbank
had cast a tacit vote of confidence in the French franc by reducing its
fixed repo rate by 15 basis points, the battle-scarred French currency
closed beneath the FFr3.4 barrier against the D-Mark for the first time in a
month.
Since early November, when the money markets renewed their attack on the
franc, the Bank of France has done everything that it can to defend the
currency - from spending heavily from its reserves, to last Tuesday's
announcement that it was temporarily replacing the five- to 10-day rate with
a one-day facility at the higher rate of 12 per cent.
The strategy seems to have worked. 'The second battle for the franc is over
and the French authorities have won,' said Mr Didier Maillard, chief
economist at Banque Paribas in Paris.
'There is still a lot of tension in the foreign exchange markets and there
could be further attacks on the franc. But it is safe for the time being,'
he added.
The French government certainly seems to think so. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the
prime minister and architect of the franc fort policy of protecting the
French currency in his former role as finance minister, was sufficiently
confident this weekend to assure the French electorate that the franc would
'not be devalued for as long as I am prime minister.'
In other words, the French authorities are now convinced that they have
bought a breathing space for the franc - at least until German interest
rates come down, thereby enabling France to follow suit without endangering
its currency.
But in the meantime, the prospects for French bonds are scarcely
scintillating.
'The long-term outlook is very positive,' according to Mr Christopher Potts,
chief economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. One way or another French
interest rates are bound to come down and the French bond market should then
really start to perform. But in the meantime it will be fairly subdued.'
Subdued was certainly an appropriate adjective for last week's performance.
The French government's regular auction on Thursday received a lukewarm
response, raising FFr16.46bn.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bonds slipped to 7.98 per
cent by the end of last week - significantly lower than 8.02 per cent the
previous week and 8.13 per cent a month before.
Moreover, the spread between French OATs and German bunds is still much
wider than the French authorities would wish.
The gap rose as high as 100 basis points when the markets stepped up the
second assault on the franc in late November, and is now hovering at between
90 and 100 basis points, in spite of last week's 'triumph' for the French
authorities.
The consensus among economists is that the spread will remain at that level
until German interest rates come down and the franc is finally free from the
threat of devaluation.
In the meantime, the French economic scene, and the Paris bond market, will
continue to be dominated by the fluctuations of the franc and by political
uncertainty in the approach to the March elections.
Once the franc is safe and the elections are over, French bonds ought to
recover and the spread against bunds will narrow.
Mr Potts of Indosuez suspects that it may fall as far as 30 basis points by
the end of 1993 - even lower than its historic low of 38 basis points in
late 1991, when the fight for the franc seemed a long way away.

FT  11 JAN 93 / UK Gilts: Little interest in long-maturing securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND for short-dated gilts picked up slightly while investors showed
little interest in long-maturing securities, as the gilt market reacted to
indications of lower short-term interest rates across Europe.
The healthier tone to sterling also underpinned prices for short-dated
gilts, while funding worries pushed up yields at the longer end of the yield
curve.
With the market slow to pick up after the new year break, last week saw
relatively little price movement. Yields for gilts maturing at 10 years or
less fell by about 10 basis points compared with the week before Christmas,
while over the same period, yields at the longer end of the spectrum rose by
a similar amount.
One of the biggest influences on the market was the decision by the
Bundesbank council to ease its short-term money market rates, a move
accompanied by speculation that it would soon cut its internationally
important Lombard and discount rates. The central bank's action in cutting
its so-called 'repo' rate to 8.6 per cent from recent levels of 8.75 per
cent or higher was interpreted as signalling a softening in its previously
obdurate stance on monetary policy.
Assuming that the Lombard and discount rates come down soon, that could give
the green light for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to reduce UK base
rates, now at 7 per cent, in an effort to speed recovery.
Potentially significant room for manoeuvre on this front was provided by
last week's strengthening in sterling, which finished on Friday night in
London at a relatively healthy DM2.525.
These developments buoyed investor interest in short-dated gilts, while
longer-dated securities were mainly on the sidelines due partly to lingering
concern about inflationary pressures over the next few years.
Mr Paul Temperton, an economist at Merrill Lynch, said: 'All the action at
the moment is at the short end of the market, with many investors perceiving
that longer maturing issues have big structural problems.'
Although Mr Lamont has given few public signs of preparing to cut interest
rates, many economists believe it is only a question of time before he does
so, especially if the recent signs of a slight upswing in the economy fail
to be repeated in the coming weeks.
Theories about a fragile upturn were given extra weight by the 3 per cent
year on year increase in the M0 money supply measure in December, together
with some evidence about a burst in retail activity around Christmas.
Mr Sanjay Joshi, an economist at Japanese investment house Daiwa, said these
indicators did not alter his view that a recovery would be extremely slow.
'The pick-up in M0 may simply mean that people are switching into cash,
rather than use credit cards where they are anxious to pay off debts,' he
said.
Mr Stuart Thomson, an economist at Nikko Securities, is another relative
pessimist, believing that 'signs of a rebound are unlikely to be
sustainable'.
Playing heavily on the minds of consumers may be indications that the
Treasury is considering tax increases in the March Budget as a way to
restrain rises in the public sector borrowing requirement. The PSBR this
financial year is likely to climb to above Pounds 37bn, while the figures
for 1993-94 and 1994-95 could easily reach above Pounds 50bn, especially if
growth remains relatively slow.
According to FT estimates, the PSBR in 1995-96 could climb to Pounds 75.8bn,
or 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product, assuming only weak growth of 1
per cent a year in the three years from 1993-94.
As for gilt investors, the notion that Britain may be stuck with large
deficits for a long period is unappealing, on the grounds that this will
mean large tranches of price-depressing gilt issues until the mid to late
1990s, on top of the Pounds 50bn of issues expected in 1993-94.

FT  11 JAN 93 / US Money and Credit: Firm demand from investors for flood of
fresh offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE holiday hangovers were swiftly banished last week, as the US bond
markets began the new year on a hectic note. In the space of five trading
days, a substantial mood-swing had taken place, and near-record quantities
of new corporate debt had been absorbed.
Post-holiday business began quietly enough. After a raft of year-end
analysts' reports had declared that inflationary forces had been expunged
from the US economy and were unlikely to resurface in any significant
fashion during 1993, bond prices resumed their upward drift.
At the beginning of the week, the yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond
came close to dipping below the 7.3 per cent level. That contrasts with the
7.75 per cent level reached in early-November, shortly after the results of
the presidential election were known, when fears that a Clinton
administration would pursue a stimulative fiscal policy were at their
height.
The friendly interest rate environment, however, induced corporate issuers
to distribute a mass of new bond offerings last week. On Wednesday, for
example, some Dollars 4.7bn-worth of new corporate bonds were sold - only
marginally less than the daily record of Dollars 5.2bn seen on January 8
last year.
On Thursday, another Dollars 4.75bn-worth of new paper hit the market,
bringing the new year's cumulative total to more than Dollars 11bn.
Although the new issue pressure receded during the final trading session,
dealers still expect that the new corporate bond offerings will top the
Dollars 30bn-mark this month.
Happily, these outpourings on the supply side seemed to meet fairly firm
investor demand - in part, a reflection of growing confidence in the US
economy. Prices of existing corporate bonds held up relatively well, and
traders reported significant buying by foreign investors.
Nevertheless, by the latter half of the week, the surge in corporate debt
issues was compounding concerns about the pace at which the US economy may
be pulling out of recession and the size of the budget deficit problem which
confronts the incoming president.
The alarm-bells started to ring when initial unemployment claims for the
week ended December 26 showed a drop of 40,000 - taking the figure to a
level not seen for almost four years. They were not silenced when the
December jobs data showed the unemployment rate unchanged at 7.3 per cent
last month.
Many analysts believe that the speed at which the labour market is picking
up was overstated in the initial claims statistics. After all, Christmas
fell on a Friday, so people laid off after the holiday season will not have
filed for unemployment compensation that week.
Nevertheless, an attack of nerves, exasperated by the supply situation,
seized the bond market, and the long bond slumped by 1 1/8 to yield 7.44 per
cent on Thursday. By Friday afternoon, it was continuing to drift lower and
the yield has risen to 7.46 per cent.
Still, few pundits seemed inclined to adjust their predictions for the year
ahead. Most were content to reiterate their belief that the underlying
expansion in the economy is moderate, at best; that the new president will
tread warily; and that inflation should not rise significantly above 3 per
cent.
Statistics to be released this week may shed some light on the validity of
these convictions. Retail sales for December - which, according to reports
from the big store chains last week, were strong - are now expected to show
a 0.7 to 0.8 per cent rise, while consumer and producer price indices (also
for December) should confirm the low level of inflation.
The market anticipates a 0.1 per cent rise in the PPI figure, to be released
on Thursday, and a 0.2 per cent increase in the CPI on the following day.

FT  11 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Safe-haven status gives early boost to
Eurosterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurosterling bond market had an active start to 1993 with a total of
Pounds 600m raised by the European Investment Bank and the Kingdom of
Sweden. Sterling's unlikely elevation to the status of safe-haven currency
made it attractive in a week otherwise dominated by the D-Mark and Swiss
franc among European currencies.
Neither of last week's issues went down well with investors, however, and
the pace of borrowing may not be sustained.
The EIB's Pounds 400m issue, which with a 10 1/2 -year maturity is a rarity
at a time of a steep yield curve, was attacked for being too tightly priced.
And Sweden, which reopened an existing five-year issue to raise a further
Pounds 200m, was criticised for offering a higher spread on the latest
tranche, upsetting holders of the existing paper.
The use of Eurosterling in the coming months is likely to be heavily
influenced by two factors: the UK government's huge gilts issuing programme,
and whether arbitrage opportunities in the swap market return.
Bankers report demand for maturities around the 10-year area. However, there
seems little chance of substantial new borrowing while swap spreads remain
tight.
Swap spreads are expected, if anything, to narrow further as a result of the
gilts programme and a preference by UK corporates to stay in floating
sterling, taking advantage of historically low rates at the very short end
of the curve.
The best swap opportunities are thought likely to remain at five years, the
maturity of the Swedish issue. Even without an improvement in the swap
market, Japanese utilities are expected to be other heavy users of the
currency as an alternative to domestic yen.
The recent rally in the stock market means that the predictions late last
year of heavy issuing by UK corporates are unlikely to be fulfilled. 'We
would have thought that there are now strong grounds for corporates to look
at the equity market rather than bonds,' said Mr Charlie Hanbury-Williams of
Samuel Montagu.
The gilts programme is expected to absorb the total cash flow of UK
institutions this year, and the need to attract foreign investors could push
yields to the point where corporate borrowers opt to tap other markets
instead.
'International demand will be the key,' says Mr Simon Best of Baring
Brothers, 'and that hinges on confidence in the currency.'
Meanwhile, news last week that holders of the Pounds 135m debentures of
property group London &amp; Provincial were to be offered 95 per cent of their
money in an early repayment prompted a strong rally among other debenture
issues.
The possibility of a London &amp; Provincial default had hung over the market
for some months, and Citibank's agreement to provide the cash to pay off the
bond holders was well received - even though it was the 'first time in
living memory' that a debenture issue would be repaid at less than par, said
Mr Hugh Corbett of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Although virtually untraded, the
bonds had been quoted at only around 80.
The particular circumstances of L&amp;P are unlikely to be repeated in other
cases. But the likelihood of bond holders reinvesting their money in other
secured issues helped to drive yields generally lower.
The yield on debentures issued by Peel Holdings, among the highest-yielding
secured stocks, narrowed during the week from 289 basis points over gilts to
246 basis points. Yield spreads on longer-dated loan stocks also narrowed by
around 20 basis points.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Risk and Reward: Recovery hopes spur launch of new
derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL 1993 be the year when the UK economy finally picks itself up off the
floor?
That question helped to stimulate the launch of two new equity derivative
products last week.
The early signs suggest, though, that it will take time for these products
to make themselves as familiar a part of the investment landscape as, say,
the futures contract on the FT-SE 100 index.
Last week's instruments, from Smith New Court and Warburg Securities, are
based on the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which comprises the tier of companies just
below the top 100. These companies will outperform larger ones as the
economy recovers, the theory runs: they derive a far higher proportion of
their profits from the UK.
Sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, and the belief that the
lower interest rates that followed would rekindle economic growth in the UK,
has brought outperformance from Mid 250 stocks.
On October 12 last year, when it was launched, the new index stood at
2,403.0, 155.9 points below the FT-SE 100. By the end of last week it had
risen to above 2,900, 133 points up on the index of larger companies.
The big question for the derivatives providers, though, is how many
investors are actively following the Mid 250. Any which have reorganised
their investments to match the indices would find index-based derivatives a
natural way to make rapid changes to their asset allocations, without
needing to buy or sell the less-liquid second-tier stocks.
Early institutional reaction seems positive, though it is difficult to find
institutions that plan to trade Mid 250 futures.
Will Smith's contract eventually be superseded by a similar product on the
London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange? The idea is at
the top of Liffe's agenda, though there are no immediate plans to create a
new contract. Together with the London Stock Exchange, Liffe is examining
the use of the Mid 250 among investors to assess likely demand, an exercise
that seems likely to continue for some time.
Even if the Mid 250 is taken up, it could be unsuited to an exchange-traded
future. Few securities houses trade enough stocks in the index to allow them
to trade between the futures and cash markets. Smith reckons it is the only
one to trade all 250, though Warburg's 244 stocks give it a close enough
replication of the index.
Also, locals are unlikely to be attracted to the contract unless they think
it will generate enough liquidity to allow them to trade in and out with
ease. It could therefore prove difficult to build enough liquidity to make
the contract a success.
Warburg, meanwhile, last week produced an exchange-traded derivative based
on the Mid 250 in an attempt to appeal to those investors prevented by their
trust deeds from dealing in off-exchange instruments.
The spate of innovation in UK equity derivatives has not been limited to the
Mid 250. Smith also launched futures on five sector indices last week,
including banks, oils and water companies. OTC derivatives based on
particular sectors have been used in the past, though only as one-off
exercises.
Salomon, for instance, successfully promoted a series of call warrants based
on water stocks ahead of the UK general election last year, playing on the
politically sensitive nature of the stocks. In the end, water companies
outperformed the FT-A All-Share index by 33 per cent last year.

FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Aberdeen Petroleum faces an
uphill struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABERDEEN Petroleum, the US-based oil and gas company, faces an uphill
struggle in its attempt at a friendly merger with Brabant Resources, the
North Sea exploration group.
Large shareholders expressed scepticism last week over the approach by
Aberdeen. 'At the moment we have not got a firm proposal,' said one
shareholder. 'We have only got an idea.'
Aberdeen admitted that it had not yet presented any terms or conditions of
any potential merger. It is likely, however, that any offer would be made
purely with shares. On Friday, Aberdeen's shares closed steady at 8 1/2 p
while Brabant's were firm at 27p.
Both companies have proved disappointing for investors since coming to the
USM in the late 1980s. Aberdeen's share price has fallen from an early peak
of 34p, while the shares of Brabant have declined from a high of 160p in its
first few weeks of quotation. They each had a market value of less than
Pounds 5m last week.
Although there is widespread sympathy for consolidation of the vast number
of oil and gas stocks which are too small to raise any useful finance,
investors said they would prefer to see a merger of more similar companies.
One investor said: 'It would be more sensible to have the merger of
companies operating in similar areas.' However, he added: 'There is a case
for companies to start getting together and . . . it pays to do it at the
beginning rather than at the end.'
Other investors said they were not averse to a merger for Brabant, although
they would prefer it to be with another exploration company.
Aberdeen, which itself has been the subject of takeover speculation,
rejected the criticisms of its choice for merger.

FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: French group launches direct
insurance in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE GAN, the French-based insurance and banking company, will today
launch a new direct insurance service into the UK market.
The new company, to be called Touchline, is part of a growing push into the
so-called direct line insurance business which allows consumers to bypass
broker intermediaries by contacting the insurer directly.
The French company's move follows on the success of Bank of Scotland's
Direct Line subsidiary which pioneered telephone selling of personal
insurance in 1985.
Direct selling of personal business, such as motor and household insurance,
now accounts for around 10 per cent of the Pounds 10bn UK market.
Some 15 per cent of motor insurance alone is controlled by the direct
writers - a third of that is Direct Line - and insurance industry analysts
expect that to rise to 25 to 30 per cent of the motor insurance market by
the end of the decade.
Groupe Gan said its new subsidiary would concentrate on selling motor
insurance and in the near future would introduce household and other
personal insurance lines.
The company becomes the second major European insurer to break into the UK's
direct insurance market in the past year.
Most recently, Swiss-based Winterthur, through its UK subsidiary, Churchill,
announced its own direct insurance business.

FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nestle Merseyside package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS HAVE emerged of the offer by Nestle, the Swiss foods conglomerate,
to assist in the formation of an ice-cream company to be owned by former
Clarke Foods employees in Kirkby, Merseyside.
Nestle confirmed that it had offered production equipment and storage
facilities worth about Pounds 500,000 to get former employees at the Kirkby
factory started in an own-label ice lolly manufacturing business. The foods
group will also contribute to overheads such as security and electricity
until the end of February.
One of the workers said the equipment offered by Nestle was not 'state of
the art' although it was in good running order.
At its peak, the Kirkby factory had been capable of producing up to 40,000
ice lollies an hour. The equipment left by Nestle would allow output of
25,000 per hour, he said.
The proposed venture had already received 'significant interest' in the
placing an order from one of the site's former customers, a leading
supermarket chain.
Nestle acquired the equipment when it bought most of Clarke Foods' assets
following the company's collapse in October last year. The 67 employees at
the Kirkby site, made redundant by the receiver before Nestle moved in, had
staged a sit-in at the factory during December in an attempt to persuade the
conglomerate to keep the factory open.
The deal is contingent on the completion of a business plan and the
arrangement of financing for the proposed venture. Nestle has offered Pounds
2,500 towards the costs of devising the business plan, with the balance
likely to be paid by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The representative of the Kirkby employees said some form of Employee Share
Ownership Plan was being discussed to arrange initial financing for the new
business. Meetings had been set up with financial institutions this week to
discuss working capital finance. The venture is also receiving significant
support from the Knowsley council, which owns the freehold on the site and
has set up similar employee co-operatives.
Mr Brian Revell, of the Transport and General Workers Union, welcomed the
offer from Nestle: 'They are taking account of their social obligations to
the workers in Kirkby, which is one of the worst unemployment black spots in
the country.'

Pounds 483,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION SQUARE, which has disposed of a significant part of its property
portfolio in order to reduce debt, cut its losses from Pounds 10.48m to
Pounds 483,000 pre-tax for the year to end-March 1992.
Net interest charges fell to Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 4.41m) and exceptional
provisions were cut to Pounds 315,000 (Pounds 5.22m). However, extraordinary
charges rose to Pounds 4.98m (Pounds 3.78m). Losses per share worked through
0.43p (15.6p).
The directors said it had not been possible to conclude discussions with the
company's main bankers with a view to renewing existing facilities and
securing medium term financing prior to announcing the preliminary figures.
They warned that the group's future prospects were dependent on the outcome
of the talks but remained hopeful that agreement would be reached in the
'not too distant' future.
The results for the year were prepared on a going concern basis and
accordingly, the auditors' report carries an appropriate qualification.
Union Square's shares are traded on the USM. Its ultimate holding company is
Thompson Investments.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS World Airlines, the bankrupt and heavily-indebted US carrier, hopes to
be able to produce a reorganisation plan before February 17 - the extension
date for a reorganisation plan filing requested from the bankruptcy court.
This will be the next step in the carrier's attempted revival, following the
departure on Friday of Mr Carl Icahn, the one-time corporate raider who
gained control of TWA in 1986.
Mr Icahn agreed to relinquish all interest and control in the airline last
year, as part of a complex pact between TWA's unions, creditors and the
federal agency which ultimately underpins the airline's underfunded pension
plans.
On Friday, he formally resigned as chairman, placing his stock in escrow.
Remaining members of TWA's board - four people, including Mr Icahn - also
resigned.
Under the envisaged reorganisation plan, creditors will hold 55 per cent of
the restructured airline's shares and labour representatives, the remaining
45 per cent. Until that plan is approved by the bankruptcy court, ultimate
responsibility for running the airline rests with a two-man mangement
committee, appointed by unions and creditors, but a new board will be formed
after reorganisation.
Although Mr Icahn took large share stakes in many companies during the
1980s, TWA is one of the few that he ended up owning. He more than recouped
the cost of his TWA share stake purchase when he conducted a leveraged
buy-out of the airline, with financing from Drexel Burnham Lambert. However,
the heavy debt burden assumed by the carrier, coupled with the tough airline
industry climate, has caused TWA to make large losses throughout the 1990s.

<TEXT>
RENAULT, the French state-owned vehicle group, plans to take a 34 per cent
stake in Karosa, the biggest Czech bus maker, Reuter reports from Prague.
Mr Miroslav Hauser, a Karosa executive said: 'Renault is very much
interested and we have jointly prepared a privatisation project which is up
for approval in late January.' Mr Pavel Stejskal, head of the Czech
privatisation ministry's general engineering division, said approval would
pave the way for a joint venture with Karosa's main plant in Vysoke Myto.
Renault has agreed to pay Kcs231m (Dollars 8.25m) within 30 days of a
contract being signed and is willing to invest a further Dollars 8.25m
within three years to acquire a majority stake.
Before the fall of communism in 1989, Karosa was Czechoslovakia's sole large
bus and coach manufacturer. Renault and Volvo, the Swedish vehicle maker,
are to expand co-operation in the German car market to maximise advantages
of the alliance between the two groups, Reuter adds from Bonn.

FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: FNFC to make Pounds 50m cash
call this week - Troubled group will move to repair balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TROUBLED First National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, is
expected to ask its shareholders for up to Pounds 50m in its first rights
offering since 1986.
Along with its annual results on Friday, FNFC is expected to announce that
it will seek up to Pounds 50m through the sale of convertible preference
shares in order to repair its balance sheet.
In the six months to last April, the group had total charges for bad debts
of Pounds 64.5m, and incurred a net loss for the period of Pounds 23m. It
also took an exceptional charge of Pounds 17m related to the sale of
undeveloped property sites.
The group, whose short term borrowings rose significantly in 1991, also
faces the repayment of some Pounds 250m in bank loans this spring.
However, the loss for the second half is expected to shrink significantly to
under Pounds 10m. Profitability has been aided by the sharp drop in base
rates in recent months and the fact that its loan agreements do not require
it to pass on all of those savings to customers.
Also, it has pared roughly Pounds 400m from the group balance sheet through
securitisation and sale of loans. In October, FNFC raised Pounds 190m when
it became the first issuer to sell securities backed by secondary mortgage
loans.
Its loan book at the end of December was Pounds 900m, down from Pounds 1.3bn
the year before. The company has said that most of its troubled loans
stemmed from aggressive business it took on in the late 1980's which has
been largely repaid or written off. About half of all new business is in the
form of home improvement loans and about a third are secondary mortgages.
The company's share price has risen steadily, rising from a 1992 low of 13p
to 60p on Friday.

FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Reversal of fortune at Phar-Mor
 -The web of litigation around the US discount drugstore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE holiday tinsel has been stashed away and many remnants of the old year
consigned to the rubbish-bin. But some of 1992's debris will take longer to
bury.
The scandal at Phar-Mor, one of the more colourful US business stories in
1992, is a case in point. Last August, this 'deep discount' drugstore
operator announced it was taking a Dollars 350m charge against earnings -
the result, it claimed, of an alleged fraud and embezzlement scheme which
had led to overstated earnings and inflated stocks. Within weeks, the
Ohio-based retailer plunged from fast track to bankruptcy.
Not surprisingly, the sudden reversal of fortune created a trail of
litigation and losses. Even now, as legal processes start grinding, some big
names - including Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, Lazard Freres'
Corporate Partners investment operation and National Westminster Bank of the
UK - are still totting up the damage.
At the centre of the Phar-Mor debacle is Mr Michael Monus, a businessman in
his 40s whose family has run retail interests from Youngstown, a depressed
former steel town, for years. Mr Monus is, by all accounts, something of a
local character; aside from co-founding Phar-Mor, his notoriety stems from a
burgeoning sports empire, a messy divorce, and a 'fast lane' life-style.
Phar-Mor was born in the early-1980s after Giant Eagle, a Pittsburgh-based
grocery chain, bought out the Monus family grocery business, and contacts
between Mr Monus and Mr David Shapira, head of Giant Eagle, prompted them to
go into business together. The Phar-Mor strategy was reportedly based on a
deep-discount operation in Cleveland which they had visited together.
Phar-Mor quickly won a reputation for striking hard bargains with suppliers,
and seemed to prosper. Within a decade, annual sales had risen to Dollars
3bn, and the chain had grown to more than 300 outlets.
On the back of such prosperity, Mr Monus - whose lawyers did not return
calls - gave full rein to his private interests. He became the owner of
'Youngstown Pride', a 'World Basketball League' franchise operating as a
second-tier, professional organisation for players under 6ft 7in tall. He
also planned to become a big investor in the Colorado Rockies, one of
baseball's two expansion franchises which start playing this year.
Ironically, it was the sports ties which became the catalyst of Phar-Mor's
downfall - at least according to a lawsuit filed by Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
Phar-Mor's accountants. It claims to have first learnt of the alleged
improprieties when asked to investigate 'certain cheques paid to a travel
agent by Strouss Building Associates, a Phar-Mor related partnership, for
expenses incurred by the World Basketball League'.
This probe, the suit continues, eventually revealed that millions of dollars
had been diverted from Phar-Mor into the league. C&amp;L also says that it was
told by one of Phar-Mor's accountants of 'hidden books'.
Inevitably, how the alleged scam worked, and who was responsible for it, is
a matter of intense legal dispute. Phar-Mor, which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection within weeks of the Dollars 350m write-off
announcement, has sued C&amp;L for negligence. In turn, C&amp;L has sued Mr Shapira,
Mr Monus, and various other employees of Phar-Mor and its related companies.
Mr Monus and Mr Patrick Finn, Phar-Mor's chief financial officer were fired
almost immediately, and Mr Monus has since filed for personal bankruptcy.
That is only the beginning. According to one lawyer involved in the affair,
there are More than a dozen lawsuits outstanding. These include a class
action filed by the unquoted retailer's shareholders, and about five actions
against NatWest and its County NatWest Securities arm in the US, which
handled a private placement of Phar-Mor shares.
Among the plaintiffs are two big mutual fund operators - T. Rowe Price and
Massachusetts Financial Services - which allege NatWest/County misled
investors about Phar-Mor's financial condition.
The various lawsuits make clear how difficult untangling the truth may prove
to be. The Phar-Mor suit, for instance, blames Mr Monus, with collusion from
Mr Finn, and suggests that C&amp;L - which issued clean audit reports in 1989,
1990 and 1991 - was negligent in uncovering sizeable accounting
irregularities.
C&amp;L's own suit is more detailed. As background, it claims that Mr Shapira
and Mr Monus ran Phar-Mor 'as a personal fiefdom'. They were involved, for
example, in a number of joint ventures or partnerships which leased stores,
store fixtures and equipment to Phar-Mor. Various professional or supplier
companies run by their relatives also worked for Phar-Mor.
As to the alleged overstatements of the company's financial position, C&amp;L
maintains that it uncovered evidence of stock shortages during the 1988
audit. This, it claimed, was the result of 'short' shipments from a Giant
Eagle distribution subsidiary. However, a promised improvement in stock
control methods was then delayed for a variety of reasons - including, for
example, the employment of outside consultants to assess the situation.
The suit also notes that Mr Monus and Mr Shapira called in reputable
inventory consultants to count stocks at every store twice a year, on a
rotating basis. The consultants' reports showed no problems. And the C&amp;L
suit claims that stock levels were fictitiously inflated at each of the
stores, except those which C&amp;L itself was testing.
Whatever the truth of the claims and counter-claims, there is no doubt that
some prestigious players in the financial community have had their fingers
badly burnt. Phar-Mor was never quoted, but did place shares privately.
In June 1991, for example, Corporate Partners - the investment partnership
run by Lazard Freres - put Dollars 200m into Phar-Mor, in return for a 17
per cent equity stake. Westinghouse Electric Corporation was another victim,
taking a Dollars 100m write-off on its Phar-Mor investment last October. So
were the mutual fund investors, and so - indirectly - was NatWest/County,
which claims that the allegations against it are 'completely without merit'.
Are there any lessons to be learnt from the affair? The legal processes are
only just getting under way, but Phar-Mor may again focus attention on how
audits are conducted.
Secondly, the willingness of investors to pour money into a discount
retailer may indicate a general eagerness to unearth a second Wal-Mart - the
Arkansas-based company which grew from one 'five-and-dime' store to become
the nation's largest retailer, making a lot of shareholders very rich. The
story, alas, is rather different this time.

FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Rank faces questions over film
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and RAY SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE possible sale of Rank Organisation's film interests is likely to
dominate investors' questions when the leisure and entertainment group
announces annual results on Thursday.
Analysts are expecting the heavily indebted company to report pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 233m and Pounds 245m, against Pounds 254m last
time.
Rank refused to comment on weekend speculation of an offer from a consortium
involving Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4.
It is understood that no formal approach has been made, while Mr Michael
Gifford, Rank's chief executive, has stressed the business has not actively
been put up for sale.
However, Mr Grade has confirmed that he is in contact with an unnamed bidder
for Rank's film business. The potential bidder, believed to be a consortium
of investors, is being advised by Chemical Bank. Mr Grade has said he would
be prepared to be a non-executive director of the Rank Organisation's film
and cinema business if it is sold.
Rank is in the process of trying to reduce its almost Pounds 1bn debt
through disposals of assets such as hotels. To date, it has sold just four
of the 22 hotels earmarked for disposal, raising about Pounds 88m. In
December 1991 Rank sold its motorway services arm for Pounds 90m. The debt
was largely the result of the Mecca takeover in 1990.
The film interests, which include the Odeon cinema chain and Pinetree

FT  11 JAN 93 / An experiment to find a panacea for recession: The forays by
bulk chemical groups into the speciality market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arrival last week of Laporte, the UK's largest speciality chemical
group, in the takeover battle for Evode, one its brethren, has cast an
unaccustomed light on the speciality chemicals sector.
During the mid-1980s speciality chemicals groups became highly fashionable.
In the previous recession, European and North American commodity groups had
enviously eyed the performance of speciality groups.
The concept behind speciality chemicals is quite simple, says Mr Ken Minton,
Laporte chief executive. Whereas commodity chemicals are sold on price
alone, specialities are sold for other considerations. The business differs
from bulk chemicals because it is research-orientated, changing the product
to meet the customer's need.
With the advantage of low capital investment, higher than average growth
rates and profits, speciality groups appeared inoculated against economic
downturns. Imperial Chemical Industries, the international chemicals group,
created a specialities division after estimating that in Europe and the US,
the average return (operating profits as a percentage of average total
assets) of speciality operations fell from 20 per cent in 1980 to 13 per
cent in 1983. Those of bulk businesses dropped from 10 per cent to 2 per
cent over the same period.
The theory was that the European and North American commodity groups could
acquire these speciality groups to offset the worst effects economic
downturns. 'Virtually without exception, the commodities groups saw
specialities as a panacea. During the mid-1980s, they launched themselves
lemming-like into the sector,' says Ms Hilfra Tandy, editor of Chemical
Matters, an industry newsletter.
So much for the theory. During this recession, the reality has been rather
different. Expectations among the large chemical groups that their
speciality chemicals operations would balance the effects of cyclical
commodity downturns have largely been dashed. While most small speciality
groups have continued to prosper during the recession, the speciality
divisions of most large chemicals combines have performed poorly. 'To be
frank, the specialities experiment has been a disaster,' says Mr Stuart
Wamsley, editor of Focus on Chemicals, an industry newsletter.
Take, for example, the operating margins of ICI's speciality chemicals
division which fell from 9.3 per cent in 1989 to an estimated 3.8 per cent
last year. The division is expected to be in loss in the fourth quarter of
1992. Meanwhile, in France, Rhone-Poulenc's speciality division had
operating margins of 5 per cent in 1989, was in loss the following year, and
generated margins of only 0.6 per cent in 1991. Its results are expected to
have improved during 1992.
The poor results of the large groups compare with margins of 14 per cent
last year at Laporte and 16.3 per cent at Allied Colloids, another UK
speciality group.
Such comparisons are not totally fair. Defining a speciality chemical
business is not easy. What might be defined as a speciality by ICI, could be
interpreted as a commodity chemical by Allied Colloids. Moreover, different
speciality operations offer varying margins. However, it is true to say that
speciality chemicals businesses have fared better in small rather than large
companies.
One the reasons for the relative failure of the large groups is their
inability to appreciate the cultural differences between commodity and
speciality chemicals.
'A speciality customer is prepared to pay more because the supplier has a
monopoly, or has a better product, or his salesmanship is better. A bulk
chemical manufacturer is obsessed by production - cutting costs to improve
margins. But for specialities, marketing becomes far more important than
production chemistry,' explains Mr Minton.
The key to marketing is to produce small batches of products specifically
designed for the customer. The effect, according to Mr Minton, is that the
customer is prepared to pay a premium for the tailored product.
Mr Minton claims most large groups failed to understand this when they
acquired their speciality groups. This reduced the speciality businesses'
ability to react quickly to market demands.
Mr Wamsley gives the example of the respective polyacrylamide businesses of
Dow, the US giant, and Allied Colloids. He says during the mid-1980s Allied
Colloids was generating 20 per cent growth a year and enjoyed high margins
while Dow, Allied's main competitor, was losing money. 'Dow just couldn't
compete. Allied was fast, flexible and customer-orientated. It was devising
products for the customer. Dow had a range of products which it then sold.
What's more it didn't provide the same levels of service,' says Mr Wamsley.
The bulk companies were not discriminating when making acquisitions. 'The
bulk chemicals groups were so large that they had to acquire large numbers
of these small niche companies to make any difference to their overall
performance. In the rush to acquire, some businesses were not well
understood - some were rash,' says Mr Michael Bennett, director at
consultants Arthur D Little.
According to Mr Wamsley, some groups have decided the impact of specialities
was negligible and could not justify the time, effort and costs involved in
running them. For example, Union Carbide, the US giant, has disposed of most
of its non-bulk activities. The proposed split of ICI into two groups,
Zeneca with the pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialities operations,
and the rump keeping the bulk chemicals business, is part of the trend.
Not all believe the 1980s speciality strategy was mistaken. Ms Jackie
Ashurst, European chemicals analyst at broker James Capel, says investors
and the companies themselves may have been too impatient. Building up
speciality businesses requires research and development effort as well as
time. Although they have not proved successful in this recession, non-bulk
chemicals may well triumph during the next downturn.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Trafalgar House wins Pounds 100m US contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the construction, engineering and shipping group, has won a
contract worth more than Pounds 100m to build a new coking plant for
Bethlehem Steel in the US.
The deal, won against stiff competition from US and German rivals, is the
second biggest contract won by Trafalgar House since its takeover of Davy,
the process plant contractor, in 1991.
It comes five weeks after Trafalgar House reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds
30.3m for the year ended September 30 after exceptional property
write-downs.
Trafalgar House, which holds its annual meeting today, has stressed the
benefits of acquiring a new 'leg' through Davy's metals and minerals plant
contracting expertise.
Early last year, it won a Pounds 140m contract for an aluminium strip plant
in Egypt. The latest deal, won by Davy International, is a turnkey contract
to rebuild Bethlehem's number two coke oven battery at its Burns Harbor,
Indiana works.
Mr Ian Robinson, chairman of Trafalgar House engineering division, said
Bethlehem's investment showed its commitment to maintain its position as one
of the leading integrated steel producers in the US.
The outlook for steel plant contractors in the US was beginning to improve
after a period where clients had been cutting back or delaying investments,
he said.
The plant is due for completion in early 1995, and will comply with the 1991
US Clean Air Act. Coking, where coal is turned into metallurgical coke for
use in the blast furnace, is one of the most environmentally sensitive
stages of the steelmaking process.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Economics Notebook: The burden of Germany's reserve currency
status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the post-war decades, as West Germany recovered its economic and
financial strength, the Bundesbank withstood use of the D-Mark as a reserve
currency.
The monetary conservatives at the Bundesbank's helm believed an overhang of
foreign-held D-Marks would be a dangerous burden, liable to depress the
currency at times of political or economic tension.
The aversion of people like Mr Otmar Emminger, Bundesbank president in
1977-79, was strengthened by observation of the painful dismantling of
sterling's reserve currency role in the 1960s and 1970s.
Then at the beginning of the 1980s Germans discovered that widespread
reserve use of the D-Mark was impossible to prevent and could bring
benefits.
The D-Mark's international status grew during the 1980s in line with its
fundamental strength. Now German economic performance is being dented by the
effects of reunification.
Germany's inflation rate is the sixth highest of Europe's 18 industrialised
economies. Its current account has tipped into the red and the deficit is
expected to persist, at least into 1994.
As a result of the deterioration in parts of the German economy, some of the
disadvantages of reserve currency status feared by Mr Emminger are coming to
the fore.
Nervousness about whether foreign D-Mark investors will maintain their
holdings provide one reason why the D-Mark may be relatively weak in coming
months.
The D-Mark has fallen against the dollar since Governor Bill Clinton's US
election victory in November. This reflected foreign exchanges' belief that
Mr Clinton will preside over a US recovery. The D-Mark/dollar move repeats
the pattern of the previous two US presidential elections (see chart). This
time the effect could be more permanent.
Much attention focused last week on the Bundesbank's cut in interest rates,
when it lowered its money market rate by just 0.15 percentage points. The
Bundesbank's decision to leave discount and Lombard rates unchanged was
primarily due to concern about inflationary pressures caused by the German
budget deficit.
But the Bundesbank's caution may also reflect worries that faster credit
easing would expose the D-Mark to greater risk of further decline against
the dollar.
Up to now, the D-Mark's international status has been a source of strength.
According to the Bundesbank's figures for end-1991, official D-Mark assets
amount to about DM230bn (Pounds 91bn), 18 per cent of world currency
reserves. Foreigners' holdings of the German currency are well over
DM1,000bn.
Since unification in October 1990, the D-Mark's reserve currency status has
proved a considerable benefit. Germany has claimed the traditional reserve
currency privilege: it has paid its bills in its own currency, without
repercussions on the exchange rate.
At the end of last year, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president,
acknowledged the advantages of the D-Mark's international use. But he also
made clear that, given the volume of D-Marks held abroad, Germany would face
risks if foreigners ever feared that Germany was departing from sound money
principles.
The scale of these potential pitfalls is illustrated by Bundesbank figures
for Germany's overall foreign assets and liabilities. Germany expanded its
net foreign assets from DM373bn at end-1988 to a peak DM564bn in June 1991.
The onset of current account deficits reduced the net asset position by
DM54bn during the 12 months to June 1992.
Overall, Germany's international financial position remains strong. But it
will be undermined unless Germany reverses the swing to current account
deficit. And this might make foreign D-Mark investors prone to sell their
holdings.
Mr Schlesinger has not forgotten the forebodings of Mr Emminger. In coming
months, Mr Schlesinger will not make much explicit reference to the holders
of the DM1,000bn worth of D-Mark assets abroad. But they will be at the
forefront of his mind. And he will do his best to ensure they do not move
back into the dollar.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Hanson in gold swap to expand coal interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the UK conglomerate, is understood to have arranged to swap its gold
mining operations in the US for the coal business of Santa Fe Pacific, the
railroads and minerals group.
The deaI, estimated to involve assets worth Dollars 500m (Pounds 324m) on
each side, would consolidate Hanson's position as the world's second-largest
privately-owned coal producer and place Santa Fe among the top 10 North
American gold producers.
The companies' proposals are being studied by the US Internal Revenue
Service, because of the swap's tax-free status, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and possibly the anti-trust authorities.
Hanson hopes to acquire Santa Fe's 720m tonnes of coal reserves and the Lee
Ranch mine in New Mexico which produces about 4m tonnes a year and supplies
two big electricity producers in the south-west US.
In return, Santa Fe, best known for its 132-year-old Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe railroad, would take Gold Fields Mining Corporation. One of GFMC's
two mines, Chimney Creek in Nevada, adjoins Santa Fe's Rabbit Creek mine and
together they would lend themselves to a 'superpit' development.
In the year to end-September, Chimney Creek and GFMC's Mesquite mine in
California, together produced a record 431,000 troy ounces of gold and have
proven reserves of 7.5m ounces. Cash production costs at the GFMC mines are
among the lowest in the industry at Dollars 108m an ounce.
Santa Fe owns three gold mines in Nevada, producing more than 300,000 ounces
annually, and recently indicated it would consider spinning off its minerals
business. In 1990 the group spun off its energy and property interests.
Hanson acquired GFMC in August 1989 when it took over Consolidated Gold
Fields, the UK-based group, for Dollars 3.5bn and the gold company has been
up for sale since then. During the Gold Fields bid battle GFMC was valued at
more than Dollars 1.1bn. Industry sources suggest GFMC is now being valued
at Dollars 500m.
Hanson's foray into US coal began with the Gold Fields acquisition. This
also brought with it a 49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining which partly
owned Peabody Coal, the second-largest US producer. Hanson took full control
of Peabody for Dollars 715m early in 1990 and at the time Lord White,
chairman of the group's US operations, suggested coal would continue to be
an important long-term source of energy in the US and that new technologies
would increase its efficiency as a low-cost fuel.
Coal is now Hanson's fastest-growing business and accounts for more than 30
per cent of the group's capital employed.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Smith tries to cool Labour row over lessons of Clinton
victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH tried to cool the continuing row in the Labour party over the
relevance of Mr Bill Clinton's US election victory by insisting yesterday
that no one advocated copying his policies in the UK.
But, in a gesture to the so-called modernisers in the party, the Labour
leader argued that lessons could be learnt from the Democrats' campaigning
style and their head-on critique of a 'totally free market' approach to
economic management.
Within a few hours, however, senior Labour politicians were again publicly
debating the significance of the Clinton campaign, adding to the heated
controversy that began last week and continued at a conference with the US
president-elect's team in London on Saturday.
In a series of interviews on BBC radio, critics of the party's image-makers
expressed disquiet that too much was being made of the US campaign. Ms Clare
Short MP, a national executive committee member, said individuals were using
a Clinton 'myth' to try to ditch long-established values and distance Labour
from the unions and the poor.
Mr Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader, added that while he believed
the Clinton campaign had important lessons, those who sought to abandon
Labour's goal of more social equality should join the Liberal Democrats or
progressive Tories.
Earlier, Mr Smith had used his first major public appearance of the new year
to give some clues about how far he was ready to embrace reform. In a
wide-ranging BBC interview, he indicated that he would push for the
substitution of the trade unions' block vote at the annual party conference
with an alternative that gives union delegates a role as individuals.
Repeating an earlier commitment to base Labour's internal democracy on the
principle of one member, one vote, he said:'We must complete the process of
modernising our constitution by the conference of this year.' He brushed
aside a suggestion that Labour should abandon Clause IV of its constitution
 -the controversial commitment to state control  - as unimportant.
He also refused to be drawn on whether he supported electoral reform for the
Commons. That would be left to the conference to discuss after the review
committee, chaired by Lord Plant, had reported its recommendations to the
national executive, he said.
On the economy, the Labour leader said he opposed any moves to increase
taxes in the Budget, adding that the government's top priority should be to
tackle rising unemployment.

FT  11 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Friday's trading statement from Boots has well and truly burst the euphoric
bubble which had surrounded the stores sector. Weakness in the Do-It-All
joint venture with WH Smith is perhaps not surprising. The chain is a weak
third competitor in a market which has been riven by price wars and
over-capacity. Perhaps the simplest solution would be for Do-it-All to
withdraw. But markets rarely work so neatly and the optimism of both joint
venturers bodes ill.
WH Smith is likely to share in another of Boots' headaches. The Nintendo and
Sega computer games craze has cannibalised many other areas of the
childrens' present market this Christmas, with video and recorded music
sales notably affected. The music business claims that the soggy trend in
compact disc sales is due to a lack of new albums. But the expiry of singles
and the high price of discs may be pricing the traditional teenage audience
out of the market.
More generally, Boots' statement adds to the picture of a patchy Christmas.
There was a late burst of spending for some retailers which carried over
into the January sales. Yet strong January spending may not be a sign of
retail health: it may only show that consumers held off before Christmas.
The stores sector is at best sputtering into 1993 and it still has fully to
face the challenge of rising import prices. Those retailers which source at
home will have an edge this year.

FT  11 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: French property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The comparison between the strains afflicting the French currency and
property markets is inexact, but intriguing nonetheless. In both cases the
French financial establishment has stepped in to prevent disorderly conduct.
But while the franc last week seemed to have scraped through the worst, the
property market is running into real strains.
Paris rental values have dropped 20 per cent from their peak. About 300,000
square metres of office space will come on to the market this year while
vacancy rates are climbing. Some 6 per cent of office space remains unlet.
In some areas, such as La Defense, the business district west of Paris, it
may be twice that level. Some developers are already squealing. Last week
saw another, Pierre Premier, hand over most of its portfolio to the banks.
The latter have tried to underpin the market but bad debt provisions have
mounted alarmingly. French banks are estimated to have a FFr400bn (Pounds
48.6bn) exposure to the property sector. Nearly a quarter of that lending
must now be classified as doubtful.
But France's property troubles are not as bad as those that have beset the
UK, US or Japan. High interest rates have choked off new development;
over-supply is far less than in the UK; the underlying economy is stronger.
And the French financial community has shown itself more sophisticated in
defending an orderly market. The French property crise is still painful, but
it is not so dire as to dampen the economic benefits of lower interest rates
when they finally come.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tension in the Middle East may have been a talking point in currency markets
last week. But the wobble on Wall Street was due more to domestic factors:
renewed worry about the size of the federal deficit and disappointing
unemployment figures. With the signals from the incoming Clinton
administration still confused, it is premature to draw firm policy
conclusions, but the market response has at least underlined how dependent
equities are on a healthy bond market.
The worry is that a weak recovery will force Mr Clinton to focus on fiscal
pump priming rather than on deficit reduction. That would mean additional
supply of Treasury bonds in a market already weighed down by a glut of
corporate and supranational issues. Equities already look fully valued both
in terms of a forward multiple of around 17 and a bond/dividend yield ratio
of 2.6. Any increase in bond rates makes the forward multiple look
expensive. Share prices have to adjust down even if earnings expectations
stay the same.
Robust economic recovery, of course, could cause the Fed to tighten. That
would be a serious challenge for equities. But employment creation looks
weak enough to delay such a move for several months. In any case it would
take a large rate increase to enable money market funds to compete with
equities again. Equities must hope for just enough recovery to keep the bond
market happy.

FT  11 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: A glut of gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the Bank of England's silence on Friday, the gilts market is braced
for an auction announcement this week. Favoured is a further issue of 8.5
per cent paper due 2007 which will become deliverable into the gilt future
later this year. A partly-paid structure would also increase demand and,
coincidentally, allow the government to tuck away funds for 1993-94 when it
has to borrow Pounds 1bn a week. But it will take more than a little
stocking up to satisfy that need.
Indeed, the authorities must already be examining a range of structures that
might help tap particular pockets of cash. An obvious one is the convertible
gilt. That would involve selling short term paper, convertible into long.
Institutions with long-term investment horizons could then profit from any
buoyancy at the short end of the market as European rates fall. Another
candidate for revival is variable rate gilts - which might have special
appeal to banks if the funding rules were changed. Or the Bank could borrow
a Euromarket concept and issue gilts convertible into residual shares held
by the government in privatised companies. To attract overseas investors it
could issue gilts redeemable in D-Marks at a guaranteed exchange rate.
Such innovations might give the impression of desperation. If they were
tailored to satisfy genuine investor requirements, however, they might help
at the margin. There is no single solution to the looming funding problem.
The Bank may also have to act on the suggestion from Warburg Securities that
it move to monthly auctions. Ultimately, however, meeting the borrowing
requirement will depend on attracting overseas money. That will require a
wider difference between gilt yields and German Bunds than the present 140
basis points. The question is whether this will be achieved through higher
yields on gilts or lower ones on Bunds.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Curbs on regulators' powers urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in Britain's priv-atised utilities are being treated unfairly by
regulators who take unpredictable decisions and operate in excessive
secrecy, according to a report published today from the European Policy
Forum, the free market think-tank.
The EPF was launched six months ago with the public support of Mr John
Major, the prime minister, and is headed by Mr Graham Mather, the former
director of the Institute of Economic Affairs.
The report says utility regulators rely excessively on the personal styles
of their heads, whose discretionary power makes them prey to short-term
political interference, especially in the energy market.
The report recommends merging many of the regulators into fewer bodies with
reduced powers to amend utility licences.
It says regulators' decisions are often shrouded in secrecy - most do not
hold public hearings - and there is also too little consultation by the
regulators. Appeal systems are also inadequate.
The report is likely to fuel controversy over the role and performance of
the utility regulators, not least among the companies they regulate.
Yesterday Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, which has been
involved in a protracted and acrimonious struggle with Ofgas, its regulator,
welcomed the study.
'Obviously, we need a regulatory framework but one that is fair, more
accountable and responsible,' he said. 'This will ensure the balance of
interests of all concerned. What regulation needs is a code of behaviour
consistent with the Cadbury report on good corporate governance.' The
Cadbury report was published last May.
But Sir James McKinnon, the director-general of Ofgas, said the EPF appeared
to be under a serious misapprehension about the power of the regulators. 'To
suggest regulators act at their own discretion flies in the face of the fact
that there is law covering these matters. Regulators take their steps by
following the law.'
He implied it would be wrong to merge Ofgas and Offer, the electricity
regulator. 'Gas and electricity are competitors and the industries have
entirely different dynamics.'
The EPF, he added, seemed to want to tip the present balance between
customer and shareholder interests in favour of shareholders.
The report recommends merging regulatory bodies and reducing their powers to
amend utility licences:
Ofgas and Offer should be combined into a single Office of Energy
Regulation.
An Office of Communications should replace Oftel, the Independent Television
Commission, the Radio Authority and the Broadcasting Standards Council.
The proposed rail regulators and the regulatory arm of the Civil Aviation
Authority should merge into an Office of Transport.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Italy to issue DM4bn Eurobonds: Government takes steps to
supplement depleted foreign currency reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government, absent from international capital markets for two
years, is expected to test its credibility among foreign investors this week
as it launches one of the largest Eurobonds issued in D-Marks.
The planned issue, expected to raise about DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to
supplement depleted foreign currency reserves, would be the first since last
year's political crisis and the currency turmoil which led to the suspension
of the lira from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Deutsche Bank has been asked to arrange the country's first-ever Eurobond
offering in D-Marks which could be launched as early as today.
Italy's credit standing has deteriorated over the past two years, forcing it
to abandon the international financial markets and rely instead on domestic
savers to finance its large budget deficit.
Italy, which until the early 1990s enjoyed the top triple-A rating allowing
it to borrow at the cheapest rates, suffered an unusual two-notch cut in its
rating by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, in the
midst of last summer's political and economic turmoil.
This blow to Italy's credit standing has been one factor encouraging the
government to tackle its budget deficit. The government of Mr Giuliano Amato
has pushed through a tough austerity package for 1993.
The new issue will be be one of the largest D-Mark Eurobond issues seen so
far and compares with the DM5.5bn issue launched in October by the British
government, one of a succession of European countries which queued up to
borrow the German currency after last year's European currency crisis
depleted their foreign currency reserves.
Some central banks had an obligation to repay the Bundesbank in D-Marks for
the support it gave to their currencies.
The pricing of the bonds is expected to be cautious to reflect the
importance of the issue's success. A meeting of banks will be held in
Frankfurt today, and pricing is likely to take place tomorrow. They are
expected to have a maturity of five years and offer a yield spread of 50-55
basis points (0.5 to 0.55 percentage points) over the yield of five-year
German government bonds.
This compares with a spread of around 10 basis points for the UK issue in
October, although spreads for all borrowers have widened since then.
The issue will also be the first test of the country's worldwide standing
since international banks suffered problems last year with Efim, the Italian
state holding company which was put into voluntary liquidation last July.
Italian borrowers were also effectively shut out of the international
syndicated loans market while bankers lobbied the Italian authorities for a
commitment to repay Efim's debts in full. Although the authorities
eventually agreed, bankers have still not received their money.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Top Kenyan poll official's debts were written off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYAN government officials ordered a state-controlled bank to write off the
Ks30m (Pounds 555,000) debt of a former judge soon after he was appointed to
chair the commission that organised last month's election, according to
legal sources in Nairobi.
Further information about the financial record of Mr Zachaeus Chesoni,
appointed to the commission in September 1991, is contained in a
confidential file given to Mr Justice Telford Georges, leader of the
38-member Commonwealth group that monitored the poll.
In his first public comment on the dossier, Mr Justice Georges sharply
rebuked the Kenyan authorities. Interviewed by telephone in the Bahamas, he
said: 'The government should not have persisted in keeping Mr Chesoni on as
chairman of the electoral commission.'
Bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Chesoni were initiated by the Kenya
Commercial Finance Co Ltd, part of the state-owned Kenya Commercial Bank.
The bank obtained judgment in its favour but was instructed by a government
official not to pursue its claim.
The file reveals that in 1984 a state-controlled bank dropped an action to
recover a Ks20.9m debt incurred while he was a high court judge. During
1990, the bank revived its action to enforce the judgment. But in 1991,
according to legal sources in Nairobi familiar with the case, the bank wrote
to its lawyers telling them to drop the action because the government had
instructed the bank to write off the debt, now standing at Ks30m as a result
of accrued interest.
This occurred soon after the decision to appoint Mr Chesoni to the electoral
commission.
Opposition parties have rejected the election, saying that electoral
malpractices helped President Daniel arap Moi retain the presidency.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Japan covets lead role in Asia: 'Miyazawa's doctrine' will
set out a change in regional emphasis for his country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Our rise can be likened to that of a person who opens a tiny shop, works
relentlessly to increase profits and save money and, one day, looks around
to find that the shop is one of the biggest in the neighbourhood. We can no
longer simply think only of ourselves - Professor Shinkichi Eto, president
of Asia University, Tokyo.
When Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, touches down in Thailand on
Friday as part of a four-nation tour of south-east Asia, he will deliver a
speech billed by his government as an important postwar review of the
country's role in Asia. It is already being dubbed the 'Miyazawa doctrine'.
Mr Miyazawa will show due deference to the US, stressing the strategic
importance of its security role. But, between the lines, the speech will
suggest that Asians should settle their own disputes and that Japan will
gradually move closer to centre stage.
His visit to Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Thailand comes as the Japanese
recognise that the political and economic sands are shifting. On the eve of
a new US presidency, which Tokyo expects will be inward-looking, and with
Asian nations debating how they should solve regional security issues, the
Japanese government senses an opportunity to reform its small-shopkeeper
mentality.
Japan's bilateral ties in Asia are as complex as the individual nations are
diverse. The relationship with China is haunted by history and a sense of
inferiority, while links with south-east Asia are coloured by Japan's
wartime brutality.
However, Tokyo feels that the time has come to develop an 'Asia policy',
with principles as relevant to South Korea as to Burma. Mr Miyazawa's tour
will not finalise that policy, but marks an important step along the way.
Japan's Asia policy cannot be considered without reference to the US. In the
postwar period, the US has been Japan's largest market by far, and
maintaining stable relations was the first priority for a country with an
export-driven economy. Bowing to the US lead on foreign policy and defence
issues allowed the Japanese government to concentrate on civilian
development and avoid awkward foreign-policy decisions.
Differences have emerged between US and Japanese interests. Japan has seen
the period since the June 1989 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square as an opportunity to improve relations with
China, while other countries, including the US, were treating it coolly.
Japanese business sees Vietnam as an ideal location for low-cost, offshore
production facilities, and Tokyo recently resumed aid to Hanoi, while the US
maintains its embargo on business with Vietnam.
Japan is increasingly reliant on trade in Asian markets. They account for 41
per cent of its total trade, while north America accounts for 30 per cent;
five years ago, both regions had 35 per cent.
The government is concerned that the North American Free Trade Agreement,
encompassing the US, Canada and Mexico, may become a trade bloc, prompting
more serious thought in Asia about the need for a regional free-trade area.
While Japan is concerned about a North American trade bloc, some US Congress
representatives have complained of a 'yen bloc' in Asia. Research by Bank of
Tokyo found a 50 per cent rise in the proportion of yen-denominated imports
over the past five years, 'attributable not only to a relative decline in
trading transactions with the US, but also to a relative increase in trade
with east and south-east Asia, where the share of yen-denominated
transactions has traditionally been high'.
The Japanese government has not wanted to offend the US or China, or other
leading trading partners. But the larger Tokyo's political profile, the more
it is likely to draw criticism from countries apprehensive about an expanded
role.
A flurry of recent government reports - though they lack detail on
politically sensitive initiatives - suggests there is agreement in Tokyo
that Japan should take a political stand.
'As the Asia-Pacific region gains further influence and moves towards
becoming an open, pluralistic region with a central role in the global
community, the Japanese people must assume a heavy responsibility,' says a
prime ministerial advisory panel in Japan and the Asia-Pacific Region in the
21st Century, published last month.
The report, which forms the core of the 'Miyazawa doctrine', says that, in
economic terms, Asia will be the 'world's brightest spot over the next
century'.
For Japan, the region is already the bright spot amid the gloom of
international recession. A survey by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry shows the average return on sales for Japanese manufacturing
projects in Asia is 5 per cent, compared with 3.2 per cent in Europe and -
0.9 per cent in the US.
Japanese direct investment overseas fell 27 per cent last fiscal year and a
further 12 per cent in the first half this year, but investment in China
will double this year, and has risen in Indonesia and Vietnam.
Though Japanese electronics makers have had a difficult three years at home
and in the US and Europe, annual growth in demand for televisions in Asia
was 10.1 per cent over the past five years, for VCRs 21 per cent, and for
motor vehicles 26 per cent, according to Mitsubishi Bank.
Japan, frustrated at being perceived as just a car salesman, has already
been seeking to expand its international role, especially in Asia. Foreign
bilateral aid spending was increased 69 per cent over the five years to
1991. East Asia received 47 per cent of the money.
Tokyo is likewise keen to play a leading role in the international debate on
the environment.
It is also accumulating a small list of Asian policy successes. It is the
principal contributor to funding for the UN operation in Cambodia, and its
dispatch - after agonising debate in Japan - of peace-keeping personnel to
Cambodia has generally been perceived, at home and abroad, as a useful
contribution.
However, the most difficult challenges in developing an all-encompassing
Asia policy will be in responding to issues such as the rapidly developing
sophistication of Chinese military hardware. It will also mean finding a
security role which respects the concerns of countries that suffered under
the Japanese military, but which allows Japan to play a part in solving
regional disputes such as that over the Spratly Islands - atolls in the
South China Sea claimed by China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei
and Taiwan.
A serious obstacle to developing such a coherent policy is the decayed state
of the Japanese political system.
A report on Japan's priorities for 1993 by the Keidanren, the Japanese
industry federation, said that political reform will be at the centre of any
serious changes in social or foreign policy. According to the 21st Century
report, Japan must build a 'mature democratic government', meaning that the
political system should be more responsive to foreign policy challenges and
less obsessed by factional fights within the ruling Liberal Democratic
party.
That will also mean elaborating a more coherent framework for Japan's
foreign relations. Neither the bureaucracy, which is crucial to the policy
process, nor the LDP has articulated principles on democracy in Asia, for
example. The military regime in Burma is still receiving aid. And when Mr
Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, explained his democracy proposals to
Mr Miyazawa, the prime minister said 'I understand', preferring not to give
an opinion. Officially, such statements are justified as respect for 'the
diverse routes' to democracy.
The need for more durable principles was stressed in another officially
sponsored report, intended to be the cornerstone of a redefined US-Japan
relationship. Prepared by select executives and academics, the report says
Japan must clearly explain its vision 'on which it must take action as a
responsible great power, not passively responding to external pressure from
the US or any other foreign nation'.
If the small shopkeeper does begin to behave as a 'great power', the
challenge to redefine perceptions and policies will be as great for Japan's
partners as it is now for Japan itself.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Nationalising the police
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR a radical reorganisation of the police service in England and
Wales are to be discussed by a special cabinet committee this week. The
plans would reduce the number of police authorities, transfer responsibility
for police funding to Whitehall and put police committees under the control
of government appointees. If agreed, they amount to the effective
nationalisation of the police, a step which is not only unnecessary but also
undesirable.
At present, the police service is provided by 43 police authorities. They
receive 49 per cent of funding from local government and 51 per cent from
central government. Elected councillors fill two-thirds of the places on the
authorities, with the balance going to magistrates. Some authorities share
boundaries with county councils; others span several local government areas,
with representatives from each. The exception is London's Metropolitan
Police, which is directly accountable to the home secretary, because of its
national importance.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, is proposing to reduce the number of
police authorities, possibly to 25. Their funding would come entirely from
the government. No doubt in consequence, the government would appoint the
majority of police authority members. Policing would become a national
service, delivered by quangos largely unaccountable to those they serve.
Civil liberties
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is reported to be opposing this
further diminution in local accountability. He is right: too many public
services are now in the hands of unelected Whitehall officials. It is also
undesirable on civil liberties grounds that so much power be concentrated in
the home secretary's hands. In a country where one-party rule is dangerously
close to entrenchment, locally accountable police services are part of an
essential system of checks and balances.
Centralisation is also wrong from the point of view of effectively tackling
crime. It is true that some forms of criminal activity require a national
approach. But this can be tackled - as it already is - through co-operation
between police forces to deal with problems such as terrorism and drug
trafficking. Police action to stop flying pickets moving around the country
during the last miners' strike demonstrated that effective national action
was possible even in conditions of political controversy.
Trusting relationship
More important, the success of day-to-day policing depends on relationships
between the police and the communities they serve. Without trust, the flow
of information central to preventing crime and catching criminals dries up.
So too does confidence in the responsiveness of the police service, an
essential element in creating a safe and secure environment. Such
relationships are unlikely to be fostered by a police service run from
London.
There may be a case for fewer police authorities. It may be true - though it
has yet to be proved - that larger forces are more efficient. And police
authorities coterminous with counties may be prone to the political
interference that dogged the old watch committees when police forces were
under municipal control. A breakdown in the relationship between the former
chief constable of Derbyshire and local politicians on the county council
led to a deterioration in the standard of policing in that county in the
1980s.
However, the police services should be more independent of Whitehall, not
less. If change is needed, it should be directed towards strengthening the
accountability of police authorities to elected local authorities. The shape
of those authorities is currently under review by Sir John Banham's Local
Government Commission. Change should therefore be deferred until the
Commission has completed its reorganisation of local government.
In any case, the Sheehy Inquiry is examining police pay, grading and
efficiency. Further changes in policing procedures are likely to follow the
report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. Mr Clarke has more than
enough on his plate without this undesirable centralisation of yet another
public service.

Why is it that management magazines seem to suffer from more executive
turmoil than most businesses they report on? Only a week after Observer drew
attention to the rapid turnover of editors at Britain's Management Today,
comes news of a behind-the-scenes editorial coup at the Harvard Business
Review, organ of the world's best known management school.
The arrival of New York Times columnist Joel Kurtzman, 45, in the new job of
executive editor at HBR, seems to have swept the chair from under T George
Harris, appointed editor in August after previously running Psychology Today
and American Health.
True, the 67-year-old Harris - hired, reputedly for his professional
publishing skills, to replace Harvard academic Rosabeth Moss Kanter -
remains editor nominally. But it looks unlikely that his name will long top
the masthead, given that Kurtzman reports directly to the magazine's
publisher instead of through Harris.

It's not the best of new years for the World Bank's globe-trotting staff. In
a cost-cutting drive by its president, former J P Morgan boss Lewis Preston,
first-class air travel as a matter of course has been restricted to
vice-presidents and above. For lesser mortals, it's business class on
flights of under 12 hours, which covers nearly all Europe and Latin America.
Preston's move will be popular in Washington where few officials enjoy
comparable perks. But it could be embarrassing for Michel Camdessus, boss of
the World Bank's sister organisation, the International Monetary Fund.
His staff still take first-class travel for granted.

<TEXT>
To judge by the frequency of people's claims to know how to do it, turning
water into motor fuel is a doddle. To go by the number on record as having
actually done so, however, it's rarer than the transformation of water into
wine.
The latest claimant is Professor Ilya Varshavsky of Moscow's Institute of
Theoretical Engineering.  'Beneath our feet is an inexhaustible supply of
fuel,' he says, referring to sand as a source of silicon. Apparently, if a
pinch of the latter is popped into the water-filled reactor fitted to his
Moskvitch limo, hey presto: out comes hydrogen to power the car.
'The basic research has already been done,' he told an interviewer from the
Russian Information Agency, expressing confidence that the process will be
widely used in everything from 'cars to the construction of a lunar base'.
Unfortunately, when Observer's colleague in Moscow called the institute for
clarification, he was told everyone was on holiday. Nor is the FT's science
correspondent entirely happy with the idea, saying that it's impossible to
see how silicon can generate hydrogen from water without an energy source.
One possibility would be a sun-powered photovoltaic cell made from silicon
which can produce electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Even
so, the device would at best be of little use during during Russia's long
bleak winter.

Businessmen beware. Being chairman of a big quango is one way to collect a
knighthood. But it can also damage your reputation if the quango misbehaves.
Is the risk worth taking?
Both the Welsh Development Agency and the West Midlands Regional Health
Authority are seeking new figureheads after government watchdogs reprimanded
them for sloppy financial behaviour. The agency's chairman, Gwyn Jones, is
hanging on until a successor is found, but Sir James Ackers has resigned
after 10 years as chairman of the country's largest regional health
authority following growing disquiet about its money management.
Ackers's decision to quit is a cautionary tale for other business folk.
Perhaps he should have spent more time keeping an eye on the family
truck-rental business, a casualty of the recession, than collecting his
various quangoships.
At various times he has been on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the
National Economic Development Council, the National Training Task Force, and
the Committee of Inquiry into Civil Service Pay, not to mention the body
representing regional health chairmen, which he chaired.
A diehard Tory, he is the sort of businessman that the government has come
to rely upon in its efforts to make the public sector more efficient. Alas,
the fact that he has been temporarily replaced by Sir Donald Wilson, a
70-year-old Cheshire farmer already heading the Mersey Health Authority,
suggests ministers are now finding top-flight younger businessmen hard to
attract.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Leading Article: History and George Bush
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD, sadly, be rather appropriate if President Bush's term of office
were to end in one more confrontation with Iraq - a decisive victory for the
US in purely military terms, yet inconclusive and unsatisfying politically.
For the presidency as a whole, in retrospect, has something of that quality:
a period in which the US reacted to world events with competence and
firmness, yet failed to implement, or even to articulate, a broader
political strategy.
The conventional wisdom is that Mr Bush was successful in foreign policy,
but paid the political price for neglecting the domestic economy. Seen from
a distance, however, his economic management rates at least a beta plus,
while his foreign policy looks uninspired.
His competence and professionalism are not in dispute, and indeed compare
favourably with those of his immediate predecessors. Yet it is arguably not
with them but with Harry S Truman that he should be compared, because no
president since Truman has been presented with quite such dramatic
challenges.
He did act with admirable steadiness in insisting that Germany could and
must be reunited within Nato; and in ensuring that the break-up of the
Soviet Union was not accompanied by loss of control over its nuclear
weapons. But he never seemed to grasp how much was at stake in the heroic
attempt of Russians and other east Europeans, after decades of communist
oppression and mismanagement, to adopt market economics and liberal
democracy.
Shared criticism
No doubt any simple transposition of the Marshall Plan model would have been
inappropriate. No doubt in the 1990s the US could reasonably expect a much
greater share of the economic burden to be borne by its allies. Certainly
any criticisms of Mr Bush have to be addressed in equal or greater measure
to the leaders of Europe, whose interest in the matter was more obvious and
direct. Even so, the transformation of eastern Europe called for a western
effort of solidarity on the Marshall Plan scale, not just in financial terms
but in imagination and leadership; and the US president was the person best
placed to provide such leadership. It cannot honestly be said that he did
so.
The new circumstances also required a reforging of Atlantic ties, which
could no longer be taken for granted in the absence of the Soviet threat.
The US secretary of state did call for such a reforging in December 1989. If
nothing much has come of it, that is as much the Europeans' fault as Mr
Bush's. The latter at least appreciated the importance of an open trading
regime with rules accepted by all parties. Yet, without in any way excusing
the near-paralysis of the European Community, it must be asked whether he
really gave this issue the priority it deserved.
Withdrawn slogan
He will be remembered as the leader of the coalition that reversed Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait, giving a new authority to the UN Security Council, and
as the man who proclaimed a 'new world order' in 1990, only to withdraw the
slogan a year later. He has been ready to exploit some of the opportunities
offered by the absence of a global rival, deploying US military force to
impose a minimum of international order in the Middle East and, more
recently, a minimum of civil order in Somalia. But these actions have been
reactive, and carefully limited in time and scope.
They have been accompanied, too, by repeated assertions that the US cannot
and will not act as the world's policeman. Yet that, it seems, is a role the
US cannot wholly avoid. It needs to be institutionalised and
multilateralised. The US should not have to bear the whole burden, but
equally it cannot expect always to be in command; nor can it continue to
treat the UN as essentially a diplomatic convenience.
The windows of opportunity that opened in 1989 have not yet banged shut, but
many may be close to doing so. The American people have denied Mr Bush a
second term, sensing perhaps that he lacks the stature for such a unique
historical moment. They have elected a younger, more glamorous and more
articulate president, who is not the first to declare the domestic economy
his main priority. He may find, like others before him, that he is
ultimately judged by his success or failure in discharging America's
international responsibilities.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Class warfare in the people's party: Labour's identity
struggle as the modernisers confront the traditionalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outbreak of public skirmishing over the relevance to Labour of Mr Bill
Clinton's US election victory is really a coded debate about the extent to
which the party must address the values and prejudices of the middle
classes.
To many insiders, it might equally be viewed as a struggle for influence
over Mr John Smith, the party leader, between Labour's trendily radical
middle-class tyros on the right and the old cloth-capped workers, espousing
gloom and conservatism, on the left.
For the party's few optimists, the row has at least shown that, behind the
apparent complacency over Labour's fourth successive election defeat, a
debate is under way about what, if anything, can be done to avert a fifth.
Yet there is still little evidence that any profound change in the party's
public persona is imminent.
In BBC interviews yesterday, both Mr Smith and Mr Tony Blair, the shadow
home secretary, who is frequently cited as the arch Clintonite and party
'moderniser', were falling over themselves to insist that hallowed party
theology was not in danger.
The party leader made it clear that he regarded tampering with Clause IV -
the party constitution's controversial commitment to state ownership - as
unnecessary and insisted that Labour's union links were secure. Only a
little later, Mr Blair genuflected to the left by stressing that, while
there was a case for parties of the left to be tougher on crime (a Clinton
bull point), its social context could not be ignored.
Despite these assurances, some even on the so-called soft-left, such as Ms
Clare Short MP, believe that there is a clandestine 'project' by senior
Labour figures to hijack the leadership, abandon the unions and the poor,
and jettison core socialist principles.
As introverted as ever, Labour is conducting its post-mortem in coded
language and nods and winks, thereby adding credence to Mr Nick Raynsford
MP's much-quoted claim that the party is 'sleepwalking to oblivion'.
There is no doubt, however, that - as Mr John Prescott, the party's
transport spokesman, said last week - a battle is under way for the heart
and soul of the party between the revisionist modernisers and the so-called
consolidators or traditionalists, most vocally represented by Mr Prescott.
What is seriously in question is whether it is sufficiently taking into
account the views of the voters Labour so desperately needs to attract.
For the moment, the modernisers appear to be making the running. While
stressing that there is no question of Labour becoming a non-socialist party
along the lines of the Democrats, they insist that the Clinton victory
brings important lessons about updating the party's identity.
Such claims infuriate the traditionalists, who believe that efforts to
concoct a new public-relations gloss for the party have served only to
alienate its basic appeal. Mr Prescott and others argue that Labour should
concentrate on rebuilding its withered working-class grassroots, make the
case for a measure of public ownership, and campaign on its convictions
about social solidarity and full employment.
For the modernisers, this formula amounts to little more than a naive faith
that Conservative failures and 'one last heave' - a redoubling of efforts to
sell old-fashioned Labourism - will be enough to win power. They argue that
a decade of Thatcherism has irrevocably changed society and, more
importantly, voters' aspirations. In consequence, they say, Labour must
address itself to the mood of individualism by broadening its appeal to
embrace the white-collar middle third of society, whose politics centres on
self-interest rather than the collective good.
Their case was bolstered last week by the leaking of a confidential Labour
poll, showing Labour has failed to make any improvement in its appeal since
the April election defeat, and that voters in the electorally vital south of
the country continue to identify it as 'a party of the past', lacking both
credibility and coherence.
With boundary changes due by 1995, which are set to award the Conservatives
another 20-odd seats to add to their 65-seat advantage over Labour,
modernisers like Ms Patricia Hewitt and Mr Philip Gould, two long-time image
consultants, say excessive optimism over the party's 20 per cent opinion
poll lead is a dangerous chimera.
Mr John Smith has so far refused to show his hand on what looks increasingly
like an outbreak of class warfare within the people's party. He cannot
afford to do so for long. During the next three months, the party leader
will probably have to decide crucial questions of great symbolic resonance
in the struggle between the two sides.
The commission on electoral systems, under Lord Plant, and the national
executive's committee on the party's constitutional links with the trade
unions are to report shortly. Both committees are deeply divided. In the
end, the questions of proportional representation for the Commons and the
extent of union influence in the party will have to be resolved by the
national executive committee, heavily influenced by Mr Smith's personal
preferences.
Mr Smith will be hard put to find formulas that satisfy both the
modernisers' and traditionalists' camps. Compromise or delay, however, will
smack of weakness.
Beyond these immediate issues, the Labour leader must plan a more
comprehensive route march out of the political wilderness. Aides insist
planning is already well under way. But some, such as Mr Frank Field, the
maverick Birkenhead MP, feel the pace of change is still far too slow. 'We
are staring a fifth election defeat in the face,' he says. 'We should be
preparing as if we have already suffered it.'
Loyalists, however, argue that the machinery for change is already in place.
The Commission on Social Justice, under the chairmanship of Sir Gordon
Borrie, the former head of the Office of Fair Trading, will begin work this
month, promising a review of all the options on tax and benefits. That will
report in 18 months. Committees on constitutional reform, under Mr Blair,
and on European policy have been set up with orders to be ready to report to
this year's Brighton conference.
In the meantime, officials say, Labour will project itself as the party
dedicated to success: both that of the nation, reversing Britain's postwar
decline, and that of the individual, helping people to do better and achieve
more. 'The simple truth is that for too long we have all been starved of
success, dependent on a government which aims too low and so achieves
little,' Mr Smith wrote recently. 'People want a hand up not a hand out.'
Yet is all this nothing more than a continuation of Kinnockism? With
ideology on the retreat, the central power struggle is over how to resolve
Labour's identity crisis by giving electors a more convincing account of its
goals.
Those advocating that Labour should adopt Mr Clinton's appeal to what he
described as the working middle class, with a message eschewing special
interests in favour of the national one, seem to have caught the leader's
ear. It is doubtful, however, whether Mr Smith could risk the
traditionalists' wrath by endorsing fully a report by Ms Hewitt and Mr Gould
which commended the SDP-Liberal Alliance for abandoning all the language of
class politics and suggested projecting Labour as 'the non-political party'.
A highly principled politician, steeped in Scottish Christian socialist
tradition, Mr Smith's instincts are to appeal to the altruism of the
electorate and the good sense of the party, not to resort to factionalism
and schism. Both may be mistakes.
The 1992 election suggested that Britain's voters are more self-interested
than enlightened. And if he attempts to keep both Labour's traditionalists
and modernisers happy, there is a danger that he will end up alienating both
 -as well, for good measure, as the electorate.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Letter: Universities failed by mediocre policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof B MCA SAYERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article, 'University challenge' (January 5), starts down
the right path, but goes nowhere near as far as the national interest
demands.
Major university institutions like Imperial College are indeed a national
asset; every one of the six engineering departments in the City and Guilds
College (the engineering faculty of Imperial College) was top-rated against
international standards in the latest Higher Education Funding Council
Research Selectivity Review. As you imply, it is wasteful dissipation of an
asset to require such institutions as this, for financial reasons, to focus
dominantly on undergraduate teaching. The great power of Imperial College
lies in its research strength and its postgraduate teaching; national
interest demands that these strengths be utilised to the full.
The dominant role of a few universities such as Imperial College is at
postgraduate level, and we welcome public recognition of this fact. Yet the
accountants are in control, as in so much of Britain today; public funding
largely follows undergraduate numbers.
Despite ministerial assertions, funding for research, and even more for the
research students through whom much research is done, is inadequate to meet
the needs of the country's top institutions or the potential national
opportunities that they could provide. In the technological interests of the
country, this is mediocre policy.
But in current circumstances, can the UK - even in its own interests -
adequately capitalise upon Imperial College and other such institutions? If
the UK cannot, perhaps Europe should? We at Imperial College are able to
identify a range of long-term research interests which transcend national
frontiers. These seem to us to be of socio-economic significance to Europe
as a whole, and offer an ideal and sustained opportunity for high-quality
research training of postgraduate students.
Now, above all, is the time for vision, for thought on a supranational,
European scale. Should Europe now be considering strategic investment in a
few special institutions?

FT  11 JAN 93 / Letter: Flaws in the idea of an 'output gap'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS DILLOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Samuel Brittan (January 7) reports that estimates of the gap between
actual and potential output have been revised down. Unfortunately, he omits
to say that the fact of such a revision casts grave doubt on the very
concept of an 'output gap'.
Such a gap is only meaningful if the rate of growth of potential output is
independent of actual output growth. Mr Brittan belatedly recognises that
this is not the case, as he says that the capital scrapping caused by the
recession has reduced potential output. He should have added that capital
scrapping is not the only way in which the recession has reduced potential
output growth. The weakness of investment may have exacerbated the mismatch
between what UK industry can produce and the composition of demand, so that
even capacity which has not been scrapped is, in effect, unusable. This is
confirmed by last year's sharp rise in imports, despite the weakness of
demand.
This convergence of 'potential' output towards its actual level means that
the idea of an 'output gap' is - and always was - profoundly flawed. Those
hoping that this 'gap' will hold down inflation may be profoundly
disappointed.

Sir, A special resolution requires a 75 per cent vote of approval by
shareholders. The recent demise of both Sale Tilney and Lilley, owing to a
lack of unanimity among their respective bankers, could possibly have been
avoided if banks had learnt, at last, that the power of a charge over assets
should also be accompanied by responsibility of effective ownership of those
assets.
One rule for the goose, another for the gander, is not a satisfactory recipe
in a recession.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The receivership of Lilley is a clear indication that the inept
custodians of Britain's financial institutions have decided that companies
should be refused additional financial support where the banks will receive
a full payout for their money in a receivership.
The spectacle of banks sprinting for the receivership door when they can see
an opportunity to make an exit without any loss of book value illustrates
the fundamental malaise of the financial system.
It is hard not to conclude that these moves will be taken by banks in order
to reinforce their capital ratios against the inevitable write-downs that
they face on the truly bankrupt companies that they continue to support.
The inevitable consequence of this behaviour is the destruction of
relatively healthy companies in favour of those which are dead in all but
name. It is only a pity that the UK has neither a Chapter 11-type process to
protect companies operating profitably, nor sufficient legal remedies for
investors to challenge the banks' motives in forcing companies into
receivership.

There is an almost tangible feeling of relief in the diamond-cutting centres

by De Beers of South Africa has regained its tight grip on the market.
Only a few months ago, a large number of unwanted stones was flooding the
market, and there were fears that rough (uncut) diamond prices might
collapse.
But now traders suggest that prices are getting firmer, and there are
shortages of particular types of polished stones. 'Rough (diamond) buyers
say the market is now in balance rather than a buyer's market as it was a
few weeks ago,' says Mr Mark Cockle, editor of Diamond International, the
trade publication.
A few traders suggest that De Beers' first rough diamond price increase
since a 5.5 per cent rise in March 1990 is not far away.
However, both diamond producers and De Beers itself have incurred
considerable financial pain to return the market to stability. Sales by the
group's London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls at least
80 per cent of world trade in rough diamonds, fell 13 per cent from the 1991
level to Dollars 3.147bn last year - the lowest for five years. De Beers
warned last summer that it might cut its 1992 dividend in March, and
industry observers say it used up all the Dollars 800m cash it had in the
bank at the end of 1991 and was forced to borrow.
Mr Harry Oppenheimer, whose father founded De Beers and sister company the
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, and whose family still
effectively has control, said recently: 'Paying dividends is a high
priority, although in the nature of De Beers not necessarily the highest.
The highest priority is keeping the money together to protect the diamond
industry so that we'll continue to pay dividends for another 100 years.'
Apart from its own production in Namibia and South Africa, De Beers has
contracts to sell most of the rough diamonds produced by Angola, Australia,
Botswana, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Tanzania and Zaire. It
operates a 'buffer pool', stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating
stocks when demand runs ahead of supply.
Rough stones are released to the market in a controlled stream, through
'sights' offered by the CSO 10 times a year to about 160 carefully chosen
buyers. De Beers offers the quantities and types of diamonds that its market
intelligence network indicates the market can absorb. Each buyer is offered
boxes of diamonds costing between Dollars 500,000 and Dollars 25m and has to
accept or reject them all.
Traders maintain that the CSO reduced the value of diamonds on offer at each
of the last five sights of 1992 to a total of about Dollars 300m - low by
recent standards. At the same time, De Beers told diamond producers to cut
their previously agreed deliveries by 25 per cent (permitted under CSO
contracts at times of stress), which means the company's stockpile is not
growing at such a fast rate.
Last year De Beers also had to cope with an unexpected flow of rough
diamonds from Angola where, at its peak, about 50,000 private enterprise
diggers were picking stones from dried-up river beds.
The stones were smuggled out of Angola, mainly to Antwerp, where De Beers
tried to buy them. At the height of the rush, De Beers' buyer in Antwerp
spent nearly Dollars 40m in one week.
The group estimates that about Dollars 500m worth of stones was smuggled out
of Angola last year, representing a 10 per cent addition to world supply.
This compares with Angolan production of about 1m carats of rough diamonds
worth about Dollars 100m in 1991.
Renewed political tension and war in the country recently has stopped the
smuggling and even brought an end to the government's own diamond
production.
Rumours of substantial smuggling out of Russia have also dogged the market.
However, De Beers says the five-year marketing contract signed in 1990 with
the then Soviet Union allowed 5 per cent of production to be sold outside
the cartel. The rough diamonds surfacing in Moscow for export to the west
outside the cartel's channels are mainly from this source, according to De
Beers.
When the contract was signed, De Beers advanced the Soviet Union a Dollars
1bn loan, and Soviet diamond stocks were moved from Moscow to London as
collateral. De Beers says that, in spite of the subsequent political
changes, Russia has kept its side of the deal and paid interest on the loan
on time.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at the Credit Lyonnais Laing financial services
group, says it is good news for the diamond market that stability has been
achieved at CSO sales levels above those seen through much of the 1980s (see
chart). But he suggests there will have to be substantial growth in demand -
about 6 per cent a year following a 'recovery' year with 12 per cent growth
 -to absorb all potential supply by the late 1990s.
Ironically, much of the extra supply is coming from De Beers's new R1.1bn
Venetia mine in the northern Transvaal which, when in full production later
this year, will become South Africa's biggest diamond mine.
Mr Coulson says: 'Some suggest it won't be until 1998 that the market will
be entirely in balance - and the CSO will still be left with a substantial
diamond stockpile to finance.' De Beers is looking east to help mop up the
extra supply. Having developed the Japanese appetite for diamonds virtually
from scratch over the past decade, the company is looking to new markets in
China and India by the end of the 1990s.

   From Mr JAMES MUNRO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One point apparently not yet picked up in the many post-mortem reviews
of the Braer tanker disaster is the following. Oil tankers should be handled
as if 'dangerous cargo' (such as toxic waste), and therefore
shipowners/charterers should be forced by EC law/UN resolution (a) to file
details of the route of each voyage with a suitable supervisory agency that
has powers to veto/adjust/delay, and (b) to accept 'pollution prevention
pilots' on board for parts of the voyage where problems might be expected.
I suggest that these simple measures would probably have prevented the
recent tanker disasters in Spain and the Shetlands.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Arts: Let the stones speak for themselves - Colin Amery
considers Stonehenge and the winning design to house the tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was Inigo Jones who was asked by King James I of England and VI of
Scotland to offer an account of the origins, meaning and purpose of
Stonehenge. His thoughts and researches were not published until 1655, and
when they were they were curiously inaccurate and speculative. Jones thought
that the group of megalithic stones was a Roman temple in the Tuscan Order,
open to the heavens, and dedicated to Coelus, or Uranus, the oldest god in
the classical pantheon.
Like many architects Inigo Jones was not above re-interpreting history to
his own ends. He was at the time an enthusiast for the severity of the
Tuscan Order and the simplicity of Roman temple architecture. It suited him
to see the monument as a reinforcement of his own historical ideas.
Today we look at a monument like Stonehenge in a variety of different ways.
It is described as the most important pre-historic monument in Europe. It is
designated as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. It is still the site of some
strange solstice rites when white robed Druidic figures try to bring
together the forces of time and space to manufacture a creative coincidence
based on the certainties of geometry. It is a gathering place for Romanies
and travellers drawn there as if by a giant magnet. Above all we still look
upon Stonehenge as a place of mystery, a place that has a strange and
powerful hold upon the imagination.
In London until January 16 at the Royal Institute of British Architects (and
later in Wiltshire) is an exhibition of the ideas of six architects, called
Visions for Stonehenge. Galvanised by the energetic new chairman of English
Heritage, Mr Jocelyn Stevens, 150 architects submitted proposals for new
facilities for visitors to the monument. The present arrangements for the
one million or more people who visit the site annually are grotesque and
inconvenient. The brief for the new proposals is for a centre one kilometre
to the north of the stones for visitors, where they will also park their
cars. From this distant site you will walk processionally to the stones,
which will be once again more isolated and united with the landscape by the
removal of much of the fencing and the A344 road, which at present passes
within feet of the sacred stones.
The winning architect from the six short listed is Edward Cullinan - who
also won the last Financial Times 'Architecture at Work Award.' The other
five were: Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones; Birds Portchmouth and Russum;
Future Systems; Colvin and Moggridge Landscape Architects; and Plincke
Leaman and Browning.
It was a difficult competition for an architect, because it really called
for invisibility for any new buildings and a lot of effort to be put into
the enhancement of the setting of the stones themselves - which are, as far
as we know, untouched by the hands of even the most ancient architects.
Circumspection and reticence are not always qualities associated with
architects, but Mr Cullinan has designed a simple scheme which consists of a
single storey visitors' centre with a grass roof which gives the appearance
of being underground. There is a potentially handsome circular viewing
terrace and a promenade along the roof top along which you can saunter and
contemplate the distant view of the standing stones.
The worrying thing about this new facility, which still has to go through
the planning hurdles and is unlikely to be opened until 1996, at the
earliest, is that it is so enormous. Much of the space is taken up by
amorphous halls apparently designated for 'interpretation', exhibitions and
displays. There is a separate audio visual theatre to 'introduce' the
visitor to Stonehenge and a restaurant for the serving of Stonehenge snacks
and Druid dinners. There will be a shop selling souvenirs - candles in the
shape of Stonehenge, full length Druid outfits, horns and harps and plastic
mistletoe. There are also special rooms for the changing of nappies,
delivery bays for the unloading of Coca-Cola bottles and rooms for the large
numbers of staff to rest their limbs and smoke their cigarettes.
This Stonehenge experience will be surrounded by a 'landscaped' sea of
nearly 1000 cars and coaches. Visitors will have to walk on grass paths
(which will surely soon wear out) to the monument itself.
The architects who have entered this important national competition are not
to be blamed for the nature of the brief, which has been drawn up over eight
years by endless committees of bureaucrats and well intentioned do-gooders
of all kinds. But there is no doubt at all in my mind that the right thing
to do at Stonehenge is to move the offending roads, so that the stones are
more remote and mysterious, and then do everything possible to lessen public
interest in the site.
All the bogus 'interpretation' in the world is not going to add any
certainty to anyone's knowledge of Stonehenge. All the shopping and parking,
lavatories and nappy changing will do nothing to enhance the real nature of
this monument. A distant car park and a long walk is all that is needed. It
will save English Heritage from drumming up sponsorship and perhaps allow
the stones to speak for themselves.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Arts: Spanish songs, French winds - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Complete performances of Hugo Wolf's Spanish Songbook used always to be the
province of senior artists. Even more than his Italian Songbook, it tests
the expressive range and penetration of any singer, whether or not the songs
are shared between two voices - as they were by Anne Sofie von Otter and
Olaf Bar at the weekend (twice over) in the Wigmore Hall.
Old memories were hard to suppress. This young pair offered a moral of
earnest intelligence, careful pacing and any amount of good taste; that left
much to be discovered yet. Both were happiest in the wry, romantic songs,
especially on a teasing note (Miss von Otter was delightfully forthright,
Bar good at comic defenciveness, though in piano his projection was
sometimes frail). Darker undertones had to be taken on trust - the despair
behind 'Ach Im Maien Wars', for example, or the numb misery in 'Dereinst,
dereinst'. Which is not to deny that Bar made a good fist of the great,
tragic 'Alle Gingen, Herz zur Ruh', nor that von Otter touched the heart
strings with her Juliettish 'Geh, Geliebter'.
Those, and many other prettily turned songs, were all from the 'secular'
part of the Songbook where at the piano Geoffrey Parsons found his best form
too - in some fleet, delicate accompaniments there is really no-one to touch
him. The sacred or 'spiritual' songs 10 of them at the start) were another
matter. Both singers were inclined to over-reverence, despite a lovely,
floated 'Die ihr Schwebet' from the mezzo-soprano, and Parsons was
unyieldingly stately.
The baritone rose nobly to the wonderful 'Blendend ihr ins Augen bricht'
line in 'Ach, Wie Lang die Selle Schlummert]' - but there was no broad lift
from the piano, only an unchanging marmoreal tread. In fact, the 'spiritual'
tempi struck me as considerably slower (and much less varied) than Wolf can
have expected, especially with younger singers: stretching things out to the
limit doesn't automatically suggest soulful depths. Some of those songs can
grab you by the throat; on Friday we had to be content with suave,
well-modulated singing, and the occasional sharper insight.
A Poulenc feast in the same hall on Thursday (his birthday) had been more
straightforward, and yet displayed more complex riches. Not because Poulenc
 -even late Poulenc - outweighs Wolf; but because the clarinettist Michael
Collins had assembled experienced wind-colleagues to deliver pieces which
they know like the backs of their hands, and which reward such seasoned
players with some of the most appealing music composed for their instruments
in this century.
To Collins himself went the late Clarinet Sonata, of course, and its
companion sonatas for flute and for oboe were treated with no less expert
tenderness and wit by Philippa Davies and Gareth Hulse. Richard Watkins
boarded the difficult Horn Elegy (for Denis Brain) with rare confidence. The
pianist Noriko Ogawa, mostly idiomatic and thoroughly musical, accompanied
everybody with bright tact, and seized her opportunities in the big Trio
with oboe and bassoon and the racketty, overflowing Sextet. A very good time
was had by all.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Arts: Don Carlos - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Tim Albery's new Don Carlos production for Opera North, Spain is a
cheerless, pitiless place - of imprisoning high walls, narrow vistas, sombre
surfaces and hard planes of light. Whether cloister, monastery garden, town
square or palace study is the setting, the removal of all Mediterranean
warmth is intentional. In the later acts the rigid containment of the visual
line is at last breached - only to reveal at the back of the stage a
landscape stained blood-red.
This spare, subtle, bleak Verdi staging has been designed by Hildegard
Bechtler in a manner marrying Appia-like abstraction to a wonderful
painterly refinement of colour and line; it is altogether a sustained feat
of dramatic economy. (Only some opening-night waywardness in the lighting
box blurred the sharpness of its outlines.) In the medium-sized Leeds Grand
Theatre, on a miniscule budget, there was absolutely no question of Opera
North simulating French Grand Opera spectacle a la Visconti or Zeffirelli;
but style - and subject have been matched with an imagination and
intelligence unshackled by budgetary restriction.
The choice of text has been made a crucial part of this fastidiously
concentrated approach. Opera North opts for the four-act (1883) version,
Verdi's severely purposeful reduction of his original (1867) expansive five
acts; and gives it in Andrew Porter's superb translation. People on the
point of being persuaded, by the more fanatic adherents of the Surtitle
School, that opera in the vernacular is now a hopelessly old-fashioned
notion should rush to Leeds: a demonstration awaits them of the
extraordinary, close-binding 'contract' that can arise between
singing-actors and audience in the moment of theatrically sharing their
native language.
On Friday this reached its peak in the scene for Philip and Posa: never
before have I been so completely gripped by its smallest pinpointing of
communicative nuance, its shifting weights and balances of dramatic and
musical insight, its developing theatrical momentum. Since this brought
together, in Albery's quietly intense staging of their dialogue, the two
most powerfully eloquent members of the cast, it was no coincidence.
Anthony Michaels-Moore, beautifully free and forward of baritone timbre,
effortlessly ardent and noble in every utterance, is already a young Posa of
high class (who will join the highest once his trill and his walk have been
polished). John Tomlinson, whose short stature adds to the impression of a
Philip at once fiercely overbearing and pierced with self-doubt, bared the
king's soul - fearlessly, frighteningly. In the study monologue the soft
singing may have gone hollow, the pitching a touch bumpy, yet in the context
of the staging the naked truthfulness of the performance seemed, if
anything, increased.
Both singers threw out each word as if it were an expressive lance aimed at
the opera's heart. Less so Claire Powell's Eboli, but her sparky personality
still sent flashes through the prevailing gloom, and in 'O don fatale' she
darkened it with strict control of means. This artist is developing apace,
to impressive effect. Linda McLeod, a mezzo turned soprano, suffused her
first Elisabeth with tenderness, grace and dignity; only the last degree of
security and focus at the top is wanting. In the title role the American
tenor Richard Burke has the hardest task, and at first appeared unequal to
it, but mustered his vocal forces in time to deliver the farewells with
poise and affecting sincerity.
A company's first Don Carlos is only the beginning. A conductor's likewise:
Paul Daniel will surely learn to keep the brass more firmly in check, to
hold a more consistently secure balance between dramatic tension and
release. The care with which he nursed his singers (Miss MacLeod being
lovingly supported through the long phrases of Elisabeth's two arias) was a
clear indication of the heartfelt seriousness which has informed Mr Daniel's
 -and Opera North's - whole approach to Verdi.
Supported by Arthur Andersen &amp; Co and Weatherall Green Smith; in repertory
at the Leeds Grand until January 29, then on tour to Nottingham, Birmingham
and Manchester.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Arts: Growing beyond the fringe - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best of London's fringe theatre is outgrowing its original purpose -
which was to show to a small audience plays that might not be seen
elsewhere. Theatres like The Gate in Notting Hill, The Bush in W12 and The
King's Head in Islington are now suffering from the problems of their own
success.
Precisely because of their high standards of acting and directing, the
performances are often far better than the basic script. Besides, the
economics of playing to a full house of under 100 people must be
questionable. The next move must be seek more space and better financial
arrangements in order to show their wares to a wider audience, which I
understand is what The Gate is now doing by appealing to its ultimate
landlord, Allied-Lyons, for a modest expansion.
Such thoughts are prompted by two fringe productions last week: Mr Cinders
at the King's Head and Waiting at the Water's Edge at The Bush. Neither is
wholly satisfactory. The King's Head, which is perhaps the most eclectic of
all the fringe, has had a go at Vivian Ellis's 1929 musical comedy before.
It revived Mr Cinders in 1983 and saw it proceed to a successful run in the
West End.
It is much less clear why the piece should be revived again now, except in
the hope of finding the honey pot a second time. The hope may be forlorn. In
this production by Martin Connor Mr Cinders achieves the unusual distinction
for a musical of slowing down whenever the music starts and speeding up
whenever we return to the dialogue. The normal technique in a musical is the
other way round, and while it might be original to stand convention on its
head, the trouble is that the music is not quite strong enough: two pianos
and some pretty thin lyrics.
There are some incidental pleasures. The story - a male version of
Cinderella - is a good one. Some of the lines are very amusing in a P G
Wodehouse sort of way. As the hero, there is an excellent performance by
Samuel West, shortly to appear in Tom Stoppard's new play Arcadia at the
National Theatre. The whole cast, including Eileen Page as the grovelling
Lady Lancaster, does well. Yet the question one has to ask is what is a cast
of this size (17) and distinction doing in a piece like this at the King's
Head?
Compare Mr Cinders to the previous King's Head production, Elegies for
Angels, Punks and Raging Queens. The latter had a cast of 33, and made a
virtue of it. It succeeded not just because it was good in its own right,
but because it was new and different. Elegies can, and should, be seen again
when it moves to another fringe theatre, the Drill Hall off Tottenham Court
Road, on January 19. It is what the fringe theatre ought to be about:
bringing in a challenge via the back door. There is no reason why Elegies,
having made its introductions, should not play on a larger stage.
The problem with the new production at The Bush is that the play is
over-ambitious. The Bush has recently specialised in new Irish work, notably
Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy. Lucinda Coxon's Waiting at the Water's Edge
turns to Wales and Nova Scotia in the early 1920s. It is about, in no
particular order, mining disasters, guilt, feminism, capitalism, class
differences and the relationships between servants and masters and
especially servants and mistresses. As a text, I found it pretentious, to
put it mildly.
Yet you have to go to The Bush, which must be the most uncomfortable of the
fringe theatres in London, to see how a good production in a packed small
house can take hold. Directed by Polly Teale, even some of the sillier lines
and gestures almost come off. And it would be quite wrong to think that the
small stage inhibits movement; sometimes it enhances it. This is a riveting
experience, and one can see why actors and directors are prepared to work
there, as at The Gate, almost for nothing.
My point is that they have begun to deserve something better in the way of
conditions. Too many people who would enjoy the fringe still do not go. How
to attract them is what we should now be thinking about.
Mr Cinders, King's Head, (071) 226 1916 until early February. Waiting, The
Bush Theatre, (081) 743 3388 until January 30. Elegies, Drill Hall from 19
January, (071) 637 8270.
* In my review of another fringe play, The Curse of the Pharaohs, at the
Lyric Studio in Hammersmith last week, the parts were transposed. The
excellent Egyptian is played by Adam Fahey and the equally excellent Howard
Carter by Nick Rawling.

Quite what it will do for equal opportunities in the workplace one does not
like to think, but Horizon's Cheating Time (BBC 2, 8.00) shows that the day
is not far off when it will be commonplace for women employees in their
fifties to take maternity leave.
Moreover, in this Brave New World, the fecund 50-year-olds of tomorrow could
find their own mothers next to them in the maternity ward.
There was once an English medieval king who reported he was having
nightmares that the peasants were coming to get him.
Michael Heseltine's dreams are no doubt haunted by the miners who gave him
such a terrible finale to 1992. Tonight's Panorama, The Great Pit Disaster
(BBC 1, 9.30), analyses the case for and against closure.
First part of The Name of the Room (BBC2, 7.20) unearthed some delightful
householders, then patronised them to death with a snooty, pretentious and
at times incomprehensible commentary.
But this week's presenter is the architectural historian Dan Cruickshank, so
things ought to look up.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Management: A patent case for looking after your company's
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Innovators often fail to understand the management of intellectual property
rights, a complex and arcane area involving patents, copyright, designs,
trade secrets and trade and service marks that is normally the reserve of
specialist practitioners. Yet coming to terms with such issues can be
pivotal to successful corporate innovation.
An example is Company X, a newly-founded software firm. Just as its first
product was about to be launched, the company received a letter from the
solicitor of the former employer of one of the founding members, claiming
that valuable information belonging to their clients was being used in
breach of a confidentiality agreement.
They also claimed that copyright-protected programs belonging to their
clients were used in the development of the new company's products. Threats
of injunctions and demands for damages and return of the copyright works
were made.
It was also suggested from another source that as the company had spent much
time and money on promotional literature, which included the name of the
product, that they check that this was not being used by anyone else. A
search by a trade mark agent found that the name was similar to a name
already registered for the same sort of products and that use of it would
entitle the registered proprietor to sue for infringement of his mark.
The copyright and confidentiality issue was resolved by the grant of a
licence to use the information and copyright work. But the company had to
select a new name and logo, which meant the original promotional literature
had to be pulped.
The commercial ramifications were that the company could not claim to have
exclusive rights over the finished product, the product was late to market
and much management time was wasted and legal fees expended.
But a few precautions could have ensured that the intellectual property
matters, crucial to the success of the product, were secured. Such measures
include:
Raising staff awareness of intellectual property rights through workshop
training and the development of appropriate guides. These can range from a
general introduction to IPRs to industry-specific ones. Or they can be aimed
at specific personnel, such as scientists operating in sensitive research
areas where technology leakage could have dire commercial repercussions.
They can also be subject-specific on, say, trade marks.
Innovation and intellectual property audits. Innovation auditing should
address 'hard' technologies such as engineering capabilities as well as
sales and distribution networks, marketing expertise and financial control.
Intellectual property auditing should focus on the underlying intangible
legal rights which the business enjoys and might create in any product
development.
With this data, management can develop mechanisms to trigger an automatic
review of IP issues at all stages of business and product development.
Management controls include guides to inform managers how to protect IPRs
when they arise. Other guidelines would establish the proper procedures for
confidentiality agreements. Control mechanisms could prevent technology
leakage by the unvetted disclosure of patentable materials from research
departments. Staff responsible for licensing would follow safe practices in
both the pre- and post-licensing function.
Finally, intellectual property legal protection insurance enables the
insured company to sue those who threaten to infringe its rights and to
defend itself if accused of infringing the rights of others. Good IP risk
management policy is having in place the best control environment together
with appropriate insurance.
IP problems can normally be predicted and prevented. Innovators should
ensure that they use the intellectual property system which is there to
protect their interests, saving management time and potential legal and
other fees.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Leicester western bypass plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMEC has started the New Year with a trio of contracts worth around Pounds
90m, all of which were given the 'green light' in the run-up to Christmas.
Heading the list is the Pounds 36m A46 Leicester western bypass contract,
which AMEC Civil Engineering won in joint venture with Alfred McAlpine. The
130-week contract, which started on site on January 4, covers construction
of about 12.5km of dual lane carriageway located to the north and west of
the city from the M1 at Kirby Muxloe to the A46 Fosse Way at Syston.
Work includes the construction of a range of grade separated junctions and
over 50 structures. Crossings include the Rothley Brook at Thurcaston, the
Grand Central Railway, the River Soar, the Grand Union Canal and the M1.
At the same time, AMEC Design and Management and American sister company
Morse Diesel International have been awarded a construction management
contract to fit-out the new London headquarter's for Barclays Bank.
Located at 54 Lombard Street, in the heart of the City of London, the
17-storey 300,000 sq ft building will be fitted out under a phased contract,
starting in May and ending in July next year.
In Bristol, AMEC Developments has been given the go-ahead on the Pounds 24m
Severn Gate project, following approval of a Pounds 3.6m city grant by the
Department of the Environment.
The project will provide 430,000 sq ft of industrial and distribution
facilities on a 35 acre site.
The development is part of a 400 acre landholding owned by AMEC's joint
development partner, RTZ Estates and is situated adjacent to the proposed
link from the M5 to the new Severn crossing.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Management: On the wrong track in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the sort of tragi-comedy which other Europeans tend to associate with
Italy. In 1987 Berghaus decided that the fragmented Italian market required
a domestic staging post to hold stock and turn round orders quickly.
They would be exported in bulk, then repacked in Italy for individual
delivery. But the plan failed.
Berghaus had chosen what seemed an ideal location just south of the Swiss
border. But a promised motorway to the town was never finished, leaving only
twisting local roads. There were no computer links - a side-effect of its UK
computer problems.
With a staff of five, 'the warehouse became a very, very expensive addendum
to our Italian operations', says Mark Held, export director. To reach it,
Berghaus had to have bulk consignments from Newcastle transferred on to
smaller lorries nearby. From the warehouse, individual cartons destined for
shops were put on to a third set of trucks.
In mid-1989 Berghaus decided to pull out, and instead subcontract the
physical distribution - and fixed overheads - to an Italian company which
carries out a similar service for Benetton, the clothing chain.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Management: Ain't no mountain high enough - Christopher
Lorenz explains why Berghaus is revamping its distribution for the second
time / Rethinking Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS BEFITS an enterprise run by all-weather mountaineers, rock climbers and
hill trekkers, Berghaus has always been a pioneer. Its innovative technical
design and marketing have made the 450-person company one of Europe's
leading and most fashionable makers of 'performance' outdoor clothing,
including rucksacks, jackets, trousers and gaiters.
Like so many of Germany's medium-sized companies - the 'Mittelstand' -
Berghaus has long enjoyed soaring sales and an export ratio of around 50 per
cent.
As from last week, the company is preparing to pioneer in a new direction:
by revolutionising its relationship with retailers in continental European
markets. Its move is likely to affect all its competitors.
Berghaus is also rethinking a distribution system it set up in Italy and
Germany as recently as 1987-88. That, in turn, results from a
newly-implemented two-year revamp of its manufacturing process, which has
been shifted from mass production to flexible short runs.
Berghaus is not German, Swiss or Austrian, as its name suggests. It is
thoroughly British, or to be more specific, steeped in the gritty character
of its home town of Newcastle upon Tyne in north-east England.
In the last 20 years it has built thriving export businesses to Italy,
Germany, Norway, Sweden, Benelux and Switzerland (in approximate order of
current sales volume). Only in France has it 'utterly failed to crack the
market so far', admits David Udberg, its joint managing director. He blames
vicious domestic price competition and French chauvinism.
In the current financial year sales will top Pounds 20m for the first time,
with pre-tax profit climbing towards the Pounds 750,000 peak of the late
1980s after two years of problems caused by the factory reorganisation and
the UK recession.
When, four years ago, the Financial Times last looked at Berghaus's
continental European sales strategy, it had just introduced what was
intended to be a faster and cheaper way of responding to orders from the 500
small family shops which constitute the fragmented Italian market. And it
was on the verge of extending the approach to Germany.
A vital back-up for both markets was to be a Pounds 300,000 German computer
system in Newcastle, capable of reserving and allocating stock several
months in advance.
With the exception of the German arrangements, little of this has turned out
as planned. Almost all of it had to be rethought.
For a start, the computer software failed to function as promised. The
result, from July 1989 to the end of that year, was five months with no
management accounts or credit notes and two without invoices.
No sooner had that problem been resolved than the company was hit by the
third mild winter in a row. Both Berghaus and its retailers were burdened
with stock.
The company's reaction was to pull out of skiwear - a strong seller in Italy
 -and accelerate a move towards more flexible garments with removable
layers, which sell throught the year.
The immediate result was a drop in Berghaus's Italian sales by 15 per cent
in 1990-91. This has been more than recouped, with this year's Italian
revenue expected to be more than Pounds 2.5m, keeping Italy well out in
front of Germany and fast-growing Norway (with Pounds 1.6m each) as
Berghaus's largest export market.
At the same time as the computer and the weather were wreaking havoc,
Berghaus's Italian branch and warehouse were having problems (see panel). To
put no finer point on it, 'we got our fingers burned,' says Mark Held, the
35-year-old export director.
Just as the Italian warehouse has been replaced by a direct distribution
system, Berghaus may have to reconsider the role of the efficient but costly
German distribution base it set up near Cologne in 1989.
Such a review may be sparked by a more radical decision: Berghaus's attempt
to steal a march on its continental competitors with a new rapid order and
delivery system for continental Europe which will allow retailers to cut
stocks drastically.
Until now, outdoor clothing retailers in continental Europe have mainly
ordered stock and taken delivery in two frenetic seasons. This has meant
retailers holding stock for up to six months.
In recent years British retailers have shied away from this pattern because
of soaring interest rates, unpredictably dry and hot weather and the effects
of recession.
As a result, Berghaus this year launched a 'stock response system' based on
the sort of 'direct sell-through' ( or 'just-in-time') supply relationship
between makers of fast-moving consumer goods and their UK supermarket
customers. This shifts most of the stockholding risk, and much of that for
demand forecasting, on to suppliers.
As from this month Berghaus's main UK retail outlets can choose to hold an
agreed range of goods and up to four weeks' of stock, in exchange for
automatic replenishment from Berghaus once a month, with delivery within a
week. In 1989, for both home and export markets, Berghaus's
order-to-delivery cycle on many items was as long as six-12 weeks.
Last week, as a precursor to introducing a full UK-style 'stock response
system' this autumn, the company relaxed its Pounds l,500-2,000 minimum
order levels for its main continental European retailers to a single
garment.
Berghaus will thus no longer be able to rely on having a fat order book
seven or eight months ahead. 'Its a drastic change - the biggest since I
joined the company nine years ago,' says Held.
'We'll have to forecast better, manufacture speculatively, and take a risk
on stock.' The company's back-up stock is being raised by 30 per cent.
To its main export customers, Berghaus is aiming to offer the same
order-to-delivery response of seven days or less that it provides in the UK.
This will put on severe trial its planning, manufacturing, supply and
distribution arrangements. It will also test whether the theory of an
efficiently operating single European market can become a reality during
1993.

FT  11 JAN 93 / People: . . and Wheatley joins Babcock's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineering group Babcock International, which last summer said it wanted to
achieve a better balance of expertise on its board, has invited Alan
Wheatley to join as a non-executive director, in the first of two or more
such appointments it intends to make in coming months.
Wheatley, 54, the new chairman of 3i and a former senior partner of Price
Waterhouse, has known the chairman of Babcock, Lord King, for some while.
'But these things are done in a much more formalised way these days and the
chairman and deputy chairman spent some considerable time considering the
sort of person we wanted,' says chief executive Oliver Whitehead.
Whitehead points out that Wheatley, with his City contacts, 'fills an
obvious gap' following the death of Rocky Stone, a former Smith New Court
director and a leading light in the Industrial &amp; Commercial Finance
Corporation, who had been on the board of Babcock since 1966 and who died
last April.
The chief executive says his own 'personal preference' would be for an
industrialist as the next non-executive director, but that that search is
not very far advanced.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Continental acquisitions by British companies down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of British corporate acquisitions in the rest of Europe fell last
year in spite of the impending launch of the single European market, says a
survey by Translink, the cross-border mergers and acquisitions adviser.
Preliminary findings from the analysis showed that 159 deals were completed
in other European countries by British companies last year. The figure has
fallen steadily in the past four years from 284 in 1989, 247 in 1990 and 175
in 1991.
Acquisitions of British companies by buyers from elsewhere in Europe were
also down at 200 compared with 232 in 1991. In 1990 the number was 279 and
the year before 239. Companies blamed the uncertain economic outlook and
turmoil on foreign exchanges in the final quarter of last year for the fall
in corporate activity.
Among UK companies the most active acquirers were in the banking and
financial services sector, and they were also the most popular targets for
foreign companies.
Some 18 British companies in the sector made acquisitions elsewhere in
Europe, while 25 British companies were acquired by overseas buyers.
In engineering, British companies made 18 acquisitions. The electronics,
electricals and computers sector - the most popular sector for British
takeovers of foreign companies in 1991 with 39 - fell to second place last
year with only 20.
The fall in UK deals reflected an overall decline in activity in Europe to
1,431 deals, compared with 1,649 in 1991, 1,468 in 1990 and 1,266 in 1989.
US companies were the most active acquirers in Europe, completing 219 deals

FT  11 JAN 93 / Storms block Shetland salvage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY seas and high winds around Shetland again blocked attempts to remove
the oil remaining on the tanker Braer yesterday and hampered efforts to deal
with the pollution caused by the disaster.
Although the ship has not broken apart, salvage specialists believe this
will eventually happen.
Experts who flew over the tanker yesterday now believe that no further oil
is leaking from the vessel, which may still contain as much as half of its
84,000-tonne cargo. But oil is still spreading northwards for about 25 miles
up the west coast of the main Shetland island.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary,
will both make statements to the Commons about the disaster today.
About 600 people living within a two-mile radius of the wreck will have
liver and respiratory checks this week after fears that pollution from the
Braer may be toxic, and protective masks were yesterday issued to crofters
living near the scene.
Yesterday Shetland salmon farmers received a boost when the supermarket
group Safeway said it would continue to buy farmed Shetland salmon after a
company official visited fish farms and environmental specialists on the
islands.
Last Friday Marks and Spencer announced that it would stop buying Shetland
salmon as 'a temporary precautionary measure'. Other food retailers are
monitoring the situation.
The Shetland salmon farming industry is one of the sectors of the islands'
economy most threatened by the disaster.
Since Friday the salmon farmers have been prohibited from harvesting salmon
in a 400 square mile area under a ban ordered by the Scottish Office. The
ban, which also covers the catching of sea fish, was announced just after
the islands' fishing and fish-farming organisations had declared their own
ban.
There are 16 salmon farms in the area covered by the ban, accounting for
about a quarter of Shetland's salmon production which last year totalled
10,000 tonnes.
Shetland council said yesterday that it was retaining the solicitors
Penningtons to represent it in dealing with legal issues arising from the
incident. The council has initiated no legal action so far.
High winds caused by the near-record atmospheric depression between
north-west Scotland and Iceland battered Britain yesterday.
At Renfrew in Scotland the River Clyde burst its banks at high tide and
flooding also hit Lochgilphead and Tarbert in Argyll. Coastguards expected
force 12 storms to hit the area around Orkney and Shetland.
Other badly hit areas were Oxfordshire, Sussex, Surrey, Kent, Hampshire and
Somerset, while in Essex beaches and seafronts were closed at Jaywick Sands
and Southend.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Bucking the Trend: Kosset becomes cat's whiskers once more -
How a buy-out has helped a carpet company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CARPET company doing well in 1993 must have had its share of good fortune
as well as good management. Carpet-making remains one of the last vestiges
of unreconstructed industrial Victoriana left in Britain.
For decades, output in this fragmented business has been hit by cheap
imports from bigger and more efficient competitors and by restrictive
domestic labour practices. More recently, the steep decline in house
purchases - accounting for 35 per cent of the carpet market in 1988 - has
increased the industry's woes.
One of the survivors is Bradford-based Kosset Carpets. Its luck came in the
shape of a bargain-basement purchase from the receiver in 1989 of the name
and assets of Mr John Ashcroft's failed Coloroll empire - Kosset was a
wholly-owned subsidiary.
'We paid Pounds 10m for Pounds 20m of assets,' says Mr John Parker, 43,
Kosset's chairman who ran the business under Coloroll and led the buy-out.
The management skills employed since seem equally simple.
'Our number one priority is cash management,' he says.
The combination has borne fruit. Operating profit rose from Pounds 1.4m in
the first year of operation after the buy-out to Pounds 1.8m in the second
year and Pounds 2.5m in the current year. The interest charge this year is
about Pounds 1.5m and there is positive cash flow for the first time, Mr
Parker says.
Several measures were taken to manage cash through cost control. Kosset
subcontracted its energy management to BP, saving Pounds 100,000 over two
years. It computerised part of its manufacturing process to cut waste, raise
quality and reduce raw material stocks. The result was a margin improvement
of more than one percentage point.
Customers used to complain that telephone lines to the company were
sometimes engaged. Rather than take on more staff, the company paid Pounds
60,000 for a new switchboard with functions such as call-queueing. Now it
can handle twice as many calls with the same staffing.
The company has improved productivity by moving workers quickly between
jobs. An agreement with the TGWU general union has allowed workers to do
more than one job. Half are now multi-skilled and can be switched between
woven carpets, tufted carpets and warehousing when necessary. Under
Coloroll, the three divisions were treated as independent.
Management's attention to detail is in sharp contrast to the Coloroll
regime. 'The only thing Ashcroft told us to do was 'Kill the cat',' says Mr
Parker, referring to Kosset's familiar Persian cat logo.
The buy-out managers saved the cat and followed a conservative marketing
strategy. Mr Parker and his three fellow directors decided not to follow
competitors down market as the recession took hold. This avoided some of the
most fiercely competitive price points but put sales volume at risk.
The strategy seems to have worked. By concentrating limited management time
on selling mid-priced and expensive carpets, turnover has risen from Pounds
42m in 1990 to a projected Pounds 55m-plus in the current year.
The mid-priced ranges of tufted carpets account for almost 90 per cent of
sales by value. Tufted carpets are made by sewing nylon yarn into a nylon
mesh. The result is hard-wearing but limited to simple patterns and few
colours. They cost between Pounds 9 and Pounds 20 a square yard  - Kosset's
biggest customers include Home Office prisons and libraries.
Carpets that cost more than Pounds 20 a square yard are woven rather than
sewn. The number and quality of colours and complexity of pattern is higher,
but the machinery is slower - productivity is only a sixth of tufted
carpets.
High-margins nevertheless exist for woven carpets - at Pounds 60 a square
yard, the Sultana range is exported to Japan, and the company has just won a
royal warrant.
Kosset's progress has not been without stumbles and errors. The first came
just weeks after the buy-out when Kosset's biggest customer, the furniture
retailer Lowndes Queensway, collapsed. Then in January 1991 management
judged the end of the recession in sight and recruited more than 70 workers.
In April 1992, when recovery seemed as distant as ever, it made 42
redundant.
Kosset has survived on management wits and luck. Mr Parker, emboldened by
comparative success, already plans to raise the profile of the company - the
cat, confined to point-of-sale promotions, could eventually return to the
television screen.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Managers' training 'insufficient'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 50 per cent of managers say they receive insufficient training, a
survey published today by the Institute of Management says.
The report, which the institute says is the most comprehensive to date, is
based on a survey of training undergone by more than 2,000 managers. The
institute undertook the research with the Economic and Social Research
Council.
Concern has been expressed recently by a number of organisations, including
the Confederation of British Industry, about the quality and quantity of
training for managers and supervisors in the UK. Un-favourable comparisons
have been drawn with other countries such as Germany.
The study concludes that training of managers should be directed at reaching
national standards.
The report, by Professor Peter Warr of the University of Sheffield, says 88
per cent of managers undertook some training in 1991, with an average of
five days a year on work-time training and three days training during their
own time, including home study.
Many managers had little opportunity to train, the survey says. One third of
the managers surveyed said their organisation did not have a formal training
policy, and one in eight received no training in 1991.
Managers were convinced of the business case for more training - 81 per cent
said they would be more effective if they had had more training.
The survey reinforces the belief of many involved in training, including the
Training and Enterprise Councils, that government efforts to improve
training should be directed at small companies.
The survey shows that managers in companies employing fewer than 25 people
were the least likely to have had training in work time and had the most
negative attitudes to it.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Cautious optimism signalled on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence that the worst of the recession may be over is contained in
new figures on company registrations and in a survey of business confidence
from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business-information group.
The figures on registrations of new companies provided grounds for 'cautious
optimism' in the view of Jordans, the monitoring group which compiled them.
Jordans said the number of companies formed last year fell for the third
year running but the rate of decline was lower than in either 1990 or 1991.
In particular, the decline in company formations slowed in the second half
of 1992, underlining expectations that the recession may be ending. Company
registrations in the UK excluding Northern Ireland reached 107,375 last
year, down 2.5 per cent on 1991.
Jordans said the decline in company formations compared with a year-on-year
reduction of 9.1 per cent in 1991 and 7.1 per cent in 1990.
Formation of companies provides a rough guide to overall economic activity.
However, the link is inexact since the figures do not distinguish between
functioning businesses and those formed for legal reasons or as
subsidiaries.
In the latter six months of last year, 51,371 companies were formed - 1.8
per cent below the 52,293 in the corresponding period in 1991. That compared
with the year-on-year change in the first six months of 3.3 per cent, when
registrations dropped to 56,004 from 57,815.
Between 1991 and 1992, the decline in formation of new companies in England
and Wales was 2.1 per cent compared with 8.4 per cent in Scotland.
The Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey suggests that businesses are more optimistic
that sales and profits will improve this year compared with last year.
The survey suggests that confidence has increased significantly since the
first quarter of last year, with light industry and the service sector
expected to lead a revival in sales over the next three months.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's confidence index has returned to levels last recorded in
early 1990 before the recession took hold. The survey shows that nearly 40
per cent of businesses expect profits to rise in the first quarter against
22 per cent expecting a fall.
However, in spite of improved expectations about company performance,
executives are more cautious than a year ago when optimism about higher
sales was unfulfilled.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which surveyed 1,950 managing directors in the first three
weeks of December, said optimism was highest in London, the south-east and
the north.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Sir John Prideaux: ex-bank head - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR John Prideaux, chairman of National Westminster Bank during Britain's
secondary banking crisis in 1974, has died aged 81.
He attended Eton and entered banking in 1930 when he joined Arbuthnot
Latham, a merchant bank connected with his mother's family. Sir John had
been a territorial officer in the Middlesex Yeomanry and during the second
world war served as a staff officer. As a colonel he served at Second Army
headquarters.
He joined the board of Westminster Bank in 1955, and became a director after
the merger with National Provincial in 1968.
Sir John served as chairman of National Westminster from 1971 to 1977.
During the secondary banking crisis NatWest was the subject of intense
speculation about heavy losses stemming from aggressive pursuit of domestic
business and loans connected with the Italian financier Mr Michele Sindona.
Sir John took the highly unusual step of issuing a public statement denying
that NatWest faced any insolvency crisis, which effectively ended the
speculation.
Sir John was from 1977 to 1980 a member of the Wilson Committee which
reviewed the functioning of City institutions. At the time the left wing of
the Labour party was calling for nationalisation of banks. The committee
recommended that no major changes be made.
Sir John served as chairman of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers from
1974 to 1976 and was vice-president of the British Bankers' Association from
1972 to 1977.
He was awarded an OBE in 1945 and knighted in 1974. His other interests
included St Thomas' Hospital, where he was treasurer and chairman of the
governors from 1964 to 1974, and the Goldsmiths Company where his family had
been wardens for four generations. He became prime warden in 1972.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Guinness adviser in court today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE criminal proceedings arising from the Guinness affair enter their last
lap today with the start of the trial of Mr Thomas Ward, the US attorney who
advised the company during the 1986 takeover battle for Distillers.
Mr Ward faces three charges related to the fee paid to him by Guinness for
his services. He is accused of the theft of Pounds 5.2m, false accounting
concerning the fee and procuring the execution of a valuable security by
deception.
Mr Ward denies all thecharges against him.
The trial will take place at the Old Bailey and is expected to last three
months. Mr Ward was arrested in June 1991 after returning voluntarily to the
UK following the commencement of extradition proceedings by the British
authorities in 1989.
His trial is the third to take place over the Guinness affair. After the
first trial, Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman; Mr Gerald
Ronson, the Heron group chairman; Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker, and
Sir Jack Lyons, a financier, were convicted between them on 28 charges of
conspiracy, theft and false accounting.
The second trial collapsed after the deterioration of the mental health of
one of the defendants, Mr Roger Seelig, the former Morgan Grenfell corporate
financier, while conducting his own defence. A nolle prosequi, a decision
not to prosecute, was entered against him.
The charges against his co-defendant, Lord Spens, were initially left to lie
on the file but he was finally acquitted last November.
Mr David Mayhew, a partner with brokers Cazenove, was due to appear
alongside Mr Seelig in a third trial, but charges against him were dropped
before the case came to court.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Fowler joins Major in tax warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, yesterday joined Mr John
Major, the prime minister, in cautioning against growing calls for the
government to increase taxes to tackle its mounting deficit.
In an ITV television interview the Conservative party chairman appeared to
side with the growing number of Tory MPs who have expressed disquiet at
arguments by Lord Howe, the former chancellor, that tax rises may be
necessary and inevitable.
'The Conservative party is and remains the party of low taxation,' he said.
Mr Major last week also appeared to reject increases in income tax or value
added tax in an BBC interview with Sir David Frost.
Sir Norman's comments came after the end of Mr Norman Lamont's traditional
two-day brainstorming session at the Kent country house of Chevening where
the chancellor met officials to discuss options for the coming budget.
The party chairman was en route to a similar meeting at Chequers where Mr
Major was yesterday holding talks with senior Downing Street policy staff.
The meeting reviewed ways of adding momentum to the government's programme
and finding ways of highlighting its underlying philosophy.
Senior Conservative Central Office officials are due at Chequers today to
discuss a radical reorganisation of the party and plans for tackling an
overdraft nearing Pounds 20m. Two reviews of the party's organisation - one
of professional employees, the other of the voluntary section - are also on
the agenda.
An announcement of a comprehensive restructuring of the party is due early
in February. Under plans announced last week by Mr Paul Judge, the new
Central Office director-general, annual overspending running at Pounds 5m is
to be brought into balance by 1996.
The reforms include the loss of up to 60 professional staff at the Smith
Square headquarters and regional offices.
A scheme devised by Sir Basil Feldman, chairman of the National Union of
Conservative Associations, the party's voluntary wing, also envisages the
creation of a new board of management for the party as part of an overhaul
of its command structures.
Members of the Charter movement, a pressure group for more internal
democracy in the party, have campaigned for constituency associations to
have the right to elect the chairman of the board.
A senior official said last night there was no likelihood of the suggestion
being adopted as it was crucial the party chairman be appointed by the party
leader and had his or her confidence. 'There are only about two Charter
supporters on the National Union executive. That amounts to about 150 people
in all,' he said.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Legislation 'threat to equal pay'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gap between men's and women's pay could widen because of the
government's Employment Bill, the Equal Opportunities Commission says today
in a critical review of the proposed legislation.
Ms Joanna Foster, who chairs the commission, said: 'In our view, the
employment bill has enormous implications for women at work.' She added that
government consultation had been inadequate given the significance of the
legislation.
Ms Foster, who has had several public disagreements with Mrs Gillian
Shephard, employment minister, will stand down as chair of the commission
later this year.
The commission said three clauses, including one providing for maternity
rights and another abolishing wages councils, gave most cause for concern.
It warned that the clause on maternity rights was inadequate and might not
fully comply with European Community law, and that it would make a scheme
which was already too complicated still more complex.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Judicial choices criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR judicial appointments last year did little to alter the image of the
judiciary as unrepresentative of society and dominated by white, middle-aged
Oxbridge-educated men, according to a Labour MP.
An analysis of last year's senior judicial appointments by Mr Stephen Byers,
MP for Wallsend and chairman of Labour's home affairs committee, found that
86 per cent of those appointed who were educated in the UK had attended
either Oxford or Cambridge universities and that more than 80 per cent had
attended private schools.
No women were appointed to the House of Lords or the Appeal Court last year.
Only two women were appointed to the High Court bench.
All those appointed were white with an average age of 52, although Mr
Justice Hirst was promoted to the Court of Appeal at the age of 67.
Mr Byers said the findings were 'depressing and disappointing' and showed
that senior members of the judiciary continued to be drawn from a very
narrow social and educational background.
He accused Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, of demonstrating complacency
in refusing to consider changes to the present appointments system.
He called for the establishment of an independent judicial appointments
commission, for vacancies to be advertised, for applications to be invited
and for selection criteria to be published.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Showdown in the Last Chance Saloon: Raymond Snoddy examines
the implications of the Calcutt report on regulating the press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE political battle to determine where the line should be drawn between
press freedom and individual privacy started in earnest yesterday.
According to widespread leaks in Sunday's national newspapers Sir David
Calcutt QC, in his report on press behaviour, has decided self-regulation of
the press has failed and that tough action should be taken, including fines
and a statutory press complaints tribunal.
Although there was no official confirmation yesterday, those who gave
evidence to Sir David and have seen parts of the report believe the
newspapers were broadly correct.
Sir David, whose original report on the press and privacy was published in
June 1990, was asked to look at how the new Press Complaints Commission -
whose establishment he recommended - was working.
Ironically, Sir David's second report on the press was called for by Mr
David Mellor when national heritage secretary - before his political career
was engulfed by tabloid headlines. The months in which Sir David took
evidence coincided with a long hot summer of controversial articles about
the personal lives not only of Mr Mellor and an actress, but also of members
of the royal family.
The reported Calcutt recommendations follow closely his recipe in the
original report for what should happen if self-regulation failed. There
would be substantial fines for newspapers breaching a statutory code of
conduct implemented by a press complaints tribunal. The chairman of such a
tribunal, replacing the complaints commission, would be a judge, sitting
with two lay assessors. These would amount to the most draconian measures
taken against the British press in modern times.
Under the proposals there would be new criminal offences covering physical
intrusion, electronic eavesdropping and taking long-distance photographs of
people who are on private property. These proposals were in the original
report but not implemented.
The leaks came after the report was delivered on Friday to Mr Peter Brooke,
national heritage secretary, and appear to be the work of journalistic
contacts with political sources, rather than a government move to discredit
the proposals. Mr Brooke's officials declined to comment yesterday.
The press has been worried for some months about what Sir David would
recommend. The first signs that the proposals might be tougher than expected
came just before Christmas when a small group from the complaints commission
was shown two chapters. The group was not told of Sir David's findings, only
allowed to check the accuracy of the account of how the commission was set
up and what subsequently happened.
Those who read the account, it is said, were shocked at the 'arrogant and
petulant' version of events. Sir David appeared more concerned that his
original recommendations had not been followed to the letter rather than
trying to assess what the commission had achieved.
Those who have read the Calcutt chapters believe they are biased. Commission
members note that when they gave evidence to Sir David they were not asked
how the body was working. Sir David was more concerned that it might have
strayed into areas such as defending press freedom.
In evidence to Sir David, the commission said self-regulation of the press
was working. Between January 1991 and July last year, 36 complaints or 3 per
cent of the total had been upheld. In 358 cases the commission found no
prima facie breach of the code of practice drawn up by the newspaper
industry. And 373 complaints were resolved between editor and complainant.
Only six complaints on breaches of privacy were upheld.
The newspaper industry will have a difficult job arguing that case in the
face of political anger over celebrated rows, particularly those involving
the royal family and the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales.
Perhaps the most notorious was about recorded telephone conversations,
apparently of the Princess of Wales talking to a male friend. They were not
only published in The Sun but 'exhibited' by it on a premium telephone line.
In spite of the growing furore in parliament and the second reading of the
private member's bill introduced by Mr Clive Soley, Labour MP for
Hammersmith, on the press at the end of this month, it is unlikely Calcutt's
draconian measures will be implemented.
What is now considered inevitable - and senior newspaper figures privately
agree - is the introduction of measures against the bugging and reproduction
of private telephone calls unless the public interest is involved.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Leeds firm heads earnings table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIBB Lupton Broomhead, the Leeds-based firm of commercial solicitors, has
emerged as the UK's most profitable regional law firm in 1991-92, according
to a league table of earnings published by Legal Business.
Dibb Lupton had average net profits per partner of Pounds 166,000 on
turnover of Pounds 28.8m and fees per fee-earner (lawyer) of Pounds 87,000.
The firm has 333 fee-earners.
Its nearest rival was Birmingham-based Pinsent &amp; Co with profits per partner
of Pounds 165,000 on turnover of Pounds 17.1m. Pinsent has only half Dibb
Lupton's number of fee-earners.
In contrast the most profitable City law firm, Slaughter and May, had
average net profits of Pounds 377,000 on turnover of Pounds 113m in 1991,
according to figures published by the magazine last March. Slaughter has 542
fee-earners.
The magazine says regional firms suffered almost as much in the 1991-92
financial year as London firms: 'Overall, most regional firms have been
happy to note modest increases in turnover while profit margins have not
held up well.' It notes that the finances of law firms appear to be
dependent on the strength of the local economy. Firms in Leeds have fared
better than their counterparts in other regions, providing four of the top
10 most profitable firms.
Of the six firms examined in the Leeds area, average profits per partner
were Pounds 139,000 compared with East Anglia where average profits per
partner was only Pounds 79,000.
Legal Business said many provincial firms reported a drop in fee income
since the end of the 1991-92 financial year and many say they will struggle
to meet their budgets this year.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Pre-birth technique decides calves' sex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first calves whose sex was pre-determined at conception have been born
in Cambridge, an Anglo-American scientific team will announce today.
The ability to choose a calf's gender, long sought by cattle breeders, is
likely to transform the economics and management of livestock production
worldwide.
The Holstein Friesian calves - three male and three female - are the product
of collaboration between Mastercalf, a Cambridge biotechnology company, the
Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics Research in Cambridge, and the
US Department of Agriculture's Germplasm Physiology Laboratory in Maryland.
The scientists are producing pre-sexed calf embryos at a rate of more than
100 per week for use in large-scale field trials under way on farms in
England and Scotland.
If all goes well, sex determination will be available commercially within a
couple of years. Mr Barrie Audis, chairman of the British Cattle Breeders
Club, predicts it will make a big impact on the dairy and beef industries.
The technique depends on an instrument called a flow cytometer that sorts
bulls' sperm into two parts according to their genetic content. Sperm with
an X-chromosome result in female calves and those with a Y-chromosome give
males.
But the sorting process does not give enough sexed sperm for conventional
artificial insemination. Embryo transfer and in vitro fertilisation are
necessary - cows' eggs are fertilised in test tubes with the appropriate
sperm and the resulting embryos used to establish pregnancy.
Mr Geoff Mahon, Mastercalf managing director, said sex determination will be
combined with other techniques of genetic selection, so that bull calves can
be given the characteristics most desirable for beef production while
heifers retain the best genes for milking.
Male embryos will be most in demand, since beef farmers want only bull
calves and an average dairy farmer needs a ratio of one heifer calf to every
three bull calves sold for meat.
Mr Mahon says the cost of sex-guaranteed embryos is uncertain. Mr Audis, a
potential customer, says: 'I could justify buying an embryo for Pounds 50 to
Pounds 60 if I am guaranteed that it is a male beef calf.'
With a world population of dairy cattle of about 220m - about half of which
are born through artificial insemination - Mastercalf sees a large market
for the technology. It has already given Mitsubishi Corporation an exclusive
licence for Japan.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS LIZ FORGAN, director of programmes at Channel 4, will be named today as
managing director of BBC Radio in succession to Mr David Hatch.
Ms Forgan, 48, has worked on national newspapers, but has no experience in
radio. It had been assumed that Ms Forgan, who has a reputation as an
independent-minded defender of broadcasting freedom, would become managing
director of BBC Television in succession to Mr Will Wyatt.
Mr Bob Phillis, chief executive of Independent Television News, will be
confirmed today as the new deputy director-general of the BBC.
Mr Phillis, a former managing director of Central Independent Television and
former group managing director of Carlton Communications, is the most
important of the new BBC appointments to be announced by Mr John Birt, who
took over as director-general on January 4.
The new deputy director-general, who is 47, will have the title of managing
director of resources.
He will have control over the entire operational and financial structure of
the BBC and will be responsible for overseeing, at least for some time, the
corporation's international activities, including BBC World Service and
World Service Television.
The managerial changes do not imply a big structural re-organisation at the
BBC, at least not immediately. Mr Phillis, who introduced tighter financial
controls at ITN, will have the task of improving financial disciplines at
the much larger BBC.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Training initiative faces cash crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN inner-city educational project that has successfully motivated young
black people to study and obtain qualifications is fighting for survival
because of financial problems.
A total of 300 pupils aged between eight and 18 are studying voluntarily
during evenings, weekends and holidays at the Chapeltown and Harehills
Assisted Learning Computer School in Leeds, and a further 400 are waiting
for a place.
The school, set up in 1987 by Mr Brainard Braimah, a Ghanaian teacher, to
tackle low educational achievement among local black children, has seen four
of its former students go to university and dozens obtain GCSEs.
The winding-up last year of the Leeds Task Force, a government inner-city
initiative, cost the school its main source of funding.
A final grant of Pounds 25,000 - matched by equal sums from Leeds City
Action Team and the city's Training and Enterprise Council - was expected to
last until March 31, but will be used up by next month, leaving the school
in urgent need of Pounds 7,000 to survive until April and uncertain of its
funding next year.
Mr Braimah last week held discussions with the City Action Team, which
co-ordinates government departments' inner-city efforts in Leeds and
Bradford, and later this month will meet the Tec. But he is not hopeful they
will be able to fill the gap in funding left by the Task Force.

MR Bob Phillis, chief executive of Independent Television News, will be
confirmed today as the new deputy director-general of the BBC.
Mr Phillis, a former managing director of Central Independent Television and
former group managing director of Carlton Communications, is the most
important of the new appointments to be announced by Mr John Birt, who took
over as director-general on January 4. The new deputy director-general, who

He will have control over the entire operational and financial structure of
the BBC and will be responsible for overseeing, at least for some time, the
corporation's international activities, including BBC World Service and
World Service Television.
Mr Phillis is not expected to join the BBC until the present restructuring
of ITN is complete. A seven-company consortium, led by Carlton
Communications, is due to take over from the existing 15 companies which own
the news organisation.
Ms Liz Forgan, the director of programmes at Channel 4 who has a reputation
as an independent-minded defender of broadcasting freedom, will join the BBC
as a managing director. Until now it had been assumed that she would become
managing director of BBC Television in succession to Mr Will Wyatt. There
were growing reports in the corporation last night that Ms Forgan would
become managing director of BBC Radio in succession to Mr David Hatch.
The managerial changes do not imply a big structural reorganisation at the
BBC, at least not immediately. Reports that the corporation was to become a
single-structure organisation covering both radio and television seem wide
of the mark.
Mr Phillis, who introduced tighter financial controls at ITN, will have the
task of improving financial disciplines at the much larger BBC. One of his
first tasks will be to get to the bottom of the admitted Pounds 38m
overspend at BBC Television in 1991-92 and the potential overspend of at
least Pounds 20m in 1992-93
The new managing director of resources will also be responsible for
overseeing the implementation of producer choice throughout BBC Television.
This is the policy that enables programme makers to buy services from the
outside market if it is more efficient.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Weather blocks Shetland salvage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY seas and high winds around Shetland again blocked attempts to remove
the oil remaining on the tanker Braer yesterday.
Although the ship has not broken apart, salvage specialists believe this
will eventually happen.
Experts now believe that no further oil is leaking from the vessel, which
may still contain as much as half of its 84,000-tonne cargo. But oil is
still spreading northwards for about 25 miles up the west coast of the main
Shetland island.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary,
will both make statements to the Commons about the disaster today.
Yesterday Shetland salmon farmers received a boost when the supermarket
group Safeway said it would continue to buy farmed Shetland salmon after it
had visited the islands.
Last Friday Marks and Spencer announced that it was stopping buying Shetland
salmon as 'a temporary precautionary measure'. Other food retailers are
monitoring the situation.
The Shetland salmon farming industry is one of the sectors of the islands'
economy most threatened by the disaster. Since Friday the salmon farmers
have been prohibited from harvesting salmon in a 400,000 square mile area
under a ban ordered by the Scottish Office. The ban, which also covers the
catching of sea fish, was announced just after the islands' fishing and
fish-farming organisations had declared their own ban.
There are 16 salmon farms in the area covered by the ban, accounting for
about a quarter of Shetland's salmon production which last year totalled
10,000 tonnes.
Shetland council said yesterday that it was retaining the solicitors
Penningtons to represent it in dealing with legal issues arising from the
Braer incident.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Iraq defiant but threat of strike recedes: Missiles seized
from Kuwait
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ continued yesterday to deny it had retreated in the face of the United
Nations ultimatum on its missile deployment, and Iraqi soldiers were
reported to have made a raid into Kuwait to seize weapons, but the prospect
of an early military strike by the US-led coalition appeared considerably
reduced.
According to the Kuwaiti News Agency, UN Iraqi-Kuwaiti Observation Mission
spokesman Abdellatif Kabbaj said 200 Iraqi soldiers crossed into Kuwait at
7.10am local time and seized armaments in trenches, including four Silkworm
surface-to-surface missiles.
UN observers, who guard the trenches, tried unsuccessfully to prevent them
returning to Iraq by blocking Iraqi lorries with their cars.
The US had no immediate comment on the raid but said it was monitoring the
border.
Earlier, an official statement issued in Baghdad claimed it was 'incorrect'
to conclude that 'Iraq gave in to threats from Bush's administration'.
Simultaneously, Iraq continued to ban internal flights of UN aircraft.
It denied permission yesterday for a UN aircraft to land, and inspectors of
the Baghdad office of the UN Special Commission were stranded in Bahrain.
On Saturday a White House statement said the US was satisfied that Iraq had
'backed down' in its latest conflict with the US and its allies. Yesterday
US officials did not think the ban on UN aircraft carring weapons inspectors
would necessarily escalate quickly into a confrontation equivalent to last
week's, although the potential for this clearly existed.
Some tentative encouragement was also drawn from the Iraqi statement, which
hoped for better relations with the incoming government of President-elect
Bill Clinton. It accused Mr George Bush of trying to 'embroil' Mr Clinton in
his policies.
But the US is not persuaded that Iraq has fully met the terms of last week's
UN ultimatum. Its missiles and aircraft appear to have been withdrawn from
bases close to the exclusion zone in the country's south, but there was no
precise word of their whereabouts.
The commander of the US naval flotilla now on patrol in the Gulf said Iraq
could expect no more warnings if the no-fly zone was violated in future.
Rear Admiral Phil Coady said that President Saddam Hussein 'has had the only
warning he's going to be given'.
US officials have long been critical of what is known as the Iraqi policy of
'cheat and retreat'. Close aerial reconnaissance of Iraqi defence
deployments are likely to continue and there is no plan to order an early
withdrawal from the Gulf of the US naval presence.
Even if the immediate crisis in the south has been avoided, there is growing
concern about Iraqi incursions into the exclusion zone in the
Kurdish-dominated north.

postponed indefinitely after India made clear at the weekend that the
'atmosphere was not conducive' to holding the conference.
Bombay has been tense since last month's nationwide riots, triggered by the

The latest phase of violence between Hindus and Moslems has claimed at least
168 lives. Eighty more people were killed in Bombay yesterday.
In Ahmadabad and Baroda in Gujarat, more than 30 people were killed at the
weekend before the authorities restored order. Six leaders of the BJP,
including Mr Lal Krishan Advani and Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, are expected to
be released unconditionally today, under orders from the Uttar Pradesh chief
judicial magistrate. The men were arrested for inciting communal violence.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Madhavrao Scindia, India's minister for civil aviation and tourism,
resigned on Saturday, hours after an Uzbekistan Airways aircraft leased to
Indian Airlines crashed at New Delhi airport, Shiraz Sidhva writes.
The Russian pilot, who was told not to land in the dense early morning fog,
apparently did not understand the command in English. The 165 passengers
aboard the Russian TU-154 aircraft crawled to safety.
The aircraft was one of seven TU-154s leased by Indian Airlines, the
government-owned domestic carrier, after pilots went on strike on December
10.
Mr Scindia said he was taking moral responsibility for the crash, as he had
not been able to resolve the strike for more than a month. This compelled
'Indian Airlines to lease the Russian aircraft due to the unfortunate
attitude of the pilots'.
Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, minister for parliamentary affairs, will take temporary
charge of the civil aviation and tourism ministries.
Mr Scindia had distinguished himself as railways minister in Mr Rajiv
Gandhi's cabinet, and had held his current office since June 1991.

ANGOLAN army troops and rebels are still fighting for control of Huambo,
despite an announcement by the government that Unita leader Jonas Savimbi's
stronghold had been captured and he had fled, Reuter reports from Luanda.
The state daily newspaper, Jornal de Angola, reported yesterday that Unita
forces still controlled residential areas of the city, where most of its
leaders lived. Unita's radio station said the group's entire leadership was
still in Huambo, a provincial capital 500km south-east of Luanda.
'Government forces are still under fire and have sustained heavy human and
material losses,' it said.
An army communique on Saturday said government troops had captured Mr
Savimbi's headquarters and his supporters were fleeing. There was no
independent word on Mr Savimbi's whereabouts.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Testing times ahead for Kenya observers: Michael Holman on
doubts over Commonwealth group's judgment in the election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not only the Kenyan government that will come under close scrutiny
following disclosures about the country's electoral commission.
Also under the spotlight will be the Commonwealth observers sent to monitor
Kenya's first multi-party elections in 26 years. The 38-member group charged
with assessing whether the poll was 'free and fair' now faces searching
questions about judgment and performance.
The scrutiny is prompted by the disclosure of a confidential file which
casts doubt on the suitability of Mr Zachaeus Chesoni as the choice to head
Kenya's electoral commission.
The Commonwealth group chose not to make public its anxieties about the key
post, while the preliminary report on the poll also makes clear their unease
about other aspects of the election.
The observers' concerns included the conduct of the registration process in
many parts of the country; the nomination process, which saw 16 ruling party
MPs unopposed; the intimidation, administrative obstacles and violence that
marked the political campaign; the partisanship of state-owned radio and
television; the reluctance of the government to separate itself from the
ruling Kanu party; and the 'lack of transparency' on the part of the
electoral commission.
Failure to express a specific concern about Mr Chesoni has puzzled
opposition politicians who have been campaigning for his dismissal.
Mr Paul Muite, a lawyer and senior official in the FORD Kenya party, wrote
in the July 13 issue of Society, a Nairobi weekly, that Mr Chesoni was
'totally unsuited' to the post.
'He has been twice removed from his position as a judge in the court of
appeal and the High Court', for reasons that Mr Muite said had yet to be
officially disclosed.
Mr Muite also noted that 'before (Mr Chesoni's) appointment as the chairman
of the electoral commission, there was a bankruptcy petition against him
pending before the High Court.'
It was alleged, the article continued, that Mr Chesoni 'owed close to Ks30m
(Pounds 555,000) to the Kenya Commercial Bank'. Mr Muite asked whether the
money was still unpaid and, if paid, how?
Opposition leaders were not surprised that calls for Mr Chesoni to be
replaced were ignored by the government. 'But what astonished us was that we
got no backing from the Commonwealth secretariat or western governments,'
said Mr Muite yesterday.' I have no doubt that Commonwealth officials were
able to confirm our information with the British and US diplomats.'
Spokesmen at the two missions said they were aware of the allegations but
did not have proof.
As the election process got under way, the electoral commission came under
increasing criticism.
Some of the most scathing comments came from Mr Hilary Ng'weno, editor of
the Nairobi-based Weekly Review. 'According to the Commonwealth election
observer team,' Mr Ng'weno wrote in an editorial on November 20, 'a lot of
work has already been done by the commission in preparation for the
elections. But you would not know it. The commission seems incapable of, or
unwilling, to tell the public what is going on.
'It holds every bit of information as if it is secret information. It won't
let opposition leaders view ballot boxes. Only after pressure does it
release the names of people it has appointed as presiding officers. This is
not as it should be.'
Widespread complaints prompted a Commonwealth intervention in mid-November.
But calls for Mr Chesoni's removal were resisted.
When Justice Telford Georges, leader of the Commonwealth group, was
presented with the 'Chesoni dossier' he was outraged by what he read,
according to Commonwealth officials.
But he gave little public hint of it; nor did the remaining 37 observers,
all of whom were aware of the file and its contents, according to
Commonwealth officials.
At the heart of the problem, say some critics, was the Commonwealth group's
uncertainty about its mandate as monitor, which in turn led to some
confusion about its responsibilities.
Its terms of reference oblige it only to say whether the poll was 'free and
fair'. The Commonwealth's own catalogue of 'irregularities' make No the only
answer.
But as one observer put it, the unwritten question that weighed heavily
throughout the exercise was: 'What is in the best interests of Kenya?' The
answer, the observer implied, could override strict application of the 'free
and fair' yardstick.
The question may well have dominated consideration of Mr Chesoni's file. An
answer may come when the group's 100-page assessment of the conduct of the
election process is published later this week.
It is too late for the observers to change their minds - but the report may
show the results of a post mortem on the Kenyan experience which could
fundamentally affect the Commonwealth's definition of its monitoring role in
the future.

MR PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, cancelled a visit to
Bangladesh as Bombay and parts of Gujarat state in western India continued
to burn for the sixth consecutive day yesterday.
Mr Rao was due to attend a meeting of the South Asian Association for
Regional Co-operation scheduled for Thursday and Friday. The summit was
postponed indefinitely after India made clear at the weekend that the
'atmosphere was not conducive' to holding the conference.
Bombay has been tense since last month's nationwide riots, triggered by the
razing of a mosque in Ayodhya, northern India, by supporters of the radical
Hindu Bharatiya Janata party. More than 1,200 people died in the ensuing
violence.
Political sources said the new flare-ups appeared to have been fanned by
Hindu political groups trying to push Mr Rao into an early general election.
The latest phase of violence between Hindus and Moslems has claimed at least
168 lives. Bombay, India's business capital, came to a standstill as 80 more
people died yesterday. Arson and looting continued unabated in several parts
of the city, despite the deployment of the army.
Police patrols, which had been accused of siding with the Hindu community
during the violence that swept the city in December, were shot at and had
acid, petrol bombs and stones thrown at them.
In Ahmadabad and Baroda in Gujarat, more than 30 people were killed and 150
left homeless at the weekend before the authorities restored order. Six
leaders of the BJP, including Mr Lal Krishan Advani and Mr Murli Manohar
Joshi, are expected to be released unconditionally today, under orders from
the Uttar Pradesh chief judicial magistrate. The men were arrested for
inciting communal violence by encouraging the destruction of the Ayodhya
mosque.

MR Jorge Camet Dickman, Peru's industry minister for the past eight months,
has been appointed economy and finance minister following last week's
surprise departure of Mr Carlos Bolona.
Mr Camet, 65, has a track record as a successful engineer and entrepreneur,
and has twice presided over Peru's private businessmen's association.
However, he has no background in economics and only limited knowledge and
experience of the complex workings of the international financial
institutions with which he will be obliged to negotiate in the coming
months.
Mr Camet has so far made no statement of substance on modifications to
economic policy. He claims the general direction towards stabilisation and
structural reform will continue and key members of the Bolona team are
expected to stay on at the Economy Ministry.
Recently both President Alberto Fujimori and Prime Minister Oscar de la
Puente have reiterated the necessity of promoting industrial reactivation
and raising social spending to create jobs and help the poor.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Chile to brief Hurd on Moyle death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO, BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who arrived yesterday from Argentina
on a two-day visit to Chile, is to discuss with Chilean officials the
unsolved murder of Mr Jonathan Moyle, a British defence journalist killed in
Santiago three years ago.
Mr Hurd was expected to be briefed by the Chilean Foreign Ministry on the
slow progress of the murder inquiry. So far, the inquiry has failed to shed
any light on the assassination, which was made to look like suicide.
Mr Moyle, the 28-year-old editor of Defence Helicopter World, was murdered
in the Carrera Hotel in Santiago in March 1990 while covering an airshow.
British interest in Mr Moyle's fate was revived following the collapse of
the Matrix Churchill trial, where it was shown that UK government ministers
sanctioned the sale of military technology to Iraq via a Chilean middle-man,
Mr Carlos Cardoen.
Attempts to link Mr Cardoen to Moyle's assassination collapsed last week
during an identification parade in which a Carrera Hotel chambermaid failed
to recognise a Cardoen employee she thought she had seen talking to Mr Moyle
on the eve of his death. Mr Cardoen has always denied any link to the
murder.
Mr Hurd's two-day visit to Chile is also expected to be taken up with trade
and investment talks, and the impact of the European Community single market
on Chilean exports. The UK is Chile's biggest export market in Europe, with
sales of some Pounds 200m last year, against imports of some Pounds 110m.
British multinationals also have a strong presence in the Chilean mining,
cement, tobacco and food industries, with Pounds 2bn of investments, but
British diplomats in Santiago believe UK exporters are not taking full
advantage of Chile's booming economy, which grew 9.7 per cent last year.
Mr Hurd's five-day visit to Argentina was described by both sides as a
success, even though they made no progress over the Falklands, the only
issue that divides them.
Mr Hurd said his trip proved 'that it is possible to come to Argentina and
not be bombarded all the time by the sovereignty dispute'. British officials
were pleasantly surprised that demonstrators did not meet them on their
arrival in Buenos Aires on Wednesday.
One of Argentina's top Falkland negotiators said Mr Hurd's visit, the first
by a cabinet minister since the 1982 Falklands conflict, meant 'we are on
our way to a broader, richer relationship in which the islands are only a
part of the relationship, not the only issue'.

FT  11 JAN 93 / McCurdy the victim in Congress feud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON knows no fury like a speaker scorned. This is the conventionial
interpretation of last Friday's decision by Mr Tom Foley, the speaker, to
remove Congressman Dave McCurdy, the rising star from Oklahoma, from the
chairmanship of the House intelligence committee.
Yesterday, for the record, Mr Foley flatly denied he wanted to take Mr
McCurdy down a peg.
Intelligence committee members were only supposed to serve for six years,
whereas Mr McCurdy had done nine, the last two as chairman, he said. 'I
thought others should have the opportunity to serve,' he added, while
praising Mr McCurdy's 'credible and innovative' chairmanship of the panel.
In reality, Mr McCurdy, 42 and fairly close to President-elect Bill Clinton,
has been a thorn in Mr Foley's flesh for some time.
At the height of the House bank scandal last year, he questioned the
speaker's leadership and even spoke of launching a challenge for his job. Mr
Foley was returned unopposed to his position last month.
More recently, Mr McCurdy had seemed to be campaigning a little too openly
for the position of secretary of defence or possibly director of the CIA in
the Clinton cabinet. This put him up against Mr Les Aspin, the chairman of
the House armed services committee eventually chosen for the Pentagon job.
Mr Aspin and Mr Foley are close. Adding insult to injury, Mr McCurdy took to
warning that if Mr Aspin did move into the cabinet, the next person in line
for the committee chairmanship would be Mr Ron Dellums of California, the
dovish black congressman from California.
Whatever his policy inclinations, Mr Dellums is also very much a senior
member of the House leadership club under Mr Foley's direction.
Mr McCurdy has also been a prominent member of the Democratic Leadership
Council, the southern-dominated centrist grouping in which Mr Clinton was
long active.
The DLC and its think-tank, the Progressive Policy Institute, provided many
ideas for a successful presidential campaign, from which the congressional
leadership sometimes felt a little excluded.
Mr McCurdy himself issued a statement on Friday seeming to acknowledge that
the speaker had put his foot down. He cited Mr Foley's 'desire to place his
own team' on the intelligence committee.
He remains, however, a member of the armed services committee, with plenty
of opportunity to get his views over.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Foley warns Clinton to rethink plan to cut income tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR TOM FOLEY, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, yesterday advised
President-elect Bill Clinton to re-think his campaign promise to cut income
taxes on the middle class because of the growing federal budget deficit.
In a TV interview, Mr Foley said it was 'probably true' that some popular
social programmes would have to be curtailed and some taxes raised in the
light of the deficit problem. He urged Mr Clinton not to duck such tough
choices, saying 'people are mature enough to be told the truth.'
He thought Mr Clinton should have his legislative programme ready
'reasonably soon', but not necessarily immediately after the inauguration
next week. There was not, he added, 'a use-it-or-lose-it momentum' problem
for the new president, since both Republicans and Democrats were willing to
support the right sort of policy proposals.
Last week, the outgoing Bush administration produced its final econonic
projections pointing to wider, not narrower, deficits, assuming no policy
changes. Forecasting shortfalls of over Dollars 300bn (Pounds 193bn), they
seemed immediately to call into question Mr Clinton's promise to cut the
deficit in half in his first term.
Mr Richard Darman, Mr Bush's budget director, also publicly questioned the
wisdom of some of Mr Clinton's ideas, claiming that 'they do not add up.'
This prompted a tart reply from the president-elect to the effect that Mr
Darman's maths had not proved so reliable either, as the final deficit
forecasts showed.
The Clinton economic team met in Little Rock last week to review policy
options but announced no conclusions beyond acknowledgment of the severity
of the deficit problem. This, in itself, may imply that the tax cut is to be
deferred.
There is some concern in Washington about the slowness in the formation of
the new government.
Although all the cabinet appointments were in place before Christmas, none
of the critical policy-making positions at the next tier have been formally
announced, though rumours of recruitment abound, including that of Mr Larry
Summers, the Harvard economist, to be treasury undersecretary for
international affairs.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Mozer to plead guilty

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL MOZER, former head of government bond trading at Wall Street
securities house Salomon Brothers, is to plead guilty to criminal charges
that he lied to Treasury officials about customer bids he submitted at a
1991 Treasury securities auction.
After concluding a plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Mr Mozer will
appear before a Manhattan court this morning to plead guilty to two felony
counts that he falsified bids, in the names of Salomon customers Warburg
Asset Management and the Quantum Fund, at a February 1991 auction of
five-year treasury notes.
The bids were submitted without the knowledge of either customer, and
enabled Mr Mozer to obtain a greater share of the newly-issued securities
for Salomon than government rules allowed.
Mr Mozer has paid Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 322,000) into a government escrow
account to meet any judgments against him by the Securities and Exchange
Commission or by private civil claims that relate to his bidding activities.
Although the two felony charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in
prison and a Dollars 500,000 fine, a special hearing will be held to
determine how much money, if any, investors and other trading companies lost
as a result of Mr Mozer's actions.
The severity of the sentence will be determined by the hearing's findings.
Mr Mozer's lawyer, Mr Stanley Arkin, maintains that no money was lost
because of his actions, and that neither Mr Mozer nor Salomon profited from
the false bids. Mr Arkin also points out that Mr Mozer has pleaded guilty to
'administrative violations' that he has long conceded were wrong, and argues
that the violations were not severe enough to warrant criminal proceedings.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Speculative effects of Anglo-American capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EMERGING US recovery, alongside deepening difficulties in Germany and
Japan, does not make this a particularly good time to trumpet the merits of
German or Japanese-style co-operative capitalism over the more deal-hungry
Anglo-Saxon variant. But the relatively dismal performances of the US and UK
economies over the last decade should prevent policymakers in these
countries from feeling smug simply because business cycles are currently out
of line.
The commonly cited criticism of Anglo-Saxon economic practices is financial
short-termism. US and UK companies, the conventional wisdom goes, are
hampered by banks who have no stake in their long-term success and will not
lend other than for short-term projects. But differences in financial
practices tend to reflect deeper variations in the structure of corporate
ownership and control across countries, according to Mr Colin Mayer, now at
Warwick University, and Mr Julian Franks of the London Business School.
Franks and Mayer describe two models of corporate governance. In the
outsider system the takeover threat is the main discipline on incumbent
managers. The insider system relies, instead, on internal, committee-style
supervision of management decisions. The outsider system is characterised by
a large number of listed companies, whose shares are frequently traded in a
liquid stock market and in which there are few intercorporate equity
holdings. The insider system, by contrast, has fewer companies which are
vulnerable to takeovers, and a web of cross-shareholdings, so that incumbent
managers tend to have considerable discretion.
Japan, Germany and France fit the insider model. Relative to the US and UK,
they all have a strikingly small number of companies whose equity is
publicly quoted and traded on the stock exchange and thus vulnerable to
takeover. The UK had a little under three times as many quoted companies as
Germany in 1991 and twice as many takeovers in the 1980s.
Within the listed companies, there is much greater concentration of
ownership in the insider economies. Of Germany's listed companies, 85 per
cent had a single shareholder who controlled more than 25 per cent of the
stock in 1990 compared with only 16 per cent of the top 200 listed UK
companies. Of these same UK companies, 77 per cent had a largest shareholder
with no more than 10 per cent of the total equity.
Company shareholder profiles in the insider economies are also markedly
different from the Anglo-Saxon economies, as the chart illustrates. German
companies held 42 per cent of the total equity of quoted Germany companies
in 1990, while banks accounted for a relatively modest 6 per cent. In the
UK, companies held only 10 per cent of total equity while the majority of
shares were held by non-bank financial institutions and private individuals.
The Anglo-American outsider system, Franks and Mayer argue rather
charitably, is best suited to corporate activities which involve subjective
assessments of future prospects and in which takeovers are motivated by
disagreements over corporate strategy. True, studies tend to find little or
no relationship between past company performance and hostile takeovers. But
nearly 80 per cent of executive directors either resign or are dismissed
within two years of a successful hostile bid.
The continental insider system, by contrast, may be better suited to
activities in which there is a direct need to control quality of product,
management and employees. Performance tends to be monitored by a committee
or supervisory board including workers, bankers and experts from related
companies who have a direct stake in the company's future. So while
Anglo-American companies dominate speculative fields such as oil
exploration, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, in manufacturing it is
Japanese and Germany companies that still lead the world.

     INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the
previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The
unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.
Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.

UKRAINE has made progress in efforts to obtain security assurances from the
west in exchange for becoming non-nuclear, authorities in Kiev said
yesterday.
Mr Borys Tarasiuk, deputy minister of foreign affairs, said a draft
agreement in which leading nuclear powers, including Russia, would pledge
not to attack Ukraine had been prepared and was being discussed with the
western nuclear states.
'There are no doubts in anyone's mind that this question will be resolved,'
he said on his return from Washington, where he met President George Bush.
Ukraine, which has 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles on its
territory, is the key to the Start 2 disarmament agreement between Russia
and the US. Until Ukraine ratifies the earlier Start 1 treaty to remove all
nuclear weapons from the country, Start 2 cannot go ahead.
The Ukrainian parliament is hesitating over Start 1 in an attempt to win
security guarantees and financial assistance from the west.
Ukraine is trying to establish a shield against Russia, which would remain a
nuclear power even if Start 2 were implemented.
But to avoid singling out its powerful northern neighbour Mr Tarasiuk said
Ukraine was seeking simultaneous security assurances from the US, France,
the UK and Russia. British diplomats in Kiev confirmed that the UK was
involved in negotiations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATORS from the US and the European Community are meeting in Geneva in
a last-ditch effort to resolve their outstanding differences in the Uruguay
round of trade talks before President-elect Bill Clinton takes office on
January 20.
Officials from other key countries have also been drawn into the
discussions, which began on Friday and are expected to intensify in the
coming days. Trade diplomats hope that an outline deal, or evidence of
progress towards one, can be presented to the meeting next Friday of senior
Uruguay round trade negotiators.
However, US and EC officials acknowledged last night that little progress
had been made in the weekend talks. 'Things are still exceedingly
difficult,' one senior US official said.
Since the US and EC settled their farm trade wrangles last November, the
six-year-old round has been beset by a host of other disagreements and by
political uncertainties on both sides of the Atlantic.
In Washington, top officials are packing their bags and looking for new
employment while the Clinton transition team scraps over trade policy. In
Europe, France has been snapping at the heels of the Community's negotiators
over services as well as farm trade, and the key Community trade and
agriculture portfolios have just changed hands.
Mrs Carla Hills, President George Bush's trade representative, and Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC's new trade commissioner, nevertheless decided on January 2
to aim for an outline deal by next Friday.
This would enable President Clinton, if he chose, to submit a more-or-less
complete accord to Congress by March 2, when the administration's
negotiating authority expires. Failure to catch that deadline could delay
the round by months, if not years.
The teams in Geneva headed by Mr Warren Lavorel, US chief negotiator, and
his EC opposite number, Mr Hugo Paemen, are trying to agree a package of
industrial tariff cuts and narrow differences elsewhere.
EC officials say an early agreement will require restraint by Washington in
re-opening the draft package of Uruguay round agreements drawn up 13 months
ago.
Washington has asked for renegotiation of some 25 issues, including
anti-dumping and subsidy rules, patent and copyright protection, and
establishment of a multilateral trade organisation.
The revised US tariff offer, belatedly produced on Friday, entails tariff
cuts of just over one-third, but this includes zero-for-zero deals which
have not yet been agreed by the EC or others. It does not include cuts in
very high tariffs on textiles and some other sensitive products, although
officials have said cuts could be made in exchange for a satisfactory
zero-for-zero package.

<TEXT>
Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said yesterday France was
prepared to act alone if necessary to liberate by force prisoner camps in
Bosnia where civilians had been raped and tortured.
'I suggest we ensure that this liberation is put into effect if necessary by
force, since we now have the legal right to intervene and there is evidence
on the existence of these camps and of tortures and rape that are committed
there,' Mr Dumas said on RTL radio.
He said he had asked Mr Bernard Kouchner, the health and humanitarian
affairs minister, to arrange 'if necessary on our own' for convoys under
military escort to go to the camps and liberate them.
Mr Dumas also said a UN resolution authorising the use of force to implement
a no-fly zone over Bosnia should be passed in the next few days.
'This means shooting down planes if necessary and a right of pursuit and
pre-emption if installations such as missile batteries or radars prevent
them from carrying out their mission,' he said.
Mr Kouchner earlier urged the UN to amend its arms embargo to allow the
Bosnians to arm themselves.
Mr Eduard Balladur, a favourite to become prime minister if the
conservatives win the elections, yesterday also urged the UN to act. 'The
time has come for vigorous intervention,' he said.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, this weekend met President
Francois Mitterrand, who is said to have agreed to discuss the possibility
of intervention under the aegis of the UN.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Turkey takes Moslems under its wing: Ankara is arguing for
force against Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   by JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THANKS to Turkey's lobbying and the loan of the Turkish president's private
jet, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem leader, should get a hearing at
today's special meeting of Islamic Conference countries in Senegal.
Turkey, a Moslem country with a devoutly secular constitution, is today in
the curious position of outdoing even the most radical Islamic states in
defence of Bosnia's Moslems.
For more than six months Turkey has been a lone voice within North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation calling for military intervention to prevent the
carve-up of the former Yugoslav republic.
Turkey was quick to offer troops but the UN has indicated its opposition to
involving such regional countries in peacekeeping.
'Turkey in some ways is in a no-lose situation,' says a western diplomat.
'It can offer a battalion, a division, the whole Turkish army in the safe
knowledge that the UN would never accept.'
The move has none the less done much to allay criticism of the government
amid growing public outrage at the failure of the international community to
curb Serbian aggression.
Primary school pupils are raising money for refugees from the conflict.
After the latest reports of Moslem rape victims, the government despatched a
team of abortionists. Turkish opposition politicians have sought electoral
mileage from high-profile visits to the region.
The reason for Turkish concern is partly historical. While officials are
quick to disclaim irredentist ambitions towards their country's former
Ottoman dependencies in the Balkans, Bosnia is often casually described as
part of the Turkish nation.
There are after all an estimated 2m Slav 'Bosnaks' in Istanbul and other
cities, who first settled in Turkey as the empire collapsed. Many are
prominent in Turkish business and society.
Having turned its back on its imperial past some 70 years ago, republican
Turkey today finds itself, however reluctantly, as the moral protector of
those communities whom the Ottomans converted to Islam. As Mumtaz Soysal, a
leading Turkish commentator, sees it: 'It's not unlike the way western
powers, particularly the French, sought to guarantee the rights of the
Christian minorities under the Ottoman Empire.'
As Turkey sees it, if Serbian aggression is not met by force in Bosnia, the
crisis could reawaken other ethnic conflicts, dragging in all the regional
powers, Turkey, Greece, Albania and Bulgaria, and perhaps even the Russians.
At a hastily convened Balkan foreign ministers meeting in Istanbul in
November, Turkey voiced concern over Kosovo, the previously autonomous
region on the Albanian border which Serbia in effect re-annexed three years
ago.
Turkey has close ties with Albania and could be dragged into a conflict if
Albania sought to defend Kosovo's 2.5m ethnic Albanians.
The Turks argue that inaction on the part of the west will also help fuel a
more radical Moslem reaction, which in the long run will damage the case for
Turkey's own position in the heart of Europe.
In the public mind, the Bosnian crisis has already been reduced to a simple
conflict of Christian against Moslem, which has not made it any easier for
the government to steer a moderate course.
The OIC set January 15 as an informal deadline for the international
community to take action. Turkish officials say the threat of unilateral
military intervention by the OIC is only 'an insinuation' and that any
military action will have to be under UN auspices.
In practice, given the naval blockade, it is hard to see what the OIC can
do. Mr Hikmet Cetin, foreign minister, last week suggested the Islamic
countries could impose an oil embargo on western countries to force action.
This may have been the foreign minister indulging in domestic politics. His
Social Democrat party, the junior partner in the coalition, is currently
challenged by Republican People's party leader Deniz Baykal, whose trip to
Sarajevo grabbed the Turkish headlines last week.
However, the suggestion is further evidence of Turkey's growing frustration
over the Bosnian crisis.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, today begins
a two-day official visit to Bonn and will tell the German government that it
cannot expect a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, or play a greater
role in the organisation, until and unless it defines the role of its army
outside Nato.
The secretary-general will also outline plans to reform the UN in talks with
President Richard von Weizsacker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mr Klaus Kinkel,
the foreign minister, and leaders of the main parliamentary parties.
UN officials believe the outcome of the talks could help the country's main
political parties reach a consensus on how the constitution could be amended
to allow the Bundeswehr (German army) to become more involved in non-Nato
operations outside Germany.
Article 87 of the German constitution stipulates that the use of German
troops must be limited to self-defence on its own territory, while article
24 allows Germans to fight alongside allies in joint security pacts, such as
Nato. Since 1949 the federal government has consistently adopted the
political position that the constitution does not allow the deployment of
German forces outside the Nato area.
The mood among some of the political parties is shifting towards
constitutional amendments enabling German troops to participate in UN
peace-keeping operations, and UN-backed humanitarian efforts.
Any change in the constitution would require a two-thirds majority of the
Bundestag, and support from the opposition Social Democratic party. So far
there is little consensus among the governing coalition of Christian
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and Free Democrats, and the SDP on
the Bundeswehr's role.
The CDU/CSU want the Bundeswehr to be engaged in international operations
even outside the auspices of the UN, when it is necessary for peace. The SPD
wants the Bundeswehr to be linked directly to any UN Security Council
resolution and limited to peace-keeping operations, although the SPD is
considering involvement in the military protection of humanitarian aid
convoys. The FDP wants any peace-enforcing missions by the Bundeswehr to be
carried out under the auspices of the UN.
'We cannot express our intentions (of any future involvement in the UN)
until we have come to grips with this constitutional problem,' a Foreign
Ministry official said. 'We have to come to grips with this problem over the
coming months otherwise we will face a credibility gap with the
international community.'
Germany, which is the third largest contributor to the UN, has already
deployed 1,500 soldiers in Cambodia in the form of medical back-up and
supplies, and has provided aircraft and pilots to help the Somalia relief
operation.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Beregovoy fires election salvo on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday kicked off the
Socialist party's election campaign by calling on the next French government
to reduce unemployment from 10.5 per cent to 8 per cent by 1998.
Joblessness has emerged as a dominant issue in the approach to France's
parliamentary elections in March. The rise in unemployment - now nearing 3m
 -is one of the biggest sources of embarrassment for Mr Beregovoy and the
ruling Socialists, who face an uphill struggle in their attempts to improve
their dismal opinion poll per-formance.
Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialists and the leader of their
re-election effort, yesterday acknowledged that unemployment was his party's
'major weakness'. He told a Socialist conference in Paris that the party had
to 'get to grips with the issue'.
The right-wing opposition has already begun its attack on their unemployment
record. Mr Eduard Balladur, who is tipped to be prime minister of a future
right-wing government, warned on television that there would be 'hundreds of
thousands more people without jobs' in the first half of this year as the
economic squeeze continued.
However Mr Balladur ruled out the possibility of artificially stimulating
the French economy by devaluing the French franc. 'It would be against the
national interest,' he said. 'I will do everything to avoid the franc being
devalued.'
His support for the franc was echoed by Mr Beregovoy, who, since the
September currency crisis, has backed the Bank of France's efforts to
protect the currency against attacks by the foreign exchange markets.
'As long as I am prime minister the franc will not be devalued,' he said in
an interview with Journal de Dimanche newspaper.
Both the left and right are developing plans to restimulate the economy and
curb the rise in unemployment by creating jobs. Mr Beregovoy said his target
of 8 per cent jobless by 1998 would be achieved partly by a European
Community initiative to cut the working week to 37 hours and partly by
employment reform.
The Socialists have already tabled proposals to modernise employment
practices by encouraging job sharing and part-time working. Mr Fabius said
these reforms should be accelerated to boost job creation through public
sector initiatives such as housing programmes.
In the meantime the government has to get to grips with the financial
problem of the rising social security budget deficit, estimated to have
reached FFr30bn (Pounds 3.64bn) in the past three years. Ministers are
expected this week to announce proposals to allocate an extra FFr20bn to
reduce the deficit.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Sweden tries again to beat the budget deficit: The fourth
financial package in a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Ms Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, presents the country's
1993-94 budget today there could be a strong sense of deja vu about its
contents. This, after all, will be the fourth package of financial measures
to be proposed by the minority coalition government since this time last
year - if you include two crisis packages in September and a third, later
withdrawn, when the krona was floated in November.
As before, the emphasis will be on cutting public spending, however
unwelcome this might be for the government when its counterbalancing
tax-cutting plans have been stymied by deep recession. In reality it has
little choice but to cut further, despite the spending reductions of SKr68bn
(Pounds 6.3bn) it announced last year, as the budget deficit is still
growing.
With gross national product set to decline for the third consecutive year in
1993, the government knows that if it cuts benefits too heavily it risks a
further drop in private consumption and a delay to economic recovery. It
also knows that if it tries to spend its way to recovery it might inflame
the deficit further.
Hence it is likely that the package will have a longer-term flavour to it,
incorporating both a strong savings element and measures that accord with
the government's free-market strategy to encourage private initiative. The
trick will be to minimise the near-term impact on demand while doing enough
to convince nervous markets that Sweden is still serious about tackling its
budget deficit.
According to one leaked report, a total of SKr90bn in savings will be
outlined, but only SKr10bn-12bn of this will take effect in 1993-94, while a
further SKr20bn a year will be enforced over the following four years (well
after the government's current mandate expires) when the economy should be
in better shape.
But many observers feel that even cuts of this order are not sufficient, in
the context of a budget deficit which this fiscal year (1992-93) will reach
SKr200bn and is unlikely to be much lower next year. Even SKr10bn in savings
next year is only equal to the amount the government was forced to provide
in guarantees to just one of its stricken banks last week.
If the government is not tougher, it is partly because of political
realities. Its measures need the support of either the Social Democrats or
the populist right-wing New Democracy party. The Social Democrats, who now
command 45-46 per cent popularity ratings in the polls, supported the first
two crisis packages but refused to back the third.
In addition, the government has to take account of the effect its actions
will have on interest rate and currency movements.
Interest rates have come down since the devaluation, with the central bank's
key marginal rate of 10.5 per cent now 2 percentage points below what it was
before the krona was freed. However, this is still high by international
standards and the pain in the domestic economy is considerable.
The scope for further reductions is being undermined by the steady weakening
of the krona, which has now fallen by 20 per cent against the dollar since
the devaluation. The government is determined to maintain its anti-inflation
credentials, not least as part of its strategy of participating in European
monetary union.
But worries over the size of the government's borrowing requirement saw
market interest rates edge higher last week. The main worry remains the
budget deficit, which is now nearly three times the SKr70m level predicted a
year ago, having been exacerbated by falling tax revenues, rising
unemployment and the cost of bailing out the crisis-stricken banking system.
Funding the interest on its debt is now the government's single largest
outlay.
The government will be hoping its calculations are more accurate this year.
However, its sums could easily be thrown out by developments within the
domestic economy - with unemployment set to rise further from its current
7.2 per cent level and the banking crisis yet to show signs of bottoming out
 -as well as abroad.
In any case, it will be desperately hoping for some signs of economic
recovery during 1993, an election year, and the last thing it will want to
do next January is to present another austerity package unrelieved by any
handouts.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Press complaints chief attacks self-regulation report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD McGREGOR of Durris, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission,
yesterday fiercely attacked the author of a government report on regulation
of the press, accusing him of bias and proposing censorship that threatened
to emasculate British journalism.
His attack follows reports that Sir David Calcutt QC, who was asked by the
government to investigate how well press self-regulation has worked in the
past two years, has recommended tough new controls. They are said to include
substantial fines for newspapers which breach a statutory code of practice,
a press complaints tribunal chaired by a judge and criminal offences of
physical trespass and electronic eavesdropping.
Sir David's report was delivered to Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage
Secretary, on Friday. Neither Mr Brooke nor senior officials from his
department would comment yesterday.
Lord McGregor yesterday accused Sir David of 'failing to give a proper
judicious assessment of the evidence submitted to him'. The PCC chairman
said the proposals would mean using the power of government to 'censor' the
press.
The growing alarm of the newspaper industry at Sir David's recommendations
seems to be based on a sight of a part of the report which deals with the
work of the PCC, the body that replaced the Press Council. This account is
critical and negative. The PCC in its evidence told Sir David it believed
self-regulation of the press was working well.
The reported recommendations for action are identical to those suggested by
Sir David Calcutt in his 1990 report for implementation should
self-regulation be seen to fail. Sir David was asked last June to carry out
a six month investigation into how self-regulation was working. During that
period there was criticism of alleged press intrusion into the private lives
of members of the royal family and government ministers.
Lord McGregor emphasised yesterday that in a long period of one party
government it was particularly important that the only effective opposition
 -the press - should not be emasculated.
Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP whose private member's bill on the press
receives its second reading on January 29, said he thought the reported
proposals were excessive and would impede good investigative journalism.
The government plans to publish the Calcutt report later this month. Its
attitude to new press controls should become clearer during the second
reading of Mr Soley's right of reply bill.
Initial political reactions suggested the recommendations are seen as
extreme although there is growing support for some action against the
grosser forms of press intrusion. An end to bugging of private telephone
calls is most likely.

FT  11 JAN 93 / France may use force over camps in Bosnia: Paris ready to
act alone as Geneva negotiations remain deadlocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE said yesterday it was prepared to act alone if necessary to liberate
by force Bosnian prisoner camps where civilians are reported to have been
raped and tortured.
The suggestion, made by Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister, came as
negotiations for a peace settlement remained deadlocked in Geneva.
Speaking on France's RTL radio, Mr Dumas said: 'I suggest . . . we ensure
that this liberation is put into effect if necessary by force, since we now
have the legal right to intervene and there is evidence of the existence of
these camps and of tortures and rape that are committed there.'
In Bosnia-Hercegovina, British troops yesterday returned fire against Serb
positions for the third time, the first time with cannons, after coming
under attack while escorting an aid convoy. No injuries were reported. The
UK government is expected to decide soon about sending reinforcements. The
aircraft carrier Ark Royal has been placed on alert.
Mr Dumas said he had asked Health and Humanitarian Affairs Minister Mr
Bernard Kouchner to arrange 'if necessary on our own' for convoys under
military escort to go to the camps and liberate them.
The French foreign minister's remarks follow the assassination in Sarajevo
on Friday by a Serb militiaman of Mr Hakija Turajlic, the Bosnian deputy
prime minister, in the presence of French peacekeeping troops, and a visit
to Paris at the weekend by Bosnian leader Mr Alija Izetbegovic.
It is not clear whether Mr Dumas's threat of unilateral action amounts to a
plan. French officials said his proposal to liberate the Bosnians from
Serbian camps would only be implemented with the United Nations' sanction.
But his statement underlined the intensifying pressures on the French and
other western governments to intervene militarily in Bosnia-Hercegovina
should the current round of peace talks fail.
Diplomats at the UN are preparing a resolution authorising enforcement of a
no-fly zone over Bosnia which may pass within days.
Separately, a group of Islamic states is meeting in Dakar, the Senegalese
capital, today to discuss increasing their support for Bosnian Moslems.
Yesterday's clash between British troops attached to the UN in Bosnia and
Serbian forces took place near the town of Kladanj as the troops were
returning to their base from Tuzla on the route used daily by aid convoys.
After coming under fire from Serbian positions, the British troops responded
with cannons, firing 17 rounds from light tanks and over 100 rounds from
machine guns.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has urged that
international military intervention be delayed to give peace a last chance.
In an interview to be published today in the US magazine Newsweek, Lord
Owen, co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference on former Yugoslavia, said
such western intervention on the ground would be taken by the Serbs to imply
UN support for the Moslems. 'That isn't to say I would rule out a military
option,' he said. 'But I'd ask myself, 'What are you doing it for?' Have no
doubt: once there's intervention . . . The United Nations will be associated
in Serb eyes with the Moslems.'
In Geneva yesterday, new proposals by the Bosnian Serbs, intended to give
the impression that they may compromise, proved unacceptable to the Bosnian
Moslems and international mediators. However, the fact that the talks were
resumed at all came as a relief to Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, his
co-chairman.
Mr Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, left the talks in the afternoon for
the conference of Islamic states in Dakar. But Mr Vance and Lord Owen
emphasised his departure was not 'a walk-out'. They said he would be back in
Geneva tonight and would be at the talks on Tuesday.
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, who it is hoped will put
pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to reach an agreement, is also due to join the
negotiations today or tomorrow.

FT  11 JAN 93 / Danish visa scandal threatens to increase pressure on krone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL TENSIONS are growing in Denmark amid fears that prime minister Mr
Poul Schluter's government might fall after the publication later this week
of a report into a scandal involving visas for Tamil refugees.
Currency analysts are worried that political uncertainty generated by the
report could damage the Danish krone, one of the European exchange rate
mechanism's weakest currencies.
A judicial inquiry was set up to investigate an instruction by the minister
of justice in 1987 to civil servants to delay issuing entry visas to
relatives of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka who were already in the country.
It is expected to release a 6,000-page report on Thursday.
The opposition Social Democratic party, led by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, is
hoping it can exploit the report to bring down the minority
Conservative-Liberal coalition government and return to office after 10
years in opposition.
Concern about the Danish krone would follow last week's intense pressure for
a devaluation of the French franc and punt in the ERM. Mr Kit Juckes,
international economist at Warburg Securities, said: 'People are worried
about the uncertainty that would be caused if Tamilgate led to the
resignation of the government. This would make it difficult to hold the
currency up.'
He added that the prospect of political turmoil had already frightened
people out of the Danish bond market.
Developments are also being watched elsewhere in the European Community as
Denmark took over the six-month EC presidency at the beginning of this
month.
Mr Schluter was not directly involved in the Tamil affair, but one of the
questions which High Court judge Mogens Hornslett's report will seek to
answer is whether the prime minister misinformed parliament when he reported
on the affair in April, 1989, concluding his speech: 'Nothing has been swept
under the carpet.'
If Judge Hornslett's report contains explicit or implied criticism of Mr
Schluter, he will come under strong pressure from the opposition to resign.
Mr Schluter has repeatedly said he will call an election if the opposition
tries to 'misuse' the report for political ends.
Another possibility is that he would hand the baton to a party colleague,
such as Mr Henning Dyremose, minister of finance, but there is doubt whether
a majority in the parliament would tolerate a change in prime minister in
this way.
The attitude of the parties to the report may take some days to clarify. The
Radical Liberal party, whose seven MPs hold the swing position in the
eight-party, 179-member parliament, has said it will make its view known on
January 17, after a joint meeting of the party's parliamentary members and
the party's national executive committee.
It is not clear whether the Radicals want a change of government. The party
forms part of the parliamentary base for the present government.
The affair began in 1987, when Mr Erik Ninn-Hansen, veteran Conservative
party colleague of the prime minister, in his capacity as minister of
justice, ordered civil servants to delay issuing entry visas to relatives of
Tamil refugees who were already in Denmark.
Mr Ninn-Hansen claimed he was within his rights to order 'reduced priority'
for processing the visa applications.
But the parliamentary ombudsman and other legal experts assert that the
action was in breach of the law.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Receivers called in at Trocadero companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS were appointed last night to the five companies which own the
Trocadero leisure and office complex in Piccadilly, central London, and the
adjacent Island Site.
The companies, which include Power Trocadero Ltd, are owned by Power
Corporation, the Irish property development group.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the receivers, were unable to quantify the total debt of
the companies in receivership, last night. It is thought that lenders to the
companies were mainly Japanese banks, with Sanwa Bank being the lead.
Last summer Power Corporation passed its final dividend when profits for the
15 months to March 1992 fell and because of 'temporarily high' gearing as a
result of buying out the outstanding 50 per cent of the Trocadero.
The Trocadero and the Island Site had been a joint venture between Power
Corporation and Brent Walker, the overborrowed property and leisure group.
But in March last year the joint venture was unravelled and Power
Corporation bought out the Brent Walker stake with the intention of finding
another partner. It appears not to have been able to find a buyer.
The Trocadero is believed to be fairly fully let. The receivers said that
the companies would continue to be run on a going concern basis and orderly
disposals of assets sought.
The companies put in receivership directly employ about 50 people.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Debate, drama and the young at heart - Radio in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC's Radio 2 and Radio 3 have changed significantly this year. Radio 1,
meanwhile, maintains its well-established principle of entertaining the
young-in-heart, with well-judged mediation in campaigns likely to matter to
the young-in-body - AIDS, for instance, drugs, suicide and ethnic affairs.
Radio 4 has only made one serious alteration I call to mind, the switch of
Woman's Hour from afternoon to morning. There is no point in reopening the
arguments about that now, though I can take the opportunity of saying what a
good programme this is.
Radio 2 up-dated its image a little, to the resentment of older listeners,
who I think regard it as a channel to play them what they have known all
their lives, as for the most part it does.
Radio 3 was up-dated in its way, too, with more conversational presentation
and more time devoted to the analysis of popular entertainment. I do not
pretend to enjoy Night Waves; but now I need not often listen, for Classic
FM has sprung up in the independent field to provide an alternative service.
Radio 3 at any rate goes on with its plentiful choice of live and recorded
concerts as well as intelligent comment on music and the other arts (such as
Test Matches). There was a series of features on the ecology - and there is
still a play once a week.
It has scored high in drama. We had Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet in the spring,
and lately a succession of pieces from the dramatic uprising of the 1960s.
There were two plays from the Spanish, wittily adapted by the expert John
Clifford, Inez de Castro and Fernando de Rojas's La Celestina. Then we were
given the contemporary Romanian play Vlad the Impaler, a quasi-historical
piece about that prince, begetter of Dracula and allegory of Ceausescu; and
the Russian Yerofeev's Moscow Train, that ran through wild country to Moscow
Station. Rabbi Lionel Blue's quarter-hour on the Last Supper was one of my
favourite programmes of the year.
Radio 4 was as generous with drama as Radio 3 with music. I pick a random
Radio Times from my pile and find in that week three plays over an hour long
(one repeated), three roughly an hour long, and seven half-hours, five of
them instalments of serials.
The Classic Serials are not always classics, but who minds? They are handy
when they dramatise books we all know about but have not necessarily read;
the year's miscellany included Humphry Clinker, Pere Goriot, The Mill on the
Floss. The less classic serials included Decline and Fall and Little Women.
For me, Radio 4 is the debate channel. Its Radio 4 Debates are real
debating-society stuff. But also there were series about current affairs -
The Politics of Choice at election-time, in which political matters were
raised without politicians; and Who Believes in Britain?, that surveyed not
only our own Church but Buddhism, the Hindus, Islam, Judah and the Sikhs.
In July there were five programmes on The Future of the Arts, and in
September four talks by Sir Roy Strong on their funding. We learnt about the
Radio 4/Radio Times Enterprise Awards for business initiative.
Talks and features proliferate, though they tend to lag behind current
affairs. Not always: William T. Vollmann's Yugoslavian Notes gave a great
pictorial background to the Yugoslavian crisis. Sometimes the features led
the way - Michael Buerk's series on Africa last winter gave a picture of
Somalia that we only now fully visualise. The American election gave rise to
The Fading Dream about the electorate, and, more amusingly, to a Chicago
production of Of Thee I Sing.
Current affairs might surface anywhere; there was a fine feature in Woman's
Hour about the new baby unit in Holloway Gaol. Costing the Earth was a
series prompted by the Rio summit, but found a second wind on ecological
subjects; yet even Lord Tebbit did not bring them in on Desert Island Discs,
that faultless Sunday entertainment.
Radio 5 had trouble finding its feet, but at least its day-long, everyday
coverage of the Olympics went down well. Otherwise I found myself constantly
burdened with serials for the young. In February, Nothing Ever Happens Here,
about an American boy's impressions of England, was fun; later examples,
less so. But having secured its age-group, the Radio 5 anti-glue-sniffing
programme was as good as Radio 1's. A Family Learns Spanish had too little
Spanish in it, but there are three Sunday evening programmes genuinely
helpful for those wanting to learn French, German or Italian.
There has been some good stuff on the World Service. A six-part history of
Japan was more interesting than it sounds; and there was a novel celebration
of Columbus's 'discovery' of America, The Invaders' Legacy, an anthology of
all that was wrong in South America. Nor must I forget LBC, which broadcasts
many of the winning pieces from the Woolwich Young Playwrights' competition,
or a good play from Radio Clyde.
*****
Auguries in 1993's first week? On Radio 4: Sex in the Head on Saturday
(modest erotic thoughts) and Two People on Friday (lesbian problems) and the
start of two unpromising comic series, Craig Brown's appalling Welcome to My
Wireless (Sundays) and Miles Kington's imaginary interviews (Mondays). On
Radio 3: Twelfth Night with a Caribbean accent, on or near Twelfth Night,
and Paul Scofield reading Seneca's letters. Radios 1, 2 and 5, wait and see.
And Classic FM gave Marschner's opera The Vampyr on Sunday. Keep on
listening.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Power makes full provision against
Trocadero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWER CORPORATION, the Irish property group, last night made a 'full
provision' against its Trocadero and Island Site properties, after its
subsidiaries owning the sites were put into receivership. The company added
that its own bankers 'continue to be supportive'.
It brought forward the announcement of its interim results for the period to
September 30, which revealed retained losses of IPounds 75.1m (Pounds
78.8m), compared with profits of IPounds 1.66m, after an extraordinary
provision of IPounds 55.7m relating to its investment in the properties.
There was a write down of IPounds 23.7m against revaluation reserves also
relating to them.
The pre-tax loss was IPounds 19.4m (profits IPounds 5.1m) after an
exceptional write down relating to other properties of IPounds 17m. Losses
per share were 16.68p (earnings 3.42p) and the interim dividend has been
passed, against 2p. Shareholders' funds fell from IPounds 234.4m to IPounds
135.6m over the six months.
KPMG Peat Marwick was appointed as administrative receiver to five companies
owned by Power, known collectively as the Power Trocadero group, which own
the Trocadero leisure, cinema and office complex in Piccadilly, central
London, and the adjacent Island Site. The five companies have borrowings
totalling Pounds 225m.
The development of the Trocadero and the Island Site had been a joint
venture between Power Corporation and Brent Walker, the overborrowed
property and leisure group.
In March last year Power Corporation bought the Brent Walker stake. The
terms of the deal put a value on the properties of about Pounds 300m, but
property values have fallen since then. Brent Walker is still a significant
tenant in the Trocadero.
Power Corporation had intended to complete the development and find another
partner to buy the Brent Walker half share. Borrowings relating to the Power
Trocadero group were 'non-recourse' to Power.
Rents from the properties were running at about Pounds 8m a year,
insufficient to service debts. An application to turn 70,000 sq ft of unlet
offices into leisure space was turned down late last year.
Mr Robin Power, chairman, said that there had been negotiations on a new
longer term banking arrangement for the Power Trocadero companies but
agreement could not be reached after the failure to get the planning
permission. Sanwa Bank, the lead bank to the syndicate which lent to the
Power Trocadero group, called in the receiver.
Last summer Power Corporation passed its final dividend when profits for the
15 months to March 1992 fell and because of what was then termed
'temporarily high' gearing as a result of buying the Brent Walker interest.
Mr Power said the six months to September 30 had been difficult for property
and no sales were made during the period. He added that reducing gearing,
which after the removal of the Power Trocadero companies and the write downs
was still about 145 per cent, remained a priority.
The receivers said that the Power Trocadero companies would be run on a
going concern basis and orderly disposals of assets sought.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Grade names new director of programmes at Channel 4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, demonstrated some of his
legendary chutzpah yesterday when he named the successor to Ms Liz Forgan,
director of programmes, before her departure was formally announced.
The BBC will announce on Monday that Ms Forgan - who was hired by Channel
4's founding chief executive Mr Jeremy Isaacs when she went to interview him
for The Guardian newspaper - will be moving to the corporation. It is
believed her new job will be to run BBC Television, but not as deputy
director-general.
Mr Grade, a former managing director-designate of BBC Television, decided to
make his move in advance of the BBC's announcement by naming Mr John Willis,
Ms Forgan's deputy, as her successor.
Channel 4 issued a statement yesterday: 'Commenting on Liz Forgan's
departure, Michael Grade said: 'We are all very sad to say farewell to
Liz',' it said.
Channel 4 also paid tribute to her commissioning of Channel 4 News; the
creation of Right to Reply, the programme for viewers to comment on
programmes; and for originating the Video Box, which allows people to walk
in off the street and record their views for the programme. However, it did
not say where she was going.
The announcement of Ms Forgan's appointment to the BBC will be accompanied
by the first public indications of Mr John Birt's philosophy since he took
over formally as director-general of the BBC on Monday.
All the signs are that Mr Birt will be looking for a powerful deputy to
handle a fundamental reorganisation of the corporation.
The BBC has been embarrassed by an overspend in its television budget which
totalled Pounds 38m in the 1991-92 financial year. It is facing a potential
overspend this year of at least Pounds 20m.
The BBC refuses to put a final figure on the overspend but some in the
organisation believe the total could be about Pounds 90m over the two-year
period.
An obvious candidate to be Mr Birt's deputy would be Mr Bob Phillis, chief
executive of Independent Television News and former managing director of
Central Independent Television.
Mr Phillis is credited with improving financial disciplines at ITN where
there were embarrassing, but smaller, overspends. ITN is in the middle of a
shake-up of its ownership - some conditions of a transfer of its ownership
from the original 15 ITV companies to a seven-company consortium led by
Carlton Communications have been met, but the deal has not yet been
completed.
There has also been unconfirmed speculation that Mr David Hatch, managing
director of BBC Radio, may soon decide to leave.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Equitable Life places Airtours stake at
260p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS' hostile Pounds 214.5m bid for rival holiday tour operator, Owners
Abroad, showed signs yesterday that it has met with a less than unanimous
welcome from shareholders.
Equitable Life Assurance, the fund manager, placed a 6.4 per cent stake with
Morgan Grenfell at 260p, about 31p below the price at which Airtours closed
on Thursday night.
Airtours shares dipped below 280p yesterday, some 8p below the price at
which the partial cash alternative is being underwritten by BZW and The
British Linen Bank. However, they ended the day 3p down at 288p.
Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, said he was sorry to see Equitable
go but was pleased that BZW had placed the block so quickly and with one
share-holder.
'During the course of the bid there will be ups and downs, he said. 'It's
early days yet.'
Meanwhile, Thomas Cook denied market rumours that it had withdrawn its offer
of a tie-up with Owners Abroad, which was announced last month.
Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, said its offer
remained 'a very strong commercial proposition'. It has proposed to take a
10 per cent stake in Owners Abroad and form the basis for Owners to develop
a pan-european holiday company,
'We have every expectation and hope that the offer will be accepted' by
Owners Abroad shareholders, he said. Owners has adjourned the EGM at which
this proposal was to be addressed.
Equitable is understood to have become an Airtours shareholder in 1990 and
was sitting on a substantial profit.
Owners Abroad shares slipped 3p to 119p.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Block backs the Bolshoi - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TONIGHT the Bolshoi Ballet treads the boards at the Royal Albert Hall and
Derek Block can start to relax. Block, best known as a pop promoter, has
invested Pounds 3.5m in the five week season, his first big diversion from
promoting Rod Stewart, managing the Nolans, and putting on more pantos and
pier shows than the mind can handle.
The omens for such arts spectaculars are poor. The previous importers of the
Bolshoi, the Entertainment Corporation, went bust, and when fellow
impresarios Harvey Goldsmith and Raymond Gubbay put on arena-sized opera
productions at Earls Court and Wembley it proved a risk too far. Block has
recouped around Pounds 3m to date and if the performances approach anywhere
near his starry-eyed enthusiasm he hopes that word of mouth will push box
office revenue above Pounds 4m.
With the 150 dancers performing excerpts from the classical repertoire
rather than full-length ballets, Block is unlikely to win over the critics,
or even the 400,000 committed dance lovers that his research pinpointed. But
aficionados of an 'event', and less scrupulous dance goers, should buy the
necessary 100,000 tickets, priced between Pounds 5 and Pounds 100. Many are
being marketed by London hotels, anxious to sell beds on the back of ballet;
many more through Pounds 200 corporate hospitality packages.
With the disappearance of the old apparatchiks, Block found negotiating with
the Bolshoi quite straightforward although, at Pounds 30,000 a performance,
it is costing well over Pounds 1m to bring the company to London. This seems
modest compared with the expense of hiring and transforming the Royal Albert
Hall into a passing resemblance of the Bolshoi Theatre, which will consume
another Pounds 1.5m.
For Patrick Deuchar, manager of the Hall, it marks another significant step
towards his dream of converting the auditorium into a venue for 'seasons'
rather than renting it out nightly. Expect more major dance events and arts
festivals at the Hall and fewer pop concerts.
*****
There are people who think that the arts exist to excite confrontation. They
are probably the only satisfied customers from the European Arts Festival
which has just ended. This was John Major's idea to make the UK's Presidency
of the EC a time for dancing in the streets. He extracted Pounds 6m from the
Treasury to be spent on arts events under the supervision of John Drummond,
ex-Edinburgh Festival and now supremo of the Proms.
The Festival led to endless bickering. The problem was that the money came
too late to devise ambitious new projects, especially at the big London
venues. The press always enjoys trashing rather than praising and wrote off
the initiative from the start. John Drummond took umbrage. Look at the stars
we brought over, he says - Pina Bausch to the Edinburgh Festival, Ariane
Mnouchkine to Bradford, Zeffirelli to London. Ask in Ulster, Wales,
Scotland: there the Festival really hit home.
But the fact that most of the money was spent out of London, and on
community events, allowed the metropolitan critics to ignore it. Drummond
had the last laugh. He enraged all those arts managers whose request for
Festival funding was rejected by spending an undistributed Pounds 25,000 in
national advertisements last weekend which sang the praises of the Festival.
In January the main London salerooms sleep. This has allowed Christie's to
display the masterpieces from the Dulwich Picture Gallery in its empty
rooms. Sotheby's, meanwhile, is choked with washing machines and video
recorders.
They are the contents of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's country house,
Headington Hall, which come under the hammer on January 14. Like most
self-made men Maxwell had no artistic taste whatsoever and the 600 lots are
expected to make a paltry Pounds 300,000 for his receivers. The only sign of
humanity among the second-rate fixtures and fittings is the fact that
Maxwell kept the cartoons which ridiculed him.
A more sinister side to the man comes with his library desk desk, estimated
at up to Pounds 3,000. It has a hidden extra, ignored by the catalogue
entry. Attached to the desk lamps are a couple of state of the art
microphones.
The auction was originally to be held (by Christie's) on the premises at
Headington Hall, and prurient curiosity might well have brought out the
crowds - and high prices. But Sotheby's won the contract at the last moment
by agreeing to a substantial cut in its charge to the seller. It could only
afford to do this by postponing the auction until the New Year to take
advantage of the the extra 5 per cent of revenue it now receives from
raising the buyer's premium to 15 per cent from January 1. But the Maxwells
had to quit Headington by the end of 1992; hence the second-hand kitchen
furniture in Sotheby's Bond Street.
*****
The V&amp;A is having little luck in renting out its newly created exhibition
space. The Sovereign show, about the Queen, ran up against public
disgruntlement with the royals and cost its sponsors Pounds 1m. Now the
latest exhibition, Sporting Glory, has fared even worse, with the
organisers, Sporting Trophies Exhibition Ltd, calling in the receivers.
Attendances are just 300 a day, half the target, and it seems set to end
well before the scheduled February 14. The main loser is Lord Burghesh, who
devised the exhibition in memory of his grandfather who organised a similar,
acclaimed, display before the War. The V&amp;A will forgo its Pounds 100,000
fee.

TALKS between Siemens of Germany and Philips of the Netherlands which would
have led to joint ventures in telecommunications cables and optical fibres,
have been abandoned, the two companies groups said yesterday.
The Dutch company blamed falling prices, arguing 'the underlying economics
are no longer attractive', but would not be drawn on plans for the future of
its two businesses.
Siemens said the talks had fallen through because of a variety of reasons. A
spokesman said: 'Economic conditions have changed in the 13 months we have
been negotiating this deal.'
The German company made it clear, however, that it expected its cable
business, second in Europe to Alcatel of France, would continue to grow
strongly. It had sales of about DM2bn (Dollars 1.2bn) last year, about 30
per cent ahead of the preceding year.
'We have no need to look for partners to fulfil our market goals,' a Siemens
spokesman said. 'We have a number of big projects here in Germany and
respectable growth in other countries.'
Philips' activities in telecommunications cables and optical fibres generate
annual turnover of Fl 550m (Dollars 307.2m). A spokesman said turnover
growth in the sectors had been flat in 1992, underlining the company's
argument that prices were weakening.

The Dutch company employs 1,400 people in telecommunications cables and
optical fibres, of whom 1,150 are divided between the German cities of
Cologne and Nuremberg. The remaining 250 are employed in Philips' home base
of Eindhoven.
In December 1991 Philips said it would sell its two businesses outright to
Siemens, but it decided in 1992 to seek joint ventures instead to retain the
technology inside the group.
The European Commission's merger task force said last month it would make a
full and detailed examination of the proposed joint ventures, which would
have had a combined turnover of roughly DM2.5bn and most of its industrial
activities in Germany.

attract local visitors
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY is slashing the price of entry for local residents to the
EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris in an attempt to boost attendance
during the slack winter season.
For the next three months people living in Ile de France, the region around
the FFr4.2bn (Dollars 770m) park including Paris and its suburbs, will be
able to visit EuroDisneyland for FFr150, rather than the usual FFr225.
Tickets for children under 12 have been reduced, from FFr150 to FFr100.
The price-cuts will be accompanied by extensive advertising in Ile de
France. Euro Disney, which has been clouded by speculation about
disappointing attendance and merchandise sales, said the programme was
similar to local promotions run by the original US theme parks owned by Walt
Disney, its parent company.
One problem has been the unexpectedly low level of attendance by the French.
Originally Euro Disney had expected to attract 11m visitors in the park's
first year. But executives have recently confirmed the level of attendance
is likely to be around 10.5m. The park had 7m visitors in its first six
months. Euro Disney said yesterday October was a 'good' month, November was
'slow', but Christmas was 'very good'.
Euro Disney recently announced a pre-tax loss of FFr339m for the year to
September 30. Mr Richard Simon, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York,
forecasts a steeper pre-tax loss of FFr750m for the current year.

ADVANCED Micro Devices, the US semiconductor manufacturer, reported
higher-than-expected fourth-quarter and year-end sales and earnings, boosted
by strong sales of its microprocessors to personal computer makers.
Fourth-quarter revenues rose 9 per cent to Dollars 400.2m from Dollars
366.2m while net income was Dollars 69.6m, before preferred stock dividends,
or 73 cents a share after the dividend. A year ago AMD reported net income
of Dollars 106.7m, or Dollars 1.17 a share, after the dividend. Net earnings
included a gain equivalent to 52 cents a share from the sale of shares of
Xilinx, another chip maker.
'AMD had an excellent quarter capping off an excellent year,' said Mr W. J.
Sanders, chairman and chief executive. Shipments of 386 microprocessors
surpassed 3m, a record for the company, he said.
For the year, AMD reported record sales of Dollars 1.5bn, an increase of 23
per cent over 1991.
Net income of Dollars 245m before the preferred stock dividend, and Dollars
2.57 a share after the dividend, also reached a new high for the company.
For 1991, revenues were Dollars 1.2bn and net income Dollars 145.3m, or
Dollars 1.53 a share, after the dividend.
AMD was recently forced to postpone plans to introduce a next-generation 486
microprocessor after an unfavourable court ruling in its intellectual
property disputes with Intel, the largest US chip maker.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Motoring: Ford prepares to take on the world - The
importance of the Mondeo which is replacing the 10-year-old Sierra in the
fleet market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD'S front-wheel driven, medium-sized Mondeo promises well. However, I
shall not know how good it is until I have tried it.
Mondeo makes an official public debut at Geneva Show in March and goes on
sale in Britain soon after. It is the long awaited replacement for the
10-year-old Sierra that, in its earlier years, was top of the pops among UK
fleet and retail buyers.
No new model introduction can be more important to Ford, whose sales and
market share figures of late have given joy only to its competitors. If
Mondeo's on-road performance lives up to its promise on paper, it ought to
breathe new life into Ford.
Unlike Sierra, whose avant-garde styling put off many potential buyers until
they got used to its jelly-mould shape, Mondeo could be called contemporary
conventional or modern anonymous. From the front, its Escort kinship shows
but from the rear, a Mondeo could as easily wear a Mazda or Toyota badge as
the blue Ford lozenge.
Mondeo is Ford's world car. It was developed in Britain and Germany and will
be built in Europe (although not in Britain) and north America. Sierra
appeared first as a hatchback, with estate car and saloon versions following
on several years later. But Mondeo is being launched as a full range.
From the start there will be four-door saloons, five-door hatchbacks and
estates with 1.6-litre, 1.8 litre or 2.0-litre, 16-valve petrol engines (all
made in Wales) or a 1.8 litre, Dagenham-made, turbo-charged and intercooled
diesel. All have catalytic converters. A 24-valve V6 powered high
performance version comes later.
Among a long list of options on certain models are traction control,
adaptive suspension damping, four-wheel drive, ABS brakes and a new
US-designed and made automatic transmission. All are linked to an on-board
computer.
Ford is equipping every Mondeo, from entry model to the smartest Ghia, with
a driver-side airbag as standard.
This is a bold move, deserving a rapid response from the competition. If it
does not, Ford will be at a price disadvantage. That is what happened when
it made ABS brakes standard equipment on all the current Granada (Scorpio)
models. All other cars makers were expected to follow suit. They did, but
not for some years. Meanwhile, Ford had to grin and bear the extra cost. All
Mondeos have power-steering, side impact protection and high security
central locking.
Prices will not be known for some weeks but an Pounds 11,000 to Pounds
19,000 spread seems possible. A fully-loaded, air conditioned, 4x4 Ghia
might even break the Pounds 20,000 barrier.
So far, I have only sat in a couple of Mondeos. The seats seemed
comfortable, the controls well placed, visibility good and the boot roomy.
My first drive is keenly awaited. Ford says development teams have tested
the car everywhere from the Arizona desert to the Arctic Circle, with
special emphasis on ride and handling. I am sure they have. All car makers
do so. But can we be sure that Ford has got its new model right from the
start?
When I sample a number of Mondeo models in the south of France soon, I shall
be looking for something I sincerely hope I will not find. By this I mean
signs of a problem development engineers are well aware of, but one they
have not been able to persuade the bean counters is important enough to
warrant money being spent on putting it right.
My memory of new Ford introductions is long. I recall the ease with which a
MkIV Zephyr would spin when tackling a roundabout in the rain, until Avon
came to the rescue with a tyre possessing real wet grip. The original
Granada made back seat passengers sick at the press launch because its
independent rear suspension was too soft. The first front-wheel driven
Escorts skittered sideways when a rear wheel fell into a sunken drain cover
or pothole. This was fixed by a minor suspension redesign. An aerodynamic
fault resulted in the original Sierra feeling unstable in motorway cross
winds. It was soon corrected.
More recently, refusing the engineers the power assistance they wanted for
the fat-tyred XR2i's steering made it heavy to park, less sharp than it
should have been on corners. And the raspberries the latest Escort received
at its launch were deserved: it was a soggy, lack-lustre car. But within two
years, it had been transformed.
Lately, Ford has not been having an easy ride in Britain. It is time it had
a break. If Mondeo fully lives up to its promise and the price is right, it
probably will.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Ford joins race for television exposure: Why carmakers are
putting their 'ordinary' models into motor sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST 24 hours after releasing the Mondeo, the family-sized 'world' car on
which Ford's financial future heavily depends, the company's UK subsidiary
this week announced that Mondeos are destined for the race track as well as
the showroom.
Ford of Britain announced that it will introduce two of the new cars in the
14-round British Touring Car Championship.
Although motor racing budgets are never formally disclosed, Ford of Britain
does not dispute that the cost by the end of the season could be much more
than Pounds 1m.
To some the exercise may seem an inexcusable frivolity for a company that
made record losses last year.
But Ford of Britain believes that to establish the Mondeo in a marketplace
crowded with more rivals than when its Sierra predecessor was launched 11
years ago, the racing budget is relatively small compared with the global
total of Pounds 4bn invested in the model. The exercise could prove to be
highly cost-effective.
Ford is not alone in this view.
To the surprise of the RAC Motor Sports Association - the governing body of
UK motor sport - the racing action and the strong resemblance of the race
cars to showroom models has attracted the interest of of television. Such
interest is highly valued by carmakers and commercial sponsors.
With every round of the championship being televised by BBC's high-profile
Grandstand programme and race highlights regularly carried on ITV, coverage
of the championship could rank second only to that of grand prix racing.
'It's giving us the kind of exposure that you simply cannot buy,' said Mr
Brian Llewelyn, public affairs director for Peugeot Talbot, whose two-car
Peugeot 405 team is being led by former touring car champion Rob Gravett.
With BBC TV contracted to televise both the 1993 and 1994 seasons - and
taking an option on 1995-96 - manufacturers are flocking to the
championship.
Mercedes Benz is expected to announce that it too is joining the touring car
championship fray. Meanwhile, Renault is launching a two-car team this year.
Japan's Mazda is entering its new executive car, the Xedos 6. Apparently
Mazda believes that should the Xedos be seen fighting against BMW in the
championship it could win the type of respect given by European buyers to
the blue-and-white badged cars from Munich.
This week a delegation from Audi was at Donington Park, the Midlands racing
circuit, to assess whether it, too, should develop appropriate cars.
The newcomers will join a starting grid that even last season - the second
in the championship's 2-litre form - was starting to resemble a roll call of
the world's volume car industry, including Toyota, Nissan, Peugeot and
General Motors' Vauxhall.
'The question now is not so much who is coming in, but whether any of the
big manufacturers can afford to stay out,' says Mr Jonathan Ashman,
marketing director of the RAC Motor Sports Association and the chief
architect of the championship.
The motor industry and companies in the tobacco, clothing and drinks sectors
that use motor sport to promote their products acknowledge there is no
mathematical formula linking pounds expended to extra sales achieved.
However, press column inches and air time can be measured. Mr Llewelyn of
Peugeot Talbot says: 'We measured the time we got on-screen just in the
reshowings of the 1992 championship's highlights on TV over Christmas - and
buying it would have cost us nearly Pounds 3m.'
The contrast with grand prix motor racing costs is stark.
Williams-Renault admits to a Pounds 20m budget, excluding its
Renault-supplied engines. McLaren's is considerably more. Most costs are
borne by large sponsors such as the tobacco group Philip Morris and the
Benetton clothing empire.
On that basis the Pounds 1m or so that BMW and Vauxhall - which took the
driver's and manufacturer's touring car titles respectively last year - and
most other manufacturers will spend on this year's championship is very
small indeed. Some of that money will be recouped from Securicor,
electronics group Philips, Listerine mouthwash, Canadian brewer Labatt and
other non-industry sponsors.
In comparison with the 100m global audiences for each grand prix, media
coverage has also been much smaller.
The dramatic development is that most of the world, excluding North America,
is adopting the British 2-litre rules, including Germany, France, Italy,
Spain, Scandinavia, Australia, the entire Asia Pacific region and South
Africa.
At the end of this year there will be a European Cup, with each nation
sending a team of drivers to compete. Within the next couple of years it is
almost certain a new world championship will exist for cars similar to those
'ordinary' motorists drive, rather than grand prix exotica.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Receivers called in at Trocadero companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS were appointed last night to the five companies which own the
Trocadero leisure and office complex in Piccadilly, central London, and the
adjacent Island Site.
The companies, which include Power Trocadero Ltd, are owned by Power
Corporation, the Irish property development group.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the receivers, were unable to quantify the total debt of
the companies in receivership, last night. It is thought that lenders to the
companies were mainly Japanese banks, with Sanwa Bank being the lead.
Last summer Power Corporation passed its final dividend when profits for the
15 months to March 1992 fell and because of 'temporarily high' gearing as a
result of buying out the outstanding 50 per cent of the Trocadero.
The Trocadero and the Island Site had been a joint venture between Power
Corporation and Brent Walker, the overborrowed property and leisure group.
But in March last year the joint venture was unravelled and Power
Corporation bought out the Brent Walker stake with the intention of finding
another partner. It appears not to have been able to find a buyer.
The Trocadero is believed to be fairly fully let. The receivers said that
the companies would continue to be run on a going concern basis and orderly
disposals of assets sought.
The companies put in receivership directly employ about 50 people.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Two investment trusts move from Invesco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leveraged Opportunity Trust and Consolidated Venture Investment Trust, two
investment trusts nominally managed by Invesco MIM will now be managed by JO
Hambro.
Invesco MIM said it would waive its contractual rights to compensation for
the termination of the contract. It subcontracted investment management of
the two trusts to Growth Investment Managers, the director of which, Mr
Christopher Mills, had been a close business associate of Lord Stevens,
Invesco's former chairman and chief executive.
Since Lord Stevens' resignation from Invesco last summer, several top
ranking officials of the company, who were closely associated with him have
also resigned. In December, Mr Nicholas Johnson, managing director of
Invesco's European operations, resigned. Mr Johnson and Mr Mills are both
listed as directors of Leveraged Opportunity Trust in its latest report and
accounts.
Leveraged Opportunity, which invests in the 'stub equity' portion of
leveraged buy-outs, has net assets of Pounds 15m while Consolidated Venture,
which invests mostly in US-based venture capital situations, has net assets
of Pounds 30m.
Analysts estimate the move will lose Invesco MIM about Pounds 450,000 per
year in investment management fees.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: IFE raises cash offer for TVS preference
holders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREFERENCE shareholders of TVS Entertainment were last night celebrating 'a
victory for shareholder democracy' as International Family Entertainment
significantly increased the value of the cash alternative to its offer.
The initial offer for TVS, the south of England ITV company that lost its
franchise, was a mixture of paper and cash valued at Pounds 38.2m. A full
cash alternative was then unveiled worth Pounds 36m - 23p for ordinary
shareholders and 43p for preference shareholders.
IFE, a US cable television company founded by evangelist Pat Robertson,
yesterday made a qualified offer of a 60p cash alternative for preference
shareholders.
The American company said that Sun Life Investment Management Services, one
of a group of unhappy preference shareholders who were holding out for more,
had undertaken to sell its 5m preference shares if the offer is increased to
60p.
IFE said the offer would be increased to that level if the original offer
for the company goes unconditional by January 12. For that to happen IFE
wants acceptances from at least 75 per cent of preference shareholders.
By January 6 IFE had received acceptances, including irrevocable
undertakings, representing 79 per cent of the ordinary shares and 52.8 per
cent of the preference. Together they totalled 74.5 per cent of the voting
rights.
While the preference shareholders have been battling for better terms the
share price of IFE, owner of The Family Channel, has been rising on the New
York Stock Exchange.
On January 6 the value of the share offer was 37.1p for each ordinary share
and 66.7p for preference shares. This was based on an IFE share price of
Dollars 13.875 (899 1/2 p) on an exchange rate of Dollars 1.5423 to the
pound.
This values the share offer for TVS at Pounds 56.5m and the cash alternative
at Pounds 44.4m including Pounds 8.5m if the increase in the cash
alternative goes ahead.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Round two for new owner of Daily News: The sale which may
prompt a New York daily newspaper circulation war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAKEOVER on Thursday of the Daily News, the New York tabloid that was
previously owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, has made the new proprietor
 -Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the real estate investor and magazine publisher -
the latest saviour to step forward in an effort to revive the fortunes of
the 73-year-old daily.
As a result the New York daily newspaper world, a frenetic place at the best
of times, is girding itself for what could soon prove to be the hottest
editorial, circulation and advertising battle in years.
The twin challenges for the Canadian-born, 55-year-old Mr Zuckerman are to
remake the Daily News and, while doing so, to beat back the expected
competitive drive from the New York Post and Newsday, the other two tabloids
in the market.
Although some have questioned whether New York can support three tabloids in
addition to the authoritative New York Times, no one doubts Mr Zuckerman's
determination or drive.
He has already overcome a set of staggering obstacles to win control of the
Daily News - spending long hours in negotiations with the paper's feisty
trade unions; pushing out of the picture Mr Conrad Black, the owner of
Britain's Daily Telegraph, who also sought the News; trudging through
bankruptcy court and other legal venues to eliminate lifetime job guarantees
for typographers; and facing down the Newspaper Guild, the union which
represents editorial staff and which became so isolated that it was unable
to stop him from sacking 170 of its 540 employees at the paper.
Mr Martin Maleska, the managing director of Veronis Suhler, an investment
bank specialising in media deals, was a top adviser to Mr Black during his
quest for the Daily News last year. Yesterday he spoke in glowing terms of
the way Mr Zuckerman had handled the deal and predicted a return to
profitability in 1993: 'I think Mr Zuckerman did what he said he was going
to do, which was to buy the newspaper and reduce costs in those areas in
which he needed to. I think he has done a very good job.'
The Daily News, which was torn by a violent six-month strike that ended when
Mr Maxwell bought it from the Tribune Group of Chicago in March 1991, went
into bankruptcy following Mr Maxwell's death in November of that year. Last
year it lost about Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.6m) on revenues of more than Dollars
230m. Mr Zuckerman has not minced words in describing the last two owners of
the paper. The Tribune 'milked' the paper, and Mr Maxwell 'raped' it.
He, in turn, plans to make substantial investments, including a new printing
plant, and to reshape the editorial staff in order to strengthen political,
business and investigative coverage.
While he began life as a real estate investor, and remains one of the more
conservative and highly regarded property owners in the US, Mr Zuckerman has
also had more than a decade to develop his management skills in the media
world. In 1980 he bought The Atlantic, a prestigious monthly literary and
political magazine, and in 1984 US News &amp; World Report, the weekly magazine
that has been revitalised and last year overtook both Time and Newsweek in
advertising pages.
The New York newspaper world, however, presents unique challenges. Since
1985 the Long Island-based Newsday, a part of the Times Mirror group, has
robbed both the News and the Post of readers and advertising. Newsday, while
unprofitable in its New York City edition, has a total circulation of
760,000, which compares to 430,000 for the Post and about 800,000 for the
Daily News.
The New York Times, with daily circulation of 1.1m, has the high ground, and
Mr Arthur Sulzberger Jr, the publisher, said this week he wanted the Daily
News to exist. Mr Sulzberger's logic is believed to be that a healthy Daily
News keeps Newsday and the Post at bay in the lower and middle-market.
The coming battle will test Mr Zuckerman in many ways. His competitors say
they are ready.
As Mr Peter Kalikow, the owner of the Post, who will soon dilute his holding
to less than 50 per cent in order to raise fresh capital, put it: 'We always
battle. This is business. This is what life is all about.'

FT  09 JAN 93 / Irish coalition policies agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government in Ireland is expected to be
in place early next week, following the publication yesterday of a joint
programme.
The central focus of the programme is on the worsening unemployment
situation, and proposes to create 30,000 jobs a year, initially with a fund
of IPounds 270m (Pounds 293m) rising later to IPounds 750m, which will be
financed out of EC structural and cohesion funds.
The two parties have been negotiating the programme since the general
election in November, in which no party emerged with an absolute majority.
The two parties say they intend to stick to targets on government spending
and borrowing set down in the Maastricht Treaty as conditions for economic
and monetary union.
Party leaders yesterday emphasised their commitment to maintain the outgoing
government's policy of defending the punt's existing parity within the ERM.
There are growing market expectations however that the past week's pressure
on the punt, which has pushed up interest rates to record levels, may force
the new government to consider an early realignment.
The coalition programme must still be approved by a special delegate
conference of the Labour party tomorrow. The parliament reconvenes on
Tuesday, when the new government will be inaugurated.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Break-up of oil tanker could aid salvage effort, experts say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SUMBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE shipwrecked oil tanker Braer was starting to break apart yesterday after
further pounding by high seas on the coast of Shetland.
But salvage experts believe the separation of the ship into two sections
could help the rescue effort by stabilising the oil carrying portion.
Smit Tak, the Dutch marine salvage company contracted by the Braer's
operators, plans to remove the remaining oil from the vessel into an
8,000-tonne barge which will arrive on Monday night. Work cannot begin until
the severe weather subsides.
The Scottish Office has also announced a ban on catching fish and harvesting
farmed salmon from an area of sea embracing the southern end of the main
Shetland island.
Earlier, the Shetland Salmon Farmers Association and the Shetland Fishermens
Association voluntarily introduced a ban covering 400 square miles. This
includes about 15 salmon farms accounting for about a third of Shetland
farmed salmon output of about 10,000 tonnes.
Bad weather once again restricted efforts to contain oil pollution from the
tanker which went aground on Tuesday.
It is thought that at least half the ship's 84,000 tonnes of light crude may
still be on board.
Mr Geert Koffeman of Smit said that there were indications that the ship's
stern was beginning to separate from the main section containing the oil
tanks.
Mr Koffeman said he planned to use salvage vessels to install pumps on the
Braer and pump the oil into a barge.
Although dispersed crude from the Braer is gradually movingnorthwards up the
west coast of Shetland, the oil slick has not reached any salmon farms.
Small pockets of surface pollution, known as rainbow sheen, have been seen
up Clift Sound but salmon swimming deep in their cages are not affected by
it. When the ban is lifted, rigorous health and quality checks on fish
produced in the area will be implemented, Mr James Moncrieff, chief
executive of the Shetland salmon farmers association, said.
Marks and Spencer said yesterday it had stopped buying salmon from farms in
the Shetland Islands as 'a temporary precautionary measure'. Other
supermarkets said they were monitoring the situation.

to committee
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carl Icahn, the former corporate raider who gained control of Trans World
Airlines in 1986, yesterday formally relinquished his controlling interest
in the carrier. Mr Icahn resigned as chairman of the bankrupt and
heavily-indebted airline, and placed his entire stock interest in escrow.
The financier's departure was anticipated in an agreement last month between
the company's unions, its creditors, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the federal agency which underpins the payment of basic pension
benefits in the US.
Under this deal, TWA employees are proffering wage concessions in return for
a 45 per cent equity interest in the carrier, once it reorganises and
emerges from bankruptcy. Creditors, meanwhile, are forgiving around Dollars
1bn of debt, and will receive the remaining 55 per cent of the shares.
In the wake of Mr Icahn's departure, the company is headed by a two-man
management committee, appointed by employees, unions and creditors. This
week, TWA asked the bankruptcy court to extend the date for its
reorganisation plan filing to be extended to February 17.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Salinas and Clinton in Nafta talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton yesterday re-affirmed his support for the
proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), and said he would
'immediately move' to address supplemental labour and environmental accords
that he would like to attach to the trade agreement.
Mr Clinton said he would soon put an official in charge of bilateral issues
arising from Nafta. His repeated support for Nafta after his meeting with
President Carlos Salinas in Austin, Texas - his first with a foreign leader
since the election - and his desire for 'this to be wrapped up in a prompt
fashion' will come as a relief to Mexico, which was looking for such a
signal.
The Mexican government needs the agreement approved as fast as possible,
both to help the sluggish economy, and to boost public support before next
year's presidential election.
Mr Clinton used the opportunity to address criticism of the Nafta in the US.
He said the side agreements must produce high-wage jobs on both sides of the
border, and not - as had been the case with the Caribbean Initiative -
reduce wages while costing the US government lost tax revenues.
He said he would look to other 'models' - presumably the EC - to address the
'great disparity' of living standards between the US and Mexico.
Despite the anti-Nafta chants from demonstrators, the two leaders talked
about 'a new era' in US-Mexican relations.
Mr Clinton said he 'looked forward to a strong partnership and close
relationship' with Mr Salinas.

The new Brazilian government of President Itamar Franco yesterday signalled
its intention to advance a Dollars 44bn debt restructuring with commercial
banks by authorising the distribution to all bank creditors of a detailed
agreement or term sheet negotiated with banks last year, Stephen Fidler and

FT  09 JAN 93 / US carmakers attack Japan's quota freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US CARMAKERS yesterday launched a fierce attack on Japan's decision not to
reduce the number of cars it exports to the US under a voluntary restraint
agreement.
Tokyo's announcement that it would freeze the quota at last year's level of
1.65m units showed it was 'not very concerned' about lowering its trade
surplus with the US, said Mr Harold Poling, chairman and chief executive of
Ford.
In a joint offensive with the chief executives of General Motors and
Chrysler, Mr Poling said the US was facing 'a critical time for our nation'.
The world trading system could not survive if one country 'sought to achieve
economic superpower status at the expense of other countries', said Mr
Poling.
The quota announcement coincided with the release of a US Commerce
Department forecast that the US is likely to see a 9.5 per cent increase to
Dollars 21.9bn (Pounds 14.4bn) in the deficit this year in car and car parts
trade with Japan. Japan reduced the quota from 2.3m units to 1.65m units in
1991 but the US car industry has been looking for further cuts, arguing that
the figure had become meaningless as it did not take into account the US
production capacity of Japanese makers.
US car industry leaders were encouraged by meeting President-elect Bill
Clinton this week and believe his administration offers a great opportunity
to intensify pressure on Japan to reduce the US trade deficit.
They urged the US to take moves to:
Demand equal access to foreign markets for US-made goods and services, and
take action if this access is denied.
Implement laws to prevent 'predatory practices by foreign competitors'.
Co-ordinate economic and regulatory policies to assure the competitiveness
of US industries in world markets.
Mr Poling called for Japan to take action to reduce its trade surplus with
the US from Dollars 43bn now to Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn over the next five
years. Automative trade alone presently accounts for around Dollars 33bn of
the Japanese surplus.
Excess capacity in the world vehicle industry now stood at around 11m units,
claimed Mr Poling, while production capacity in Japan exceeded home market
demand by more than 100 per cent.
Japan and the European Community had agreed to limit Japanese market share
increases in Europe, warned Mr Poling, so excess world capacity would be
'directed towards the US market at the further expense of US jobs' if the US
market continued to be the 'most open market in the world'. Japan's open
markets remained among the most closed in the world, he said. The Japan
Automobile Importers' Association said imported vehicle sales fell 7.7 per
cent last year to 184,615 units, the second consecutive year of decline,
Robert Thomson writes. Total sales in the Japanese market fell 7.2 per cent
to 5.3m units.
Sales of US-made cars rose 23.1 per cent, but the largest increase was in
imports of Japanese makers' vehicles.
Ford Motor sales rose 15 per cent and Chrysler's 7.4 per cent but GM's sales
declined by 1.9 per cent.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Hungary sees end to 3-year economic slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S Finance Ministry has forecast an export-led economic upturn and
rising investment in 1993 which will halt the precipitous slide in output of
the last three years.
The authorities predict gross domestic product will stabilise this year and
could grow by up to 3 per cent. This follows a cumulative fall in GDP of
nearly a fifth between 1989 and 1992.
However, Mr Mihaly Kupa, the finance minister, warned yesterday against
premature optimism, saying the burst in consumption in the last quarter had
much to do with pre-empting price rises due to VAT changes from January 1.
The timing of the rebound is important to Hungary's government. The ruling
conservative coalition is approaching parliamentary elections in 1994,
facing voters dissatisfied with its economic record and a daunting gap in
the opinion polls.
Mr Kupa's goal of 'healthy but not forced growth' ties in with the official
expectation that investment growth of 2-6 per cent and export growth of 5-7
per cent will drive the recovery.
The rosy prognosis for investment however presupposes an acceleration of
privatisation and a continuing decline in interest rates, which remains
uncertain.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Bosnia talks to resume as fighting goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between the warring factions in Bosnia resume in Geneva tomorrow with
few prospects for an early agreement and amid renewed fighting in Sarajevo,
the capital, and other parts of the country.
After failing last Tuesday to persuade the main combatants - the Bosnian
Moslems and Serbs - to endorse a draft constitutional and ceasefire
agreement, international mediators are attempting to broaden the
negotiations to include Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the hardline president of
Serbia.
The mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance, representing the United Nations, and Lord
Owen, the European Community representative, have written to Mr Dobrica
Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslavia, asking him if he would 'consider it
appropriate' to include Mr Milosevic in his delegation.
But Mr Cosic's office said last night that no word had yet been received
from Mr Milosevic on whether he would join the Yugoslav federal government's
delegation.
It can be assumed that the mediators would not have done written to
President Cosic unless they had won Mr Milosevic's prior approval for such a
move during their meeting with him in Belgrade earlier this week.
After their meeting, Mr Milosevic said he was willing to support all efforts
which would lead to a peaceful solution of the Bosnian conflict and that the
mediators' plan was 'a good approach' to a settlement.
Mr Fred Eckhard, the mediators' spokesman, said in Geneva that they hoped Mr
Milosevic could play the same kind of brokering role as he did when Mr Vance
was negotiating the end of the war between the Yugoslav federation and
Croatia a year ago.
The mediators appear to believe that only Mr Milosevic can exercise enough
pressure to persuade Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs,
to accept their peace plan, which he has so far rejected.
Specifically, Mr Karadzic is insisting that the Serbs, who currently hold 70
per cent of Bosnia-Hercegovina after pursuing a relentless campaign of
'ethnic cleansing', should be allowed to have their own independent 'state
within a state'. Their ultimate, if undeclared, objective is that such an
entity should eventually be absorbed into a Greater Serbia.
However, the mediators, who have proposed the creation of an independent,
sovereign Bosnia-Hercegovina divided into 10 internally self-governing
provinces without an international legal status, have stressed that such a
solution would be unacceptable to the international community.
More important, the Serbs' demands have also been firmly rejected by Mr
Alijah Izetbegovic, the president of the Moslem-led Bosnian government, who
had talks with US Senate leaders in Washington on Thursday and is due to
meet French President Francois Mitterrand on his way back to Geneva today.
While approving in principle a separate draft agreement on a cessation of
hostilities, which only the Bosnian Croats have so far signed, Mr
Izetbegovic has made clear that he cannot countenance an independent Bosnian
Serb state under any circumstances.
He has also demanded modifications to the provincial map tabled by the
mediators, which would give the Serbs control of about 50 per cent of the
country and the Moslems about 25 per cent, including the main urban and
industrial areas. The remaining territory would have either Croat majorities
or mixed populations.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Iraqi missiles on the move as deadline passes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of immediate military action against Iraq receded last night as
the US announced further movement of Iraqi aircraft and missiles away from
the exclusion zone in the country's south.
Reports from the White House and the Pentagon came as the 48-hour ultimatum
issued by the US, Britain and France to Iraq to withdraw its missiles
expired. Earlier, Iraq had insisted it had no intention of backing down and
that the deployment of air defences was a sovereign matter. Mr Tariq Aziz,
the deputy prime minister, said that if attacked Iraq would respond in kind.
US officials were careful to state that it was still impossible to determine
if Iraq was in compliance with the terms of the ultimatum. But they said
Iraqi aircraft had been flown out of one base close to the no-fly zone while
missile batteries were no longer deployed in a 'potentially hostile
pattern.'
General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, noted 'lots of
movement' of missiles, but did not reveal their new whereabouts, possibly
because heavy cloud cover in the region has made aerial reconnaissance
difficult. He also implied any action in Iraq would not be immediately
taken.
'There has been a good deal of movement involving these missiles but we are
still in the process of determining whether Iraq is in compliance with the
terms of the coalition demarche (demand),' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said in a statement just before the 5.30 pm Washington time (22.30
GMT) deadline. 'We continue to keep the situation in Iraq under close
scrutiny.'
President George Bush had conferred earlier with his national security
advisers, including General Powell, and been briefed at the CIA.
President-elect Bill Clinton again reaffirmed his support for Mr Bush's
stance, saying there was 'no daylight' between their views.
Military experts had considered the most likely targets for any 'surgical'
allied strike would be fixed military installations such as air bases,
communications centres and missile sites. These would probably include
targets north of the 32nd parallel.
The apparent Iraqi withdrawals came after the United Nations had been told
by Baghdad that none of its aircraft, including those carrying teams of
inspectors searching for weapons of mass destruction, could land. A UN team
was due to leave Bahrain for Bagh-dad this weekend. The Iraqi news agency
said the cabinet had applauded the decision by the country's political
leadership 'to confront the new, blatant American aggression which is doomed
to failure thanks to the unity and steadfastness of our people and armed
forces under our blessed leader Saddam Hussein'.
Iraq was thought to have deployed between three and five batteries of
Soviet-made SA-2 and SA-3 anti-aircraft missiles in the east of the no-fly
zone.
At first the movement of these missiles was consistent with standard
practice and was not necessarily a response to the ultimatum. The missile
systems can be dismantled, transported to another prepared site and
re-assembled within a matter of hours.
But later the US appeared to conclude they had been moved to non-aggressive
positions.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said it was clear Mr Saddam had
to remove the missiles and to stop infringing the no-fly zone.
An Iraqi Mig-25 aircraft was shot down by a US fighter on December 27 over
the exclusion zone and soon afterwards it was reported that the batteries of
Iraqi Sam-2 and Sam-3 missiles had been moved south of the 32nd parallel.
The no-fly zone was imposed at the end of August to protect the Shia
population against further attacks by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein.
US, British and French aircraft were moved to Saudi Arabia to supplement the
American carrier-based forces operating in the Gulf.
Allied strength now amounts to more than 200 combat aircraft, supported by
airborne radar systems and electronic jamming equipment.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Actors behind the camera - Nigel Andrews tries out a
new phenomenon, the laser disc / Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVE YOU the stomach for another technological revolution? These are trying
times, I know. One audio-visual breakthrough treads on another's heels like
shoppers at a January sale. Who could have foreseen that by 1993 the
videocassette, once the wonder of the home-viewing age, would seem as old
and demode as Aunt Edith's aspidistra?
The new phenomenon is the laser disc. If you have not yet experienced these,
you should know what you are missing. Their main advantages over cassettes
are better picture quality, greater fidelity to original formats
(Cinemascope, Panavision and Co) and larger possibilities to scan, search
and study. Of the two types of disc on sale, CLV offers a basic range of
improvements, including the division of movies into 'chapters' to aid scene
or picture search. The more densely programmed CAV discs, though shorter in
duration, allow the viewer to activate additional aids like subtitling and
commentary.
The prices of movies on disc are chilling but not prohibitive. Moderate
treats like The Addams Family (Columbia TriStar) or Air America (Pioneer)
will set you back Pounds 25 pounds, while all-singing all-dancing
blockbusters - Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (Columbia TriStar),
Lawrence Of Arabia (Columbia TriStar) and Terminator 2 (Pioneer) - come in
at Pounds 35 pounds. The only Pounds 40 one is Kevin Costner's Dances With
Wolves. But then if you are mad enough to like that calendar-art sermon on
racial accord, you are probably mad enough to pay the price.
I have not yet plunged into purchasing a disc-player. When not sallying
forth to richer friends' homes, I do my viewing on the steam-powered VCR.
Here one has a wider range of movies to choose from, including samples of
that startling trend - thank you for the cue, Mr Costner - whereby actors
are turning into directors. This month alone brings three films never before
exposed on British screens: Diane Keaton's Wildflower (High Fliers), Arnold
Schwarzenegger's Christmas In Connecticut (First Independent) and Lou
Diamond Phillips's Ambition (Columbia TriStar).
Phillips wrote, directed and stars in his film, as a would-be crime writer
who employs a paroled murderer as research material. Minor but well-crafted.
Schwarzenegger's offering originated as a TV special. Packed with slightly
shopworn stars - Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson, Tony Curtis - it is
festive-spirited enough to be viewed in the undemanding aftermath of
Christmas.
Of the three thespians turning directors, Keaton most looks as if she is
going places. Having directed a kooky vox-pop documentary called Heaven,
screened at Cannes some years ago, she grooms her talent further in
Wildflower. Like Arnie's film, this was made for TV. But Keaton, also an
acclaimed photographer, takes a threateningly mawkish tale about an
epileptic girl (Rosanna Arquette) rescued from a brutal stepfather by two
brothers and brings it alive with lighting and camera movement. Coming from
a front-of-camera career, she also knows how to wake up actors. Arquette is
superb, so is Beau Bridges as the boys' father.
What else have we for you? Not a lot, I fear. The video industry assumes a
state of paralysis in the wake of Yuletide and the New Year, so you must
make do with such fare as Star Trek VI (CIC), Christopher Columbus: The
Discovery (Braveworld) and Stop] Or My Mom Will Shoot (CIC). You might,
though, try two well-penned films about showbiz. The Player (Fox), scripted
by Michael Tolkin and directed by Robert Altman, is an exuberantly
scurrilous portrait of Hollywood life. And Peter Bogdanovich's film of
Michael Frayn's Noises Off, hated by those who had seen the play, was
guffawed over by everyone who had not, including me. Happy new year.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Master of character movies - Nigel Andrews talks to
the hottest director in Hollywood, Rob Reiner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATURE in the film industry comes in different shapes and sizes. There are
slightly-built wunderkinder like Spielberg and Scorsese: pocket-size
prodigies grappling with their mega-projects. And then there are big,
bearish men like Rob Reiner who look as if they missed vocations as
wrestlers or nightclub bouncers.
Reiner is currently wrestling with the burden of being the hottest
film-maker in Hollywood. As director of A Few Good Men, he has just overseen
the cinema's first ever 'global premiere'. The Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson
drama, in addition to opening in 50 countries on the same date, has so far
grossed Dollars 80m at the US box office and is tipped for about a dozen
Oscar nominations. The only question in the minds of some Reiner fans is:
'Was the this the film we hoped for from the maker of When Harry Met Sally
and Misery?'
On meeting the director, you do not want to ask this first. If he was never
a bouncer, he might have been. And he was everything else before taking to
direction, including a two-time Emmy award-winning actor for his role as the
son-in-law in All In The Family, American TV's answer to Till Death Us Do
Part. Before that he had his own family show, stranger than fiction. Son of
film farceur Carl Reiner (The Jerk, All Of Me), he was born into a household
dense with the human fall-out from the famed Sid Caesar TV show of the
1950s, whose writers included not just Reiner pere but Mel Brooks, Neil
Simon and Woody Allen: just the crowd to crush the self-esteem out of a
innocent ten-year-old.
But when Reiner became a film-maker, it was with a comic masterwork of his
own. This Is Spinal Tap (1984) is a feature-length mockumentary about a
fictive British rock group. Its deadpan hilarity - many thought it was about
a real group - went unappreciated for half a decade, since when it has
become a cult. Later Reiner movies - Stand By Me, The Sure Thing, The
Princess Bride, Harry/Sally, Misery - are startling for the Rorschach
randomness of their genres and styles: romantic comedy, road movie, fairy
tale, Gothic thriller.
'I hope all my films are about human experience,' Reiner volunteers: 'that
they don't rely too much on car crashes, special effects, explosions. What I
like to do is find a main character I can identify with, whether it's the
writer in Misery or the struggling lawyer in A Few Good Men or the guy with
an accident-prone love life in When Harry Met Sally.'
Hence the off-kilter realism of Reiner's best work. When Harry Met Sally is
as good a comedy of relationships, rueful, unblinkered and hilarious, as any
outside Woody Allen. And Misery is a no-tricks Stephen King story directed
with simple power and humming performances (James Caan and Oscar-winning
Kathy Bates).
So what is Reiner doing directing A Few Good Men, already nicknamed in
Hollywood 'A Few Big Names'? Unlike his previous chamber pieces, here is a
formula movie built to Formula-1 standards. Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson
don the goggles as the Guantanamo Bay Grand Prix roars towards the chequered
Oscars.
That the movie, based on Aaron Sorkin's Broadway play about a Marine base
murder, is a crowd-pleaser is beyond doubt. (Si monumentum requiris, read
the Variety charts). Reiner also claims a little subversive boldness for it
by citing the non-cooperation he had from US military in the matter of using
real bases and personnel. 'I had an interview at the Pentagon with the
assistant to the Marine Commandant. I said, I think you're being very
parochial; you want this movie to be a recruiting film. But it's not an
indictment of the Marine Corps, if anything it's a celebration of the
military justice system. I think you should take the high road.'
They didn't. But to the film's credit, its substitute low-road locations
seem the real thing. So - for much of the time - does the conviction with
which Cruise's wastrel-turned-hero Navy lawyer is played and directed. 'I
was interested in his personal struggle. Kaffee (Cruise) is trying to escape
the shadow of his father to become his own man.'
So, on scrutiny, are most Reiner protagonists. Stand By Me was about a gang
of boys who 'grow up' when they encounter a dead body. The Sure Thing and
When Harry Met Sally were comedy-romances about the tussle between grown-up
love and eternal-teenager sex. And what interested Reiner in filming Stephen
King's Misery was not the eek-gasp Gothic stuff but the story of a novelist
trying to outgrow his best-selling juvenilia.
'He's a successful creative person trying to break away from the mould and
establish himself in a new way - but fearful he'd do badly. It's what I had
felt on leaving All In The Family and trying to establish myself as a
director. It was difficult for others to see me in a new light. So Misery
for me was a metaphor for an artist's struggle to grow, and the demons he
must face inside himself.'
Yet one wonders if Reiner has conquered his own demons and tyrants. His best
earlier movies, especially When Harry Met Sally, are more mature works than
A Few Good Men. While the first pursues its personal idea through daringly
plotless alleys and high-risk casting (neither Meg Ryan nor Billy Crystal
were yet stars), the new movie is a Well-Made Film big with superstars and
impersonal takeaway themes.
Perhaps Reiner realises that Hollywood giveth and Hollywood taketh away.
Even running one's own production company - and Reiner's Castle Rock is the
most successful in town - is no guarantee of eternal survival. A Few Good
Men looks suspiciously like a sop to the box-office from a film-maker who
wants to stay solvent while cultivating the unique cottage industry he has
created in Beverly Hills.
'It's very difficult to be artistically free in Hollywood today,' Reiner
says. 'Most film companies, certainly most studios, are not run by people
whose main interest is film. The average major studio is a tiny speck on the
portfolio of a multi-national corporation. They're not in the business of
putting on shows but of turning out 'product'.'
So if AFGM looks like product, let's hope it's part of the prosperity
strategy for Castle Rock: designed to allow Reiner and Co to go on making
their low-cost character movies that chart the moods and mores of a changing
America. The most courageously funny scene in modern cinema - and one
epitomising Reiner's touch at its best - comes in When Harry Met Sally. It's
the moment when Meg Ryan performs fake-orgasm noises in a crowded restaurant
before a horrified Billy Crystal. A male director here created one of the
great feminist moments in film.
And no one who sees and hears it forgets. Who, though, I asked Reiner, was
the supporting actress who then capped the scene with the funniest line in
the film? She plays a customer who says to a passing waitress, 'I'll have
what she just had.'
'That was no supporting actress,' says Reiner. 'That was my mother.'

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Slide show dance - Clement Crisp reviews 'The Percys
of Fitzrovia'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERCYS of Fitzrovia is the latest confection from Matthew Bourne for his
Adventures in Motion Pictures troupe. In his earlier piece Town and Country,
and more clearly in Deadly Serious, Bourne set up an Aunt Sally - urban and
pastoral life, Hitchcock films - and proceeded to shy his dance grenades at
it. His aim has not, so far, proved of the best, but at least his audiences
could see the target, and some point, to the exercise. With The Percys of
Fitzrovia, the butt of his awful little jokes is unclear, the humour lacks
edge, and the movement (for Motion Pictures read Slide Show) minimal and
dull.
Six characters are shown to us: three male, two female, one (a being in pink
knickers and a strawberry blonde bob) undecided. They are the denizens,
Bourne would have us believe, of his Fitzrovia - un-mapped territory, as far
as I know - and toilers in the field of art. They are not the Bloomsburies,
though Ally Fitzpatrick could pass for Carrington, but they posture, flail
their arms, and involve themselves in tiny storms of agitation that might
pass for artistic ecstasy without infringing on the idea of choreography as
anything more than feeble tableaux vivants.
Bourne's favoured structural method - popular music as accompaniment to
unconnected and vaguely emotional episodes - seems thin, unconvincing.
Performances look, not surprisingly, unclear, amateurish. The whole affair
is too like family charades for display to a paying public. A thread of
sexual ambivalence runs tediously and humourlessly throughout. At his best -
in his recent Nutcracker - Bourne has managed an astute blend of organised
movement and day-to-day action. The shifts between invention and actuality
give such a language its savour, and this, I feel, is lacking in The Percys,
which remains obstinately pedestrian.
The evening - 90 minutes, but seeming longer - is completed by a re-working
of Bourne's Infernal Galop. This started out three years ago as a joke about
France, but has now acquired idees audessus de sa gare. There are the voices
of Mistinguett, Trenet, Piaf; a vespasienne (which occasions the best gag in
the piece), and too much mooning about by performers to songs that have
pertinent and potent lyrics which are dutifully ignored. Andrew George is
very funny in a mermaid impersonation to Trenet's La mer, as are the three
chaps in the vespasienne - peering rather than peeing - but elsewhere the
piece takes itself seriously. Perfide Albion.

IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A SAINT
by WW Meissner
Yale Pounds 20, 480 pages
UNPREDICTABILITY is the only common characteristic of divine callings.
Martin Luther's less friendly biographers report that he received his
summons while satisfying nature's needs, 'as if,' one wrote, 'elimination
prompted illumination'. For Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, the
vehicle of divine vocation was much more dramatic. It was a cannonball.
Ignatius was a nobleman's son, born in the Spanish province of Guipuzcoa in
1491 and brought up as a military courtier. He enjoyed the work, and took a
leading part in several battles, including the defence of Pamplona against
the French in 1521, at the height of which Ignatius's legs were swept from
under him by a cannonball. A French surgeon set his right leg badly, leaving
it inches shorter than his left leg, and deformed by a protruding bone.
Ignatius was only five feet tall; but he was vain, so he limped home to
Loyola, and had the bony protrusion sawn off and his leg rebroken and reset.
Throughout these agonies he uttered no sound.
It was during his recovery that Ignatius found vocation. The only two books
available in the castle were a bible and a book of saints. They inspired
him. He decided to reject his old life of gambling, drinking, women and war,
and to embrace holiness.
WW Meissner, a Jesuit and a Professor of Psychoanalysis at Boston College,
has attempted to write a psychoanalytical study of Ignatius. We are taken
through his conversion, his period of self-discipline at Manresa where he
wrote the celebrated 'Spiritual Exercises', his journey to the Holy Land and
his studies in Paris, all leading to the foundation of the Society of Jesus
in 1539. The remainder of Ignatius's life, involving his generalship of the
Jesuits, is somewhat briefly discussed. Meissner's aim is to identify the
psychological factors which made him a saint. This, if done well, would have
made an intriguing and worthwhile study. Alas, Meissner does it as badly as
possible.
Indeed this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Why review it, then?
Because it is published by a highly reputable body, Yale University Press,
which should know much better, and because there is something profoundly
questionable about a book masquerading as an objective study which is in
fact a romantic hagiography tricked out in psychoanalytic terminology.
There can be no objection to a Jesuit writing about the founder of his
Order, providing that the result is not merely a disguised excuse for yet
another apologia. There are plenty of these in propagandistic Lives of the
Saints manufactured for the faithful. But this is just what Meissner gives
us, performing wondrous contortions to reconcile his devotion to Ignatius
with Freudian theory.
Take, for example, Meissner on Ignatius's sexuality, since sexuality is a
major Freudian preoccupation. Ignatius was wet-nursed in a blacksmith's
cottage on his father's estate. Meissner writes: 'The conditions regarding
the separation of the sexes, nudity, sleeping arrangements, and the dangers
of primal scene exposure would have put little Inigo in a state of high
sexual stimulation, intensifying his oedipal desires and the corresponding
level of libidinal conflict, oedipal guilt, and castration anxiety'.
('Primal scene exposure' is gobbledygook for 'seeing sex happen'.)
We are then told that women found the adult Ignatius magnetically
attractive, that they gathered round him wherever he went, drawn by his
'powerful masculine style', and that 'the apostolic endeavours closest to
his heart were the care of poor women and prostitutes'. His 'spiritual
conversations' with the 'pious ladies of Manresa' attracted scandal, and
Meissner says this might have prompted Ignatius to leave the city. Later,
when the Inquisition tried Ignatius for heresy, there were suggestions of
impropriety with the veiled young girls 'constantly coming and going' to be
instructed by him.
Meissner psychoanalyses this data, and startlingly concludes that it was not
sexual pressures Ignatius felt, but the need of a mother figure. There is no
suggestion of struggle to conquer libido: 'his dealings with women,'
Meissner says, 'were always marked by concern, respectful warmth, tact,
circumspection'. This may be true, but it is a tame result after so much
infantile exposure to 'primal scenes' and so many girls responding to such
powerful masculinity. The question is: could a Jesuit writing about Ignatius
have concluded otherwise?
The book is hugely repetitive and its naivety beggars description. It reads
like a children's book, coyness and whimsy squirting out at every
opportunity: 'So Inigo found his first benefactress. On his first day in the
hospice of Santa Lucia, the good widow sent him a boiled fowl for supper.'
Biography is interspersed with equally awful theory: 'From a psychoanalytic
perspective' we are told in the section on mysticism, 'psychic process and
psychodynamic influence are present in both primary and secondary
manifestations of the mystical state'. The least of this sentence's crimes,
as you see when you translate it into English, is that it is tautologous.
Yale and Meissner deserve a stinging rebuke for publishing this book in this
state.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Books: A triumph of family capitalism - The success of
Schroders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID KYNASTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHRODERS: MERCHANTS AND BANKERS
by Richard Roberts
Macmillan Pounds 25, 616 pages
IT READS like Buddenbrooks-on-the-Thames. Johann Heinrich Schroder,
17-year-old son of a prosperous merchant family, left his native Hamburg in
1802 and settled in the City of London, joining his elder brother's
business. Sixteen years later he started his own firm, J. Henry Schroder &amp;
Co. And, until retiring in 1849, he ran it and a sister firm in Hamburg with
an iron hand: strongly Lutheran and equally strongly devoted to the profit
motive, his world-view was encapsulated in advice to a St Petersburg agent
in 1846: 'Take pains to become a sensible human being, acquire good,
unassuming manners, don't dream of Spanish castles in the sky.'
Other Schroders followed but the culture remained the same. A crucial moment
occurred in the early 1890s. John Henry (son of Johann Heinrich) was
childless: who would come through from the third generation? His 25-year-old
nephew, Bruno, started work in the firm's Leadenhall Street office on the
day in January 1893 that the FT turned pink. At once he was discovered
examining the bills of exchange that had come in to be guaranteed hy
Schroders: trade finance was the very backbone of the firm's business and it
was obvious he was the man.
There was probably no more German house in the City. Most of its clients
world-wide were of German origin; even by the turn of the century German was
still the language of the office; and the Schroders themselves continued to
take German brides. The partners of other merchant banks were increasingly
attracted by politics and high society, but these held no allure for the
serious-minded Schroder partners.
The results were apparent by the Edwardian period: on the eve of war,
Schroders was arguably the City's most successful merchant bank. Issuing
foreign loans as well as lubricating world trade, it was consistently
achieving a rate of return on capital of some 16 per cent - three times
greater than that of British banking as a whole. All done with 40 clerks and
two partners (Frank Tiarks as well as Bruno Schroder), it was a triumph of
family capitalism.
Then came a series of crises. The First World War would have been a disaster
anyway, because of the firm's heavy commitments in Central Europe, but was
doubly so because of the perceived German allegiance of Bruno Schroder, his
situation little helped by having been made a baron by the Kaiser. Patient
rebuilding followed in the 1920s - including opening a New York firm,
Schrobanco - but all was blown aside by the European financial crisis of
1931, which for over a decade left the firm hobbled. The Second World War
was merely a further blow.
Would a phoenix arise? 'It is vitally important to our own happiness that we
should make up our minds quite definitely, once and for all, that to run JHS
&amp; Co is what we want to do more than anything in the world. That we want to
and can deal with and master awkward folk and awkward unpleasant situations
and enjoy doing it.' So in 1944 wrote the fourth Schroder (Helmut) to the
third Tiarks (Henry). Tiarks' reply was whole-hearted and by the 1950s the
firm was again on the move, reflecting the revival in the City at large of
corporate finance and international banking.
There was one more central figure: not from Hamburg but from Nottingham; not
a City man but a successful lawyer up to the age of 40. Gordon (now Lord)
Richardson joined Schroders in 1957, in an inspired piece of recruitment,
and over the next decade and a half was its dominant presence, imbuing the
firm with revived professionalism and sense of thoroughness. There are
affinities with Siegmund Warburg, though without Warburg's creative streak:
and now, 20 years after Richardson left to become Governor of the Bank of
England - years in which the firm has generally got right the important
decisions, above all a low-key approach to 'Big Bang' - it is appropriate
that Schroders lies second only to Warburgs in the merchant bank ratings.
All this is told by Richard Roberts with a formidable technical grasp but
also a pleasantly light touch, including a good joke about Yoko Ono's
father, a well-known Tokyo banker. There are also wonderful photographs of
the partners enjoying Christmas dinner in 1956, complete with crackers, nuts
and port. Johann Heinrich may have been spiritually a man for the phoned-in
sandwich, but even he would have agreed that a chap needs sustenance if he
is to avoid those Spanish castles in the sky.

GLUBB PASHA: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF SIR JOHN BAGOT GLUBB
by Trevor Royle
Little, Brown Pounds 20, 525 pages
JACK GLUBB played a notable role in modern Middle East history - not as
overtly spectacular as that of TE Lawrence, but in many ways more
influential. Most attention is paid to Glubb Pasha's development of the Arab
Legion which he commanded between 1939 and 1956 in what is now Jordan.
In the author's words, this is a 'political biography', and while it goes
over ground made familiar in an earlier account of Glubb's life by James
Lunt, Royle has drawn on more recently released government documents in
addition to Glubb's extensive collection of private papers. More
importantly, Royle puts Glubb into broader historical and social
perspectives.
Glubb followed his father into the British army, becoming like him a sapper.
He was horribly wounded in 1917 in the Battle of Arras: the injury's legacy
was the Arabs' epithet of Abu Hunaik - 'he of the little jaw'.
His Middle East experiences started in Mesopotamia, operating with the
Bedouin on the border with Saudi Arabia. He pioneered sky-spying and bombing
from DH9A aircraft, thereby giving British forces and their allies a
distinct edge over Arab rebels. But it was in Jordan that he made his name,
building up the Arab Legion, the only Arab army to emerge from the 1948 war
against an embryonic Israel with any military credit.
But Glubb's position was an extraordinary anomaly. Employed by King Hussein,
38 years his junior, he was still expected to supply intelligence to the
British government. He was a good intelligence-gatherer, a prolific writer
of memos, but an isolated and introspective man who was at his most relaxed
with the Bedouin. He was no politician.
Although Eden saw Nasser's hand behind his abrupt dismissal by King Hussein
in 1956, it was almost certainly not the case, rather a sign that an era had
ended. Had Glubb been more politically astute, he might have retired earlier
and of his own accord.
The writer is correctly careful not to make a martyr of his subject, whose
return to Britain was met with wrangling over his official pension. He made
his subsequent living writing and lecturing. Today in Jordan, he is scarcely
an historical footnote. But through developing the Arab Legion he helped to
lay down the foundations on which King Hussein could rely for his country's
continued existence.

LOST COMRADES: SOCIALISTS OF THEFRONT GENERATION
by Dan S. White
Harvard Pounds 27.95, 255 pages
DAN WHITE has found an original and exciting theme and has written a
compelling exploration of it. He has taken a group of men, Hendrik de Mann
in Belgium, Oswald Mosley in Britain, Marcel Deat in France, and Carlo
Meirendorff and Theodor Haubach in Germany, and used their
intellectual-political biographies to create a composite portrait of a
generation of socialists, all of whom served at the front in the Great War.
All emerged determined to reject the rule of 'old men' in favour of a new
form of socialist politics. De Mann, the most intellectually interesting of
the group, and Deat became fascist sympathisers and collaborationists after
1940. Mosley was imprisoned for his fascist activities. The two Germans
ended as martyrs in the anti-Nazi resistance.
White has done a masterly job in weaving together their disparate yet
connected stories, highlighting their common generational experiences
without minimising the importance of the national settings which determined
their eventual fates. These are all studies in failure. None of these men
left any mark on the post-1945 socialist movements.
In each case, the experience of the trenches shaped the thinking of these
'front line socialists'. The men of the left became pacifists and political
activists after 1918, re-thinking the socialist doctrines of their early
youth in terms of a tragedy which none wanted to see repeated. The
ex-combatants looked for something more vibrant and exciting than the
theories of the past.
They sought to create new movements that would go beyond working-class
ideologies, Marxism and existing parliamentary forms. All strongly believed
in national planning but sought a new economic order that would embrace
Europe. They were committed to action, to the cult of leadership, and to the
use of propaganda that would energise the passive majority. To the lessons
of the trenches was added the new challenge of the fascists with their
successful mobilisation of the masses.
Yet none of these ex-soldiers succeeded in overcoming the inertia of the
socialist parties to which they belonged. Nor could they match the popular
appeal of national socialism. Having failed to prevent war in 1939, the more
disillusioned chose the path of collaboration hoping that Hitler's New Order
might provide a final chance.
The more resilient or, perhaps, the truly idealist, joined the Resistance.
Even as he traces the wartime careers of de Mann and Deat, White continues
to stress the utopian elements in their thought, under-playing, in my view,
the moral weaknesses in their arguments which military defeat exposed but
did not create. Neither man found himself welcomed either by the German
officials or the Occupation governments. Disillusionment came quickly.
White has used the generational concept to excellent effect. If the author
has treated his subjects too sympathetically, he has provided good reasons
for re-examining their roles.

I AM THE CLAY
by Chaim Potok
Heinemann Pounds 13.99, 211 pages
TURBULENCE
by Chico Buarque
Bloomsbury Pounds 13.99, 167 pages
BAD NEWS
by Edward St. Aubyn
Heinemann Pounds 13.99, 217 pages
THE DIAMOND LANE
by Karen Karbo
Gollancz Pounds 14.99, 316 pages
CHAIM Potok's I am the Clay is a sombre tale of people who need miracles
just to survive. Set during the Korean War, an elderly couple are forced to
flee their ancestral village when it is overrun by the Chinese. They soon
come upon a wounded orphan boy. The woman, seeing in him something of her
own long dead son, adopts the child. Her husband is dubious at first, but
warms to the boy after he brings a spell of apparently magical luck in the
form of food, shelter and safety.
Potok's story is a convincing portrayal of the way souls adapt to survive
the most horrific of situations, of the way love can sprout through the most
charred soil. The author was a front line chaplain in the war, a fact which
lends weight to descriptions like the 'stench of iodine and roasting meat'
encompassing a pyre of dead refugees. But despite these occasional jolts,
there is a strange flatness to the novel, due primarily to its overly sombre
language and unsurprising imagery.
Also of small surprise is the fact that the best thing about a book called
Turbulence is its troubled, dangerous atmosphere. The Brazilian folk singer
Chico Buarque's first novel charts a few days in the life of an unnamed man
as he circles Rio de Janeiro, making approaches to people and situations
without ever really touching down. His journey begins with a sinister knock
on the door which sends our hero looking for refuge first with his rich
sister, then his ex-wife, and finally his familial farm, which has been
taken over by a nebulous group of criminals. He winds up stealing a cache of
jewels, which he exchanges for a suitcase of marijuana. Corrupt police enter
the story and the book ends with our man bleeding from a chest wound and
coming in for a landing.
Employing a taut, nervy prose and a telling eye for detail, Buarque expertly
depicts a Brazil that is shot through with crime, corruption and
dislocation. Unfortunately, having done a fine job setting his violently
fragmented scene, he fails to populate it with compelling characters or much
of a story.
More dark atmospherics are to be found in Edward St. Aubyn's Bad News. His
second novel tells the story of Patrick Melrose, a rich and troubled young
lad with a nose for narcotics. When he receives the putative 'bad news' that
his hated father has died in New York, Patrick hops on Concorde with the
intention of dancing on the old boy's grave. En route he makes several
detours through Manhattan's upper and nether worlds, imbibing enough mind
bending substances to keep a brigade of laboratory rats hopping for months.
All, it would seem, in a fruitless attempt to forestall feeling any actual
grief for the verbally, physically and sexually abusive father he refuses to
mourn.
St. Aubyn's high style is able to dip into low places with alarming ease -
anyone with questions about heroin abuse among the well-heeled will probably
have them answered here. But his satire is a bit off key, giving the book a
distinctly nasty edge that is never really redeemed by its knowing vision
and cool tone.
Karen Karbo's The Diamond Lane is yet another attempt to satirise the film
business, though she at least creates characters who are neither rich nor
famous. Her story of the marital and professional travails of two
Californian sisters is a pleasant enough read, though it is too short on
serious laughs or novel insights to make for memorable comedy. Her satire is
often a case of setting up straw men who have been knocked down so often
that watching them topple again is not worth the effort.

HENRY JAMES: THE IMAGINATION OF GENIUS
by Fred Kaplan
John Curtis/Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25, 566 pages
WHEN Leon Edel revised his four-volume biography of Henry James and
condensed it into one volume - Henry James: A Life (1987) - he managed to do
the job in 717 pages plus notes and index. Now another American James
biographer, Fred Kaplan (born 1937 and with previous biographies of Carlyle
and Dickens under his belt) has come along and has performed a similar task,
a complete life from cradle to grave, in a mere 566 pages plus notes, etc.
Kaplan's book prompts three questions. Has the saving of 150 pages of text
resulted in the omission of any significant material that the first-time
reader of a life of Henry James would need to know? Have the five years that
have elapsed since the appearance of the one-volume Life by Edel revealed
some startling material unknown to Edel and included here? And finally, even
if the material is basically the same here, does Kaplan's use and
interpretation of it give the reader a series of radically new insights into
Henry James? The short answer to all these three questions is the same - No.
It must be conceded that Kaplan is a skilful writer who succeeds in reducing
the facts of James's long, arduous literary career, and the complex web of
personal relations it entailed, into a tighter package than Edel did. The
price to be paid for this comparative concision is in loss of readability -
Edel is more enjoyable - and in Kaplan's fewer references to the novels and
stories. Edel traces many more echoes and resonances of the life in the
work.
Some new facts do emerge in Kaplan. The most vivid concerns James's sad
relationship with Constance Fenimore Woolson - an American authoress living
in exile in Italy who contributed to the character of Miss Tina in The
Aspern Papers. This poor lady committed suicide, probably on account of
James's refusal to propose marriage to her. Kaplan has a scene - straight
out of a Roeg movie yet to be made - where, after her death, James takes her
voluminous black dresses with him in a gondola and throws them into the
lagoon. For a long while the sombre garments refuse to drown and bob up out
of the water as black shapes to haunt him.
On the other hand, there is some fresh material in Edel not taken account of
here by Kaplan. He accepts the received view, put out originally by James
himself, that The Turn of the Screw derived from an anecdote told to the
novelist by Edward Benson, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Yet it is rather
odd, as EF (Fred) Benson confessed in As We Were, that none of the Benson
children could ever remember hearing that anecdote from their father.
There may have been some shadowy remark, about children being corrupted by
servants in a big house, from the lips of the archbishop that triggered
James's imagination. But, as Edel fascinatingly showed in his one volume,
the true source was a story 'Temptation' published in the widely ready
American 19th-century story magazine, Frank Leslie's New York Journal (the
forerunner of Collier's). It was a horror story serialised there between
January and June 1855 when James was a schoolboy. The parallels with James's
tale - a villain called Peter Quin who was the valet of an employer who
lived in Harley Street; Quin having a henchman called Miles - these
parallels are too abundant to be mere coincidence. The story was published
anonymously but Edel has deduced the author was Tom Taylor, a former editor
of Punch. 'What James', writes Edel, 'seems to have carried over into his
later years, more than the memory of the names he borrowed, was the sense of
portentous evil in Tom Taylor's story, the insidious power of Peter Quin and
the . . . child victims'.
Both Edel and Kaplan adopt a Freudian stance in their interpretation of the
works. They see little Miles, for instance, as a projection of James's
immediate anxieties about his occupancy of Lamb House, Rye, and more
ingrained fears and jealousies, rooted in childhood, concerning his older
brother William, the professor of psychology, whose approval he wanted for
his purchase of the house. Both biographers are also of a mind in regarding
What Maisie Knew as being crucial in James's efforts to resolve his own
psychological difficulties. In that novel Kaplan affirms that 'James
dramatized his own lifelong problems of growth, choice and personal
freedom'.
Kaplan makes slightly less of the theatrical failure than Edel, who sees it
as the great trauma. (Understandably he does: it was the origin of Edel's
interest in James when as a French-speaking Canadian student of literature
at the University of McGill in Montreal, he published his doctoral thesis in
1931.)
Writing in our contemporary climate, Kaplan is a little freer in dealing
with James's sex-life - the lack of it in practice - than was Edel. James
never seems to have had a real physical affair with anyone of either gender
and it was not until The Wings of the Dove, written when he was pushing 60,
that he intimated that sexual congress had recently occurred between two of
his principal characters. But in his latter years in real life he had a very
physical way of addressing people he was fond of, certain younger men like
the sculptor Hendrik Andersen. 'My dear friend, I pat you on the back . . .'
and similar phrases. Kaplan concludes that James was 'homoerotic' - an
ugly-sounding word he uses a great deal. It comes from psychiatry, defined
in the OED 2nd edition as meaning: 'Pertaining to or characterised by a
tendency for erotic emotions to be centred on a person of the same sex'.
With particular reference to Henry James, it means that basically he was gay
but he never did anything about it.
The psychological profile of James we get from Kaplan may well be perfectly
true but it becomes unhelpful when it serves to concentrate the mind of the
biographer on viewing the fiction largely as a form of self-therapy. One may
hope that the next Jamesian biographer to come along will pull the old boy
up from off the analyst's couch and permit him to stand once more on his own
two feet. What we need now is a biographer who will treat James's fiction
not as the dramatising of interior anxieties but as the expression of the
keenest, most scrupulous observations we possess concerning the men and
women of his period.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: In search of a White Knight - Dulwich is brave to
break loose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE with a paltry Pounds 200,000 a year to spare has a once in a lifetime
opportunity to adopt the nation's first, and perhaps most cherished, art
gallery.
Dulwich Picture Gallery wants to sort out its future for once and for all.
It is sick of launching periodic appeals for funds to cover the fact that it
receives no significant public money. It rattles on with a revenue of around
Pounds 360,000 a year and costs that are over Pounds 460,000. It thinks that
a gallery with its history and contents deserves better.
The story of its collection is romantic. The late 18th century dealer Noel
Desenfans was commissioned to acquire a choice group of Old Masters which
would form the basis of the national museum of Poland. It was a wonderful
time to buy, with the fall out from the French Revolution flooding Europe
with cheap pictures. But then the Great Powers gobbled up Poland and
Desenfans was stuck with the stock. It contained paintings by Murillo,
Canaletto, Van Dyck, Poussin, Tiepolo and more, and should have formed the
basis of a British national gallery. Instead it ended up at Dulwich College,
as did Desenfans, who is buried in a mausoleum in the art gallery designed
by John Soane.
The Estate Governors of the College are the villains in the piece. They give
the gallery Pounds 150,000 a year but their reserves total Pounds 42m and a
worryingly high proportion of their annual income disappears in management
costs. The Gallery has decided to break loose, recruit its own Trustees and
make a play for the market. Even so, it expects the Governors to keep
funding this undoubted local asset.
Its director, Giles Waterfield, is disarmingly open minded as to where the
Pounds 200,000 needed to make up the deficit and to ensure gallery
improvements should come from. At the moment the Gallery is spending its
capital, which will run out in two years. Then Waterfield will close the
doors. He will not go for the easy fix and sell a major painting. The last
time the Trustees did this, 20 years ago, they imagined that the Pounds
100,000 raised from the Domenichino they sold would secure the future. The
money lasted four years and brought Dulwich a poor reputation.
So where will the White Knight come from? The neatest and nicest solution
would be for Dulwich, with its collection of choice Old Masters, to become a
satellite of the National Gallery, which already helps out on its picture
restoration. But Neil MacGregor of the National Gallery has no desire to
follow the lead of Nick Serota at the Tate and preside over a plethora of
out-stations.
The next favoured approach would be for the National Heritage Fund to come
up with a Pounds 3m endowment which would enable Dulwich to remain
independent. But the Fund is the victim of Government cutbacks, and there is
little chance of this happening before the arrival of Lottery money and the
Millennium Fund. There is more mileage in anticipating a generous gesture
from the Secretary for National Heritage, Mr Peter Brooke, whose officials
have held mildly encouraging talks with Waterfield.
But if the search is on for a final solution, what about something really
imaginative and making Dulwich the UK outpost of the Getty Museum at Malibu
California. With its annual income in excess of Dollars 100m the Getty could
well afford to adopt Dulwich. So could a rich family like the Sainsbury's,
which has local links, or a company like British Telecom or British Gas. The
money needed is paltry. If anything Dulwich is in danger of selling itself
short: an imaginative gallery like the Tate is currently looking for nearer
Pounds 100m for its development.
In the short term the biggest drawback, the relative inaccessability of the
Gallery, is made good by the display at Christie's (until January 24). Not
all the treasures are on show, the much stolen Rembrandt has not made the
journey, but wonderful works by Canaletto, Poussin, Murillo and Gainsborough
take on a grander look on the high walls of Christie's. Many are returning
to their mid-wife since Christie's was the major supplier to Desenfans, who
paid 11 guineas for the Murillo flower girl in 1785. Given such a price it
is easy to see why Dulwich has found it hard to move with the times.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Block backs the Bolshoi - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TONIGHT the Bolshoi Ballet treads the boards at the Royal Albert Hall and
Derek Block can start to relax. Block, best known as a pop promoter, has
invested Pounds 3.5m in the five week season, his first big diversion from
promoting Rod Stewart, managing the Nolans, and putting on more pantos and
pier shows than the mind can handle.
The omens for such arts spectaculars are poor. The previous importers of the
Bolshoi, the Entertainment Corporation, went bust, and when fellow
impresarios Harvey Goldsmith and Raymond Gubbay put on arena-sized opera
productions at Earls Court and Wembley it proved a risk too far. Block has
recouped around Pounds 3m to date and if the performances approach anywhere
near his starry-eyed enthusiasm he hopes that word of mouth will push box
office revenue above Pounds 4m.
With the 150 dancers performing excerpts from the classical repertoire
rather than full-length ballets, Block is unlikely to win over the critics,
or even the 400,000 committed dance lovers that his research pinpointed. But
aficionados of an 'event', and less scrupulous dance goers, should buy the
necessary 100,000 tickets, priced between Pounds 5 and Pounds 100. Many are
being marketed by London hotels, anxious to sell beds on the back of ballet;
many more through Pounds 200 corporate hospitality packages.
With the disappearance of the old apparatchiks, Block found negotiating with
the Bolshoi quite straightforward although, at Pounds 30,000 a performance,
it is costing well over Pounds 1m to bring the company to London. This seems
modest compared with the expense of hiring and transforming the Royal Albert
Hall into a passing resemblance of the Bolshoi Theatre, which will consume
another Pounds 1.5m.
For Patrick Deuchar, manager of the Hall, it marks another significant step
towards his dream of converting the auditorium into a venue for 'seasons'
rather than renting it out nightly. Expect more major dance events and arts
festivals at the Hall and fewer pop concerts.
*****
There are people who think that the arts exist to excite confrontation. They
are probably the only satisfied customers from the European Arts Festival
which has just ended. This was John Major's idea to make the UK's Presidency
of the EC a time for dancing in the streets. He extracted Pounds 6m from the
Treasury to be spent on arts events under the supervision of John Drummond,
ex-Edinburgh Festival and now supremo of the Proms.
The Festival led to endless bickering. The problem was that the money came
too late to devise ambitious new projects, especially at the big London
venues. The press always enjoys trashing rather than praising and wrote off
the initiative from the start. John Drummond took umbrage. Look at the stars
we brought over, he says - Pina Bausch to the Edinburgh Festival, Ariane
Mnouchkine to Bradford, Zeffirelli to London. Ask in Ulster, Wales,
Scotland: there the Festival really hit home.
But the fact that most of the money was spent out of London, and on
community events, allowed the metropolitan critics to ignore it. Drummond
had the last laugh. He enraged all those arts managers whose request for
Festival funding was rejected by spending an undistributed Pounds 25,000 in
national advertisements last weekend which sang the praises of the Festival.
In January the main London salerooms sleep. This has allowed Christie's to
display the masterpieces from the Dulwich Picture Gallery in its empty
rooms. Sotheby's, meanwhile, is choked with washing machines and video
recorders.
They are the contents of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's country house,
Headington Hall, which come under the hammer on January 14. Like most
self-made men Maxwell had no artistic taste whatsoever and the 600 lots are
expected to make a paltry Pounds 300,000 for his receivers. The only sign of
humanity among the second-rate fixtures and fittings is the fact that
Maxwell kept the cartoons which ridiculed him.
A more sinister side to the man comes with his library desk desk, estimated
at up to Pounds 3,000. It has a hidden extra, ignored by the catalogue
entry. Attached to the desk lamps are a couple of state of the art
microphones.
The auction was originally to be held (by Christie's) on the premises at
Headington Hall, and prurient curiosity might well have brought out the
crowds - and high prices. But Sotheby's won the contract at the last moment
by agreeing to a substantial cut in its charge to the seller. It could only
afford to do this by postponing the auction until the New Year to take
advantage of the the extra 5 per cent of revenue it now receives from
raising the buyer's premium to 15 per cent from January 1. But the Maxwells
had to quit Headington by the end of 1992; hence the second-hand kitchen
furniture in Sotheby's Bond Street.
*****
The V&amp;A is having little luck in renting out its newly created exhibition
space. The Sovereign show, about the Queen, ran up against public
disgruntlement with the royals and cost its sponsors Pounds 1m. Now the
latest exhibition, Sporting Glory, has fared even worse, with the
organisers, Sporting Trophies Exhibition Ltd, calling in the receivers.
Attendances are just 300 a day, half the target, and it seems set to end
well before the scheduled February 14. The main loser is Lord Burghesh, who
devised the exhibition in memory of his grandfather who organised a similar,
acclaimed, display before the War. The V&amp;A will forgo its Pounds 100,000
fee.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Debate, drama and the young at heart - Radio in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC's Radio 2 and Radio 3 have changed significantly this year. Radio 1,
meanwhile, maintains its well-established principle of entertaining the
young-in-heart, with well-judged mediation in campaigns likely to matter to
the young-in-body - AIDS, for instance, drugs, suicide and ethnic affairs.
Radio 4 has only made one serious alteration I call to mind, the switch of
Woman's Hour from afternoon to morning. There is no point in reopening the
arguments about that now, though I can take the opportunity of saying what a
good programme this is.
Radio 2 up-dated its image a little, to the resentment of older listeners,
who I think regard it as a channel to play them what they have known all
their lives, as for the most part it does.
Radio 3 was up-dated in its way, too, with more conversational presentation
and more time devoted to the analysis of popular entertainment. I do not
pretend to enjoy Night Waves; but now I need not often listen, for Classic
FM has sprung up in the independent field to provide an alternative service.
Radio 3 at any rate goes on with its plentiful choice of live and recorded
concerts as well as intelligent comment on music and the other arts (such as
Test Matches). There was a series of features on the ecology - and there is
still a play once a week.
It has scored high in drama. We had Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet in the spring,
and lately a succession of pieces from the dramatic uprising of the 1960s.
There were two plays from the Spanish, wittily adapted by the expert John
Clifford, Inez de Castro and Fernando de Rojas's La Celestina. Then we were
given the contemporary Romanian play Vlad the Impaler, a quasi-historical
piece about that prince, begetter of Dracula and allegory of Ceausescu; and
the Russian Yerofeev's Moscow Train, that ran through wild country to Moscow
Station. Rabbi Lionel Blue's quarter-hour on the Last Supper was one of my
favourite programmes of the year.
Radio 4 was as generous with drama as Radio 3 with music. I pick a random
Radio Times from my pile and find in that week three plays over an hour long
(one repeated), three roughly an hour long, and seven half-hours, five of
them instalments of serials.
The Classic Serials are not always classics, but who minds? They are handy
when they dramatise books we all know about but have not necessarily read;
the year's miscellany included Humphry Clinker, Pere Goriot, The Mill on the
Floss. The less classic serials included Decline and Fall and Little Women.
For me, Radio 4 is the debate channel. Its Radio 4 Debates are real
debating-society stuff. But also there were series about current affairs -
The Politics of Choice at election-time, in which political matters were
raised without politicians; and Who Believes in Britain?, that surveyed not
only our own Church but Buddhism, the Hindus, Islam, Judah and the Sikhs.
In July there were five programmes on The Future of the Arts, and in
September four talks by Sir Roy Strong on their funding. We learnt about the
Radio 4/Radio Times Enterprise Awards for business initiative.
Talks and features proliferate, though they tend to lag behind current
affairs. Not always: William T. Vollmann's Yugoslavian Notes gave a great
pictorial background to the Yugoslavian crisis. Sometimes the features led
the way - Michael Buerk's series on Africa last winter gave a picture of
Somalia that we only now fully visualise. The American election gave rise to
The Fading Dream about the electorate, and, more amusingly, to a Chicago
production of Of Thee I Sing.
Current affairs might surface anywhere; there was a fine feature in Woman's
Hour about the new baby unit in Holloway Gaol. Costing the Earth was a
series prompted by the Rio summit, but found a second wind on ecological
subjects; yet even Lord Tebbit did not bring them in on Desert Island Discs,
that faultless Sunday entertainment.
Radio 5 had trouble finding its feet, but at least its day-long, everyday
coverage of the Olympics went down well. Otherwise I found myself constantly
burdened with serials for the young. In February, Nothing Ever Happens Here,
about an American boy's impressions of England, was fun; later examples,
less so. But having secured its age-group, the Radio 5 anti-glue-sniffing
programme was as good as Radio 1's. A Family Learns Spanish had too little
Spanish in it, but there are three Sunday evening programmes genuinely
helpful for those wanting to learn French, German or Italian.
There has been some good stuff on the World Service. A six-part history of
Japan was more interesting than it sounds; and there was a novel celebration
of Columbus's 'discovery' of America, The Invaders' Legacy, an anthology of
all that was wrong in South America. Nor must I forget LBC, which broadcasts
many of the winning pieces from the Woolwich Young Playwrights' competition,
or a good play from Radio Clyde.
*****
Auguries in 1993's first week? On Radio 4: Sex in the Head on Saturday
(modest erotic thoughts) and Two People on Friday (lesbian problems) and the
start of two unpromising comic series, Craig Brown's appalling Welcome to My
Wireless (Sundays) and Miles Kington's imaginary interviews (Mondays). On
Radio 3: Twelfth Night with a Caribbean accent, on or near Twelfth Night,
and Paul Scofield reading Seneca's letters. Radios 1, 2 and 5, wait and see.
And Classic FM gave Marschner's opera The Vampyr on Sunday. Keep on
listening.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: A Scottish flourish - Poetry in performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH it called itself the Festival of New Poetry, lastmonth's gathering
of 12 poets at the Poetry Society in London was hardly an affair of youth at
all - only one of the poets reading was under 30. Of that dozen readers,
four were from Scotland, and these poets made the most distinctive and
original contribution to the festival - especially Bill Herbert, who writes
by turns in English and Dundonian Scots and, in certain respects, is a
natural heir to Hugh MacDiarmid.
Herbert is a reader with flair and gusto, perfectly at ease in front of an
audience and like MacDiarmid, too, a natural proselytiser for his own point
of view. To such an extent, in fact, that it was his single prose piece,
exploring the dilemma of the Scottish dialect poet in a society that largely
thinks and feels in English, which was his most memorable and amusing
contribution to the second evening. Herbert was, of course, mocking
society's refusal to take lowland Scots seriously as a language for poetry;
but when he went on to read an original poem in Scots entitled 'The Flock in
the Firth' telling us proudly that it was full of 'dictionary vocabulary'
because it 'sounded good', one began to wonder about the validity of the
exercise as a genuine repository of feeling. We sat back and enjoyed the
music.
Fellow Scot Angela McSeveney, the festival's youngest reader, could not have
been more different. The subject matter could not have been plainer: the
imagined terrors of the smear test; a delightful description of a dirty
weekend, 'one of those poems you can't publish while your parents are
alive'; the back injury which results in a visit to the physiotherapist who
'walks round me like one of those art gazers'. These were poems about the
normalities of life, written with a forceful simplicity.
The sole Welsh representative at the festival was Gwyneth Lewis, a poet
whose work has been too little published. Many of the poets reading seemed
to have an instinctive dislike of using language in ways that poets have
traditionally used it: to praise; to express sublime feelings; to regard the
writing act itself as something ceremonious. All that sort of thing is old
fashioned; it sorts ill with the cynicisms of the present - and, indeed,
with its tragedies. That is the way the humbug runs. Gwyneth Lewis set aside
these fashionable preoccupations in such poems as 'The Hedge', 'Illinois
Idylls' and, most remarkably of all, a poem entitled 'Pentecost', the
account of an Estonian woman who has been commanded by God to go to Florida
in order to reveal his miracles to the benighted residents. The language of
this poem - as of others that she read - had a visionary reach that few
poets now writing manage to attain. (The woman, it seems, really existed -
and she went).
But the last word of all must go to Maurice Riordan, a poet from Cork whose
work will be represented in a forthcoming volume of Faber introductions to
new poets. Riordan's poems were unusual in several respects: for their
remarkable rhythmical control and judicious choice of vocabulary, for
example, evidence in such poems as 'Chair', a long and loving description of
the splendid engineering of the chair used by the master of the Inquisition
for the purposes of torture, Riordan read softly, mellifluously,
unhurriedly, allowing each nasty detail to register its impact upon us,
culminating in the statement that 'the sitter must learn the virtues of
minimal fuss'.
But best of all the long narrative poem of his entitled 'Time out', which
told the terrible story of a serial nightmare. A father leaves his house at
night to buy a packet of cigarettes. A taxi knocks him over. He dies
overnight in the hospital. Unfortunately, back at home, alone and helpless,
two small sons lie sleeping in their beds. This was one of the most gripping
and horrifying narrative poems I have heard read aloud in many years, and it
surely heralds the arrival of a major new talent.
It was as refreshing festival, and one which said a great deal about the
state of poetry now: how various an art it is, for example, no longer
divided into schools or camps; the fact that there is no subject matter that
poetry will not encompass, and no words that it feels afraid to use; what a
fresh, confident and distinctive contribution young women poets are now
making; and, perhaps most interesting of all, how shamelessly poets plunder
their own autobiographies when writing their poems, which are sometimes
little more than versified anecdotes - something entirely out of bounds to
the prose writer, of course, for whom the writing of autobiography,
fragmented or otherwise, is an admission of failure (unless, of course, you
happen to be famous for other reasons. In which case someone else would
probably write it for you.)
W N Herbert's 'Anither Music' is published by the Vennel Press at Pounds
4.99; Angela McSeveney's first collection, 'Coming Out with It', will be
published shortly by Polygon.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Property: Herstmonceux sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of Herstmonceux Castle, in east Sussex, has been decided. The huge
moated house, built in the 15th century, has been bought for Canada's
Queen's University by a grateful former student.
A donation of Pounds 6m by an alumnus brings to an end five years of
uncertainty for the former home of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. About
Pounds 4m will be used in the actual purchase, the remainder going towards a
major restoration programme.
The gift has been made by Dr Alfred Bader and his wife, Isabel. Dr Bader
fled Vienna and the Nazis shortly before the Second World War, visiting
Sussex on his way to university at Kingston, Ontario.
After completing his studies, Dr Bader established a successful chemical
company in America.
It had always been his wish to show appreciation to the university and the
gift is to enable it to transform the old castle into an international study
centre.
Queen's principal, David Smith, said this week: 'This splendid gift is an
important demonstration of faith in the future of international efforts and
contributions possible through the unique participation of a Canadian
university.'
Five years ago, agents Knight Frank and Rutley attracted criticism for
selling the castle, its grounds and the group of equatorial telescope
buildings and the Sir Isaac Newton buildings for 'only' Pounds 8m.
Recently, joint agents Savills, estimated that to rebuild the castle alone
would now cost at least Pounds 50m. Nevertheless, there is a feeling of
relief that it has been sold at all, and for a good cause.
The castle, its gardens and grounds were bought back in 1988 by Ian Tegg's
company, James Developments.
Plans were drawn up for conversion of the entire estate into a leisure
complex; further land was acquired and by the time the company went into
receivership it was said that more than Pounds 20m had been spent.
Before the castle's sale to James Developments, astronomer Patrick Moore
formed a syndicate in an unsuccessful attempt to raise money to buy the
remarkable domed buildings that housed the world-famous telescopes.
This week's sale includes all the buildings and most of the land. The sale
was on behalf of receivers Grant Thornton, with merchant bankers Guinness
Mahon by far the largest creditor.
Jeffrey Cooper, deputy chief executive of Guinness Mahon, said: 'We are
delighted to have found a buyer for this estate who proposes to use it in a
way that will represent such a boon, both to the local community and to the
diversity of educational choice in the UK.'
The castle was built between 1440 and 1449 by French and English architects
employed by Sir Roger Fiennes; there are more than 140 rooms in the main
building.
Restoration work started in 1911 and was completed in 1935. In 1948, the
castle became the home of the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the official
residence of the Astronomer Royal.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Property: Confusion clouds the listing regulations - A look
at legislation related to historic buildings and considers what help is
available for preservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the 1980s almost half a million property owners were forced to accept
the obligations of their building becoming 'listed'. After the demolition of
the Art Deco Firestone factory in west London, over the 1980 August bank
holiday when the building was about to be listed, Michael Heseltine, then
environment secretary, ordered a relisting of properties.
But while estate agents now cite Grade I, II* or II listing to certify that
a house has quality - and English Heritage (EH) prosecutes owners for
deliberate damage - public understanding of listing, and what you may or may
not do to your house, has lagged. And the regulations for VAT relief - an
important consideration when a refurbishment bill can be as much as Pounds
100,000 on a large property - seem to counteract the intentions of listed
status.
Recession has contributed to the confusion. Applications for listed building
consent for alterations have become much less frequent which has meant few
planning disputes have arisen and a smaller body of case law exists than if
work on listed buildings had continued at the pace it did in the 1980s.
As a result, less pressure has been put on the chancellor to give VAT relief
to those who are legally obliged to maintain the best buildings in Britain,
although EH, the Historic Houses Association and the Country Landowners
Association regularly remind him of how he could help.
Of the 440,000 buildings in England certified by listing as the country's
premier building stock and of architectural or historical importance, about
6,000 are Grade I, 29,000 are Grade II* and 405,000 are Grade II. EH submits
candidates for listing to the Department of the Environment for approval. In
spite of EH's efforts, the DoE has approved few modern buildings.
After a building is listed its details are recorded in the 'Green Books',
which are available from local planning authorities and sometimes public
libraries. If you are buying a listed house, ask the vendor's agent for a
copy of the entry and check if it is included in Pevsner's Buildings of
England.
Regular maintenance does not require building consent. Once a building is
listed, owners are obliged to maintain it, as the Guide to the Legislation
Relating to Listed Buildings of Simmons &amp; Simmons (solicitors) and
Jackson-Stops (estate agents) explains. Owners may apply for a grant to make
up some of the cost. (Ask first at your local authority. EH is unlikely to
give grants except for large sums and important buildings.)
Anything that 'alters the character' of the house requires consent. For
Grade I and II* houses, the local authority usually refers the matter to EH
and amenity societies such as the Georgian Group. If it is about to approve
the work, an 28-day delay allows the DoE to consider whether it will refuse
permission. If the owner wants to demolish a substantial part or all of a
listed building, the case goes automatically to the DoE and the other
bodies.
When an owner neglects a building, the local authority can issue orders
specifying work that needs to be done or do the work itself and present the
bill. The ultimate sanction is for the council to acquire the building by
compulsory purchase, when the price is based on the present state of the
building. North Shropshire District Council acquired Pell Wall Hall for just
Pounds 1.
EH's Buildings at Risk survey estimates that around 37,000 listed buildings
are at risk from neglect, more than 900 in London. If a Grade I or II*
building is at risk and could be used if restored, chances of a grant from
EH are higher.
Present VAT rules do not help the conscientious owner. Regular repairs which
can be extremely expensive - for example if a large house needs to be
re-roofed - attract VAT at the usual 17.5 per cent. Only work that changes
the building and needs listed building consent is exempt from VAT.
These rules make no sense. The new work may negate features for which the
building was listed in the first place. They give owners an incentive to
make unnecessary changes in order to keep the bill down. Although most
owners feel the pinch on regular maintenance, Adrian Dobinson, of
Renaissance Partnership in Bath, (tel: 0225 314426) says: 'No government in
the world is going to give you VAT relief for clearing the gutters or
repainting. They go with living in any house.'
But if the colour or even the hue of the paint is changed and consent is
applied for, help is available. A DoE directive issued under Lord Ridley
when he was environment secretary accepts that this changes the character of
a building and so qualifies this for the relief.
Dobinson's firm specialises in listed buildings and sends its own team of
builders around the country, as he has found it hard to ensure that local
builders do the job properly. Dobinson says VAT relief is not the hurdle
that many owners think. But obtaining it requires the consent and a
carefully specified list of works.
More jobs qualify than many people imagine and Dobinson has a body of
precedents ready to cite to the Customs and Excise which, he says, is
generally helpful.
Insurance is another unrecognised problem. Take advice. If the house burns
down, you are legally liable to put it up again as it was. But the cost of
doing so is likely to be more - even twice or three times - than what you
would get for selling the property.
'Take everything into account', says Dawn Carritt, of agents Jackson-Stops,
'even the garden walls, if you have an old walled garden and they are
listed'. If you are buying a house, check whether any of the walls, gates or
statuary has a listing of its own and make sure that everything is insured
for its replacement cost. If you are in doubt about how much to insure for,
consult an estate agent or chartered surveyor.
In a third grey area (but one which is slowly becoming better defined) are
the fixtures of listed buildings, as Coming Unstuck - a recent report by the
Victorian Society - highlights. If a building is listed, its fixtures (such
as fireplaces, staircases and door frames which are physically attached to
it and garden ornaments) are covered by the listing.
Whether or not the Green Book entry specifies them, it is illegal to remove
them without consent, which is unlikely to be given, as it is bound to
change the character of the house. Sadly, many fixtures are lost through
theft and by owners cashing them in.
The Victorian Society recommends that local authorities be given the power
to serve stop notices when fixtures are under threat and urges tougher
control on the sale of fixtures from listed buildings. It should be illegal
to offer them on the expectation of (retrospective) consent.
If you want to embellish your house with architectural antiques, make sure
the dealer or auctioneer tells you where they have come from. It would be
sad if they had to be pulled from your house to be restored to their
rightful home.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Restaurants: Lunch for a fiver - at Britain's finest -
Nicholas Lander outlines the Weekend FT's scheme for eating out at an
affordable price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IDEA for the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver' offer was conceived in New York
last summer, when restaurants were emptying as locals headed for the beach.
Delegates to the 1992 Democratic Convention failed to book the empty tables,
so 100 restaurateurs agreed to try the ancient remedy of cutting prices.
Each offered a set three-course lunch menu for Dollars 19.92 (then just over
Pounds 10).
The scheme was a success. After I had written about it, my editor, a
Yorkshireman with a keen eye for value, asked whether we could run a similar
scheme in the UK. I suggested we should try in late January, traditionally a
quiet period for the trade. We decided on the ambitious target of Pounds 5
for a two course lunch and that the FT menu should be offered for two weeks
to any customer and without special conditions.
We then approached a selected list of restaurants, suggesting that they
should enter into the spirit of the scheme by showing what they could do for
Pounds 5. Most agreed to join. It will run for ten week-day lunches from
Monday, January 18 until Friday, January 29. A full list of the 130
restaurants taking part appears in the box on the righthand side of this
page.
From Monday, January 11, the FT will be printing the names of a proportion
of the participating restaurants each day as well as running a competition
based on the names of the restaurants listed. (Please note that some of the
restaurants close on a Monday).
The prize for the winner of this competition - and for that in a
questionnaire accompanying complimentary copies of the FT available at these
restaurants, will be a weekend for two at Gidleigh Park, Devon, a luxurious
country house hotel on the edge of Dartmoor renowned for its food and wine.
If you would like to try the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver', all you have to do is
to specify the FT menu when booking a table. Customers will not be under any
obligation to choose that menu once they arrive. The Pounds 5 will cover two
courses from the special menu - either a starter and main or main course and
dessert. Value added tax is included in the fixed price, but coffee,
service, drinks, wine or a third course are not.
Restaurateurs are interpreting this in different ways. Some are including a
third course for the price of two; some are specifying the price of a third
course; while others are taking the price of any extra dishes from their a
la carte menu. Some are just discounting the price of any two dishes from
their menu to meet the Pounds 5 limit.
We have asked all the restaurants to submit sample menus. It would be naive
for any prospective diner to expect to be offered the most expensive raw
ingredients - fillet steak, sea bass or black truffles - for Pounds 5. But
the range of dishes on offer is impressive.
Starters include pumpkin risotto, fish soup and omelette Arnold Bennett
while main courses include breast of guinea fowl with braised leeks, salmis
of venison, and salmon and haddock fish cakes with parsley sauce. Although
the timing of this scheme is important, one other vital factor that makes it
possible is the growing appreciation of relatively inexpensive ingredients.
Pasta, polenta, interesting and well-prepared vegetables, cheaper cuts of
meat and less well-known varieties of fish provide, in the hands of an
imaginative chef, the basis for exciting food.
And, above all, we all hope that the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver' will provide
enjoyment. One restaurateur said that he was taking part not so much for the
extra business but for the fun. 'I have been a restaurateur for 18 years and
I am beginning to feel that the fun is going out of my profession,' he said.
If this scheme is successful, it may be possible to repeat it.
The most productive long-term effects will come from those who try the menus
on offer and pass on their comments, complimentary or critical, to the
restaurants and to me, Nicholas Lander, at the FT.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Restaurants: Why we agreed to take part - Restaurant
proprietor Neville Blech explains why he is participating in 'Lunch for a
Fiver'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEVILLE BLECH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Nicholas Lander first wrote to me proposing the FT's 'Lunch for a
Fiver', my first reaction was to file it in the bin. Not our scene, I felt.
However, intimate French restaurants such as ours are decidedly not in
fashion at the moment. In fact, intimate restaurants of any kind seem
definitely out. I was enormously saddened by the closure in 1992 of such
fine restaurants as Sutherlands and Rue St Jacques, victims of this most
vicious recession and deaf banks. Restaurants that are working well now are
those serving basic foods (albeit of many different countries) in posh,
spacious surroundings at relatively modest prices.
Students of marginal costing will know how critical a break-even point is.
In the restaurant business, the profit/loss yield curve is very steep. Get
well above break-even point and you are in clover, but go even a little
below and you are heading down that slippery slope of rapidly escalating
losses that ends, ultimately, in financial doom.
So how do I think Mijanou can capitalise on the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver'?
Although our volumes have been hit by the recession, our break-even point is
a lot lower than those of the larger restaurants. If we had not been hit by
a double whammy in 1991 (a six-month closure due to dry rot and a rent rise
that meant we have to find an extra 500 covers a year), our break-even point
would have been even lower.
As it is, we need every customer to spend at least Pounds 33 to cover our
overheads. Obviously, the more customers we have, the less they need to
spend for us to break even. Giving our customers 'Lunch for a Fiver' may not
seem the way to increase profits but with an increased spend on drinks, the
damage will be limited. The object of the exercise will be to secure a
permanent increase in our clientele back to the level of the mid-1980s. The
FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver' may achieve this, whatever the cost.
Naturally, the whole exercise has led us to look carefully at our costings
and pricing policies. We have produced a new menu running parallel to the
'Lunch for a Fiver' menu which will allow customers to spend considerably
less at Mijanou than they have done in the recent past. We will have some
lower-priced dishes with cheaper ingredients to cope with the psychological
retrenchment on spending that accompanies all recessions but we shall also
be retaining some of our signature dishes for those who still crave subtlety
and finesse. One thing is certain. Whatever happens, we shall never lower
our standards of cuisine or service.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Restaurants: A small price for cash flow
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FOR its two-week duration, the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver'
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a two-course set lunch for Pounds 5 - will offer readers real gastronomic
value. But what will it cost the restaurateurs and why have 131 restaurants
agreed to participate?
Once the Pounds 5 has been stripped of its value added tax element,
restaurants will receive Pounds 4.25 for every two-course, or in some cases
three-course, meal served. Not a significant amount of money, as any
householder knows, to buy the raw ingredients, cover fixed costs and pay the
wages of those in the kitchen and front of house, even allowing for
economies of scale.
Fixed costs at La Truffe Noire, a busy City restaurant near London Bridge
and one of the participating restaurants in the FT offer, are a good
example. Its annual fixed overheads are Pounds 165,000, consisting of Pounds
36,000 rent, Pounds 14,000 business rates, Pounds 100,000 in national
insurance and salaries, while gas, water, telephone, laundry and
depreciation costs add a further Pounds 15,000.
The restaurant serves 13,500 customers a year so that each cover costs
Pounds 12.22 before any food is served. If the restaurant could increase its
dinner trade by 40 per cent, its fixed costs would drop dramatically to
Pounds 7.50 per cover.
'More bums on seats', as restaurateurs say, is the answer to many
restaurants' financial problems. As in so many other businesses in the UK,
income, although often higher than expected, is not rising as fast as costs.
The options open to restaurants are far more limited than to many others in
the retail trade. The age-old maxim that you never see a good restaurant
advertise may no longer be as valid as it once was but the most effective
advertising rates are still far too high for individual restaurateurs to
contemplate. Public relations companies are expensive and often
counter-productive and, although many new restaurants have followed the
example of theatres with 'preview prices', the policy has obvious
limitations.
Nor can restaurants merely lower their prices to attract more customers.
Such a long-term reduction has to mean a similar decrease in the quality of
food and service. Once a restaurant pursues this policy - unless it actually
changes its identity from restaurant to brasserie, as a number did in 1992 -
it only alienates established customers and confuses new ones.
One solution to reducing fixed overheads - and one of the major attractions
of the FT scheme for restaurateurs - is to promote their quiet periods
aggressively . Many restaurateurs have successfully stimulated trade on
Monday evenings, notoriously the quietest night of the week, with wine
tastings and special dinners and far more restaurants open seven days a week
to spread fixed costs.
The FT 'Lunch for a Fiver' will, for many restaurateurs, enliven the dull
period that follows a hectic start to a new year, a period that can last
until Easter. Even in better economic times, this often proves the most
difficult period in which to manage a restaurant. Morale sags when
restaurants are quiet, tips are considerably lower, bills keep rolling in
from pre-Christmas heavy purchases and staff still have to be paid,
particularly the good ones who are always sought after. Fresh produce must
be bought and served fresh - most good restaurants aim to turn their
perishable stock over every 48 hours - and suppliers must be paid promptly
to ensure quality supplies.
The January sales, which attract so much publicity, had no equivalent in the
restaurant trade until the arrival of the FT 'Lunch for a Fiver' scheme. But
now restaurants have to compete directly with so many other retailers, all
of whom are chasing a finite amount of disposable income, restaurateurs need
to generate cash flow and customer goodwill to cover marginal costs and make
some positive contribution to their fixed overheads.
This is the new economic reality for restaurateurs in the 1990s. The FT
'Lunch for a Fiver' will, they hope, create interest and goodwill and
generate demand for what they all expect will be a difficult trading year.
On December 30, I wished a friend who runs a 50-seater restaurant
participating in this scheme a prosperous 1993. His response was succinct.
'If we break even in 1993, we will be happy.'

FT  09 JAN 93 / Restaurants: Think of a quality drink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF I WERE lunching well for a fiver, I would be tempted to spend the money I
was saving (if you see what I mean) on something good to drink with it. Not
that I want quantity. In fact, my ideal lunchtime drink would be one glass
of very fine wine indeed.
Unfortunately, however, it is taking time for restaurateurs to realise how
easy it is nowadays to preserve wine leftovers in a bottle - no complicated
machinery, or heavy investment, just a squirt from the Wine Saver can of
heavy, inert gas that keeps the harmful oxygen out, Pounds 6-odd from most
good wine merchants.
In all probability, therefore, I would be lured into buying a whole bottle
of wine, and happily the quality and range of the wine lists in the sort of
restaurants offering the FT 'Lunch for a Fiver' is generally very good, and
far better than was the restaurant norm a few years ago.
The following are the sorts of wine I find myself ordering from restaurant
wine lists at the moment because they go well with food, are ready to drink,
and offer good value:
Australian and New Zealand Chardonnays: Usually relatively cheap, and fine
so long as they are drunk as young as possible while the acidity is still
capable of giving them youthful zest. Each new vintage tends to bring
increased subtlety, too.
Alsace whites: Pungent, full-bodied dry whites of which Pinot Blanc is best
value and Pinot Gris best at spanning the fish and meat gap. One of the very
few wine regions where both 1992 and 1991 vintages will be remembered with
pleasure.
Cote Chalonnaise burgundy: Names such as Givry, Rully and Mercurey are often
more reliable than the grander and much more expensive ones of the Cote d'Or
to the north. The 1990 reds are particularly delicious at the moment.
Oddball Italians: I have found good value among Italian reds and whites with
unfamiliar names and lowish prices. If wines cannot be sold on the basis of
their fame, you can be pretty sure they have been chosen because they offer
real interest and flavour.
California Pinot Noir: Oddly, almost shamefully, a more reliable bet than
the real thing from Burgundy - especially from the likes of Acacia, Au Bon
Climat, Calera and Saintsbury.
1987 Pomerols, 1989 and 1990 lesser clarets: If ever a Bordeaux combo
qualified as that elusive commodity 'restaurant wine', it is the delightful
1987s from Pomerol. The vintage does not score in the Bordeaux charts but
good bottles of Pomerol (and some Pauillac) are delicious for current
drinking.
Throughout Bordeaux, on the other hand, 1989 and 1990 produced some
particularly luscious red wines. Lower ranking wines such as AC Bordeaux and
village wines (Margaux and St Julien, for example) are designed for the
table, not the cellar, and can provide real current drinking pleasure. Bon
appetit]

FT  09 JAN 93 / Britain joins in a game once deemed a sin: With a national
lottery on the cards, David Spanier delves into gambling history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPANIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARRIVAL of a national lottery in Britain will give the state a direct
stake in the game. Church and state have traditionally been against
gambling. But the Lottery Bill before Christmas changed this completely.
Although they may deny it, the authorities will be encouraging gambling. The
more money gambled, the more benefit to such recipients as the arts. And the
more revenue, no doubt, for the Treasury.
In this game, Britain is a late starter. The huge cash prizes promised in
the lottery extend to Britain a trend proliferating round the world: the
spread of commercial gaming with official approval.
Gambling, provides a thrill; it may be short, as in the spin of a roulette
wheel, it may be weekly, as in a national lottery, or it may be long term,
as in currency speculation. The price - how much money to risk - is decided
by the player.
Gambling was once seen as a sin. In England it was opposed by the church,
from the Middle Ages to Victorian times. The bible was cited as
justification for this view, although no injunction such as 'Thou shalt not
gamble' can be found in the scriptures.
The real reason why the authorities opposed gambling was that it interfered
with people's work. Games of chances were banned in the court of Henry VIII
because the soldiers' passion for gaming grew so intense it interfered with
archery training.
When Premium Bonds were introduced, Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of
Canterbury, fulminated against 'debasing the spiritual coinage of the
people'. He told the Lords: 'The government knows, as well as the rest of
us, that we can regain stability and strength only by unremitting exercise
all through the nation of the old-fashioned and essential virtues. . .
honest work honestly rewarded.'
A more fundamental (perhaps instinctive) reason for the authorities'
opposition to gambling is that people enjoy it. Anything allowing people to
do what they want when they want, was seen as wrong or anti-social.
In Victorian times attitudes began to change. Society came to see gambling
as a crime rather than a sin, like prostitution. People might lust after
fallen women but this was regarded as an undesirable trait of human nature
which ought to be suppressed. But while formally condemned, prostitution was
patronised by the upper classes.
So with gambling. Around the turn of the century, the beau monde took off
for Deauville or Monte Carlo to gamble. The masses, meanwhile, were supposed
to get on with their work.
The inconsistency of gaming laws was not shown up until the late 1950s, when
John Aspinall came on to the London scene. His high stakes gaming parties,
moving from house to house, were the Mayfair equivalent of the betting on
horses with a street bookie - both were evading out of date laws prohibiting
gambling. In due course the law was changed, first by a betting and gaming
bill in 1960, which proved counter-productive, and then by the Gaming Act of
1968.
Gambling in Britain still tends to be regulated by Home Office ideas of what
is good for people. Thus, slot machines are limited to two per club.
But perceptions about gambling are changing again. It has now come to be
seen as a legitimate aspect of human behaviour. Once gambling ceases to be
seen as wrong and is regarded as part of the leisure industry, it becomes
practical to tax it. Indeed, gambling is being seen as a useful revenue
earner.
This reopens the question, however, of how gambling should fit into society.
It is one thing for people to gamble at the race-track or in a casino. It
becomes quite another thing if a government is actively encouraging gambling
as a means of raising revenue.
Furthermore, it is arguable that raising taxes through gambling is
inherently bad economics. It is a voluntary tax because people do not have
to gamble unless they want to. But it still has a bit of the 'smoke and
mirrors' to it in that gambling revenue reflects expenditure diverted from
elsewhere. Gains should therefore be discounted against lower activity in
other sectors. At best, it is argued, such a source of revenue is a
palliative which saves the government from bringing in orthodox tax
measures, such as income or sales taxes.
Certainly the Treasury should do well out of it. When up and running, say in
its fifth year, the lottery is expected to produce anything from Pounds
1.5bn to as much as Pounds 4bn. Of this, the Treasury will lop off its due
share in tax. The rate has yet to be decided, but if it were to be 20 per
cent (which is one figure being talked about) the Treasury would benefit
from between Pounds 300m and Pounds 800m.
Good causes - arts, sports, charities, heritage and the 'Millennium Fund'
for 2000 - will get 30 per cent of this. The Treasury, we may be sure,
regards itself as a good cause. Expenses must also be paid. This would leave
perhaps less than a half of the total money wagered for the prizes.
What a gamble] But wait, this is merry old England. The government is not
talking about 'gambling'. It is talking about 'improving the quality of
life'. It is, formally, against encouraging gambling. You can bet on that.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Gardening: The noble art of boxing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING THE frost, I had been playing with shapes and marking out possible
gardens on a vacant stretch of turf. The basic idea is so old that it ranks
as historic, but I would not call it anyone's 'heritage': it is not peculiar
to my family, our ancestry or our country.
It is ever-so-1993 and sans frontieres: gardeners all over the Mediterranean
were playing with it too long before English gardening was special. It
involves a series of rectangular beds whose straight edges do not align
exactly but project and recede in various patterns. Their shape can be
endlessly varied during planning by the use of lines of string marking the
possibilities of the ground.
This cat's cradle of rope and twine is not so much a blueprint as a
greenprint. Its formal pattern is going to define a space in which I intend
to grow vegetables, a few herbs and currants: there is a point nowadays in
growing your own, as the new varieties of blackcurrant will fruit very well
in early autumn.
Such a pattern does not have to be a plot for vegetables. It could just as
well be the design for a small front garden, a terrace or a series of beds
in which to grow tulips, forget-me-nots and summer flowers. Whatever your
intention, be sure to observe one cardinal point: do not make the beds and
paths too narrow. If your plan is to walk round a formal pattern, you do not
want to feel as if you are visiting one of those mini-villages, laid out for
children and parents in need of outings.
For any purpose, you need a firm, smart edging: for this reason, I have
described my experiments as greenprints. Almost everybody knows that a
pattern of small, formal beds can be edged with little bushes of evergreen
box. There is only one form for this job and its nursery name is buxus
suffruticosa. You will see that I think it is unsurpassed.
Those who disagree say that box edging is a home for snails and becomes too
leggy. I have never found it to be a safe haven for pests and it will never
be leggy if you clip it properly in June. Even if you do not, you can
restore old box by replanting it more deeply so that all the bare stem lies
below ground. It will then grow away at its new level.
None the less, gardeners are curious, changes are seductive and we all like
to think of something new. What else will frame a flower bed as a neat
edging at a height of about a foot? I can think of six candidates, unless
you wish to include painted boards or lengths of whalebone, both of which
were recommended in antique English gardening books. In my view, they can
stay there: nowadays, we can do better.
My six alternatives are lavender, cotton lavender, hyssop, germander,
parahebe and sarcococca. Each has its merits which the books will describe
to you, but if you are ordering enough to edge 50 or 60 yards of flower bed,
you need to know the other side.
Nobody could complain about lavender in flower. The best form for a low
edging is the dark Hidcote variety which has very silver leaves. It makes an
edge which is not too wide and it is extremely cheap because anyone can root
it from cuttings taken between April and September. However, it is not
ideal.
Lavenders die out after several years and Hidcote becomes bare in places,
like every other variety. In winter, it looks wretched. Lavenders develop an
armoury of dark, spiky growth which is chilly and drab out of season. Box,
meanwhile, is a lovely shade of green, enhanced by white frosts.
Cotton lavender, or santolina, sounds silvery, fluffy and adventurous, but
as an edging, it should be avoided. It makes a very broad bush, even if you
clip it back to the old wood. Unlike box, it will not stay neat and level;
it dies in the middle and its yellow flowers are beastly. It looks much
better in a big bed, either by itself as a contrast to evergreens or topiary
on the grand scale, or in big formal blocks, alternating with another low
evergreen shrub.
Hyssop is more promising. It, too, will root with the greatest of ease from
cuttings; its leaves are a fresh and everlasting green, although a hard
winter will dull them temporarily. The flowers of blue and pink are charming
and they divert bees from other areas. 'Purge me with hyssop. . .', as the
psalm says, but these little plants are short-lived, brittle under snow and
not absolutely hardy, especially on soil with poor or moderate drainage. On
clay, a hundred hyssops would be a bad investment.
As an edging, germander is prettier. Its formal name is teucrium chamaedrys;
it has rose-pink flowers if you allow it, and its leaves are a beautiful
green with good texture. It looks its best in a small knot bed at Barnsley
House in Gloucestershire where it was the historic brainchild of Rosemary
Verey.
None the less, there are snags. It lives longer than hyssop, but it is not
as hardy as box. Germander is fun to try, but it is not a mainstay. It needs
clipping twice in the year, once in spring and once in July after flowering.
My other alternatives are more modern and exotic. I love parahebes, those
small, evergreen bushes which grow loosely to nine inches and flower in
shades of milk-blue, violet or a splendid white. Again, they root freely
from cuttings, but I am not yet confident of their total hardiness. As a
greenprint, they are best reserved for a low flower bed where their loss
would not ruin the line of an entire plan.
Sarcococca, by contrast, is as tough as nails. Americans call it sweet box,
and indeed the scent is extremely sickly on a clear day, but very welcome as
it appears during the next six weeks. The best value for edging is the
glossy evergreen one, confusa, but the problem is its cost. At up to Pounds
3 a plant, it becomes too expensive for a long line of patterning, spaced
nine inches apart. Sometimes, just sometimes, it will sit and sulk,
especially on heavy soils.
So, we revolve like the seasons and come back to box, beautifully green and
absolutely hardy. You see why I put it first and why gardeners have used it
for this purpose during the last 2000 years. Or perhaps you have the ideal
box alternative, a seventh in the list, proven, please, to be totally hardy:
if so, let us know about it, but be honest in order to be fair.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Lucky seven cut their literary teeth: A look at the work of
the new novelists that WH Smith is launching this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of Aldous Huxley's characters says: 'No publisher would ever publish a
first novel if he could possibly avoid it.' This is not quite true. One or
two exceptional first novels, such as Donna Tartt's The Secret History,
published earlier this year, are fiercely competed for and reap huge
pre-publication advances.
But for the most part, taking on first novels is to publishing what planting
oak trees is to forestry: you do it more for the benefit of your successors
than yourself. A first novelist may take 10 years or more to mature into a
steady, profitable seller. WH Smith, sometimes criticised in the literary
world for its alleged indifference to the existence of worthwhile
non-bestselling novelists, is taking an initiative to try to remedy this.
It has got together with a number of fiction publishers to select seven
first novels which will all appear as paperbacks and will be given the same
high profile promotion in its shops as is currently afforded to the likes of
Danielle Steel, Catherine Cookson, Robert Ludlum and Stephen King.
Although none of the lucky seven has had a novel published before, several
of them have experience in other forms of creative writing or in working for
publishers. Valerie Windsor, whose psychological thriller Telling Stories
comes from Sinclair Stevenson, cut her dramatic teeth as one of the writers
on the Channel 4 Brookside team and has had plays broadcast.
American Jane Stanton Hitchcock is also a playwright turned novelist. Her
play, Vanilla, caught the attention of Harold Pinter, who put it on at the
Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith, London, where it rapidly came off. But it
seems she will have better luck with her novel Trick of the Eye (Penguin),
where the investigative heroine is an artist who specialises in illusion.
The assignment to re-design the ballroom of a grand Long Island home plunges
her into a world of illusion and counter-illusion that for once is not
entirely of her own devising.
Anne Billson has lived professionally in a world of illusion as the film
critic of New Statesman and, clearly, her novel Suckers (Pan) is an attempt
to cut through all the pretence this engenders, especially that surrounding
the affluent young financial high-livers of contemporary London.
Elizabeth Palmer began her professional life as a graphic designer in a
publishing house. She moved from there to the Financial Times, where she met
her husband David, now its chief executive, and then became a freelance book
designer. Two years ago, she began writing The Stainless Angel (Arrow) and
on submission of the manuscript was rewarded not just with acceptance but
also a forward-looking deal for further novels.
The story she tells is of Camilla, a widowed Englishwoman with a small son
living in Rome. She marries a fellow member of the British set. His roots
are in upper-class rural England where she finds herself obliged to live -
far from permissive Rome. How she comes to terms with his background - and
it with her - is developed in a traditional linear narrative.
Ben Woolfenden was for eight years deputy manager of a bookshop in Covent
Garden. He saw for himself all too well what shifted and what stuck on the
fiction shelves.
The model for his The Ruins of Time (Black Swan) is the Penelope Lively type
of novel which begins with an investigation of the past, after which the
trail loops disconcertingly forward into the investigator's present. In this
case, the past is that of a late 19th artists' colony in Newlyn, of which
the hero's grandfather was a member - an attractively bohemian setting.
In the case of Joanna Hines, the model is even more illustrious. Hines's
heroine in Dora's Room (Coronet) becomes the chatelaine of Chatton Heights,
where a sequence of revelations and painful remembrances awaits her in
shades of Daphne du Maurier. To underline the comparison, Hines has lived
with her Canadian husband and children in Cornwall for the past 18 years.
And, finally, Marika Cobbold is Swedish, married to an Englishman whom she
met when he was part of a Royal Naval helicopter squadron visiting
Gothenburg. Her father was the editor of a leading Swedish newspaper. But
Nordic Strindbergian gloom is the last epithet to be applied to her Guppies
for Tea (Black Swan). It is in that vein of domestic social comedy beloved
of English women novelists from time immemorial.
Martin Lee, WH Smith's product group manager for adult books who is putting
his muscle behind the launch of these seven new novelists on January 7,
said: 'We do not see the hardback as the natural format for these titles and
believe that they can become more successful as paperbacks.'
That may be so, but it does not, surely, entirely preclude their eventual
hardback publication, and indeed at least one of the titles - Dora's Room -
is being published in both formats simultaneously by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. The
fiction hardback is dead. Long live the fiction hardback]

FT  09 JAN 93 / Cookery: Fat cats start here
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTMAS has taken its toll. The bathroom scales dictate that salads - and
little else - go on to my menus this week. The weather suggests otherwise. I
suppose that means I shall have to take a lot of distasteful exercise to
keep warm. What a helluva way to begin the new year]
Well, here goes - though if I do not succeed in shedding several pounds
quite quickly, I may be forced to settle on being a fat cat for 1993.
TREVISO SALAD
If you boast an imaginative local greengrocer, ask for rosso di Treviso, a
winter salading grown in the Veneto, available from November to March. It is
also cultivated in France: French imports are labelled 'Trevisse'.
Rosso di Treviso is a remarkably handsome plant with tall, tapering,
cos-like leaves, tulip-streaked with deep red, and it is much more
interesting to bite into than red whitloof chicory from Holland or the
common cabbage-shaped radicchio of Chioggia - though either of these last
two can be used as substitutes.
To make a dark and beautiful salad with rich colouring and a mixture of
earthy, sweet and slightly bitter flavours, first shred two crisp heads of
rosso di Treviso (their combined weights will be  3/4 lb to 1lb) into a
salad bowl.
Add a good quantity of cooked and cubed beetroot, home-cooked for
preference, though shop-bought will do, providing it is plain-steamed and
vaccuum-packed, not, repeat not, the acid-sozzled sort. Add a handful of
seeded raisins and sultanas soaked in vinaigrette dressing made with
balsamic vinegar, and add extra dressing as necessary to lubricate the
shredded leaves.
Take a handful of thick crusts from good white bread, reduce them to very
coarse crumbs, turn them in a little olive oil to moisten lightly, then fry
them until very crisp. Scatter them into the salad bowl and add a grinding
of black pepper. Mix quickly and serve while the crumbs are still toasty.
FRUIT &amp; LEAF SALAD
A healthy tonic of a salad, this is best if the ratio of fruit to leaf is
high. Clementines are, in my view, decidedly superior to satsumas and they
have the virtue of being seedless.
Shred a little Chinese leaf into a salad bowl, preferably from the stalk end
if you share my preference for crisp bite over floppy leaves. Add the same
quantity of frizzy endive, snapping the greenery into short lengths, a
handful of lambs' lettuce or the contents of a box or two of mustard and
cress.
Dress with sea salt, black pepper, orange juice and zest and a mixture of
olive and hazel or walnut oil.
Then add lots - I mean lots and lots - of clementines, simply peeled and
divided into segments. Add, for good measure, a few kumquats, thinly sliced,
if you happen to have some left over from Christmas, or the flesh of a pink
grapefruit, ruthlessly stripped of all pith and membrane. The main thing is
to include plenty of citrus.
COLLEGE SALAD
This is so called in acknowledgement of Mark Twain's description of
cauliflower as cabbage with a college education. I get the impression Twain
was no fonder of cauliflower than President Bush of broccoli. Perhaps this
is a more palatable way of serving the vegetable than Twain was used to.
Divide a fine, firm cauliflower into sprigs and steam until just tender.
Meanwhile, make a vinaigrette dressing in a shallow dish, using 1 1/2 to two
tablespoons of olive oil and  1/2 tablespoon of sherry vinegar.
Put the cauliflower, cooked and blotted dry, into the dressing and turn it
to coat it fully. Leave for five minutes to continue absorbing the
vinaigrette and to cool somewhat, turning the sprigs once or twice.
Chop coarsely one large or two small bunches of watercress. Add the greenery
to the cauliflower and toss again. Toast a generous, mixed handful of
pumpkin and sunflower seeds in a dry frying pan and sprinkle the seeds over
the salad just before serving.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Private View: Shakespeare in the asylum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS I climbed the path to the great rampart surrounding Broadmoor Hospital,
the air was suddenly filled with the shriek of a siren. I clutched my
folding umbrella more tightly, expecting every moment to see wild-eyed
figures clambering over the high brick wall in front of me.
'Just a test,' said the man at the main gate. 'We do it every Monday
morning.'
Nobody entering this 130-year-old asylum for the criminally insane can avoid
a shiver of voyeuristic apprehension. Not all of the 500 occupants, men and
women, have killed. But many have, and some of their names are known to
every newspaper reader in Britain.
Inside the walls, the place is more spacious, quiet, clean and modern than a
jail - no sign of state penny-pinching here - and enjoys a panoramic
southward view over Berkshire and Hampshire. I began to forget Broadmoor's
fearsome reputation and the recent allegations of cruelty by a former
resident doctor.
I began to believe, instead, in the truth of a book which movingly describes
an extraordinary experiment which has been going on here for the past three
years.
The author of the experiment and editor of the book is Dr Murray Cox,
consultant psychotherapist and Shakespearean scholar.
In 1989, as a result of a chance meeting between Dr Cox and the actor Mark
Rylance, then doing a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Hamlet was
performed in front of 105 Broadmoor patients. That was followed by the RSC's
Romeo and Juliet, a local amateur group's Measure for Measure, the National
Theatre's King Lear and, most recently, the RSC's performance of A Woman
Killed with Kindness by Thomas Heywood.
Now Aristotle, as every theatre-goer knows, described the purpose of Greek
tragedy as 'catharsis': the purging of the audience's emotions through the
dramatic depiction of pity and terror.
But there was something shocking about the idea of showing madness,
mutilation and murder - I thought of the scene in King Lear where
Gloucester's eyes are gouged out - to people with a psychotic or
psychopathic condition, whose own horrifying deeds had caused them to be
locked away.
Dr Cox demurred. 'What this is doing, I think, is opening up a safe way for
people to face unfaceable things in their inner world.'
He explained that psychotics (mostly schizophrenic) need more protection
from the real world than confrontation with it, whereas psychopaths need
both.
'Watching first-class drama is an encounter with truth of all kinds. It is
one of the great aspects of drama that it gives you the support and the
confrontation in an interesting amalgam.'
Interviewing Dr Cox, I found it impossible to pursue a straight line. His
discourse spun like a Catherine wheel and he threw off quotations from
Shakespeare and other poets like sparks. At one point, I entirely lost the
drift and apologised for the fact that we were going round in circles.
He was delighted. 'Absolutely. We go in spirals actually. Spirals are very
important. It's like therapy in some ways. You think you're going in circles
but actually you're going in spirals and you get deeper and deeper into the
material.'
Dr Cox was reticent about his own life. Apparently, it can damage a
psychiatrist's relationship with his patient if he discloses too much about
himself and, Dr Cox assured me, the Broadmoor patients would be reading the
interview.
But I learned that he read medicine at Cambridge University and was a
general practitioner for 10 years until his interest in poetry and language
and the way patients talked about themselves - the 'deictic stress' or
signalling function of their words - took him first into prison psychiatry
and then, in 1970, to Broadmoor.
Bringing Shakespeare himself to Broadmoor had been therapeutic, he said, but
it had not been designed as 'dramatherapy'.
Did you think it would be good for patients to see enactments of their own
offences? I asked.
'Yes, I did think that; but then it's good for all of us to see enactments.
This is not something special for patients here. Ibsen, for instance, is
full of the idea that there are things people just don't do. But people are
always doing things that 'people just don't do'.'
I asked about what seemed to me the obvious dangers. Are there people here
for whom seeing these plays is a mistake?
'I'm not sure you can say that. Their own defence mechanisms would on the
whole have defended them against seeing what they weren't ready to see.
There is a sense in which we are kept at a distance from what is perceivable
because it is too horrific.
'Gradually during psychotherapy and maturation and a hundred and one other
things one can gradually . . . let's go to Macbeth: I am afraid to think
what I have done. To look on't again I dare not. Or again: But when we have
our naked frailties hid, that suffer in exposure, let us meet again and
question this most bloody piece of work to know it further.'
Cox told me that many patients had televisions and could watch whatever they
wished. I asked: Including scenes of violence and rape?
'But we all know that every news bulletin has the most horrific scenes. This
is part of the web of life that we're all in and it's something that's woven
into virtually every therapeutic session here. This is the human predicament
and in a curious way one needs to undramatise a great deal of it because the
offences - it may be one act, years ago, and of course it's very serious -
are part of life too.'
Why didn't you start with Alan Ayckbourn and work up, so to speak?
'That's a very good question. It just so happened that Mark Rylance said it
would be good if we could come to Broadmoor. It was totally an accident . .
. That's a good Shakespearean word,' he mused.
But why tragedies?
'I happened to meet Mark and he happened to be playing Hamlet and Romeo that
year.'
Are there disadvantages in this experiment?
Dr. Cox pondered. 'I'm thinking of this word experiment . . . Is it an
experiment? Yes, it is . . . One negative would be if it ever became
compulsory.'
Would it be a negative if actors got a thrill out of performing in front of
a lot of homicidal maniacs?
'Those are your words, not mine. I think that would wear off very quickly.
In the workshops afterwards, both groups quickly recognised the other as
human beings and the homicidal maniac stereotype simply vanished.
Paradoxically, it was almost a de-dramatising of patients in Broadmoor and
of actors, too.'
How do you answer the charge that you are just curious to see how patients
will react, and the actors are curious to see what killers look like close
up?
'That is a charge which could be levelled and if that is the overall
impression people get, I'm sorry, but it just isn't like that. I can tell
you it just isn't so.'
At this point I used the word 'inmate' and got a severe ticking off. However
neutral the dictionary definition, at Broadmoor the word is verboten.
'This is definitely a hospital. I mean, seriously. It is a secure
psychiatric hospital and the people here are patients.'
Of course, I resumed, if you show murder on the stage to murderers it's
bound to make a big impact . . .
'But that's the point. We're not showing murder on the stage. What we are
doing is performing Hamlet. To say that is showing murder on the stage is
taking one small fragment of a hugely important drama. I'm well aware this
is an extremely important point. What you see is Shakespeare's huge
presentation of life: he's not simply demonstrating murder . . .'
There was a knock on the door and one of Dr Cox's colleagues poked her head
in to ask a question. When the door shut he asked: 'Where were we?' and
immediately plucked out another quotation, from Richard II: Where was I when
weeping made me break the story off? This led to a long and emphatic
digression, laced with quotations, on the productive accidents that can
occur during therapy sessions, on the 'existential aspect of therapy' and on
the 'paraclinical precision' of Shakespeare's poetry. Although I followed
his every word, the purpose of Dr Cox's digression quite escaped me.
I steered him back to the subject. Are some people too disturbed to benefit
from Shakespeare?
'It's a huge question. It depends on the perspective from which he or she
sees the world: that will fluctuate as it does for all of us. For example,
someone will see Hamlet stabbing Polonius and might easily say: 'that's
nothing to do with my life, that's simply an actor stabbing another actor.'
The person sitting beside might say: 'that stabbing is exactly like what I
did, except I stabbed a young man not an old man like Polonius.''
Does all this mean that once patients can distinguish between fantasy and
reality with the help of drama, they are cured and can be trusted to go out
into the world?
'No, it certainly doesn't. Drama is a generic human encounter. Patients have
to be treated as appropriate. There must be other signs of a more integrated
life, evident on the playing fields or in the workshop.
'Everything I say about the therapeutic aspects of drama must be seen not as
replacing, but supplementing, conventional clinical approaches, such as
psychotherapy, medication. That's very important.'
As he escorted me back to the gate of Broadmoor, and suspecting I had missed
something vital, I asked Dr. Cox to explain again the purpose of his
digression. I still didn't understand his reply.
But what I did understand, even as I felt the relief of crossing back into
the real world, was his fascination with the human mind - normal, poetic, or
deranged. Perhaps it is only by getting to grips with madness that we can
come to terms with the dreadful deeds of mankind. And that, after all, is
what Shakespeare was all about.

BULLY for George Bush, and bully for Boris Yeltsin. The scale of their
latest arms reduction pact, Start 2, is generous enough to bring tears to
the eyes. But I was in for a shock when I studied the small print of this
week's news stories detailing the extent of Britain's nuclear arsenal and
explaining that its nuclear deterrent was unaffected by Start 1 or 2.
Apparently, Britain has 192 nuclear warheads at present, and will increase
this to as many as 512 warheads under the Trident submarine programme.
Perhaps this is commonly known. But I was not aware of the numbers.
According to one defence correspondent: 'By the time Start 2 (has been)
implemented in 2003, those 512 warheads will represent about 15 per cent of
the total number of warheads across the whole spectrum of American strategic
nuclear weapons. . . Trident's raison d'etre is still principally to help
counterbalance the former Soviet strategic arsenal, to deter would-be
blackmailers and to keep Britain's place as one of the five permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council.'
This seems to me outrageous. What business has Britain got with 512 nuclear
warheads, or playing tit-for-tat with hypothetical 'blackmailers', or
clutching, like a drunken dowager, to the illusion of power via permanent
membership of the UN Security Council?
In my view, there should be a referendum, the result of which, I am sure,
would be a call by the populace for the immediate cancellation of most of
those warheads. One of the reasons that I was attracted by Ross Perot's US
presidential candidature last year was his fascination with teledemocracy,
electronic town halls, on-line voting, real-time decision-making by voters.
Perot, like me, believes in power for the people.
The UK Establishment - not just Laurel and Hardy, but all the other
comedians - hate referenda. Presumably, they hate the populace, are afraid
to consult it directly.
(I do not count general elections. They are held too infrequently, under
rough and ready rules, and are as useless as opinion polls, if you ask my
opinion.)
What we need are frequent referenda on topics large and small. To kick
things along, I am reviving my plan to launch the British Board of
Referenda. Ross Perot will be its first life president. Security will be in
the hands of his boys from Dallas.
We shall hold a referendum at least once a week, possibly in tandem with the
national lottery. Excitement is guaranteed. Voting will be obligatory. The
government will be instructed (by the populace) to enact necessary
legislative changes within four working days.
I have consulted Ross Perot. It is our belief that many improvements to our
national life could be achieved quite quickly. The populace will be asked if
it wants to:
1) Sack Norman Lamont, then ponder which other government ministers should
be pensioned off because of decrepitude, weariness or hubris. (Michael
Heseltine, for example, scores three out of three.)
2) Sack most of the shadow cabinet. Their performance, if anything, is worse
than the government's.
3) Appoint Paddy Ashdown ambassador to Bosnia, Serbia, Scotland or Fiji.
4) Sack a Treasury mandarin a day until there are unequivocal signs of
profound economic healing. This idea was suggested last summer by Teresa
Gorman, a Tory MP, and then endorsed by hairy-chested pundit Anatole
Kaletsky and by Hawks &amp; Handsaws. Gorman to receive a Pounds 5,000 cash
payment for all-round gumption; Kaletsky and H &amp; H Pounds 2,500 each.
5) Reduce, at a stroke, the number of British nuclear warheads to five, and
specify their targets. For example, one could be targeted on Bonn, to
concentrate German minds. A second could be pointed at Paris. A third could
be aimed at Sainsbury, to make it clear that none of us is fooled by its
current chicken-feed price reductions, and to encourage the supermarket
giants to make deep and lasting price cuts instead of bleeding us all white.
That leaves two warheads for emergencies.
6) Bring back capital punishment.
7) Fine the Queen Pounds 500m in back taxes, set Prince Charles aside, and
name Princess Diana next in succession.
That would just be scratching the surface. The enfeeblement of Britain has
gone too far. Steps must be taken. Ross Perot and I will be in touch with
you shortly.

IT was the traditional marching song of British troops when fighting in some
godforsaken spot about which they knew nothing and cared less: 'We're here
because we're here.' Although no reporter has captured such a song on the
lips of the British troops involved in Operation Grapple in Bosnia, this is
probably only because it is too dangerous there to march in formation.
Although the predicament of the US troops in Somalia is slightly less
terrifying, I am equally sure that the privates or 'grunts' will be humming
a similar tune in their prefabricated barracks around Mogadishu. Both the
British and the US troops are at the painfully sharp end of a strange
experiment in western foreign policy. This is the application of military
force, and the inevitable spilling of western soldiers' blood, in regions
where the west has no discernible strategic or political interest. Instead,
we are told, there is a pressing moral need to intervene, to save one group
of people or another from possible starvation and certain ruin.
The Cold War, it is true, was always described by the west in moral terms -
President John F Kennedy spoke of paying any price in the pursuit and
defence of liberty - but the real motivation was not moral, but
self-preservatory: the west believed, in my view correctly, that it was the
intention of the Soviet Union to subvert its political systems and security.
Similarly, the British declaration of war against Germany in 1939 is often
seen as a moral crusade, whereas Britain entered the war with reluctance,
when it was finally clear that Germany was bent on destroying the balance of
power in Europe, the very basis of long-term British foreign policy.
As for the US, like the USSR, it waited until it was attacked militarily,
before entering the second world war. It would be similarly erroneous to
imagine that the old Allies' reconstitution to fight Saddam Hussein was a
decision determined by a scrutiny of its collective conscience.
Britain, France and the US had supported the Iraqi dictator militarily, not
because they did not know what he was doing to his own people, but because
he was seen as a secular bulwark against the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism. Then he made a grab for the world's most prolific oil
fields, the ones we in the west most need to keep our cars on the road, and
our airplanes in the skies. In this way, and only in this way, Saddam
became, I think rightly, our enemy.
Because the west still think the Iraqi dictator has ambitions in this
direction, it is threatening him over a 'no fly' zone. It is an illusion to
think that hearts in Foggy Bottom and King Charles Street are bleeding over
the plight of the Marsh Arabs who live in the zone. But there is no
practical argument behind the sending of British troops to Bosnia. Arguably,
if all the west is after is security in the region, it should give the Serbs
a free hand to carve out discrete ethnic areas in the former Yugoslavia,
however repulsive their methods.
The intervention is, as it claims to be, purely humanitarian, which is why
the Foreign Office is so uneasy and hesitant in its handling of the affair:
it has been dragged by a section of public opinion into a place where it
would rather not be. I suspect the same attitude of misgiving must pervade
the State Department over the exposure of 30,000 US troops in Somalia. But
George Bush decided that food must get through to women and children who
were starving.
How were they starving? On peak-time US television, that's how. And where
could John Major see the emaciated frames of Bosnians captured by the Serbs?
On British television, that's where. So now we know what the British and
American troops will be chanting in Bosnia and Somalia: 'We're here because
the networks are here.'

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Schiff's Schubert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INCREASED attractiveness of the Wigmore Hall as a venue and the
publicity it has received since its re-opening have combined to create a
powerful draw for audiences. The first major series of the year is Andras
Schiff's cycle of Schubert's Piano Sonatas and even before the first
programme on Wednesday, all seats had been sold for the entire series.
Schiff has long been faithful to the Wigmore Hall and its audiences respond
in kind. The unshowy musicianship that marks his performances of the
classics would seem to make him a natural resident of an intimate hall like
this. But there can be surprises. I vividly recall a recital at the Maggio
Musicale in Florence a few years ago, when the pianist attacked Beethoven's
'Hammerklavier' sonata as if he was dealing out a punishment.
His Schubert is by no means a shy or demure visitor either. Those who enjoy
this pianist's lyrical playing of Bach and Mozart may not expect to find him
among the toughest interpreters when he comes to Schubert's Piano Sonatas.
We are a long way from the dreamy tenderness that cocoons the Schubert
performances of Radu Lupu, for example, or the classical poise of Maurizio
Pollini.
In each of the opening sonatas - a pair of unfinished works in E Minor
(D566) and C Major (D840) - Schiff fiercely announced his readiness to
address the music's dramatic outbursts head-on. In the C Major, in
particular, there was an unsmiling dogmatic side to the playing, which would
rise to a noisy plateau of hammered chords, where the music often lost its
sense of forward movement. Tender moments came as a respite from the attack,
not a permanent ceasefire.
Each of the six programmes will conclude with one of the later sonatas. On
Wednesday it was the A Minor (D845). Again, this was a strong and dramatic
reading, although the softer elements of the music were now better
integrated, showing how a pianist of Schiff's stature can marvellously light
upon new colours in what may look a monochrome passage on the page. Only
with the finale was the demon fully let loose, whipping up percussive
rhythms in the closing bars that presaged Bartok or Stravinsky.
The Wigmore's new Bosendorfer piano continues to play its part, bringing a
more transparent texture to the thickest handfuls of chords. An encore of
one of the unfinished sonata movements also suggests that this powerful
cycle could turn out still more complete than advertised.
Series continues through to January 23 (Box Office 071-935)

FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Paris hosts 'Die Brucke' - William Packer reviews the
German Expressionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE manifold isms of art history, convenient as they undoubtedly are, are
also deceptive to a fault. I remember the late Vera Russell, the formidable
doyenne of London's art world, shaking me by the throat at a private view
and, in reference to a protege of hers whom I had lately so described,
hissing into my ear 'she is not Expressionist at all: Expressionists are
German.'
It is salutary sometimes to be reminded of what she meant by so narrow a
view, and Figures du Moderne at the Musee d'Art Moderne offers just such a
moment, in splendid and comprehensive fashion. Its subject is the work of
the avant-garde of Dresden, Munich and Berlin between 1905 and 1914, clearly
centred upon the two principle groups, Die Brucke (the Bridge) and Der Blaue
Reiter (the Blue Rider), taken in turn, with the former rightly given the
weightier emphasis.
In 1905, in Dresden, the young artists of Die Brucke - Kirchner,
Schmidt-Rotluff, Heckel and their friends - declared it their aim 'to
attract all the revolutionary and surging elements - that is what the name
signifies', with a social and political engagement that distinguished them
at that time from their contemporaries (although a period of more pertinent
expression would come with the First World War and its aftermath). What we
find here is the earlier formal development through through radical
technical adventure, and imagery that is anxious, psychological, sexual,
urban, dislocated.
Der Blaue Reiter, a looser grouping, came later, in Munich around 1911,
apolitical and more painterly in its interests and, in the comparative
serenity of its expression, ironically so much closer in spirit to the
Fauves, the wild beasts of Paris of those few years before, than to the
engages of Die Brucke. Here were Klee and Macke on their North African
travels, Marc with his prismatic formalism and zoological romanticism,
Kandinsky in uninhibited transition from landscape into abstraction,
Jawlensky with his chromatic intensity, and each one the more impressive
taken on his own.
But as much is true of all of them, with the isolated and disturbed Ludwig
Meidner the perfect model, whose apocalyptic landscapes and drunken cities
of 1913 are extraordinary previsions of the devastation so soon to come. And
yet how beautiful they now seem - which again may be said of Kirchner's
streets and cabarets, Jawlensky's heads, Heckel's landscapes, Pechstein's
nudes, Schmidt-Rotluff's trees, of Nolde, Klee, Kandinsky and the rest of
them. How strange it is, that so much of the radical work of early modernism
that we found so harsh and difficult even 20 years ago - cubism, futurism,
fauvism etc. - now appears so substantial, assured, and beautifully done
Yet the question remains as obscure as ever: what is Expressionism? Not,
surely, the expression of ideas and emotions through the medium of imagery
alone, but through the direct, intuitive application of the paint itself,
perhaps, and its physical presence upon the canvas? Perhaps. Munch had had
his first controversial show in Berlin in 1892. Van Gogh died in 1890. By
1905 Gauguin had long since gone to the South Seas, the Vienna Secession
been and gone. Art was well-travelled, fin de siecle, and zeitgeist a
general phenomenon.
*****
Elsewhere, the enviable redevelopment of the Louvre continues, with
excavations now deep into the foundations of the old Palace of the
Tuileries. And to temper our impatience, a mere 39 new rooms have now been
hung and opened in that part of the Louvre so long the preserve of the
French Ministry of Finance. Thirty-nine galleries would double our Tate or
National Gallery, and still our civil servants blockade the greater part of
Somerset House.
The enclosed Cour Carree, one of the great rediscovered public spaces of
Europe, has been for some months now a short-cut from the Pont des Arts
through to the Louvre and the Palais Royal. Now it is to be enjoyed as much
from the inside, where the French painting of the 17th, 18th and 19th
centuries now fills each flank of the court. All of Watteau, Chardin,
Boucher, Fragonard, Robert, David, Ingres, Gericault, Delacroix, Corot - and
all to be savoured in peace, far from the tourist cacophony of the Grande
Galerie. The Louvre takes more of our time than ever.

FT  09 JAN 93 / How To Spend It: Shoppers' chance to buy more than they had
bargained for - The best sale bargain is perhaps obtained by blowing all you
have to spend on one special, timeless item
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SASHA JENSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF IT is January, it is sale time. The rush is on, the stores are full.
Britons all over the country are taking part in the annual ritual of
scrummaging through the rails for the magic garment, the must-have
accessory, in the hope that it comes into that elusive category known as a
bargain.
But perhaps this is the year to rethink your strategy. Instead of homing in
on the cheap and cheerful, of coming away with a handful of garments that
are quite good value but not very special, why not blow all you have to
spend on something truly special?
Adopt some inverse psychology. Be prepared to spend more than usual. Go to
the shops with the idea of buying something that will last you a lifetime,
something special, something timeless that you will treasure. If you get it
right, the pleasure of wearing it will be with you long after you have
forgotten how much it cost.
Imagine that you were to spend up to Pounds 1,000 or even more on just one
item which, every time you put it on, made you feel wonderful. It could be a
longed-for coat with swish and swagger, an evening dress that could take you
anywhere or a knock-out day-time suit.
Take coats. The Loewe sale, at 130 New Bond Street, for instance, is full of
unique designs. The most striking include a suede swing coat with fox fur
collar, new-buck leather and Loewe emblem buttons, reduced to Pounds 1,113
from Pounds 1,590. Then there is a lambskin, three-quarter length wrap coat
with belt, similar to suede on the outside with soft fur on the inside, now
Pounds 1,245 reduced from Pounds 1,780 - soft as butter, light as air, made
from all one skin in honey, rose pink or chocolate brown. Or there is a silk
puffa three-quarter length coat, with a fox fur collar - something you could
dress up or down for any occasion and reduced to Pounds 756 from Pounds
1,080. And last but not least, the double-breasted 100 per cent cashmere
coat with velvet collar that at Pounds 860 reduced from Pounds 1,720 seems
like real investment dressing.
Aquascutum in Regent Street has its sale now in full swing and also offers a
range of its seasonless tweed coats with raglan sleeves - they have a
slightly flared fit without any pleats or vents at the back and are now
Pounds 275, reduced from Pounds 475. There are some pure wool,
double-breasted red coats with flat gilt buttons and raglan sleeves reduced
from Pounds 349 to Pounds 250.
For Callaghan fans, Liberty of Regent Street has a three-quarter length
cashmere and wool coat designed by Romeo Gigli in midnight blue only, with
revere collars and beaded cuffs, reduced from Pounds 769 to Pounds 384.
One stunning evening or cocktail dress can do wonders for the morale. There
must have been a time when you have peered into your wardrobe and discovered
that you have nothing to wear. The acquisition of one beautiful dress can
solve the problem. Yves Saint Laurent at 135, Bond Street, for example, has
a wide selection, the most eye-catching being a consummate long, black
velvet and silk evening dress with sash: reduced from Pounds 1,030 to Pounds
395.
Next door to YSL, Valentino is taking 60 per cent off evening wear from
previous seasons' collections and between 40 and 50 per cent off this
winter's collection. There is, for instance, a brown linen and black silk
evening dress with a large bow that sits just below the neckline and
suitable for any dinner or formal function.
Alternatively, if you prefer a dress with a touch more daring, there is a
black silk and velvet number with a back button fastening. Both are reduced
from Pounds 1,100 to Pounds 440 and either would add class to any wardrobe.
Ralph Lauren of 143 New Bond Street begins its sale today. Here there is an
evening dress worth blowing the budget for - a black tulip split, strapless
cotton and silk affair from the New York collection which has 50 per cent
off, reduced from Pounds 940 to Pounds 485. There is also a plain silk,
strapless, bodice-hooked dress, with a satin strip down the side, which was
Pounds 335 and is now Pounds 234.50, a worthwhile reduction of 30 per cent.
The Harrods sale started on Wednesday and it is worth getting there as soon
as you can. For those who move in seriously dressy circles, it has a full,
multi-colour sequinned, above-the-knee sleeveless number with a scoop neck
by Oleg Cassini, reduced to Pounds 199 from Pounds 349. There is a
full-length version with fewer sequins for those who prefer a less dramatic
style, down from Pounds 649 to Pounds 389.
Finally, for that special evening that we all hope for - a Ben Di Lisi
crushed velvet, full-length column dress with buttons from the centre of the
neck-line to the ankle, reduced from Pounds 399 to Pounds 199.
Lastly, something elegant for the day. YSL have some marvellous reductions
on their suits. For instance, a black and white dog-tooth check,
single-breasted wool blazer which was Pounds 1,135 is now Pounds 717. It has
a plain skirt to match that falls just under the knee - down from Pounds 285
to Pounds 185. There are some pin-stripe wool suits with wide lapels and
bold silver buttons with skirts to match: reduced from Pounds 1,070 to
Pounds 642.
Ralph Lauren stock some definitive suits, most of which are reduced by 30
per cent: a sage coloured, twill wool, simple but spruce single-breasted
jacket, which was Pounds 440 is now Pounds 308 - matching trousers are
reduced from Pounds 195 to Pounds 130.50, while the matching above-the-knee
skirt is Pounds 80.50, reduced from Pounds 115.
For those who love the archetypal dog-tooth check, Ralph Lauren also has a
range of double-breasted, hacking style jackets at Pounds 346.50, down from
Pounds 495, with a skirt to match reduced from Pounds 130 to Pounds 91.
Byblos, another great label often beyond one's reach in normal times, has
some honey-check, wool, single-breasted jackets with patch pockets in
Harrods sale - down to Pounds 265 from Pounds 365. There is a co-ordinating
pair of blonde-coloured ski-pants which flatter the jacket at Pounds 195,
down to Pounds 115.
Marella at Harvey Nichols offers a charming, tuxedo-like suit with a
single-breasted blazer in 100 per cent virgin wool, with shiny jet buttons
and a matching knee-length skirt with a slit at the back (Pounds 145 from
Pounds 290).

Lucia van der Post tracks down some unusual and inexpensive items for around

NO REAL New Yorker, they say, ever buys retail. Shopping for discounts, for
bargains, for end-lines, is a city sport and one that New Yorkers seem
singularly well-equipped to play. Here bargain-time is a moveable feast and
the best of the prizes go to the fleet of foot.
For those in an economical mood, suffering from what my son calls
Post-Purchase Depression, now is as good a time as any to stock up on some
of the things you need for hearth and home.
The Curtain Exchange, for those who have not yet discovered it, is well
worth visiting if you are in the market for curtains, blinds and other
fabric accessories. The company sells top quality, second-hand curtains at
good prices and the branch I have visited (133 Stephendale Road, London SW6)
always seems to have a vast range in a wide variety of styles. It has just
opened its tenth shop in Parbold, Lancashire, but for details of your
nearest branch you should telephone 071-731-8316.
Crucial Trading of 77 Westbourne Park Road, London W2 and 4 St Barnabas
Street, Pimlico Green, London SW1, always a good source of splendid,
relatively inexpensive floor coverings made from seagrass, jute, sisal and
coir, and now has a sale in which some of the ranges are reduced by 25 per
cent and more.
It also has two splendid new ranges of floor-coverings - co-ordinated
runners, broadlooms and borders in jute in sophisticated colours at Pounds
9.99 a square yard (Pounds 11.95 a square metre) and some pure wool
flatweave carpeting in white, beige, pale chestnut, pale green, dusty pink
and yellow at Pounds 20.75 a square yard (Pounds 24.75 a square metre).
Kingcome Sofas of 302-304 Fulham Road, London SW10, makers of luxury sofas,
are offering 20 per cent off all their designs - sofas are made to
individual measurements and design and there is 20 per cent off the fabric
as well.
Global Village, purveyors of astutely-gauged ethnic furniture and
furnishings to sophisticated Westerners, is offering 33 per cent off all its
stock and 75 per cent off some of it. There are now 11 shops, including the
main one at 4-5 Queen Street, Bath, and the London one at 247-249 Fulham
Road, London SW3.
Finally, if you do not have the stamina for the sales and prefer to do your
shopping in the year-round factory shops and cut-price stores, it would
probably be worth your while taking out an annual subscription to The Good
Deal Directory.
Published 10 times a year, it lists most of the 1,300 factory shops selling
everything from designer clothing by such names as Nicole Farhi, Janet
Reger, Burberry and La Perla, to cut-price carpets by Axminster, china by
Royal Doulton, and fabrics by well-known names.
It also lists the annual charity sales and the dress agencies selling
nearly-new clothing by designers ranging from Chanel to Valentino.
The Good Deal Directory costs Pounds 15 from The Value for Money Company
Limited, Freepost (SW 6037), London SW10 9YY or order by telephone on
071-352-8976.

FT  09 JAN 93 / How To Spend It: Craftsmen's way out of the woods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HARDLY needs saying that craftsmen today are hungry for work and so there
could hardly be a better time to think about commissioning something
special. Order times at the moment are shorter than ever, designers keener
and ever-more ingenious at finding ways of keeping quality up and prices
down.
Two workshops that anybody in need of an unusual piece might find worth
investigating are Rhode Design and Simon Stocker. Rhode Design's new range,
The Boston Collection, (above) is based on the American country look and is
well priced. The shelving unit on the right, for instance, is Pounds 275
(ready-painted and including VAT) while the sideboard is Pounds 475 and the
blue and gold cotton rug or 'throw', 4ft by 6ft, is Pounds 55.
Although these pieces can be seen and bought at Rhode Design's showroom at
86 Stoke Newington Church Street, London N16 OAP, (Tel: 071-275-8261), the
workshop's speciality is furniture made to special order.
Some readers may remember its Shaker-inspired kitchen collection which was
featured last year. A hand-made, specially designed kitchen, painted in the
colours of your choice (it has a marvellous range of traditional earth
pigment paints) can be had for roughly the same price as an off-the-peg
kitchen from one of the multiples.
As well as making to order anything a customer fancies, Rhode Design also
stocks a limited range of furniture which Brian Innes, the artist, has
embellished with his painting. Other pieces can be painted to order.
Simon Stocker, whose dressing-table and stool in American ash is
photographed left, also makes furniture to order. He has found that, in
these tough times, budgets are smaller and more carefully considered. As a
result, Stocker has devised simpler, less expensive ways of producing fine
work. He is, for instance, building a kitchen using plywood and he has found
that by cutting an edge off at an angle he can produce decorative handles.
'It is simple and it is cheap,' he says. 'One of the things more and more
customers are looking for.'
Although he works mainly in wood, glass and metal are sometimes
incorporated. Contact Stocker Furniture, 191-197 Archway Road, London N6
5BN, Tel: 081-341-7322.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Sport: Imperious Lara knocks Border's plans into a spin -
Kevin Brown watches some myths debunked in Sydney / Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the third consecutive year, the annual Test match at the Sydney Cricket
Ground faded into a draw, but not without destroying a couple of
long-standing myths.
By the time Brian Lara wrapped up the match on Wednesday afternoon with a
couple of overs of wobbly leg-spin - including a googly which the hapless
Mark Taylor failed to pick up - Australia and the West Indies had racked up
1,226 runs, in spite of frequent interruptions for rain. It was a
heart-stirring display batting exhibition, which included six 50s and three
centuries, capped by Lara's imperious 277, widely lauded as one of the best
knocks ever seen at Sydney.
For those with a taste for history (which means almost all cricket watchers)
it conjured up images of the golden age of batting between the wars, when
Bradman and Ponsford, Hammond and Sutcliffe piled up so many towering
scores. Lara's innings, in particular, announced the arrival of a great
talent, fit to be spoken of in the same breath as masters such as Sir
Garfield Sobers and Vivian Richards. After Lara passed 250, when it seemed
almost impossible that any of the toiling Australian bowlers could remove
him, Sobers' record Test score of 365 not out (against Pakistan at Kingston
in 1957) seemed doomed to fall. Fittingly, it took a brilliant run out by
Damian Martyn to send the modest 23-year-old back to the pavilion and a
standing ovation they must have heard in Trinidad.
Lara's achievement was all the more astonishing given the circumstances in
which it was made. The West Indians came to Sydney one down in the five
match series, having drawn in Brisbane and lost in Melbourne (mostly because
of their abysmal catching.) After losing the toss, captain Richie Richardson
watched Alan Border's Australians score 503 for nine declared, followed by
the rapid removal of Desmond Haynes, the veteran West Indies opener, and
Phil Simmonds, a heroic centurion in Melbourne. Richardson and Lara came
together at 31 for two, facing what seemed like certain defeat. They parted
at 324 for three, when Richardson mistimed a pull shot off the big-hearted
trundler Merv Hughes and was caught in the deep for 109. From there, it was
all downhill for Australia as Keith Arthurton chipped in with 47, and Jimmy
Adams with a painstaking 77 not out.
It was, of course, not supposed to happen that way. Australia's game plan
was built on two beliefs about the West Indies which have acquired the
status of received truths: they cannot play spin, and their heads drop when
things are going badly.
Border's team had two specialist slow bowlers, and Peter Leroy, the Sydney
groundsman, prepared a brown strip which looked guaranteed to uphold the
SCG's reputation as a spinners' paradise.
Richardson, relying on all-rounders Adams and Carl Hooper for spin, could
only echo fast bowler Ian Bishop's plaintive cry of 'Where's the grass?'
when he saw the pitch. Richardson was too polite to say so, but he will not
have failed to notice that the West Indies pace attack has been blunted by
grassless wickets in all three Tests so far. This may not be in Australia's
long term interests, since the next Australian tourists in the Caribbean are
likely to find themselves batting (or more likely ducking) on the greenest
wickets they have ever seen. But it did appear, when the captains walked out
on Saturday, that all Border had to do was win the toss and score as many
first innings runs as possible before unleashing his spinners on a crumbling
wicket.
Border duly won the toss, and Australia got what looked like enough runs,
thanks partly to a sparkling 100 from Steve Waugh. But the script went wrong
when Richardson and Lara, refusing to bow to seemingly inevitable defeat,
treated Greg Matthews' flat off breaks and Shane Warne's more flighted leg
spin with equal disdain. The manner of the result will give great heart to
Richardson's young team, which is rebuilding after the recent retirements of
stalwarts like Richards, Gordon Greenidge, Jeff Dujon and Michael Holding.
Wes Hall, the fast bowler who played for the West Indies in the 1960s,
watched part of the match and was moved to comparisons with Clive Lloyd's
inexperienced 1975 / 76 team, which was thrashed 5-1 in Australia but went
on to become undisputed world champions.
The experience will have been less uplifting for the Australians, and it
must have been particularly difficult for Warne, who finished with one
wicket for 116 off 41 overs - his single scalp the wicket of the struggling
Hooper, who continues to promise more than he delivers. However, Warne may
benefit in the long run if his failure lowers the expectations raised by his
seven for 52 in Melbourne. That performance made him the latest candidate
for the mantle of Clarrie Grimmett, the best in a long line of match-winning
Australian leg-spinners the last of whom was Richie Benaud in the 1960s.
Warne did not bowl badly in Sydney, and at the age of 23 he has plenty of
time to perfect the leg-spinner's art, perhaps the most difficult in the
cricketing lexicon. Already, for example, he is sufficiently confident to
bowl the 'flipper,' a delivery which Grimmett practised for 10 years before
he dared bowl it in a Test.
However, Sydney has raised two big question marks about the slow men: will
Warne's promise fade on less accommodating pitches in New Zealand and
England later this year; and why does the West Indies no longer produce
spinners of the calibre of Lance Gibbs, Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine?
The first question will be answered soon enough; the second seems destined
to remain a mystery.
The teams move on to Adelaide and Perth with the West Indians requiring one
victory to even the series and retain the Sir Frank Worrall trophy. Both
venues are likely to offer more pace and bounce than the lifeless Sydney
pitch, giving hope to the West Indies that their quick bowlers can finally
match the increasingly confident batsmen. The Australians, deprived once
again of the injury-prone Bruce Reid, will be hoping for further fireworks
from Warne. But they may be hard pressed to hold off the resurgent visitors.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Sport: Old-fashioned friends at the Park - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF I had a penny for every time I was asked to name my favourite golf course
then I could probably afford to buy a new set of woods, a dozen balls and
have a few pence left. No one, however, wants to know which is my favourite
rugby club. So since you won't ask, I will tell you. It is Rosslyn Park.
Geography has nothing to do with it. I live in north-east London; Rosslyn
Park are in south-west London. It has more to do with where I feel most
comfortable. Harlequins are too smart, Blackheath not quite good enough and
Wasps are difficult to find, out there, somewhere, in north-west London.
Besides, I always feel uneasy as I pass in the lee of Wembley, a stadium I
associate with soccer.
Someone once said that love is blind and friendship closes its eyes. I am
blind to Rosslyn Park's faults. The pitch has a slope and parking is poor,
inadequate for the days when Leicester, Northampton and Bath arrive with
their coach loads of supporters yelling 'oggy, oggy, oggy'. But in the grand
scheme of things does this matter? They do the best after-match sandwiches
of any first-class club, serve the strongest cups of tea and the warmth of
their welcome has to be experienced to be believed.
Sadly Rosslyn Park are tumbling down the leagues faster than a man sliding
on a patch of ice. Relegated from the first to the second division last
season, they are now in imminent danger of falling in to the third division.
Why is this?
A simple answer might be old-fashioned morals. They will not pay players nor
are they prepared to offer the sort of financial incentives available at
other clubs: cars, help with mortgages, that sort of thing. Players join
other first-class clubs and use them as a flag of convenience. They stay a
while, give of their best and then leave. These men are the gigolos of the
game. Not to put too fine a point on it, they are bought.
It is rather different at Rosslyn Park where the players receive only
legitimate expenses and must pay an annual subscription of Pounds 60 and buy
their own club ties.
Rosslyn Park have some similarities with the Jesuits. Once they have got
you, they have got you for life. I had not been to Priory Road for at least
a decade when I went to watch Rosslyn Park play Northampton in 1991. Yet the
moment I entered the ground and walked past the small wooden hut where the
programmes were on sale and tickets had to be bought, it was as if I had
never been away.
Rivulets of beer slid over the clubhouse floor and discarded crisp packets
floated on them. Noisy supporters stood on the grass between the clubhouse
and the pitch. Beaming beatifically over this scene was Andy Ripley, the
former England number 8, wearing his famous rimless granny glasses.
Ripley was just one of the former players I came across on that and
subsequent visits to the Park. Bob Mordell, the ex-England flanker who went
to play rugby league, was back at his old club. So was Steve Tiddy, the
darting wing who leaned so far forward when he ran he looked as though he
would fall on his face.
And there in the front row of the wooden stand was the craggy-faced forward
Phil Keith-Roach, who joined Rosslyn Park when he was 13 and only stopped
playing for the club when he was 42 because he had broken his neck. As I
drove home that night I reflected that it was reassuring how little had
changed at Rosslyn Park in recent years.
'We are in a new era money-wise and in terms of amateurism and I am not sure
that we have taken to it easily or naturally,' said Keith-Roach last week by
way of explanation for Rosslyn Park's plight. 'Perhaps we have been a bit
slow off the mark. We haven't known how to play this recruitment business.
It is still a lovely club and our aims and ambitions are high. We have never
been big on expenses and freebies because we have never had the money.'
Rugby in 1993 is not the game it was in 1987. The success of two World Cups,
the rise of leagues, the irresistible surge towards the best players making
money from it, the new laws, all these have changed the game more in the
past five years than in the previous 25.
Rosslyn Park have made a distinguished contribution to rugby for more than
100 years not least in organising the national schools sevens each spring.
If the game at the highest level loses clubs with their distinctive appeal,
the game itself will be the poorer. Long may Park As Ripley, the club
chairman, said in his speech at the centenary dinner: 'Rock on chaps, rock
on.'

FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: Dracula a distant memory in rural Romania -
James Henderson finds peace and tranquillity in the hills and traditional
villages of Transylvania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a rare pleasure in Britain now to see the traffic stop to let a file
of geese cross the road. In Transylvanian villages it happens more often.
Their ungainly, overlong step gives the geese a comic waddle and they take
their time. But then life is rather less hurried in Transylvania.
I arrived in Romania in the height of summer, over the border from Hungary:
walking, hitch-hiking, riding buses, trains and tractors and - once - a
horse and cart. The sunflowers were 6ft tall and the harvest was being
collected. There is a gratifying timelessness in a scene of men and women
pitch-forking hay into rounded stacks. Half a century ago, mention of
Romania sent people running for the atlas. All it was known for was its
hardy peasant stock, gypsies and Dracula, although it was in fact one of
Europe's most successful agricultural economies.
If Romania was little known then, it has become notorious since - for the
most violent of the eastern European revolutions; for the pitiful faces of
orphans living in monstrous circumstances and for its grotesque leader,
Nicolai Ceaucescu. It was part of his unhinged vision for Romania to erase
traditional village life.
In his master-plan he would simply bulldoze centuries-old villages and move
the people into agro-industrial collectives, those hideous assemblies of
concrete tenements that cluster round cities throughout eastern Europe. In a
few years, with luck, the Romanians will remember Ceaucescu and his
master-plan only as a bad dream.
In the Mara Mures, the Carpathian uplands, the rolling hillsides are covered
with orchards and pasture and the rivers are lined with willow. I admired
all this from my perch on the wheel arch of a tractor, on which I had
hitched a bouncy 10-mile ride.
The driver dropped me at the edge of a village where I stumbled on a crowd
of women dressed in headscarves and long skirts, standing round an apple
tree, all looking up into the branches. A man was clambering about.
Periodically there was a drumming noise on the pavement as a shower of small
apples bounced on the concrete. They pressed a handful on me. Life is
simple, hard and poor. Winter must be another story, but in summer the
markets are full with vast cabbages and melons.
The Romanians are proud and rich in another sense, as a quick look at their
homes reveals. The neat farmhouses of the Mara Mures are made from timber
and overlook yards formed by barns. They are roofed with wooden tiles and
wrapped with verandas shaded by a screen of vine leaves.
The central decoration is the carved entrance gate. Two gateways sit under a
miniature tile roof - one for vehicles, one for people - and they are carved
with devotional care.
A kaleidoscopic explosion of diamonds, hearts, beading and interlocking
arrows leads out from the centre, like a rose window. At the edges, some are
finished in rustic, saw-toothed simplicity, but others run in an elaborate
series of kiss-curls and cresting waves. Elsewhere rope motifs are rolled
like thick plaits of hair.
These elaborate gates are still being carved. When they are newly glazed
they are as attractive as a harvest festival display.
I caught a lift with a pair of Hungarian honeymooners. Close to the
Ukrainian border, passing little herds of sheep that huddled together, heads
down for shade, we came to the town of Sapinta, famed for its mayor who was
quick to throw out all the communists after the revolution. It is also known
for its graveyard, the Merry Cemetery.
The orthodox crosses on the graves are decorated with bright illustrations.
Here there is a milkmaid, there a forester and there the sad story of a
four-year-old girl run over by a car. The style is naive and schematic.
At the end of the day we arrived in the town of Sighetu Marmatiei, as the
harvesters plodded heavily into town, their scythes and rakes hung over
their shoulders. After a quick meal in which we were joined by the local
boozer (unfortunately he spoke enough of every European language to say
cheers and be incoherently boring), we made a break and went in search of
somewhere to stay.
We tried all the hotels and guest houses - nothing. The last two beds in the
town turned out to be in a 'mini-hotel', and were both in the same room.
Gradually, I realised what I was letting myself in for.
It would be the first time I had shared a room with honeymooners, that was
for sure. But they had it all arranged and we were installed before I could
say: 'Oh, don't worry about me, I'll wander off to the next town in the dead
of night.' So I made a couple of comments about being a heavy sleeper,
ostentatiously put in some earplugs and turned to face the wall. Next
morning they treated me to breakfast.
Travelling south, I came to the heartland of Transylvania: whole valleys of
vines and fields of maize. The farmhouses changed style and were now made of
plastered brick with patterned beams inlaid, painted bright colours. For a
while, they affected little turrets, like minarets, but these soon vanished.
The vine-screened balconies remained, however, as did the wells: weighted,
angled poles with long necks are dipped to collect the water.
For the first time I saw Romanian gypsies, or rather I heard them, for an
uproar came from around the corner. Two women were screaming at each other
and gathering their skirts for a set-to. Gypsy skirts are fuller and more
brightly decorated than the ethnic Romanians' and suit their fiery
temperament.
The menfolk sat dispassionately by, in long boots, breeches and waistcoats,
only intervening when the argument developed into an all-out fight.
I could not work out the cause of the row, but a moment later the woman who
had lost the fight returned with a man carrying a pathetic human shape. He
laid the bundle of clothes on the ground and she took care of him as they
waited for a bus. She fanned the sick man and then, to my surprise, rifled
through his pockets and took a couple of notes. Then I hopped on a horse and
cart and learnt no more about the saga.
I found myself sitting among a Romanian family on the way back from the
fields for lunch. There must have been four generations present, fresh-faced
seven-year-olds and their tanned, stubble-chinned uncles. A dog ran like a
scout about 30 yards ahead, clearing the ground for them. They stopped and
joined a crowd of other farmers who were resting under a tree. The sun was
at its highest.
They looked at me in mild surprise when I set off between the fields of
neatly-trained hops. And well they might have. No doubt they do not see many
Englishmen walk off into the midday sun. I chuckled and quietly resolved to
keep a close eye on the dog, which was trotting beside me.
Through fields of wheat and tobacco overflown by birds of prey, I reached
the hilltop town of Sigisoara. Emerging from a spooky covered wooden
stairway into medieval streets, I was surprised to be addressed in German. A
little crowd of ladies was sitting outside a neat townhouse. We chatted for
a while. They were ethnic Germans whose families had lived in Romania for
centuries.
I ate in a place they recommended, offered with a lugubrious chuckle - the
Vlad Dracul. The restaurant is set in the house where Dracula himself was
supposed to have been born. I had forgotten about Dracula and Transylvania.
I might have expected ghostly shadows at noon and craven peasants scuttling
around, but the only sense of foreboding I had on my trip was a large number
of single magpies. Dracula seems about as far from Transylvania as the mad
Ceaucescu's plans.
Instead, my memories are of a crowd of schoolboys illicitly stripping a plum
tree and a large crowd of carts and people around the village threshing
machine . . . and nearly being thrown out of a tractor trailer as it bounced
to a halt to let a file of geese cross the road.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: A resort much maligned - Arnold Wilson discovers
that, in spite of its image, Les Menuires has a lot to offer the serious
skier / Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEO LACROIX, ski racer and ski maker extraordinaire, put it in a nutshell:
'When I was racing in America and people asked me where I came from, they
said Les Menuires sounded like a huge pile of steaming manure.'
Regine Jay-Grillot, the resort's public relations director, who has quite a
task on her hands, agrees there is a problem. 'The English have difficulty
with the word 'Menuires,'' she says. The French Olympic resort
unquestionably has an image problem, even though the locals gallantly refer
to it as 'the smile on the face of the three valleys'.
'Hideous assembly of apartment blocks,' (Filofax's Skiing Travel File) and
'one of the ugliest blots on the alpine landscape' (The Good Skiing Guide)
are among the least kind descriptions, albeit both written by the same man.
If you throw in the unfortunate-sounding name, you start to wonder whether
Les Menuires will ever be taken seriously, especially when its neighbours
are as chic as Courchevel or as easy-on-the-ear - and eye - as St Martin de
Belleville.
Well, my daughters, who arrived here for a family holiday with all kinds of
misapprehensions and forebodings, say we have got it wrong.
I am not going to pretend that since my last visit the least attractive of
the Trois Vallees has turned from ugly duckling into white swan. But the
valley is, after all, part of the most extensive ski area in the world which
encompasses almost limitless permutations of supremely good skiing.
Lucy Dicker, of Touralp, who had the daunting task of organising the British
University Ski Championships in Les Menuires this month, is often heard to
say: 'Les Menuires is quite lovable really.'
Well, she would say that. But my daughters agree with her. But with day
after day of cloudless blue skies, excellent snow and superb skiing, Les
Menuires can seem quite attractive.
The new-found friendliness, encouraged during last February's Olympics,
still lingers. On my first day I needed to get from the satellite village of
Reberty-les Bruyeres to the Menuires nerve centre at Le Croisette to pick up
my lift pass. But, without the pass, how could I persuade a surly
lift-operator to let me on to the local lift in order to make the journey on
skis rather than walking or catching a navette?
The first lift operator I approached not only gave me permission to use the
chairlift, but also explained that I might have difficulty finding my way
because it involved taking two more chairs before I would be high enough to
cut across - so why not take the gondola? The prospect of finding two French
lift operators prepared to be kind seemed optimistic. But the man checking
lift passes at the gondola was equally helpful and off I went.
Ten years ago, when I had a similar problem in Tignes during a tour of the
Tarentaise, a stubborn, lantern-jawed lift operator refused me one 'free'
ride out of the resort after I had inadvertently packed my lift-pass in my
onward luggage.
I was forced to ski all the way down to the road and hire a taxi in order to
catch up with the group. This has changed in France.
Val Thorens, the highest ski resort in Europe, and rather a desolate place,
is trying to build its way out of its bleak image. Like Flaine and La
Plagne, when the resort puts up new chalet blocks, they are built in a much
more traditional, attractive alpine style.
Val Thorens now has a pretty alpine church in pink and copper. 'We wanted to
celebrate our 20th anniversary,' said the resort's Tourist Office director,
Francois Gros, a renowned climber and high mountain guide. 'But in France
you are not supposed to use public funds to build churches. So we got some
private subscriptions and pretended it was going to be a village hall until
the last minute - then we put the steeple up. We only finished it on
Christmas Eve.'
The serious skiers who patronise the swashbuckling slopes of Val Thorens and
Les Menuires go there for the skiing rather than the architecture, but a
little extra charm has not gone amiss. The huge army of university skiers -
1,500 in all - has certainly enjoyed village life as well as the ski slopes.
In spite of Les Menuires' image, the students chose it for the British
Universities Ski Championships because 'Val Thorens didn't have enough
rooms, Val d'Isere was too expensive and Tignes will not have us back'.
The giant slalom and slalom - long, tough, icy courses on man-made snow on
the same slopes used in last Febuary's Olympics - were dominated by Scottish
Universities, although Southampton snapped their heels. Aberdeen finished
third in the men's giant slalom. Michael Folkman from Edinburgh University
achieved a remarkable double, winning both the men's events.
The Scots - the only British nation with any ski resorts - have long been a
threat, so much so that, until this year, the event was called the English
and Welsh Universities Ski Championships, excluding Scottish teams.
The focal point of the local skiing is the challenging La Masse, where 100
instructors carrying torches spelled out '1993' on the mountainside on New
Year's Eve, and Val Thorens' Cime de Caron, where a big cable car whisks
skiers up to more than 10,000 feet. When the cable car was first built, the
tourist office proudly asked a visiting Australian skiers what they thought
of the new toy. 'Well, mate,' came the response, 'it's just another cattle
truck.'
They were not far wrong. Skiers frequently moo good-naturedly as they herd
into the 150-person cable car. At the top a panoramic view extends deep into
the distant Italian Alps and features the jagged slopes of La Meije,
towering above Les Deux Alpes and La Grave.
You can now ski on from the Cime de Caron down into the beautiful and
desolate Maurienne Valley. An excellent alternative route runs via the
summer skiing area near the Pointe de Thorens, where a dramatic, but not
dangerous, traverse-cum-trudge of 20 minutes or so brings you close to the
Col de Pierre Lory.
From there a beautiful, sweeping and not too steep off-piste descent is
perfect for carving out giant slalom turns on hard, wind-packed snow (or
powder, if you are fortunate) all the way down to lunch at the Chalet de
Plan Bouchet.
Another classic descent from the Pointe de Thorens is achieved by hiking for
half an hour or so up to a col behind the jagged Aiguille de Peclet and
skiing 10 miles down into Meribel. From here Courchevel, the most chic
resort in France is only a quick (queues permitting) up-and-over.
My visit to Les Menuires and that of the students was organised by Touralp
(UK), 1, Berghem Mews, Blythe Road, London W14 OHN. Tel: 071-602-1952. I
stayed at the three-star Latitudes Hotel in La Bruyeres, which has an
outdoor swimming pool and skating rink at the foot of the slopes.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: A touch of the hawk's wild wing - Adam Hopkins
considers Aragon, which has some of Europe's most exhilarating countryside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADAM HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMEHOW the name of Aragon, though lovely on the ear to start with, also has
a mean tinge to it - entirely appropriate to that doughty local monarch
Ferdinand: the one, you will remember, who married a young lady from
Castille (her name was Isabella) and became a model for Machiavelli's
Prince.
Since Aragon's countryside is not well known, what one may not realise in
advance, is that large parts of it must rank among the most exhilarating in
Europe, with more than a touch of the hawk's wild wing and a tremendous
history.
First, though, the saddest aspect of contemporary Aragon. Like Leon and
Castille, like neighbouring Navarre, like rural Spain in general, Aragon is
heavily depopulated, apart, that is, from Zaragoza, the local capital, which
is vigorously alive and well.
You might not spot the emptiness at first, since the local people are famous
for loud voices and speaking their minds. Depopulated - yes; curmudgeonly -
sometimes; lively - almost always; dreary - definitely not.
As for the land itself, this comes sweeping down from the tops of the
Pyrenees and, in the west, across the still-high valley of the River Aragon.
The Aragon valley offers breadth and openness and mountain views, a tingling
springtime greeness and deep old gold in summer. Its rocky edges are
traversed by the shadows of red kites and griffin vultures.
After the Aragon, it is on down into the tablelands of the Spanish interior,
with a second river crossing at the Ebro (Zaragoza stands on the Ebro's
banks) and any number of lesser mountain outcrops.
Having teased myself in recent years with several small forays into Aragon,
I decided to string some of the northern parts together, starting off with a
few days in Jaca, in the Pyrenees, then making a car tour, first down to the
plains and then up again into the mountains, but moving always in the
general direction of the Mediterranean.
My route was odd in the sense that it ended in the central Pyrenees. As it
happened, I went on into Catalonia, though equally one could turn northwards
into France, but apart from minor niggles I can commend it as fascinating
and revelatory, and just occasionally quite challenging.
Jaca was in fiesta when I got there, cheerful if a little ragged, with
dancing outside the cathedral and water-fights among the children. My error
lay in sticking too close to Hilaire Belloc, who swept through the area in
1909. The poem that begins 'Do you remember an inn, Miranda, do you remember
an inn?', with plenty of muleteers, was a product of this trip, along with a
less memorable prose work.
Belloc called the Hotel Mur in Jaca: 'The kindest little hotel in Europe and
certainly one of the cleanest in Spain.' Alas, it proved the epitome of
dinginess and meagre spirits, a terrible contrast with the fiesta in the
streets.
There is no doubt that a modern Belloc would have put up 300 yards away in
the entirely charming Conde Aznar. The history, though, more than made up
for the Mur, for Jaca had acted as first capital of Aragon when the tiny
state first started to emerge in the 9th century, fighting off the local
Moorish conquerors inch by inch until finally, centuries later, it achieved
the once unthinkable and captured Zaragoza.
In Jaca, the early kings of Aragon built a dark and solid Romanesque
cathedral and gave it some splendid sculptural touches. Sculptures and
cathedral made a statement of intent. They also came in handy for impressing
the pilgrims who now began to flow through the Somport Pass above (as
equally they did at Roncesvalles, a good step further west) to start their
long trek to Santiago de Compostela; and one of a visitor's cultural duties
while in Jaca is to take at least a peek at Somport, a sombre affair due to
be by-passed in the next few years by a road tunnel.
The coming of this new all-weather route from France seems likely to result
in many local changes, adding to those already caused by skiing, and may be
seen as strengthening the case for an early visit.
From Jaca, it was easy to take in Ferdinand's birthplace at steep and stony
Sos del Rey Catolico, and, closer home, the monastery under a rock at San
Juan de la Pena. Long before Ferdinand (born 1452, with bones in fact
residing in Granada), the Aragonese kings and gentry had taken a fancy to
being buried at San Juan beneath the rock. But the place was plagued by damp
and falling stones, just as anyone remotely rational would have predicted.
It was finally done in by Napoleon's troops at the start of the 19th
century.
San Juan remains an exciting little spot, historically and architecturally,
but not half so exciting as the Ordesa and Monte Perdido national park, also
close to Jaca, which occupied me for a further day and could have held me
for a week if I had been braver.
There is one high-level walk here where you hang on to iron stakes as you
make your way along what seems from the photographs to be a precipice. I
saved it up for next time, thank you. As it was, I spent two hours wiggling
up a steep ascent, then six of purest joy descending through a gentle
Z-bend, 10km on either haul, in the company of miniature azaleas, a
brilliance of Alpines, butterflies by the kilo and waterfalls. If there is a
lovelier or more impressive cleft in the Pyrenees, entirely without roads or
noise of engines, I have yet to find it.
Now it was time to follow the Aragonese advance with a lancing movement
south towards the plains. The castle of Loarre, another royal artefact,
soars up in a rugged stump on the very final outcrop of the Pyrenean
foothills.
Loarre is intoxicating, and certainly deserves the detour it involves. But
Huesca, next kingly capital in the advance from Jaca, was now my goal for a
first night on the road. It is curious how small a showing Huesca makes in
English language guidebooks. Its cathedral is magnificent, combining
ruggedness and Gothic aspiration and once again a great richness of
sculpture.
Huesca has a good hotel. Barbastro, the next town eastwards, has mainly
history, for it was here in the 12th century that a marriage was celebrated
between the ruling houses of Aragon and Barcelona, quite as decisive for the
future as the later alliance of Ferdinand and Isabella and sometimes
referred to as the master-stroke of the Spanish Middle Ages.
In place after place in Aragon, the visitor gets an odd, sometimes
hair-raising, sense of great events gone by, as in a dream, leaving a
ghostly presence, the swishing of a curtain, a footfall on stone.
It comes as a huge change of mood to head back north again into the
mountains, first through the peach groves that line the River Cinca, on land
worked and watered by the Moors, those brilliant agriculturalists, then up
through the gorge along the River Esera and so at last by way of charmingly
faded Graus - good for another night in a rough and ready roadside hotel -
to the skiers' playground round Benasque, last outpost of Aragon.
Thanks to the skiing there is a building boom in Benasque. If this is the
future, I reflected selfishly, then give me the ghostly past in Sos and
Huesca. And long live, too, the national parks on both the French and
Spanish sides of the Pyrenees.
The easiest way to arrive in Spain from Britain by car is to cross from
Plymouth to Santander by Brittany Ferries (tel: 0752-221321). It takes 24
hours.
Nearest suitable airports: Barcelona, Girona and Bilbao, are all some
distance. All are served by Iberia (tel: 071-437-5622).

FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: Playing away from home - Practical Traveller:
Nicholas Woodsworth says commonsense precautions can minimise health risks -
from viruses to dodgy food and water - and offers suggestions for coping
with the uncertainties and frustrations of travel in Africa

WHERE IN the world is it safe to travel? The answer, in the age of modern
medicine, should be 'everywhere.' But it isn't. While medical science
advances every day, so does global poverty and the bacteria, parasites,
viruses, infections and diseases it breeds and spreads. Health risks to the
traveller are in many cases greater than ever; short of staying at home and
locking the door, there is no way of avoiding exposure to them.
A few examples illustrate the point. A generation ago, new chloroquine-based
drugs were highly effective in preventing malaria in tropical travellers.
These days, many strains of malaria - some of them lethal - have developed
drug resistance and every year now there are 2,500 cases of malaria brought
back to the UK.
Cholera, a disease for which vaccination is no longer obligatory, has made a
comeback in South America and Africa. Aids continues unchecked: as many as
10m are now thought to have the virus worldwide. Not even the Mediterranean,
Britain's favourite holiday area, is safe these days  - a diluted sewer, it
now receives 2bn tonnes of sewage annually. Nor are Britain's coasts clean -
up to half the country's beaches fall below EC hygiene standards.
Travel may sound like a dangerous pastime, but it need not be. There are
more than 25m trips made from Britain every year, and an upset stomach is
the worst most of these travellers will experience. If risks cannot be
avoided, a few commonsense precautions can minimise them to the point where
they are worth taking. Some of the most important:
FOOD HYGIENE. It is known by 1,000 euphemisms, but by any name diarrhoea is
by far the traveller's most common complaint. In areas where the local water
supply is suspect (most of the developing world), drink bottled water, avoid
ice and salads, and eat only fruits and vegetables which you can peel
yourself.
Avoid milk products, food that has not been freshly prepared, and stay away
from shellfish - only 4 per cent of Mediterranean shellfish-growing areas
produce seafood fit to be eaten. The cost of a meal is no guarantee of its
safety: five stars in the lobby says nothing about what goes on behind
kitchen doors.
Water purification equipment, medical kits and advice on self-treatment of
intestinal infection, all vital in some areas, can be obtained from Medical
Advisory Services for Travellers Abroad, the London School for Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, tel (London): 071-631-4408.
MALARIA. Today malaria is the second most common health complaint among
travellers. With drug resistance now making many treatments wholly or only
partly effective, informed advice on anti-malarial medication is vital. The
Malarial Reference Laboratory (tel: 071-636-7921) provides free advice for
individual countries.
Specialists increasingly emphasise the importance of not being bitten by
mosquitoes in the first place. In malarial areas use repellant liberally and
wear long sleeves and trousers, especially in the early morning and evening.
Use mosquito nets. Those impregnated with Permethrin are particularly
effective. Malarial symptoms - fever, sweating, chills or headache - can
develop up to one year after initial infection. Frequently, and sometimes
tragically, symptoms are incorrectly diagnosed simply because the sufferer
has failed to tell his doctor of a trip abroad.
AIDS. It seems silly to note such an obvious and avoidable risk, but
statistics continue to make a nonsense of human rationality: despite the
fact that 70 per cent of Bangkok prostitutes are believed to be HIV
positive, at least one-third of foreign male visitors to Thailand purchase
their services.
SUNSHINE. We all love to return home well tanned, and shrug off sun-burn as
an integral part of holidaying. Take note, however, of the Australians,
formerly the most passionate sun-worshippers: today very few are found on
beaches without heavy protection from sunlight. Skin cancer has been clearly
linked not just to long-term exposure to the sun, but also to short,
intensive episodes of sunburn.
There are literally thousands of other illnesses one could contract through
foreign travel. Although most travellers' chances of contracting serious
diseases are small, food and water, animals, insects and other people are
all channels for infection. The best prevention is knowledge - knowing the
risks and how to avoid them - and this is best obtained before going abroad.
The most useful single volume of information is Traveller's Health (edited
by Richard Dawood, Oxford University Press, Pounds 7.99). GPs are rarely
well informed of health conditions overseas. Precise and up-to-date data on
specific destinations, however, can be obtained from one of more than 30
British Airway travel clinics in the UK. Tel: 071-831-5333 for details.
Like the BA clinics, Thomas Cook, 45 Berkeley Street, London (tel:
071-499-400) also gives vaccinations and information on travel destinations.
While the British government still feels fit enough to fund it, the Hospital
for Tropical Diseases, 4 St Pancras Way, London (tel: 071-387-4411) remains
one of the best travellers' treatment centres in the world.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: Africa: frustrating, but worth it - Practical
Traveller: Nicholas Woodsworth says commonsense precautions can minimise
health risks - from viruses to dodgy food and water - and offers suggestions
for coping with the uncertainties and frustrations of travel in Africa

A CENTURY ago African travel was no holiday. Look at David Livingstone. He
left for Africa in perfectly good health on a perfectly innocent venture - a
search for the source of the Nile. He returned to England a sun-blackened
mummy wrapped in a roll of bark, his heart and entrails left behind in a tin
box buried under a mango tree.
Holiday and business travel in black Africa is not so rigorous these days.
You can find good French cooking on the deepest backwaters of the Okavango
swamps, CNN satellite TV in the most pestilential of west African cities,
gleaming medical clinics just a hop from prancing herds of wildebeest. But
such facilities are found only in enclaves where expatriates congregate. For
the most part, the continent remains what it has always been, a place of
uncertain and sometimes hazardous travel.
Successful African travel depends on arrangements that take these
uncertainties into account. The easiest way, of course, is to let specialist
operators undertake travel and holiday arrangements for you. But not even an
entire legion of tour reps from Abercrombie &amp; Kent can keep you from a
sticky end if you stray too far from the rules of common sense.
Avoid, for example, travelling in ostentatious style. In a continent of
sometimes desperate need, expensive baggage and jewellery, conspicuous
clothing or a neck slung with cameras is an unnecessary provocation. Being
in a large modern city is no protection; most African crime is urban crime.
Baggage, in fact, is best cut to a minimum.
If you can travel with a small frameless bag rather than a full-size
suitcase, chances are you will be able to keep it in the bus rather than on
top of the bus, in the aircraft rather than the cargo hold. The less time it
is in other people's hands, the less chance it has of becoming 'lost'. And
do you really need mountains of luggage? The Africa editor of this paper
claims that the entire continent can be taken in wearing either a
lightweight suit or simple cotton trousers, shirt and a pair of running
shoes.
There are certain things, though, that he would never be without: a torch
and batteries, not only for the bush, but for city hotel rooms during
inevitable power cuts; a teaspoon and penknife for papayas and avocados
bought from market stalls; a pair of high-quality sunglasses dark enough to
cope with harsh African light; a wad of Dollars 1 bills, honored everywhere
for tips, taxis and small emergencies; a short-wave radio and reading
material to relieve waits and delays; and lastly, an adequate supply of
Lomotil to relieve diarrhoea.
Medical and hygiene precautions, in fact, are among the most important you
can take in Africa. The key points such as food, malaria and Aids, are
covered in the article above.
Do not expect Africa to be cheap simply because it is poor. Air travel
within Africa is among the most expensive in the world. Count on paying
international prices in top hotels, but do not count on international
management standards; if hairs on unchanged pillow-slips are common in
African-run establishments, they are not unknown in Sheratons, Meridiens or
Inter-Continentals.
The most important items you can bring to Africa are time and patience.
Train, bus and even aircraft departure times often have nothing to do with
printed schedules. Leave plenty of margin for error and keep a flexible
timetable. If things do go wrong, keep cool.
A wake-up call missed, a worn tyre burst, a visa refused, a petty official
over-indulgent in the exercise of power - these and 1,000 other irritations
lie in wait to test the African traveller's mettle.
Lose your temper, puff yourself up, and start threatening the wrath of your
consul, and you are lost: you may not return home a wizened mummy, but you
will have foregone some of the pleasures to be garnered from an often
frustrating continent.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: Go east - or north, south or west - Eastern
Europe is opening up, but you should look before you leap. Michael
Thompson-Noel surveys the latest holiday options
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SHORT while ago I spent a bleak weekend in Vilnius, Lithuania. There is
almost nothing to see or do in Vilnius, except go to church, scuttle in
search of restaurants - and marvel at the bankruptcy to which the Evil
Empire drove its vassal republics before history gave it the heave-ho.
So far as I could see, the Lithuanians make nothing, own nothing, and have
almost nothing to do. Despite this, they are trying to be cheerful. Here,
for example, is an extract from a release put out by Lithuanian Tours, one
of the first private travel companies in the country, which is establishing
relations with foreign tour operators:
'If you long for wild nature, green forests full of singing birds, swift and
clean brooks, golden sand dunes and refreshing sea breeze, you should come
to Lithuania . . . It is here that organ, chamber and symphonic music is
still highly admired and people gather in concert halls solemnly
concentrated and dressed for the occasion. It is here that the Church mass
is still held with ancient dignity harmoniously matching elegant, monumental
and ornated church architecture.'
It will be many years, I fear, before Lithuania makes its mark in the
cut-throat world of international tourism. But for those with ancestral
connections, or who like to visit places that are 'new' and 'different,'
things are starting to stir.
Just before Christmas, Instone Travel, London-based, launched a brochure
featuring Russia and the republics. 'Russia,' claims Des McGuinness,
Instone's managing director, 'offers one of the most exciting and
stimulating travel experiences available today. Our new tour programmes
reflect and exploit fully the greater freedom and flexibility now to be
found in Russia and the republics.'
Instone is offering 14-night tours of the Baltic republics, starting in St
Petersburg and taking in Tallinn (Estonia), Riga (Latvia) and Vilnius, then
Moscow.
The all-in price (travel, hotels, meals and guide) starts from Pounds 839
per person for the April 26 departure. Other offerings: four-, seven- and
13-night visits to St Petersburg, Moscow and central Asia, or a trip on the
trans-Siberian railway (starting price for 14 nights: Pounds 999).
Among the vast array of cruise company brochures, one that catches the eye
is Cunard's first Great Rivers of Europe programme, which offers a variety
of cruises on the Rhone, Elbe and Danube on purpose-built craft. Example: a
10-day cruise on the Danube Princess from Passau (Germany) downstream to
Constanta on the Black Sea, calling at Durnstein, Vienna, Budapest, Kalocsa
and Mohacs (Hungary), Belgrade, Turno-Severin (Romania), and Russe
(Bulgaria). Prices for seven-day cruises start at Pounds 880, including
flights between the UK and Passau or Constanta.
A number of cheap and cheerful do-it-yourself holidays is available in the
French Country Cruises brochure of Andrew Brock Travel, which says that hire
costs of a four-berth boat start at Pounds 446 per week in low season, while
a 12-berth boat in peak season costs Pounds 2,286. The brochure details 16
bases for cruising on French canals; the reintroduction of a base in Holland
(Loosdrecht, south of Amsterdam), and the start-up of boating holidays in
eastern Germany, on the 'waterway wonderland' of lakes and canals in the
Mecklenburg and Brandenburg regions.
'The well-maintained locks are rare,' says Brock, 'commercial traffic rarer
still, and in the hot central European summers, bathing is a matter of tying
up to a tree and plunging into the lake. Now is the time to see it all,
before the Russian troops and the Trabants are gone for ever.'
A brochure devoted to sea voyages by passenger-cargo vessel can be had from
Gdynia America Shipping Lines (London), while the 1993 brochure from
Clipper, which organises natural history and cultural cruises, includes
several new itineraries. Examples: Antarctica and the Chilean Fjords,
Bridging the Bering Strait, and Treasures of Western South America.
If you want to go north, study the brochure of Arctic Experience, which
specialises in tours to Iceland, Greenland, Spitsbergen, Norway, Finland,
Lapland, Canada and Alaska. Its Images of Finland holiday, for example,
ranges from the lakes of the south to the high fells of Lapland, and
includes two nights in St Petersburg.
Short-stay holidays have had plenty of attention in recent years. A useful
brochure (because of its brevity) is the Romantic Escapes programme of Made
to Measure Holidays, featuring - or so it says - 'some of Europe's finest
hotels as well as some less rossetted properties which offer great charm and
great food.' It covers obvious attractions like Paris, Venice, Florence and
Berlin, but also less rossetted spots such as Annecy, Sintra and Durnstein.
The cross-Channel ferry companies are reasonably big holiday operators in
their own right. Brittany Ferries, for example, has a series of brochures,
including Holiday Homes In France (more than 400 British-owned properties
for rent), Holidays and Breaks in France and Spain, and Gite Holidays in
France.
One of the best of all British travel companies is Cox and Kings, run by the
energetic Peter Kerkar. It is probably best known for its Indian and
environmental programmes, but is at present devoting a lot of time to South
America. In addition to group tours and suggested itineraries for
independent travellers, the company's Latin American brochure has a third,
themed section divided into five categories: beaches, cruises, rail, and
country and city tours. Cuba features in the brochure, alongside Mexico,
Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, Argentine, Chile, Belize, Panama, Costa Rica,
Guatemala, Bolivia, the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador and Patagonia.
A company for which I have a great deal of time is Meon Villa Holidays,
which offers top-quality villas in popular European centres. It started out,
25 years ago, by offer ing 30 villas on the Algarve, and now offers 500
villas and apartments in 16 places. Last autumn Meon fixed me up with a
villa in northern Majorca. I took my executive assistant and her mother.
Everything worked impeccably. Meon's formula - flights, properties with
private pools, maids and car hire - and its service, are exemplary.
This year, Meon is offering a wider range of properties in Florida and says
that overall, many prices in its brochure are lower than in 1991-92. Flights
 -daytime weekday whenever possible - are from Gatwick, as well as
(depending on destination) Birmingham, Bristol, Heathrow, Luton, Manchester,
Stansted and Glasgow. Telephone help is available from Meon staff.
Other useful self-catering brochures are those of Classic Cottages (west of
England, though it is now seeking French properties); Something Special
Travel's Florida Villa Experience, and French Affair, which manages quality
rural properties in the Dordogne, Lot Valley, Gasgony, Provence and
Languedoc-Roussillon. Its sister company is Corsican Affair.
High Places is an independent mountain travel company in its seventh year.
New itineraries for 1993 include: Peaks of Ecuador (22 days, Pounds 1,880),
Madagascar by Bike and Boat (24 days, Pounds 2,460) and A Trek to Spiti, a
newly-opened Buddhist kingdom (24 days, Pounds 1,630).
For culture vultures, a useful programme is that of Specialtours, under the
wing of the National Art Collections Fund. You need to be a fund member,
although non-members can book provided they take out a year's membership,
which costs Pounds 15, before departure. Specialtours says it has more than
20 years' experience in arranging cultural tours, and has contacts among
curators and collectors, in Europe and the US. Its 1993 tours include A
Journey Through Syria, Art in California and Treasures of Berlin and
Dresden.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Grim year for over-borrowed -
Nick Garnett revisits some of the companies he has written about
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHOP'S interior lies gutted and its front window caked in grime. Milk
bottles litter the step and a pile of bills and circulars are heaped through
the letter box. A poster of pasta twirls swirling in tomato sauce and the
name of the defunct business on the shop front are the only clues that this
was a food delivery and take-out service. Fasta Pasta, opened in London in
1990 by a former manager of a pizza chain disappeared without trace last
year.
Among the many new companies written about for this column, 1992 reaped a
grim catalogue of failure. In Arundel, west Sussex, receivers were called in
during the summer at New Era Cosmetics, a pot pourri and toiletries maker
partly owned by a former Body Shop manager. Long experience in a trade is no
guarantee of success for an entrepreneur.
The Alternative Shooting Company, which offered clay pigeon shooting for
corporate and individual clients, never really got off the ground and was,
in effect, wound up along with its loans of more than Pounds 100,000.
Resurrected with the same name and same owner, minus the debts shouldered by
the owner in another holding company, it is trading again though at a tenth
of the level its originators hoped for three years ago.
In north-east England, Pam Jose's waste recycling business, started in 1989,
has endured a gruesome year. The company maintained a tiny profit and Jose
has kept her head above water only by a second job as freelance computer
consultant. 'When I see the accountant in April we'll have to make a
sensible decision about the future of the business,' she says.
All this reveals how tiny companies with high borrowings, low margins or
both, suffer during recession. Some go under whatever the business climate.
But if an enterprise is grossly under-capitalised, a precarious existence
might be the best it can hope for.
Nonetheless, 1992 was better than might be expected for Minding Your Own
Business companies, especially those whose finances are not riddled with
death-watch beetle. Some of the larger companies have performed well by
doing the opposite of what stock market-quoted concerns are encouraged to
do. They have striven to maintain turnover by increasing their ranges of
products even at the cost of profit margins. This applies to SMTS which kept
its sales above Pounds 500,000 last year, making high-cost collectable
miniature-scale cars in Hastings. This has been the path taken by sisters
Lexi Douglas and Henrietta Nettlefold with their Sparklers mail order shirt
business in Kent.
'For the last financial year, sales were about the same at Pounds 300,000
but we have introduced more varieties and, partly as a result, saw the
return drop from 19 to about 14 per cent,' says Douglas.
Many tiny enterprises run from home with minuscule overheads have plodded on
nicely, avoiding the horrors suffered by bigger brethren. At Leonard
Foulkes' Out Of Print Book Service in Cardiff, run from a low-cost building,
sales last year dipped just 5 per cent.
'Some mainstream book businesses suffered a 10-20 per cent drop in sales,'
Foulkes says. 'I have reduced costs this year partly because renovation work
on the building has finished so profits are up.'
Foulkes was able to raise his salary above the Pounds 20,000 he paid himself
the previous year.
Back to the bad news. Surfachem, the chemicals group which had partnered New
Era Cosmetics and was forced into a controlling interest in it early last
year, eventually called in receivers Touche Ross to its small prodigy.
Touche Ross' accounts for June last year showed New Era encumbered with a
Pounds 93,000 deficit owing to unsecured creditors. The company, which had
bought dried flowers, fragrances and other material for making into pot
pourri, after-shaves and fragrance sprays, made losses in both of its full
operating years. It started with capital of just Pounds 15,000 and loans of
about Pounds 50,000. Retailers and brand name suppliers to which it provided
pot pourri forced it into price cuts and recession hit demand.
Fasta Pasta's financial structure always looked a bit uncertain. Three years
ago, Ben Fox, a young former manager at Pizza Piazza, persuaded his local
branch of National Westminster to make a Pounds 72,000 loan of which all but
Pounds 20,000 was covered by the government's loan guarantee scheme. Fox put
in almost nothing himself. He bought too much pasta-making equipment from
Italy, purchased a new jeep and five new mountain bikes for deliveries.
Fancy menus and uniforms for the food delivery service in London alone cost
Pounds 4,000. The Pounds 72,000 was gobbled up in 18 months. New investors
came in and another outlet opened in Clapham but sales of take-out boxes of
pasta with prawn and vodka sauce at Pounds 5 never looked an easy prospect.
The company continually suffered from weak cash flow and burdensome debts
Up in Newcastle, North-East Recycling is still in business but has proved a
very difficult experience for Jose.
'Last year was a stinker,' she says. 'We are still struggling to survive.
The waste paper side was steady through the year but plastics were badly hit
by the recession. Virgin polymer prices fell dramatically so recycled
polythene prices were effectively cut in half.'
Yearly turnover rose from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds 120,000 but profits
remained marginal.
A surprising number of businesses in catering acquitted themselves well.
Moodies, supplying corporate entertainment packages from converted
double-decker buses, suffered a bleak year in 1991.
'1992 was fabulous,' says owner Jenine Moodie. 'One of the reasons is that
we have gone into weddings. We've found we can make Pounds 3,000 to Pounds
5,000 for a day's work. We estimate turnover for the year at about Pounds
600,000 with a return of about 20 per cent.'
John and Hazel Milligan bought a derelict pub building in Oxfordshire in the
late 1970s, spending Pounds 150,000 to purchase and transform it into the
award-winning Falkland Arms. The couple also owned a pub in St Albans which
they sold last year, transferring their attentions to the tenancy of The Old
Reindeer, Banbury.
'That pub was closed since August,' says Hazel. 'It was run down. We have so
far rebuilt the kitchen and cellars. The cost of obtaining the tenancy and
doing the building work was about Pounds 50,000. We can't complain about
trading at the Falkland Arms. It's about the same level as last year. We
haven't put prices up for accommodation and for weekends you have to book
four to five months in advance.'
An en suite double room with four-poster costs Pounds 45 per night.
Laurence and Sue Cowley, could not sell Glazebrook House country hotel in
Devon for Pounds 700,000, so they took it off the market last year. 'We are
enjoying it now,' says Laurence. 'Turnover was up 15 1/2 per cent, which is
unusual for this part of the world. The majority of our business comes from
conferences. Business trade is mainly with solicitors, accountants and some
larger commercial companies.'
Good news for some is not for others. 'There are three country-house hotels
near us which have shut down in the past year. Most country hotels are
holiday-orientated and are having a desperate time.'
Running harder to stay still has been the dominant theme for this column's
businesses in 1992. Most were forced to work harder to maintain sales while
profit margins deteriorated.
'Considering the climate, we've had a good year with sales rising from
Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000,' says Adrian Wright, of Watts and Wright,
fitted kitchen and bedroom makers in Walsall. 'Margins have suffered and we
realise we must move to better premises where the production lay-out is
better. It is so competitive even some of the most famous names are doing
special sales.'
SMTS makes miniature cars which sell from Pounds 40 to Pounds 250. It kept
its turnover to about Pounds 550,000, the same as last year and Pounds
100,000 more than in 1990.
'Our margins are a little down because material costs are up and it would
have been suicide for us to raise prices,' says co-founder John Allen.
'Re-orders of models are slow to come through and there are few new
collectors coming in. We normally introduce about eight new models a year
but we have invested in about 15 over the past 12 months which causes an
additional cost. Most of our new models get 400 orders or so straight off
but over the past year it has been less than 200.'
Allen says the company has profited from manufacturing changes introduced
after help from the DTI enterprise initiative. The company has also been
putting more people on training courses. No matter how bad a recession, some
entrepreneurs in quirky businesses will still locate a market. Angus
Greenlees last year transferred his exotic skin business from his home to a
shop in London's Knightsbridge. With ray-skin bags at Pounds 210 down to
eel-skin wallets at Pounds 33, Greenlees abandoned most of his low-margin
wholesale activities, concentrating on direct sales to the public.
'In the year to May 1992 we did between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 160,000
business. I'm very pleased overall. The lesson I learned was don't be afraid

FT  09 JAN 93 / As They Say in Europe: How history kills in
Bunkum-an-der-Oder - James Morgan studies rhetorical lessons of the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN

<TEXT>
'HISTORY,' said Henry Ford, 'is bunk,' and there is a sense in which he was
right. He was not foolish enough to be a member of the 'End of history'
school of nonsense which emerged a few of years ago just in time for history
to collapse on it like a tidal wave gushing from an ancient sewer.
When Ford talked of bunk he was using the familiar abbreviation of the word
bunkum. That in turn comes from Buncombe, a county in North Carolina. Its
congressional representative in 1820, Felix Walker, spoke at length because
'Buncombe expected it of him.'
So bunkum is a mixture of anecdote, tall stories and claptrap, and, as such,
provides the main constituent of what passes for political debate over much
of Europe today. The representatives of the Buncombe school of history are
having the time of their lives, and, unlike Congressman Walker, are able to
influence events. The Czecho-Slovak divorce resulted from the overblown
rhetoric of Slovak politicians. They played on the popular feeling that
Slovaks had been done out of their rights by the more numerous and
domineering Czechs.
This merely ensured that they were full participants in the revival of that
ancient Euro-game of finding someone to resent. And so, of course, they fell
into the trap laid for them by the crafty Czech prime minister, Vaclav
Klaus.
When the split came, the Bratislava papers were still trying to define what
it meant to be Slovak while their headlines proclaimed the establishment of
the frontier with 'Moravia', implying that the Czech Republic would itself
break up into its constituents - Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia.
In fact the determination of the Slovaks to believe that their neighbour
will fall apart would be pathetic were it not for the malign assistance of
the European Community. By placing strict quotas on exports of the products
of the north Moravian steel industry it has given a boost to local
separatists.
Thus there is a revival of that theme of the 1930s when the newspapers of
the Third Reich called Czechoslovakia the 'Mosaic-state'. Then, after the
creation of independent Slovakia in 1938, Hungary took over the bit
inhabited by its people and so today the lifeblood of the Budapest press has
become stories of the hardships facing the Hungarians of Slovakia - 'our
Upper Land' in Magyar. Hungarian nostalgia for the Austro-Hungarian empire
is a natural result.
During the Yugoslav conference in London last August, one unreported element
was the way that every national minority the Balkans arrived in the Queen
Elizabeth II Conference Centre to have its say.
The Macedonian and the Montenegrin Albanians both began their press
conferences with the dread words, 'In 1878 . . . ' That reference unleashed
a litany of grievances that left the audience of mainly west European
reporters baffled and bored. One inflamed Albanian was asked if his was the
largest minority in wherever it was that it was a minority. He replied, 'We
are not a minority. We have always been there. It is ours.'
The resentments are often based on real injuries. They are, however,
subjected to the catalyst of paranoia that has already led to the
construction of Buncombe-cum-Serbia whose present deplorable conduct is
founded on a bizarre mixture of fact, fantasy and epic distortion.
So it is that we have become familiar with Bunkum- an-der-Oder as old East
German communist youth leaders easily transform themselves into neo-Nazi
rabble rousers. In Baincombes- sur-Aube, politicians tell peasants that they
have an absolute right to sell everything that they produce at no matter
what cost because it is historic destiny and glorious vocation of la France
profonde etcetera etcetera. And in the bars of the south Antrim village of
Ballybunkum, either tears are shed or glasses raised in memory of the events
of the late 17th century.
In England, fortunately, history has been theme-parked into trivia. In the
'Neighbours' bar of the the Polystyrene Arms, the villagers of Buncombe St
Michael consume their microwaved chicken tandoori in a basket, suck
mouthfuls of Mexican lager through little bits of yellowing lime and argue
whether they can really be at the heart of a European Community which
threatens the future of prawn-cocktail flavoured crisps.
This provides a haven from the 'historical correctness' which has become the
prevailing philosophy of east and central Europe. But it can catch its
practitioners out.
Since reunification, the German media have, more than ever, taken to using
the old German names for Polish towns and cities. Nothing wrong with that,
perhaps - the English would never say 'Roma,' but in middle Europe these
things sound different. Last week, however, German sports editors faced a
nasty problem. The Polish team which qualified for the European ice-hockey
championships in Dusseldorf, called Unia Oswiecim. Now that might be
rendered in English as Auschwitz United. The German media settled for the
Polish name.
At the Yugoslav meeting last August the prime minister of the rump state,
and loser in the recent Serbian elections, Milan Panic, spoke at length of
the damage wrought by historical obsessions in his part of the world and
made a valuable suggestion: the teaching of history should be banned. Henry
Ford may have been mistaken but he was not talking bunk.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Council tax liability
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM landlord of a dwelling let under an Assured Shorthold Tenancy, the
first six months of which expires on February 9 1993. I intend to lextend
the tenancy on an indefinite monthly basis. The tenant currently pays her
Poll Tax. What action should I take to ensure she pays the new Council Tax
from April onwards?
Although a residential leaseholder is responsible for paying Council Tax, it
might be argued that a lease or tenancy agreement such as the one you
describe varies the incidence of that obligation (thus placing the ultimate
burden of the Council Tax on you). To avoid such risk, do not use the
present form of lease after February 9 1993, but require a new form to be
used which obliges the landlord to pay the headlease ground rent (and any
other outgoings attributable to your status as lessee under the head lease)
but omits reference to rates and taxes in the landlord's covenants.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Accrual of interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BECAUSE of my ill health, my wife and I had to sell our business in 1991. As
the purchasers could not raise all the money he required, we left Pounds
60,000 in the business in the form of a second mortgage on the property. In
early January 1992, the purchaser declared himself bankrupt and it took the
building society until August 1992 to sell the business as a going concern
at a much reduced figure.
We expected the building society to claim back its loan capital but we did
not anticipate they would claim full interest on the loan accruing from the
date of bankruptcy to the date they received money for the sale. My
understanding was that interest charges stopped accruing at bankruptcy.
Could you please advise me if the building society were within their rights
to take this interest before paying out our second charge, since it resulted
in a serious loss for us.
The building society was entitled to its interest, as it was realising its
security, not proving in the bankruptcy. The moratorium on the accrual of
interest which you have in mind applies only to unsecured debts which are
proved in the bankruptcy.
