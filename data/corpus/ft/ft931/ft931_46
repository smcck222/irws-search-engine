FT  09 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Agreement desirable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I EARN an income of Pounds 10,000 and have unearned income of Pounds 40,000.
I have assets as a result of an inheritance of Pounds 500,000 including our
house which is worth about Pounds 100,000. My husband to be has no assets
and earns about Pounds 25,000.
Much as I love him, our relationship has been volatile to date. If we marry
and divorce in five years with no children and no changes in our financial
positions, is there any risk the Courts could award him any of my capital?
There must always be some risk of the kind which you envisage on divorce,
since the Court has power to direct whatever financial settlement it deems
just in all the circumstances. Hence a contractual agreement settling the
parties rights (in the absence of children) is desirable.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to beat the average
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAST performance has a bearing on the future, the Weekend FT's analysis of
unit trusts over 1991-92 concludes. Buying the best, or most consistent
performing unit trusts, appears to give the investor a better chance of
beating the average.
To test the theory, we assumed that an investor was selecting a unit trust
in October 1991, and chose, as his options:
One of the best 10 performing trusts in each sector over the previous year;
One of the worst 10 performing trusts in each sector over the previous year;
Trusts with a long record of consistency, ie those with an above average
performance in their sectors over one, two, three, five, seven and (where
possible) ten years.
All figures were taken from Finstat, on the basis of offer-to-bid with net
income reinvested.
The next step was to see how those selections performed over the year to
October 1992. The table shows the result, and includes the average for each
sector over the same period.
Choosing one of the best 10 trusts would have enabled the investor to bear
the sector average in nine out of the 14 categories, or 64.3 per cent. A
good example is the Far East (excluding Japan) where October 1991's top 10
funds rose by an average 18.1 per cent over the following year, compared
with the sector average of 10.8 per cent.
Buying each of the top 10 trusts in a sector would be cumbersome. But the
encouraging news is that the top trust over the previous year beat the
average in 10 out of 14 cases.
The theory that the worst performing unit trust in the sector might rebound
has often been a market favourite. The idea is that the management group
will put effort into improving a poorly performing fund, perhaps by changing
the manager. Funds have been launched with the main aim of investing in the
worst - performing unit trust of the previous year.
But the table does not give much succour to this theory. The 10 worst trusts
failed to beat the sector average on nine out of 14 occasions.
Consistency of performance might well be a better indicator of a manager's
skill than being top of the table over as short a period as a year. The
table shows that trusts selected on this basis beat the sector average on
seven out of 12 occasions - and beat the average of the 10 top performers in
six out of the 12 categories (in two sectors, no trust meet the consistency
criteria).
The table is only a rough-and-ready analysis, and does not claim to settle
an issue which has provoked much academic head-scratching in the past.
Statistics can easily mislead, as those who followed the opinion polls
during the last general election can attest.
But one further statistic might help convince the doubters. A single
calendar year is not an ideal period over which to measure a unit trust;
since trusts are long-term investments. So we also analysed how the investor
would have done had he backed the top performing fund over the two, three,
five and ten years to October 1.
In each case, the top performer would have beaten the sector average over
the following 12 months more times than not and, in the case of the three -
year champion, the average was beaten 11 out of 13 times.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why paying off the mortgage is
worthwhile - A look at the best way of reducing your home loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOMEOWNERS have now seen their monthly mortgage payments reduced by
one-third or more in just over two years. Borrowers with the Halifax, the
country's largest lender, were paying 15.4 per cent interest on variable
rate mortgages in October 1990 but are now paying 8.55 per cent.
For many people, the reduction in rates has eased finances to the extent
that they may be able to afford to make capital repayments on their
mortgage.
If homeowners already have adequate savings and pay off credit card bills in
full each month, they may choose either to save more money or reduce the
size of their mortgage to Pounds 30,000 (interest payments over this amount
are not tax-deductible).
The main argument for reducing the size of a mortgage is that the interest
is likely to be far higher than the return savings can earn in a bank or
building society. While the standard variable rate mortgage at Halifax is at
present 8.55 per cent, it is only paying out between six and 6.6 per cent
net on its Premium Xtra account for a basic rate taxpayer.
These percentages include a 0.25 per cent bonus payable on the anniversary
of the account if no capital withdrawals are made. The return for a
higher-rate taxpayer is only between 4.8 and 5.25 per cent net.
Put another way, if you are a higher rate taxpayer, with a mortgage of more
than Pounds 30,000, you would need to be earning gross interest of 14.25 per
cent - and 11.4 per cent gross if you are a basic rate taxpayer - for it to
be cost-effective not to repay the mortgage at 8.55 per cent. There are, of
course, other considerations. Inflation at 3.6 per cent is low at the moment
but now that the UK is out of the discipline of the exchange rate mechanism,
it is possible that annual inflation will become larger than interest rates,
thereby eroding the size of your debt.
You may also prefer to invest in equities in the hope of obtaining higher
returns than those in a bank or building society.
But if you do decide to reduce the size of your mortgage, the difference in
monthly repayments can be startling. The table shows that by paying off
Pounds 10,000 of a Pounds 40,000 loan, interest on a repayment mortgage will
fall to just over Pounds 200 a month from Pounds 273.65 a month at current
interest rates. You would be better off by over Pounds 160 a month by
reducing your repayment mortgage by Pounds 20,000 from either Pounds 80,000
or Pounds 60,000.
Before increasing payments to your lender, you should decide between one of
two strategies. You may wish to reduce the capital and spread the remainder
over the existing term of the loan, which will result in reduced monthly
interest payments. Alternatively, your main aim may be to shorten the term
of the loan, say from 25 years to 10 years or even less.
In either case, it is important to consult your lender over the best way of
achieving your aim, otherwise you could be in for a shock. Paul Burgin, of
Abbey National, says that the worst thing to do is to send off a cheque
without explaining what it is for. You should state that it is a capital
repayment and ask for your monthly interest payments to be recalculated
accordingly. If you do not make this clear, Abbey will assume it is
overpayment of interest and it will not be taken into account until the end
of the year.
Many borrowers opt for an annual repayment review, which is to their benefit
when interest rates are rising but to their disadvantage when they are
falling. The majority of borrowers at Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester are on annual
review and the calculation is done by the society on December 31 with the
change coming into effect for borrowers on March 1.
'Formerly you would not see any benefit for 13 months if you made a payment
in February, without telling us what it was for,' said C&amp;G. So long as the
society is now told that an increased payment represents a capital
repayment, a recalculation will be made. C&amp;G will assume the increased
payment is to enable you to reduce the term of the loan if your mortgage is
on a repayment basis. If you want the reduced capital paid over the existing
term of the loan, you must tell C&amp;G.
By contrast, Lloyds Bank will assume the opposite. Unless you tell the bank
otherwise, Lloyds will assume that you will want to make payments on your
reduced capital over the same term. This underlines the importance of
consulting your lender.
Borrowers with endowment mortgages can also reduce the size of their debt.
An endowment is an interest-only mortgage where part of the monthly payments
is paid to a life company which invests the money primarily in equities in
the hope that when the policy matures, it will have grown by enough to pay
off the capital. Anything that remains can be taken by the householder as a
tax-free lump sum.
By reducing the size of the capital, you will pay less interest. But the
size of the premiums you pay to the life company will remain constant
throughout the term of the mortgage.
When the endowment matures, you should be able to keep more of the tax-free
lump sum since the size of the capital, which the policy needs to repay,
will have been reduced.
Most lenders prefer the mortgage to be reduced with a lump sum rather than
through regular payments, although the Royal Bank of Scotland says that it
will treat increased monthly payments as capital repayments as long as the
borrower consults the bank.
But National Westminster bank will charge an administration fee if capital
repayments are made more than twice a year.
The Alliance &amp; Leicester building society will only consider amounts of
Pounds 500 and above as capital repayments, and lesser amounts will be left
to languish until the end of the year.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Finding a monthly top-up for the
coffers - The options open to investors seeking a regular income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS looking for income are having a rough ride in the present climate
of low interest rates. Those needing monthly income will find it even harder
to obtain good rates, since the choice is more limited.
However, a year can be a long time to wait before an injection of funds for
those retired or mainly dependent on savings for income. So, what are the
best options open to those seeking monthly income?
The choice depends on the amount of risk the saver is prepared to take, the
length of time for which capital may be tied up and the degree to which
capital may be run down in order to meet income needs. Mailesh Shah, of
London-based advisers William Mercer Fraser, cautions: 'Investors should be
concerned not only with the initial level of income from their investments
but also with the prospects of that income increasing to keep pace with
inflation.'
Deposit-based investments are secure (if the institution harbouring them is
sound). The returns do not usually depend on capital being tied up for long
and they therefore represent a convenient way of holding money for most
people.
By contrast, equity-based investments involve risking capital. To get the
best from the stock market, an investment usually needs to be left untouched
for a long time to smooth out the market's ups and downs. For this reason,
shares are theoretically not the ideal investment for a person seeking
income. However, a class of funds - income funds - have been specifically
devised to address this problem, with fund managers choosing companies which
pay high dividends rather than those aiming primarily for growth. The snag
is that dividends can always be cut.
Those totally averse to risk will want to keep holdings in cash but many
people could consider holding both forms of investment and there are a
number of ways of doing so.
Cash
The simplest way of holding cash is in a bank or building society. Investors
should be aware of prevailing rates of inflation to gauge the real rate of
return being offered to them. The table, provided by Moneyfacts, shows the
current highest rates on accounts offering monthly income.
Many banks and building societies offer fixed-rate bonds and the table shows
the most attractive currently available. However, since base rates are
historically low at the moment, now is not the best time to lock in to fixed
rates. For example, Halifax's five-year guaranteed reserve bond is paying
7.72 per cent gross, equivalent to 5.79 per cent net for a basic-rate
taxpayer.
This may be an acceptable rate at present, but if base rates go up within
the next five years, it is likely to appear very unattractive, particularly
if it is accompanied by a rise in inflation.
Providence Capitol last year launched a building society bond which invests
in the deposits of the top ten building societies and aims to give higher
than average returns. It is a single-premium insurance bond which gives
higher rate taxpayers increased flexibility.
Guaranteed income bonds usually pay out annual income but some offer monthly
income. The highest rates available on sums of Pounds 50,000 are shown in
the table. Money is invested with an insurance company for a fixed period
and, in exchange, the saver is paid a guaranteed rate of interest. However,
Robert Leonard of fee-charging advisers Moores Marr Bradley does not
recommend Gibs at present because of low interest rates. National Savings
Income bonds pay monthly income but, as with the fixed interest products,
current rates of seven per cent gross are historically low. The minimum
investment is Pounds 2,000 up to a Pounds 50,000 maximum. Interest is paid
gross and there is a three-month notice period for withdrawal of the
capital.
Equity-based products
A number of insurance companies offer monthly income accounts although these
may have been given a bad name because of the recent debacle over the
advertising by Scottish Widows of its Monthly Bond. The bond's promise of
'up to 9.20 per cent net of basic rate tax fixed for five years' is being
investigated by Lautro, the regulatory body for the insurance industry, as
possibly misleading.
The bond is what is known as a 'back-to-back investment' in which part of
the capital sum goes into a temporary annuity, and the remainder into a
Personal Equity Plan which attempts to grow enough to replace the capital
lost in the annuity. Returns from the Pep cannot be guaranteed, which is why
the advertisement may have been misleading; there is a real risk that
investors may lose part of their capital.
The concept of 'back to back' investment is a useful one, however. There are
a number of choices when it comes to the investment to replace the capital.
Apart from Peps, unit or investment trusts can be used, though these are
relatively high risk. Leonard believes a with-profits bond would be less
risky, while higher-rate taxpayers could consider a Business Expansion
Scheme.
James Higgins of fee-based advisers Chamberlain de Broe suggests combining
the annuity with the recently-launched sixth issue index-linked National
Savings certificate, which pays 3.25 per cent compound per annum over the
retail price index, if held for five years. This has the virtue of being
completely risk-free and carrying no charges, but the investor will be
limited by the Pounds 5,000 maximum holding.
Unit and investment trust funds usually pay out income annually but there
are some that make monthly distributions, for example, the M&amp;G Treasury fund
(see below).
Higgins recommends the income shares of split-level investment trusts which
distribute at various times of the year. He suggests constructing a 'ladder'
of various shares, so that the investor could ensure that he receives
regular income throughout the year.
With-profit investments bonds can also pay out monthly but Shah of
London-based advisers William Mercer Fraser says: 'High rates of withdrawal
can lead to capital erosion. If withdrawals are taken for the with-profits
bond, it is important that the market value adjustment does not apply to
units encashed for that purpose.' The adjustment is a weapon of last resort
used to cushion the blow to a unitised fund by lowering the value of the
units if too many people withdraw from it.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pep confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL NUKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL equity plan investors, thinking of reducing their exposure to
equities by diversifying into bonds, could be forgiven if they ended the
week a little confused.
On the one hand Save &amp; Prosper began the embarrassing task of writing to
between 800 and 1,000 planholders informing them they would have to move out
of bonds if their Peps are to remain valid after April 6, while M &amp; G and
Fidelity are planning the launch of bond-led schemes.
The two apparently contradictory initiatives stem from an Inland Revenue
rule drafting error in July and its unprecedented decision to rewrite the
Pep rules retrospectively.
The result: Save &amp; Prosper, which launched its plan in September, has been
caught between rule and counter rule and its combined bond and equity pep
judged offside. M &amp; G and Fidelity have sidestepped the thrust of the new
regulations and are planning to launch virtually identical hybrid schemes.
The new rules, effective from April 6, will render any monies held in bond
or gilt-based unit and subject to full taxation. Plan-holders can invest up
to Pounds 1,500 in these so-called 'non-qualifying' funds.
Most of the affected investors hold units in Save &amp; Prosper's Pep Portfolio.
This controversial product, launched in September last year, exploited the
loophole and combined Pep investments in equity and bond-based unit trusts
for the first time.
Previously bond funds were not actively marketed by Pep managers because
investors who bought them had either to stop investing once the Pounds 1,500
limit had been reached or place the maximum Pounds 4,500 balance in single
shares which entail a relatively high risk.
The decision to rewrite the rules was taken by Stephen Dorrell, financial
secretary to the Treasury, who said the use of bond and gilt-based funds by
Peps violated the spirit of the original legislation.
'Peps were introduced to encourage people to invest in shares and I have
therefore decided that the regulations should be amended to correct the
position,' he said.
But Ken Emery, Save &amp; Prosper's technical director who is faced with moving
up to Pounds 2m of investors money into new funds, called the Inland
Revenue's action 'vindictive' and warned that many unitholders could end up
with invalid plans.
He was backed by the Unit Trust Association which said it would be writing
to the Treasury this week attacking the retrospective nature of the change
which it regards as 'objectionable in principle and unnecessary in
practice.'
Emery added: 'The Inland Revenue has admitted that it was its mistake but
has nevertheless introduced this change retrospectively.
'It is ridiculous that we could now offer - as others are - a 49 per cent
exposure to bonds, while the recommendation on the original product was that
investors hold only 25 per cent in bonds.
The new plan to be launched by M &amp; G will escape the new regulations
because, instead of investing directly in a bond-based unit trusts,
investors' money will initially be channeled into a qualifying fund of funds
which in turn will invest in bond and other fixed interest funds.
Fidelity's plan is also intended to meet the new rules, which stipulate that
Pep subscriptions to unit or investment trusts will only be valid if the
fund holds at least half its assets in equities.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: M &amp; G launches Treasury fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW option for the income-seeking investor has been created by the launch
of M &amp; G's Treasury fund. The unit trust will aim to provide a better return
than that provided by the instant access accounts of big building societies.
It will do so by investing around half the fund in Treasury bills issued by
the UK government, with the remainder in money market instruments, such as
bank bills or commercial paper.
The minimum investment in the fund will be Pounds 5,000, but investors will
be given a chequebook allowing them to transfer money into their bank or
building society account. Cheques must be for a minimum of Pounds 250 and
you will be allowed to write enough cheques to take your balance down to
Pounds 2,500.
Income will be distributed monthly and M &amp; G estimates that, as of November
30, the fund would have paid 6.06 per cent gross per annum, compared with an
average 5.15 per cent on investments of Pounds 5,000 in instant access
accounts from the top five building societies.
Although the income will be paid net of basic rate tax, non-taxpayers will
be able to reclaim the tax charge from the Inland Revenue.
Such funds are commonplace in the US, where investors have become
increasingly concerned about the safety of savings and loan institutions
(the American equivalent of building societies).
In the UK, money market funds have grown significantly only in the past few
years. The most obvious direct competitor to M &amp; G's new fund is Fidelity
Investments' cash account, which also grants a chequebook to those with
balances of over Pounds 5,000.
The Fidelity fund yields rather more (6.8 per cent this week) than M &amp; G's
and is more flexible - investors can use cheques to pay for large
transactions such as holidays, rather than simply make transfers into a bank
or building society.
However, the M &amp; G fund, because of its holding in Treasury bills, is lower
risk (although the risk in the Fidelity fund is very small).
There is no initial charge on either fund and annual fees are 0.6 per cent
on M &amp; G and 0.5 per cent on Fidelity. The income figures quoted above are
net of these charges.
It is good to see competition in this market; eventually such funds will
offer facilities such as standing orders and cashpoint withdrawals.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Twins who generate success - Bernice
Cohen explains her investment guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNICE COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEING a committed Do-It-Myself Investor (DIMI) I soon discovered the
importance of good timing coupled with share selection. These twins can
generate that happy outcome: investment success.
Capital growth, for a DIMI, has a high priority in portfolio planning.
During the expansionary 1980s, sharp share price rises occurred for
companies such as Glaxo, Guinness, Sainsbury and Rentokil. So I remain
optimistic of finding shares with great potential.
My search began with the writings of several investment writers. Jim Slater*
offers sound advice: start with the basics, find and adopt a good system,
then work on it to improve results. Peter Lynch** warns: 'Invest in stocks
to make money, not to preserve capital.'
For discovering small company shares with exceptional potential, William
O'Neil*** uses a mnemonic 'CAN SLIM'. My version of this covers extra
points. 'GAINS ARE FAST', outlined below, is my research detector for
unearthing mini-stocks with big prospects.
G: growth in earnings per share over the long term - at least a doubling
over five years.
A: annual earnings per share. The latest results should show growth of over
20 per cent.
I: institutional support. This helps to improve trading liquidity.
N: new products, management or a new high in the share price: niche markets
which confer strong growth advantages.
S: supply/demand for the shares. Small capitalisation plus demand encourages
a rising share price.
A: ambitious owner/managers. They are eager for success.
R: Rich in cash. Companies which have no debt and handle cash generating
products which fund growth without diluting earnings.
E: efficient management. It builds leading, not lagging, companies.
F: fundamental facts. They inform on the present and prospective share
price.
A: act if growth falters. I bale out rapidly on profit warnings, setbacks or
if a chart falls below its uptrend.
S: stock market direction. Few shares prosper in falling markets.
T: technical analysis. What does the share price chart imply? Charts give
guidance on buying and selling decisions and to assess the potential for a
share price rise.
Investment is a subjective, imprecise art. 'GAINS ARE FAST' incorporates a
belt and braces approach.
Airtours, a star 1991 performer - this week it bid for Owners Abroad -
illustrates the formula in action. Annual results in 1990 showed 'G' (growth
in earnings per share) of 220 per cent from 1986 to 1990, a rise from 8.5p
to 27.2p. One could also see 'A' (current annual earnings) growing by 31 per
cent and 'I' (institutional interest) rising through 1991 as Airtours'
improving prospects were recognised. In March, the new element 'N' occurred,
when Intasun, the UK's second largest tour operator collapsed, boosting
Airtours' market share.
The market capitalisation at the time was Pounds 23.7m with the share price
at 148p. This small 'S' (supply) - of 16.01m shares was further limited by
the large holding of chief executive/owner, David Crossland.
He is a typical example of 'A' (an ambitious owner) building his own
success. In December 1990 Airtours was also 'R' (rich in cash) with net cash
of Pounds 26m exceeding market capitalisation of Pounds 23.7m.
When Intasun collapsed, management quality enabled Airtours to harvest
bumper 1991 profits. It was 'E' (efficiently managed) to exploit this
unexpected advantage. The 90,000 bookings taken during the next week
represented more than Pounds 1m in profits.
In December 1990, the 'F' (fundamentals) were favourable. The dividend yield
was high (7.4 per cent) and the price earnings ratio (P/E) modest at 5. At
148p, five years' earnings would pay for the share. Knowing 1990s earnings
growth was 31 per cent, I can value a share by dividing what I get (earnings
growth) by what it costs (current P/E).
John Neff, a famous investor, devised this clever ratio. For good value,
growth divided by P/E must be higher than 2. For Airtours, 1990 earnings
growth divided by P/E gives a rating of 6.2, a sizeable under-valuation.
To judge the possible rise, I assumed continuing growth, while remaining
alert for setbacks. If 1991 earnings per share had risen 30 per cent to
35.4p, and the P/E rose to 10, the share price would reach 354p. A P/E rise
to 20 would have implied a share price of 708p.
To judge if this was feasible meant 'A' (actively monitoring) Airtours'
progress. News items in the summer hinted that analysts were
under-estimating its performance.
January is often a good month for equities. When the Gulf War began on Jan
16, 'S' (stock market direction) improved dramatically. From a closing low
of 2054.8 that day, the FTSE-100 reached 2459.1 on March 8, when Intasun
collapsed, and then reached a September 6 peak of 2667.4, providing a
bullish background.
Finally, 'T' (technical analysis). Was there guidance in the share's chart
in December 1990? From 148p, the price fell to a February 1991 low of 135p.
Then, a steady climb reached 184p by early March. This move created a
classic 'shallow dip' before the huge take-off. By September, channel lines
drawn to connect the rising highs implied a Pounds 12 target by spring 1992.
This exceeded my 'guesstimates' but underestimated the final outcome. The
price sustained several bursts, peaking in March 1992, at the equivalent of
Pounds 13.50, (ignoring the January 1992 scrip issue). The sell signal came
in May 1992, when the price fell through the lower channel line.
Clearly, Airtours had an exceptional 1991. While searching for another such
investment I try to resist diversifying into possibilities that fail some
'GAINS ARE FAST' rules. A King Penguin approach focuses me on one giant egg
(while earning interest on other cash assets).
Unearthing spectacular growth stocks is an exciting treasure hunt. William
O'Neil exhorts: 'Don't dabble in stocks. Dig in and do some real detective
work.'

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMKINS, the conglomerate which has just bought Ranks Hovis McDougall, the
bakery, milling and baking company, is expected to report on Monday interim
profits of Pounds 47m, up from Pounds 43.7m. Earnings per share are expected
to be up 8 eight per cent. Tomkins is expected to be enjoying the beginnings
of recovery in the US where it has extensive manufacturing operations.
TSB Group reports results for the year to October 31 on Thursday. Brokers
expect a modest recovery to profits of Pounds 80m before tax, against losses
of Pounds 47m in the previous year. The group is thought to have incurred a
big charge, estimated at more than Pounds 400m, to cover possible losses on
bad and doubtful debts. TSB chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison warned last week
that the second half had been unexpectedly bad.
Wednesday sees interim results from Dixons Group. They will depend on how
the electrical retailing group chooses to treat the Pounds 10m property
development profits. Assuming they are not taken at the pre-tax line,
taxable profits of about Pounds 10m are expected, against last time's Pounds
17.5m. Good growth in the UK retail side will lift profits to Pounds 20m
(Pounds 16m), while in the US, losses will also grow to Pounds 14m (Pounds
11m). Its comments on Christmas trading will also be of close interest.
The Rank Organisation, announcing preliminary results on Thursday for the
year ended October, is expected to reveal unchanged trading profits for its
managed businesses. But lower profits are expected at Rank Xerox, its
photocopier joint venture, while profits from its 50 per cent stake in the
Universal Studios theme park in Florida should be significantly higher.
Group pre-tax profits should be slightly lower at Pounds 245m (Pounds
250.5m), with the total dividend unchanged at 31p.
First Leisure is reporting preliminary results on Wednesday for its
financial year ended October. Pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from
Pounds 30.4m to between Pounds 30.6m and Pounds 32m.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The two plums at the top of the trust
tree - Philip Coggan compares the records of collective funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE consistent records of two firms of investment managers stand out from
the lists of the top performing unit and investment trusts over the past
decade.
Capel-Cure Asset Management has three unit trusts in the top five (and
another one, Capability Growth, not far behind) while the newly-merged
Henderson Touche Remnant has three investment trusts in the closed-end fund
top five.
Over a 10-year period, equities have traditionally outperformed other
financial investments, such as bonds or cash. When investing in an
equity-based fund such as a unit or investment trust, investors should not
be concentrating on a short-term period such as a year.
Three years is probably the minimum period over which equity investors have
a chance of seeing sufficient capital and dividend growth to overcome the
costs of investment and the risks of a short-term market fall. But the
three-year tables show that the short-term chart toppers are often highly
specialist. Among unit trusts, three of the leaders are based in the Hong
Kong market, which, until recently, had performed very strongly on the back
of hopes for the capitalist development of China.
But only a brave man would predict that Hong Kong funds will top the tables
over the next three years, given the political tensions between the colony
and the mainland.
In the investment trust field, the leaders over three years include two
venture capital funds (one of which, Manakin, is in the process of
liquidating itself); two zero coupon shares (which have benefited from
falling interest rates); and Templeton Emerging Markets, which seeks out the
potential of developing countries in areas such as Latin America and south
east Asia.
The 10-year champions come from the UK equity market (although this is
partly because there were fewer geographical specialist funds in 1983). Most
experts agree that the UK market should be the starting point for the
investor who wants to move into equities.
So how has Capel-Cure managed to produce its long-term success? Kenneth
Levy, who manages both Capability Special Situations and Capability Growth,
follows a strategy which he admits is remarkably similar to that advocated
by Jim Slater in his recent book The Zulu Principle. He looks for companies
which can show positive earnings growth over the past five years and which
have a price-earnings ratio which is attractive relative to the market, a
recent positive statement from the chairman and a strong balance sheet. He
also pays great attention to what is called the 'technical' position (how
the recent share price movements look on the charts) and likes to 'run with
the winners'.
Leonard Klahr, who runs N &amp; P UK Income (which used to be known as Key
Income) and Capability Income &amp; Growth, follows a different high-yield,
contrarian strategy. This was highly successful throughout most of the 1980s
but has run into problems in the past two years as the recession cut into
companies' dividend-paying ability.
Some would argue that 10 years is too long a period on which to judge unit
trusts, since the good performance might have occurred many years ago under
a different manager and thus may not be relevant to current prospects.
As the article 'How to beat the average' on page VI indicates, there is some
evidence that the investor would do well to pick trusts which have been top,
or consistently above average, performers in the past. Both Capability
Special Situations and Capability Growth are in the top quartile (best 25
per cent) of their sector over one, three, five and 10 years, while
Capability Income &amp; Growth is above average in its sector over one, three,
five and 10 years. However, N &amp; P UK Income has been below average over the
three and five-year periods.
The James Capel Income fund has managed to increase its dividend by more
than the rate of inflation for all but two years since it was launched in
1975. The fund aims for a yield equal to around 125 per cent of that on the
FT-A All-Share Index. John Knight, who has managed the fund for the past
three years, says he looks for stocks with the best combination of dividend
yield, growth potential and cash flow. The James Capel fund has a consistent
record with above-average performances in its sector over one, three, five
and ten years.
Two of the top investment trust performers (Law Debenture and TR City of
London) have had the same fund manager for much of the past 10 years  -
Michael Moule. According to TR's Paul Manduca, Moule owes his success to a
concentration on larger companies (small stocks have underperformed over the
past few years), no exposure to the unquoted sector and little investment
overseas in a decade when sterling was relatively strong.
The trust which is top of the tables - Capital Gearing - is a real oddity.
It is small (a market capitalisation of Pounds 8.3m as of January 1),
invests exclusively in the shares of other trusts and has achieved the knack
of standing at a premium to assets (although not at the moment).
The investment trust figures are calculated on a mid-market to mid-market
basis with net income reinvested (unit trust performances, as usual, are
based on offer-to-bid with net income reinvested; all figures from
Micropal). Some would argue that investment trusts are best judged on net
asset value performance, since this measures what the managers have actually
achieved with the portfolio.
But to private investors, it is the return they actually receive which
counts, and taking advantage of narrowing discounts is all part of the skill
of trust investment. Nevertheless, small investors deciding between unit and
investment trusts should realise that the basis for calculations modestly
favours the latter; a mid-market basis does not reflect all the costs of
dealing or indeed income reinvestment. And, of course, discounts can widen
as well as narrow.

TOMKINS, the conglomerate which has just bought Ranks Hovis McDougall, the
bakery, milling and baking company, is expected to report on Monday interim
profits of Pounds 47m, up from Pounds 43.7m. Earnings per share are expected
to be up eight per cent. Tomkins is expected to be enjoying the beginnings
of recovery in the US where it has extensive manufacturing operations.
Wednesday sees interim results from Dixons Group. They will depend on how
the electrical retailing group chooses to treat the Pounds 10m property
development profits. Assuming they are not taken at the pre-tax line,
taxable profits of about Pounds 10m are expected, against last time's Pounds
17.5m. Good growth in the UK retail side will lift profits to Pounds 20m
(Pounds 16m), while in the US, losses will also grow to Pounds 14m (Pounds
11m). Its comments on Christmas trading will also be of close interest.
The Rank Organisation, announcing preliminary results on Thursday for the
year ended October, is expected to reveal unchanged trading profits for its
managed businesses. But lower profits are expected at Rank Xerox, its
photocopier joint venture, while profits from its 50 per cent stake in the
Universal Studios theme park in Florida should be significantly higher.
Group pre-tax profits should be slightly lower at Pounds 245m (Pounds
250.5m), with the total dividend unchanged at 31p.
First Leisure is reporting preliminary results on Wednesday for its
financial year ended October. Pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from
Pounds 30.4m to between Pounds 30.6m and Pounds 32m. Assuming Pounds 30.6m,
earnings will fall to 15.5p (15.67p) after a higher tax charge, and a 10 per
cent rise in the total dividend to 6.25p is expected.
Securicor, the security and parcels delivery group, is forecast to unveil a
sharp jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 33m to Pounds 54m for the year on
Thursday. Its share of Cellnet, the cellular telephone network, is the main
contributor, pitching in Pounds 47.5m. Earnings should rise to 23p (16.7p)
and the total dividend to 2.7p (2.336p).

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Disclosure ruling is needed - Eric
Short thinks spouses should have pension information rights / Planning your
Pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT in a pension, whether through a personal pension or a company
scheme, usually represents the largest and most important savings by
individuals. For most people, a pension will provide the bulk of income in
retirement.
So individuals need to understand the progress of their pension
arrangements. They need to know the likely pension provided and the current
value of accrued benefits should the arrangement be discontinued or
transferred.
At one time, employees in company schemes were given little or no
information. Now, employers and scheme trustees are legally obliged to
provide employees with certain information.
The format depends on the type of scheme. There are different requirements
for final salary schemes and for money purchase schemes.
Disclosure regulations concerning final salary schemes require employers and
trustees to provide certain information at an employee's request or to make
that information available for inspection. An employee can only seek such
information once every 12 months.
However, the most convenient means of fulfilling this legal obligation on
disclosure is for employers and trustees to provide employees with an annual
benefit statement automatically and to provide employees and scheme
pensioners with an annual report and accounts.
The annual report will include details of scheme income, spending and
investments, changes in assets over the year, changes in membership numbers
and changes in benefit structure, including details of pension increases.
There will also be the annual report of the trustees, and details of the
last actuarial valuation of the scheme.
However, interesting though the annual report and accounts may be, employees
will find their annual benefit statement of far greater value in planning
their retirement income.
This statement usually shows the employee's salary or earnings, the
pensionable salary or earnings if different, the amount of contributions
paid over the 12 months, the cash sum and spouse's pension entitlement
should the employee die at the time of the statement, the employee's pension
from normal retirement age and the spouse's pension - all based on the
employee's current pensionable salary.
The retirement pension expressed as a percentage of the employee's salary
shows whether the company pension, together with the basic state pension,
would be sufficient to provide a reasonable income in retirement.
If not, then the employee can boost his pension benefits through an AVC
(Additional Voluntary Contribution) arrangement.
However, there are gaps in the information provided in the benefit
statement. The disclosure regulations give trustees the choice of showing
either the benefits at normal retirement or the current benefits if the
employee ceased being a member of the scheme at the time of the statement,
but not both benefits.
In the current employment market, with employees moving jobs frequently,
employees need to know their current transfer benefits and early retirement
benefits as much as they need to know the benefits at normal retirement.
They have the right to ask for these benefits from scheme administrators.
But many employees are reluctant to ask in case the employer becomes aware
of the request and the wrong impression is conveyed to the employer, even
though such requests are supposed to be confidential.
Some schemes do provide transfer benefits on the benefit statement
automatically. But it would be better for both employees and employer if it
were obligatory to provide both benefits on transfer and at normal pension
age and possibly the minimum benefits at certain early retirement ages.
The disclosure requirements for money purchase schemes are different. All
that is certain on a money purchase scheme is the value of accumulated
benefits to date relating to the employee and essentially that information
has to be provided to employees.
If the scheme is on a unitised with-profits basis, then the benefit
statement would show the contributions paid, the bonus added for the year
and the accumulated value, often split into the guaranteed additions and the
bonus additions.
If the scheme is on a unit-linked basis, then the statement would show the
year's contributions, units purchased with those contributions and the total
number of units on the employee's account. The unit value(s) at the date of
the statement should be shown.
The statement should also show the current transfer value of the accumulated
fund, whether with-profits or unit-linked, thus showing the penalty that
would be applied should the employee wish to transfer the accumulated value
to another arrangement.
However, OPAS (Occupational Pensions Advisory Service) reports that it has
received a number of complaints on transfer values from money purchase
schemes where the benefit statement did not show the transfer benefits, in
spite of the legal requirement to do so.
But, while the benefit statement shows the size of the employee's
accumulated fund at present, it gives little idea of what the ultimate
benefits are likely to be and whether the pension at retirement will be
sufficient. Some schemes do provide employees with an illustration of likely
benefits at retirement. But since most money purchase schemes are through
life companies, the illustration has to conform with Lautro requirements.
The Lautro basis is highly misleading, showing just the accumulated fund at
retirement on two rates of interest - the new rates will be 6 per cent and
12 per cent - with no account taken of inflation except to provide an
incomprehensible general inflation statement. The employee needs to know the
pension secured by the accumulated sum.
The annuity invariably used is the highest possible rate - a level annuity
on the life of the employee with no spouse's benefit. The Department of
Social Security needs to grapple with this defect in providing employees
with information on money purchase schemes. But it should also consider
disclosure to spouses.
Spouses of employees are potential beneficiaries of company pension schemes.
Yet the only information to which they are entitled is general details of
the scheme, such as that it provides a spouse's pension of a given
percentage of the employee's pension. Only when they become beneficiaries on
the death of their partner do they become entitled to information. Until
then, they rely on their partner keeping them informed.
The dangers of such reliance were highlighted by OPAS when it received a
complaint from an elderly woman who found her pension stopped on the death
of her husband, in spite of assurances from the husband that she would be
looked after. OPAS found that the husband had done nothing to provide a
spouse's pension despite assurances to his wife.
Spouses should be told what their partner's benefits will be.
This is the last piece in this series.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A bigger dose of gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL this week offered cold comfort to those finding difficulty in
meet their monthly mortgage payments by predicting it would take another
three years before the number of repossessions fell.
The UK's second-largest lender believes that 64,000 homes will be
repossessed this year, with another 62,000 in 1994 and 59,000 in 1995. The
record figure was in 1991 when 75,540 homes were repossessed by lenders.
The forecast is based on gloomy predictions on employment and house prices.
Abbey expects unemployment to continue rising until 1994 from 2.9m at
present to 3.3m. It also expects house prices to fall by a further three per
cent this year but expects them to rise by two per cent, five per cent and
seven per cent respectively in the following three years.
Final figures for repossessions in 1992 will be released later this month.
There were 35,750 repossessions in the first half of of the year and the
Council of Mortgage Lenders says it expects the total to be about 70,000.
The reduction in repossessions is thought mainly to be the result of
increased flexibility by lenders, rather than fewer people falling into
mortgage arrears. The council has said that lenders preferred to accept
reduced monthly payments from their borrowers rather than take possession of
a house which, in an already depressed market, might take some time to sell,
and could sell for less than the value of the outstanding mortgage.
One consequence of a more flexible policy by lenders has been a significant
increase in the number of those falling into mortgage arrears. The council
estimated 89,000 borrowers had fallen behind in their payments at the end of
1989, rising to 300,000 by the end of last June.
Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, said this week that while the
number of repossession orders in England and Wales had dropped by 16 per
cent from 55,563 in 1991 to 46,422 last year, it had been offset by the
number of suspended orders. These had increased by six per cent during the
first nine months of last year compared with the same period in 1991 - from
50,127 to 53,150.
The process meant a possession order was made in favour of the lender but
was then suspended if the borrower agreed to comply with certain terms. If
those were broken, the possession order took effect. Sheila McKechnie,
director of Shelter, the housing charity, said: 'Unless there has been a
realistic assessment of repayments, this suspended order is equivalent to a
repossession.'
According to Shelter, the number of homeowners threatened with repossession
and seeking advice at its centres increased by 50 per cent last year.
Meanwhile, mortgage holders should still contact their lenders if they
foresee payment problems.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Policyholders wait anxiously for
pay-outs - As the 'bonus season' begins, John Authers answers your questions
on mortgage endowments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THIS moment, a bunch of actuaries could be deciding the value of the
investment which will pay off your mortgage.
The annual 'bonus season', when extra bonuses are added on to the value of
life assurance policies under the arcane 'with-profits' system has now
started (see box on right). The exact amount to be passed on to
policyholders is at the discretion of the actuary.
And, as the table shows, the trend for pay-outs is downwards. This might
seem odd at first, as both bonds and equities, in which life funds are
mostly invested, performed strongly last year.
Unfortunately, investment performance is only one of several factors
actuaries must consider when paying out maturity values. And the legacies of
the past, combined with a future outlook which could bring lower returns and
lower inflation, have in many cases more than cancelled out the funds'
recent gains.
Policyholders will now have many questions:
Why have pay-outs dropped?
The market fell in 1990. Actuaries assumed this was a blip and did not cut
bonuses. The subsequent recovery has not been strong enough to cancel out
1990, so pay-outs have to come down even though markets have gone up.
Other factors are in play. Returns are expected to be lower in future, and
so the companies need to reduce reversionary bonus. Once these have been
announced they are committed to them, so they are not going to announce a
rate which they cannot sustain.
Then, actuaries must look at their volume of business. It is easy to
announce a high maturity value if only a few policies are maturing in the
next year. But when a large volume of policies is about to mature, the music
stops - a generous pay-out will cost serious money.
This lies behind Sun Alliance's particularly savage 15 per cent cut in
10-year pay-outs. A cut of this magnitude after a good year seems almost
impossible to justify on logical grounds, but Sun Alliance wrote a lot of
10-year business 10 years ago. Those who bought one of their policies in
1983 must be wishing they had bought a year earlier.
Are with-profits endowments a good investment?
This is the tricky one. As pay-outs have been artificially high for the past
few years, they are of no use in predicting future returns.
But pay-outs, after the latest drastic round of pruning, must be closer to
reality than they were and investors in most companies can have few
complaints. The annualised return from Commercial Union is 13.2 per cent
over 10 years and 13.3 per cent over 25 years. The equivalent figures for
Norwich Union are 13.0 per cent and 12.9 per cent, while Sun Alliance showed
yields of 9.9 per cent and 11.9 per cent.
These figures are comfortably in excess of inflation, which averaged 9.1 per
cent over the past 25 years and 5.5 per cent over 10 years. Norwich Union
points out that as recently as 1985, 10-year policies were yielding less
than inflation. Offices still predict that real returns will be maintained.
The question of whether they are the best available long-term investment now
hinges on the circumstances of the investor. The policies are not as
tax-efficient as other long-term vehicles - most obviously personal equity
plans and pensions - and they are very inflexible. If you surrender early,
you will not receive the full value of what your money has earned.
High commissions to intermediaries and the expense of life assurance, which
many people do not need when they are making an investment, make it an
expensive way to invest. Too many people surrender their policies,
indicating that a 25 year inflexible policy is not the best product to be
selling to the mass market.
But for those who can take the commitment, returns are still satisfactory.
Will they succeed in repaying the mortgage?
Several commentators have suggested that they may not. Much of this is
premature.
When premiums are quoted for a mortgage endowment, the standard practice is
to assume that no terminal bonus will be paid, while reversionary bonus will
continue throughout the term of the policy at only 80 per cent of its level
at the start. Terminal bonus often makes up more than half of the final
pay-out on a 25-year policy, so this is very conservative. At present,
maturing endowments provide investors with massive profits compared with the
amount they borrowed.
However, Guardian Royal Exchange's decision not to pay any terminal bonus at
all on its 10-year policy this year, the first time it has failed to do so
since 1968, will not bolster confidence in this area.
For unitised with-profits contracts, a straight growth rate is assumed,
currently around 8.5 per cent, before charges. That does not appear onerous.
But if inflation and returns stay low, 8.5 per cent might be a problem. For
Norwich Union, annual nominal growth of 8.25 per cent is needed to repay a
mortgage in full 25 years from now. Those who took out policies in 1988 or
1990 now need the fund to achieve 10 per cent annual growth for the rest of
its term for the mortgage to be paid off in full.
About a decade will pass before anyone can tell whether this is too
optimistic. A spokesman for NU said the 'vast majority' of policyholders
should be able to meet capital repayment, and it would be many years before
it became clear whether those who took their policies out a few years ago
would have difficulties.
Anyone whose endowment is more than half way through its term has little to
worry about. The high reversionary bonuses slapped on during the 1980s leave
the fund with little left to do to meet requirements.
Marianne Cantley of Scottish Provident calculated this by working out the
annual reversionary bonuses which would need to be added to policies over
the rest of their term for them to meet their target. If you took out a
policy last year, you will need average annual bonuses of 4.55 per cent.
This figure drops to 4.49 for policies started in 1990, and 4.42 for 1988.
However, those who started in time to catch the genuine growth of the early
1980s, have little to worry about. Any policy taken out in 1974 or earlier
has already reached its target, according to Cantley, and need not pay any
more bonuses at all. Policies started in 1976 need 0.22 per cent annual
bonuses, and those in 1978 need 1.52 per cent.
If policies are likely to undershoot, this should become clear some years
before maturity, and the industry has pledged to monitor policies and advise
customers when they need to raise their premiums. Unitised with-profits has
made this easier for offices to administer.
But no rule states all your mortgage saving should be with one life company.
Those who took out their endowments in 1988 or 1989, and can afford to save
more, might supplement the policy with savings into a unit or investment
trust. If done through a Pep this will be more tax-efficient than an
endowment.
But a final point, provided by John Hyland of Standard Life, should reassure
those who fear endowments' problems could spell financial ruin. If
endowments fail to meet their target, this will presumably be because
inflation and returns have been low. These conditions usually correlate with
low mortgage interest rates. If endowments look as though they will not do
their job, your interest payments will be less, giving you more money to
make supplementary savings.
Correction. A bar chart covering policy payouts over 10 years which appeared
in yesterday's FT, used figures based on premiums of Pounds 30 per month,
not Pounds 50 per month as stated. The correct figures are shown in the
table.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Conventional with-profit endowment pay-outs are made up of the following:
The Sum Assured
When you start paying premiums, a minimum sum is guaranteed to you either
when you die (these policies started out as life insurance vehicles) or when
the policy matures. This sum will usually be set at a level slightly less
than the value of all the premiums paid in by the end of the policy.
Reversionary Bonuses
These bonuses, sometimes called annual bonuses, are added to the sum assured
each year, and once declared cannot be taken away, provided the policy
continues to maturity.
Such bonuses need to be backed by low-risk, fixed-interest investments for
the guarantees to be made. Some offices have multiple reversionary bonus
structures, with bonuses added on both to the sum assured and to the accrued
total of reversionary bonuses.
Terminal Bonuses
When the policy has matured, a terminal bonus may be added. This will be a
proportion of the accrued reversionary bonuses on the sum assured, and
allows actuaries to take the latest market conditions into account. These
bonuses add an element of volatility, as they are not guaranteed from one
year to the next, so they will not, as a rule, appear on an annual bonus
statement.
Unitised With-Profits
In the past decade, insurers have introduced a new form of with-profits
contract in which investors buy units with each premium. The value of the
units increases steadily in line with bonuses announced at the start of the
year. This avoids the need to make reserves for the entire sum assured from
the word go, which makes life easier for the office and helps with
administration - it is much easier to vary premiums under this form of
contract.
Surrender Values
Most policyholders do not keep their policy until it matures. If so, unless
they sell it, they will receive only a surrender value, which is worked out
using a different set of calculations from the bonuses which make up the
pay-outs on a conventional policy. Investment returns will have an effect,
but you will not necessarily receive all the accrued reversionary bonuses if
you surrender a policy early.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More income funds cut their payouts in 1992 than raised them, according to
new research. Exactly half the funds (60 out of 120) monitored by Income
Fund Analysis, the Welsh-based group, cut their payouts, although 20 of
these made reductions of less than 5 per cent. However, 53 funds managed to
increase payouts, led by Merlin Income unit trust with a rise of 36.4 per
cent. For further details ring Income Fund Analysis on 0492-875410.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Markets: New FT index launched - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A new FT index was launched this week. The FT-SE Small Cap Index will
measure the performance of 450 smaller companies; together with the FT-SE
100 and the FT-SE Mid 250, it is one of the three components of the
All-Share Index, which has been extended to include 800 companies.
Meanwhile, smaller companies shares continue to rally. The Hoare Govett
Smaller Companies index rose 3.6 per cent from 1208.87 to 1252.69 over the
week from December 30 to January 7; while the County Smaller Companies Index
increased 3.8 per cent from 932.86 to 968.43 over the same period.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices fell in December according to both Nationwide and Halifax
building societies. The graph above (left) shows the falls recorded by the
Nationwide index which found that house prices dropped by 0.2 per cent
between November and December.
The average house price was down by 8.4 per cent last year, according to
Nationwide; while Halifax recorded a slightly lower fall of 7.8 per cent for
the year but a drop of 0.6 per cent in December. Both Nationwide and Halifax
said the greater interest shown by prospective buyers was one factor
indicating that prices should stabilise by the summer.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Markets: The principal uncertainty is big v small - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that it is impossible to measure
accurately both where an object is and how fast it is moving. The very act
of measuring subtly shifts the object being measured; you can either measure
its position or its velocity, but not both at once.
Watching the performance of the new FT-SE Mid 250 index over the past weeks,
it has been easy to imagine that some similar principle has been at work.
Last autumn's introduction of the index - which measures the 250 companies
which rank just below the FT-SE 100 in terms of market capitalisation -
coincided with the beginning of a sustained period of outperformance by
second-tier stocks.
Since it was introduced on October 12 1992, the Mid 250 has outperformed the
FT-SE 100 by 11 1/2 per cent. This week, for example, the FT-SE 100 dropped
62.3 points, to close at 2799.2, but the Mid 250 rose 36.3 points, to close
at 2932.7. Has the fact that it is now easy to see, minute by minute, what
is happening to the broad middle of the London market helped to create a
self-fulfilling upward spiral in second-tier stocks?
The facts do not support the case. As the chart shows, the two indices have
moved in opposite directions - relative to the market as a whole - on a
noticeable cycle.
The most spectacular feature of the chart is the big relative upswing of the
second-tier stocks in the 1980s boom. That was followed by a two-year period
during which the blue chips had the advantage. Since the end of 1990, big
and mid-sized stocks have bumped up and down in regular patterns, with the
Mid 250 tracing a substantial move upwards from the autumn of last year.
Is the Mid 250's latest period of outperformance about to draw to a
temporary close, as the Warburg analysts suggested this week?
One way of answering this question is to look at the factors which influence
the Mid 250's performance. Some sectors are much more heavily represented in
the Mid 250 than in the FT-SE 100. Building Materials, for example, which
outperformed the broad market by 11 per cent in the closing three months of
1992. makes up 6.4 per cent of the Mid 250, but only 0.7 per cent of the
FT-SE 100.
Other cyclical industries - such as motor retailing, contracting and
construction, and electricals - are also much more heavily represented in
the Mid 250. Many of these have been big gainers from the post-devaluation
market, as investors have looked for companies that stand to benefit from
the expected recovery in the UK economy.
Perhaps the biggest difference in sectoral composition, however, lies in the
health and household stocks. These companies - the big international drug
companies, such as Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham - make up 12.1 per
cent of the FT-SE 100 index, but only 2.6 per cent of the Mid 250. As a
whole, the health and household sector has underperformed the market by 19
per cent since September's devaluation. This week, for example, Glaxo
dropped 61p to 732p; SmithKline Beecham fell 28p to 468p; and Wellcome lost
23p to 944p. These stocks alone are enough to account for a sizeable chunk
of the FT-SE's underperformance.
A modest market capitalisation and membership of a favoured sector did not
help one company this week: Lilley, the Glasgow-based contracting and
construction group collapsed with debts of more than Pounds 80m. Its shares
were trading at 60 1/2 p as recently as March 1991; by last Friday they had
reached 7 1/4 p, and on Wednesday, lacking the support of two out of its six
banks, the company went into receivership.
Another unexpected event of the week was a sudden burst of excitement in the
bid for Evode, the glue-maker. Wassall, the mini-conglomerate, had appeared
to be grinding its way unexcitingly towards a takeover. But on Friday,
minutes after Wassall had announced its final offer, a white knight entered
the fray.
Laporte, which trails ICI by several miles but still qualifies for the title
of Britain's second largest chemical company, said it would shortly be
making a friendly bid. Ken Minton, Laporte's chief executive had carefully
prepared the ground by approaching Andrew Simon, Evode's chairman, as early
as 1986. 'After the Wassall bid was announced, Andrew Simon's first call
after talking to his bankers was to me,' said Minton. On Friday, Laporte
offered more, and Wassall promptly threw in the towel.
With the Evode battle seemingly wrapped up, there was nothing to distract
the market from the fate of Owners Abroad, the UK's second-largest
package-tour operator. On Wednesday, the company was the victim of a hostile
takeover bid from Airtours, the next-largest operator. The bid, all in
shares, is worth Pounds 215m.
There are several tricky elements in the calculation. First, the bid is
conditional on Owners Abroad shareholders turning down a proposal from
Thomas Cook, the travel agent chain controlled by a German regional bank, to
take a 10 per cent stake in the company.
Second, it faces potential competition scrutiny, since Airtours, Owners
Abroad and Thomson (the market leader) between them have 60 per cent of the
package holiday market - though Airtours believes the deal will be nodded
through.
Third, Westdeutsche Landesbank (Thomas Cook's owner) might choose to become
more directly involved, to try to block the deal. And fourth, all-paper
offers have been out of favour since the end of the 1980s boom.
It is not surprising that the market thinks Airtours will have to do more to
achieve success. Its shares closed on Friday at 288p, down 12p on the week;
Owners Abroad rose 22 1/2 p to 119p - that is, 11p higher than the value of
the Airtours bid.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Markets: Traders struggle to decipher smoke signals - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS not an auspicious start to the New Year. Three days of confused,
directionless trading followed by a worrying 36-point drop in the Dow on
Thursday that set alarm bells ringing on Wall Street.
The only bright spot was the heavy trading volume (more than 300m shares
changed hands on Thursday alone), which delighted the brokerage firms who
earn commissions handling customers' orders.
Yet the heavy volume may be a warning sign of sorts. Some analysts see it as
a reflection of the indecisiveness that has plagued the market since the
final days of last year. Investors are uncertain about the short-term
direction of equities, so they have been frantically switching in and out of
individual stocks or sectors in search of either growth opportunities or a
safe haven.
Many buyers were turning to small stocks for comfort - the Nasdaq composite
index surged to a new record high mid week - but that was itself another
cause for concern. Many Nasdaq stocks are regarded as speculative
investments, and therefore more prone to sudden reversals of the kind that
could trigger a market-wide retreat.
The chief worry among investors is that with shares looking relatively
expensive in relation to earnings and dividends, a substantial correction is
around the next corner.
That corner may, in fact, have already been turned. The plunge in stocks on
Thursday was the market's steepest one-day loss in three months. By
mid-morning yesterday, the Dow was another 30 points lower as the downward
momentum began to build up. Although prices later recovered some of their
lost ground, the market's mood remained fragile.
Ironically, while stocks have stumbled, the economic fundamentals have
continued to improve. The latest figures on construction spending this week
showed a big increase consumer confidence also rose again, and there was a
healthy drop in weekly state unemployment insurance claims. Although
yesterday's December jobs report was a little disappointing - non-farm
payrolls rose by 64,000, and not 80,000 as economists had predicted - the
numbers were still moving in the right direction.
There was also some good news from an international perspective, in the
shape of Thursday's modest cut in German interest rates. The move raised
hopes that the Bundesbank will begin to ease policy by degrees, a process
which would help Europe's ailing economies and give a welcome lift to demand
for US exports.
In spite of the brightening economic backdrop, the stock markets remained
glum. They were not helped by the threat of renewed conflict in the Middle
East, nor by a steep plunge in government bond prices. The fall in bonds was
a reaction to the economic figures and to competition from a big influx of
new corporate debt. It was also a reflection of growing concern about the
incoming President's willingness to tackle the federal budget deficit.
The latter could become a significant factor in financial markets over the
coming months. After the final budget figures of the Bush administration
were released this week showing a likely 1993 deficit significantly larger
than expected, President-elect Clinton quickly backed away from his campaign
pledge to halve the deficit in four years.
The back-pedalling frightened bond investors, who, in the aftermath of the
election in November, were willing to give the Democrats the benefit of the
doubt on deficit-reduction policies. The bond market's honeymoon with
President-elect Clinton, however, is over, and sunny optimism has been
replaced by suspicion.
Any regular visitor to the US will have noticed that during weekdays the
pavements outside big office buildings in some cities are often cluttered
with people quietly puffing away on the cigarettes that they are not
permitted to light in the warmth and comfort of their own offices.
The sight could become even more familiar following the Environmental
Protection Agency's decision this week to declare that 'passive', or
'second-hand' smoke is a significant carcinogen that causes about 3,000
deaths a year.
Although tobacco companies contested the EPA's findings, concern about the
legal implications of the agency's ruling, combined with rumours that New
York legislators were considering doubling state cigarette taxes, provoked
heavy selling of tobacco stocks.
Philip Morris bore the brunt, partly because the company was also the
subject of a brokers' report claiming that sales of its top brand
cigarettes, Marlboro, have been slipping. On Wednesday, the stock hit a low
of Dollars 71 3/4 , a steep decline from its September high of Dollars 86
5/8 , before enjoying a modest rally at the end of the week.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Markets: Keep your eye on dividends - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY investor knows that there are two ways to make money from shares -
dividends and capital gains. But, as stockbrokers James Capel pointed out
this week, it is the growth in dividends that is the key to share price
outperformance.
James Capel has calculated that the share price of a group of 24 companies
for which it is forecasting annual dividend growth of more than than 12 per
cent over the next two years rose on average, by 25 per cent more than the
stock market in the last year.
Investors long since realised that on a long-term view shares should be
better investments than fixed interest stocks as the risk of investing in
equities is more than offset by the fact that dividends (usually) grow, but
fixed interest coupons cannot.
Further, an investment theory first expounded more than 30 years ago has it
that the amount a company pays in dividends is irrelevant to a company's
value. It is the company's future earnings power - out of which dividends
will eventually be paid - which matters.
James Capel argues that while this rule may be true in the long term, in the
short term a company's dividend policy will affect its share price. At times
such as these when dividend cuts and receiverships are in the air, investors
put a higher value on actual cash than on theoretical future gains.
The problem now facing companies is that dividend cover, the number of times
a dividend can be paid out of earnings, has fallen to an historically low
level. Many companies kept paying dividends through the recession in spite
of falling profits, some making payments out of reserves rather than current
profits.
James Capel says that 'with the onset of recession in 1990-91, earnings fell
by 14 per cent, but dividends rose by the same amount. This attempt to
maintain dividend growth at an unrealistic rate raised the payout ratio of
industrial companies to an unsustainable level'.
As a result, in 1992 dividend cuts became more frequent, and dividends for
industrial companies are likely to have fallen slightly over the year. But
equity strategists are now expecting a rise in dividends in 1993, though by
a slower rate than earnings growth.
At County NatWest the forecast for the industrial group is for an increase
in dividends of between 5 and 6 per cent, slightly ahead of the expected
inflation rate. However, earnings growth of around 15 per cent is expected
by the strategists there - and over 20 per cent by the analysts.
There are a few cuts still to come, says County NatWest, and dividend growth
will lag earnings because of the cover problem.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd has a slightly lower forecast of dividend growth, of
4 per cent in 1993 and again in 1994. That would mean little or no real
growth when BZW's inflation forecasts are taken into account.
Again the level of cover is cited as holding back dividends. 'Payout ratios
are not going to be rebuilt that quickly,' says Michael Hughes at BZW.
But he argues that this is not necessarily a negative story. Companies which
are using their earnings to reinvest in their businesses rather than paying
it to investors, could in the longer term be in a better position to pay
higher dividends than if they pay more out now.
Thus, the theories about total return - from dividends and capital gains -
and the irrelevance of dividend payments, come back to suggest that total
returns could be better if dividend growth is not as rapid as investors
might hope.
Even so, as Hughes suggests, the policy to pursue in the short term might be
to select shares on high yields, where the dividend is covered, as these may
offer better capital gains too.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Markets: Tied agents and 'best advice' - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREPARE to strengthen your letterboxes. National Westminster customers will
already have received some mailshots from their bank's new life arm, and
more are sure to follow.
With more than 1,400 unit trusts in existence, the world is not crying out
for another nine, but that is what NatWest is giving us. The range is much
as you would expect: UK general, UK income, UK equity growth, gilt and fixed
interest, Japan, Far East, Europe and North America, with a fund of funds on
top.
But cost-cutting initiatives in charging have passed NatWest Life by.
Initial charges are 5.25 per cent across the range (even on the gilt trust,
where many managers have cut upfront fees or even abolished them). Annual
fees are mostly 1.25 per cent with the exceptions of the gilt fund, where
the annual fee is only 0.5 per cent, and the fund of funds, where a 0.5 per
cent charge is levied on top of the fee imposed by the underlying trusts.
Other trusts, such as Gartmore's. impose lower fees and aim to track the
index. Since most actively managed funds have failed to beat the index in
the past, one might imagine that an adviser giving 'best advice' would find
it hard to recommend the NatWest unit trusts ahead of lower charging trusts,
or indeed trusts with exceptional long-term track records such as Capability
Special Situations (see pIV).
Under a section 'How do I choose a unit trust?', the NatWest brochure
explains: 'A meeting with your NatWest adviser should give you the necessary
information to help you determine a suitable choice.' However, elsewhere in
the brochure, we learn: 'Your NatWest adviser is only able to supply
information on the packaged products of the said marketing group'. In other
words, your adviser can only 'advise' on products offered by NatWest Life.
So if, in a year's time, NatWest's unit trusts are bottom of the performance
tables, the 'advisers' will still be recommending them. 'Best advice' is, as
you can see, a strange concept.
I suppose a second hand car salesman could call himself a 'motoring adviser'
on the basis that he makes comments such as: 'I shouldn't go for a Fiat,
mate, you can't get the parts. You're always safe with a Ford'. But he would
never advise you to go to 'Honest John's used cars' instead.
In the world of finance, there are people who can recommend the best
products from a range of companies - they are called independent financial
advisers. It would be better for the consumer if tied agents (salesmen in
plain language), were not allowed to use the same term.
To be fair to NatWest, its new policy is the same as that followed by other
big banks. And it will retain a independent advisory arm to which customers
can be referred. NatWest also says its tied agents will tell people, where
appropriate, that they might be better off in, say, national savings, even
though the agent cannot do the deal. I would be keen to hear from NatWest
customers if they do indeed get such unbiased recommendations.
In April, I wrote about the investment theories of Michael O'Higgins*, a US
fund manager who had developed a way of beating the Dow Jones index, which
can be easily used by the small investor. It involved circling the 10 stocks
in the Dow (which has 30 constituents) with the highest yields and then
ticking off the five of those with the lowest share prices. Those five
become the portfolio for the year; after a calendar year, the whole process
was repeated. If stocks did not reappear in the list they were automatically
sold.
O'Higgins found that between 1973 and 1991 a portfolio chosen in this
fashion had produced average annual returns of 19.4 per cent, compared with
10.4 per cent from the Dow Jones.
I tested this theory for the UK, using the FT-30 index and found that
between 1979 and 1992, an O'Higgins portfolio achieved annual returns
(including income reinvested) of just under 22 per cent, compared with
around 17.5 per cent from the All-Share.
In April, the five stocks indicated by the system were Asda, Lucas, Royal
Insurance, Hanson and BP. Had investors bought those stocks then, their
capital growth to date would have been 29.7 per cent, compared with a rise
in the All-Share of 7.4 per cent over the same period.
Thus encouraged, I thought it was worthwhile conducting the exercise for the
start of 1993. The exercise produces the following stocks: Blue Circle
(199p, 7.5 per cent); British Gas (291.5p, 6.1 per cent); Forte (188p, 7.0
per cent); Hanson (233.5p, 6.3 per cent); and Lucas (132p, 7.1 per cent).
The figures are from the FT of January 2.
Four important caveats. These are definitely not the FT's share
recommendations ; the O'Higgins method does not claim to beat the Index
every year, only over a period of time; the method only works if you buy all
five stocks, not just one or two; and just because it has worked in the
past, does not mean it will in future.

FT  09 JAN 93 / The Long View: Bonds may deliver KO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER

<TEXT>
SO THE fund managers had another bumper year in equities and the dogged
minority who put their faith in fixed interest gilts have once again been
forced to take a rain check.
That is the kind way to interpret the latest figures from the performance
measurement specialists at the WM Company, which showed that British pension
funds earned a total return, taking capital and income together, of between
19 and 20 per cent in 1992.
A more realistic verdict might be that the trustees and fund managers of the
average pension fund, which continues to hold a whopping 78 per cent of its
assets in equities, were saved by the bell. Were it not for sterling's
dramatic exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September, gilts would
have put equities in the shade on the basis of their performance in the
first three quarters of the year.
The great debate on the respective merits of the two principle categories of
investment thus rages on. How long can the pension funds maintain their
historically high exposure to equities in the face of overwhelming pressure
to expand their bond holdings?
The institutional investor's disinclination to buy gilts is understandable
against the background of one of the sharpest deteriorations in public
finances in living memory. Most analysts expect the PSBR, that left-over
from the 1970s, to exceed Pounds 50bn in 1993. Since institutional cash flow
is a little under Pounds 40bn, something has to yield. The obvious
candidate, unless foreign investors pick up the gauntlet, is the gilt yield
itself, which must surely rise in the face of such a huge funding burden.
QED.
The trouble with this argument is that it has been around for some time and
is widely understood. For it to convince, its proponents have to explain why
gilt yields have not already surged into double figures, as estimates of the
PSBR have come close to trebling over the past year or so. But before
pursuing the argument further, consider the conventional wisdom in equities.
The easing of policy on both the exchange rate and interest rates fronts
since devaluation unquestionably paves the way for economic recovery. The
problem here is that domestic consumption looks set for a painfully slow
revival, while the competitive devaluation took place just as Britain's
trading partners especially in Europe, started sinking towards the doldrums.
After the big valuation adjustment in equities in the fourth quarter of
1992, the historic price earnings ratio on equities is well over 17, which
assumes an impressive profit recovery. Will it come up to expectations?
Against that background it is important to remember that the capital
component of the total return recorded by the WM Company is, from an
actuarial perspective, fool's gold. The actuary is interested in income, not
paper gains in the stock market. And dividends last year fell 5 per cent in
real terms, according to WM, raising questions about what might happen if
actuarial surpluses disappear.
Since the 1980s corporate earnings have been boosted by reductions in
pension contributions. The resulting increase in earnings has facilitated
higher dividend payments, which in turn have contributed to pension fund
surpluses. If this British form of what the Japanese call zaitech, or
financial engineering, goes into reverse, a virtuous circle could turn
vicious.
People with a sceptical turn of mind might conclude that we have just
witnessed the last fling of equities, before the official declaration of the
Decade of the Bond. If so, the question is why pension fund trustees and
managers still adopt what the Americans would call a highly aggressive
stance in equities. One answer is that gilts were consistently mispriced in
their formative years in the face of unanticipated inflation. Another is
that they were taught to believe that they needed to match real,
earning-related liabilities with real assets such as equities and property.
The real assets argument is clearly guff. Commercial property was no kind of
hedge against inflation in the 1980s. As for mispricing, note that estimates
of the rate of increase in UK earnings are falling by the day and
unemployment is rising inexorably. With average earnings going up at 4 1/2
 5 per cent in a very slowly growing economy, while long gilts yield 8 1/2
 9 per cent, a historically high real rate of interest could prove a better
match for pension liabilities than a wilting dividend stream from equities.
It seems plausible that mispricing of an equal and opposite kind could take
place in present disinflationary circumstances.
One thing that might just tilt the argument on the allocation of assets is a
change in financial structure. In 1980, the net cash flow into pension funds
ran at nearly 20 per cent of assets. By 1990 it was down to 4 per cent; WM
expects it to be well below 3 per cent this year. That means that with
dividends weakening on 80 per cent of the portfolio, many funds will have
had to liquidate investments to pay the pensioners. In short, liquidity has
become more important; and as we all know, there is no more liquid
investment than gilts.
There is also the fact that the Goode Committee's deliberations on
occupational pensions could ultimately lead to stricter funding rules that
would affect the shape of pension fund portfolios. US pension funds hold
three to four times as much fixed interest paper as their British
equivalents because holding bonds makes it easier to avoid underfunding
under American rules.
The big weakness in this case for gilts is one that has been expressed here
by my colleague Barry Riley. At its simplest, the value of gilts is in the
hands of the government and the present government's reputation in monetary
policy is one of matchless incompetence. But if you share that view, the
correct response is not to maintain 80 per cent in equities, but to increase
overseas bond holdings in countries with a better reputation for monetary
management. One way or another, the equity content is going to fall.

FT  09 JAN 93 / The history of bloodlust that stains the conference table:
The Zulu tradition is killing and conquest under Shaka, its heroic but
brutal warrior king. This is hard to reconcile with the ideal of a new South
Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACROSS a windswept hilltop in Zululand, thousands of feet above the spot
where Zulu pride was shattered by the British more than a century ago at the
Battle of Ulundi, descendants of that warrior nation lead a ceremonial
procession to deliver a young bride to the kraal,or homestead, of her new
husband.
Picking their way across a boulder-strewn field, they carry a mattress, box
spring, sleeping mat and bedroom furniture, along with brightly-coloured
duffle bags filled with smaller household items: the bride's dowry.
The men also carry 'traditional weapons': painted sticks and spears, cowhide
shields and clubs, the cultural arsenal of the Zulu man from time immemorial
and the symbols of a powerful nationalism which propels South Africa closer
every day to civil war.
For this wedding is not just a cultural occasion; in these days of endless
slaughter among the Zulus, culture is inseparable from politics. The
colourful display of tradition is part of a battle for the soul of the
7m-strong Zulu nation between the African National Congress (ANC), which
would subsume Zulu identity in a new South African nationhood which denied
ethnicity, and the Inkatha Freedom Party, militant Zulu nationalists who
will fight to the death for tribe and tradition.
Guests at this wedding are firmly on the side of Inkatha. They make a
political point of continuing the traditions of a vast 19th century kingdom
ruled by the Zulu hero, Shaka, who combined Napoleon's ambitions with the
methods of Genghis Khan.
Women adorn their bare breasts with strings of beads - or, incongruously,
sport a modern nylon brassiere gone grey from many washings, above a more
traditional skirt of plastic or cloth strips. Male relatives of bride and
bridegroom wear skirts made from strips of leopard-skin or other fur; the
groom wears a crown of black plumes and cow-tail bracelets on his shins and
upper arms.
In a field nearby, youths test their manhood in an age-old sparring contest
with stick and shield. The spirit of the amaZulu, 'the people of heaven',
lives on in them, proud and defiant, fractious and belligerent.
That belligerence is fast proving an obstacle to the creation of a new South
Africa. Violence involving Zulus has so far left 8,000 people dead in Natal
province; nationwide, 15,000 people have died, many in fighting between
Zulus and other tribes. The violence has many causes - political, social,
economic, not to mention superstitious - but since 1990, it has taken on an
increasingly ethnic tone.
The ANC denies this, arguing that ethnicity is an invention of Pretoria,
dreamed up by a white minority which could not rule without creating
artificial tribal divisions among blacks; indeed, it shuns ethnicity
precisely because the government so abused it.
But there is little that is artificial about the Zulus' sense of ethnic
identity, fed by a powerful historical memory of a glorious military past,
and stoked constantly by the reigning King, Goodwill Zwelithini, and by
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland and
leader of Inkatha. He uses ethnicity - as the Afrikaners before him used
their fierce nationalism - as a powerful weapon.
In speech after speech, Chief Buthelezi and his nephew, King Goodwill,
exploit this ethnic consciousness by reminding Zulus of their history:
unique among the black tribes of South Africa and probably unparalleled by
any tribe on the continent.
'KwaZulu has been KwaZulu ever since King Shaka put it together as one
kingdom,' King Goodwill said in a recent speech to mark the annual Shaka Day
celebrations. 'KwaZulu is the place of the Zulus because history has made it
so. . . because our illustrious King Shaka rose like a colossus in his day
and age to make KwaZulu a place of Zulus.'
Nothing is as likely to stir the Zulu heart as an appeal to the national
hero Shaka, the one symbol which all acknowledge, whether they be Christian
or pagan, urban or rural, traditional or modern.
'You don't have to be Inkatha to have Shaka as your King,' says Madoda, a
young 'comrade' (in the lingo of Natal, an ANC supporter), who aspires to
citizenship of a new South African nation which is blind to colour and
ethnicity. But even he is not ashamed to admit: 'Shaka is my hero.' Few
Zulus would disragree, however deracinated they have become in the polyglot
townships, or even in exile with the ANC.
For the squeamish foreigner, it can be difficult to understand the appeal of
Shaka. Historians dispute the details of the atrocities he committed in his
campaign to unite 200-odd clans in a new Zulu nation - indeed, Madoda argues
he was no worse than any other 19th century ruler - but none deny that many
thousands died in often arbitrary slaughter.
Shaka was a visionary, an illegitimate son of the insignificant Zulu clan,
who inherited a territory of 100 square miles and eventually gave the Zulu
name to a nation which spanned 200,000 square miles and had 50,000 men under
arms. He was a brilliant military tactician who bequeathed to the Zulus the
short stabbing spear and fighting formation which helped them to victory at
Isandhlwana, the British imperial army's worst ever defeat. Almost
single-handedly, he created a culture which values discipline, obedience and
total submission to authority.
But his methods were ruthless and his genius sometimes lunatic. His royal
kraal was called, appropriately enough, KwaBulawayo, 'the place of killing'.
The explorer and medic Henry Francis Fynn, a member of the first party of
whites to meet Shaka, describes in his diary how perfunctory executions were
frequently carried out whenever whites visited the king (and by Zulu legend,
much of the rest of the time as well). Offenders had their necks broken in
full view of the guests, or were impaled on stakes and left to die slowly.
But Shaka's brutality reached new heights on the death of his mother, Nandi.
He decreed that no cultivation should be allowed during the year following
her death in 1827; all milk was to be poured on the earth as it was drawn
from the cow (tantamount to a sentence of starvation, given that milk curds
were the Zulus' staple food); all women found pregnant during the following
year were to be executed, along with their husbands.
Soon afterward, Shaka's rule declined and he was assassinated in 1828. But
his spirit lives on in the authoritarian traditions of Zulu society and the
militaristic tone which traditional Zulus adopt without embarrassment.
The Zulu king still forms military regiments (albeit largely ceremonial)
which group males of a certain age under his control. Albert Mncwango is a
member of the Nala regiment, the first to be formed by the current king, a
descendant of Shaka.
Mncwango, whose home is Mahlabatini in the heart of traditional Zululand,
explains that his duties are not just ceremonial: 'After regiments have been
formed, there must be an occasion of washing of their spears, meaning that
we want to get involved in a military campaign. Our regiment has never
washed our spears. That is the problem. . . the Zulu regiments would really
love to get involved in a full-scale war.' Not just for the thrill of
fighting, he explains, but to avenge the deaths of women and children killed
in the violence.
He and other traditional Zulus - such as Chief BF Bhengu, chief of the
Ngcolosi clan, whose kraals cling to the steep slopes of the Valley of a
Thousand Hills near Durban - defend the custom of carrying cultural weapons
which has caused so much political controversy.
Mncwango explains: 'Every Zulu male would always carry something in his
hand. Even if you go to visit your girlfriend or go shopping with your wife,
you carry a traditional weapon because there is nothing so disgraceful in
Zulu culture as to be unable to defend your wife and children.' Chief Bhengu
adds: 'You can't go to a wedding without carrying cultural weapons. It's
like going without wearing your trousers.'
Some educated Zulus - such as prominent journalist Khaba Mkhize - dismiss
such traditionalists, with their skins and spears, their beads and clubs, as
'postcard Zulus'. 'There are two major types of Zulus: postcard Zulus and
the type of Zulu who is running away from the postcard,' says Mkhize, who
regularly covers the violence which flares between the two. 'The postcard
Zulu belongs to a dying generation,' he concludes.
Certainly, millions of Zulus are migrating to urban areas in Natal and the
Transvaal, where inter-marriage will eventually dilute tribal identity. But
this is likely to prove a long process, and one which can easily be
interrupted or even reversed - as has happened recently - by outbreaks of
violence which waken a slumbering ethnicity. Although ethnic consciousness
ebbs and flows with politics, it is never far from the surface.
Inkatha leader Chief Buthelezi, one of South Africa's most skilful
politicians, capitalises on this situation: he taps a strong vein of tribal
feeling in traditional rural communities in KwaZulu, and especially among
the approximate 2m Zulus who live away from their homes in Natal, many in
migrant worker hostels which have become Zulu enclaves in multi-ethnic
townships. In a hostile environment, they look to tradition and Inkatha to
protect them.
Buthelezi complains of a campaign of 'ethnic cleansing' against the Zulus,
claiming that the government and the ANC want to create 'Zulu concentration
camps' by fencing migrant worker hostels, and adds a new concept, 'cultural
castration', to the lexicon of ethnic conflict.
Buthelezi's complaints are exaggerated: most deaths so far have involved
Zulus killing Zulus, and the ANC's campaign against the hostels is far more
political than ethnic.
But even the ANC would agree that a strong Zulu ethnic identity is one which
the new South Africa ignores at its peril: the post-colonial history of
Africa has shown how difficult it is to replace individual tribal identities
with a commitment to a new single nationhood.
Jacob Zuma, the most senior Zulu in the ANC leadership - where Zulus are
rare - acknowledges this powerful identity. 'When it comes to KwaZulu, you
are dealing with a group of people which - not because I am a Zulu - were
highly developed socially and militarily by the time they were in contact
with colonialists. And the colonial crushing machine could not finally crush
that.
'The Zulu kingdom. . . remained a very strong factor among the Zulus,
because we always had the King, however undermined he was,' he adds. Unusual
among ANC leaders, Zuma does not try to deny his own ethnicity. 'I do not
pretend because I am sitting here in the ANC that now I am some South
African who is not a Zulu. I am a Zulu and I am proud of being a Zulu.'
But he believes that ethnic confrontation can be defused by devolving some
powers to regional and local government and protecting language and culture
through a bill of rights. He rejects Inkatha's demand for autonomous or
semi-autonomous regional government for Natal, where Zulus would be in the
majority. 'Even if you said today 'We are leaving you, Natal, to
yourselves', no one leader in Natal can say, 'Because you are Zulus, I'm
taking you along'. It is too divided.'
Those divisions have fuelled violence which could hamper the creation of a
democratic South Africa for many more years to come - and which has all but
destroyed the nation forged by Shaka.
'I talk to Shaka about it,' says Mabongi Majola, a young sangoma (spiritual
healer) who squats by the side of the road in her headdress of goats'
bladders, plaited hair and beads. 'Shaka is worried about the future of the
Zulu nation because of the violence,' she says. And as many Zulus will tell
you, he is not the only one.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Pioneer plan threatens Japanese jobs-for-life system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS at Pioneer Electronic, the Japanese maker of compact disc players
and video equipment, have discovered that the country's famed lifetime
employment system is under threat from compulsory early retirement.
Like most other leading Japanese companies, Pioneer had already trimmed
capital and advertising spending. It has now told 35 senior managers to
retire or face dismissal.
Pioneer's move creates a precedent for other Japanese managers, who consider
the last years in office to be the most enjoyable. The successful cherish
the view from atop the corporate hierarchy, while the less successful are
known as mado-giwa-zoku, literally, the window-sitting tribe, who spend
their final years in blissful irrelevance.
But recession has amended the terms of Japan's social contract. Pioneer says
the 35 section chiefs and department heads, some as young as 50, were
selected because the company needs to promote younger, more vital managers,
and cannot afford the window-sitters.
'A few days ago, these managers would have been looking forward to a
comfortable last few years. Now they are told the company doesn't want them.
Who will be next?' said an employee.
In trimming staff, companies have usually targeted part-time workers and
women, as both groups tend not to be unionised and are generally thought to
be excluded from the lifetime employment system. But the continuing domestic
slowdown, reflected in a 48.8 per cent fall in interim operating profits at
Pioneer, has forced further job cuts.
The 35, who had presumed they would be employed until their 60th birthdays,
will be given between 12 and 24 months' salary in compensation if they
accept the offer by the end of this month, or face dismissal.

FT  09 JAN 93 / One-day strike closes TSB branches and hits services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL strike at TSB Bank yesterday led to the closure of at least 380
branches and prevented the delivery of all cheques to processing centres.
Bifu, the banking union, said the strike had been the most disruptive in the
banking industry for 20 years. TSB executives admitted that the
effectiveness of the action had surprised them.
There was a dispute between Bifu and TSB about the number of branches
affected. Bifu claimed 700 of TSB's 1,400 branches had been closed and that
14,000 employees took part. TSB's banking operations employ slightly more
than 20,000 people, excluding its insurance staff.
Mr John Elbourne, TSB's chief operating officer in charge of retail banking
and insurance operations, said 73 per cent of branches stayed open, and that
the number of strikers was much lower than Bifu claimed.
He admitted that no cheques were being delivered to processing centres, so
customers would experience 'a slight delay' before cheques were credited to
their accounts.
The strike was prompted by TSB's unilateral decision to amend a 1983
agreement with Bifu that job cuts at the bank should be achieved without
compulsory redundancies.
Mr Elbourne said such an agreement was no longer tenable because of pressure
on banks to cut costs. He denied the bank was seeking immediate compulsory
redundancies.
Mr Bill Green, the Bifu organiser for Birmingham, said the bank was trying
to include compulsory redundancies as part of its programme to cut 1,000
jobs by the end of January.
Compulsory redundancies have been rare in the banking industry. Last year
National Westminster became the first big bank to say it would make some
compulsory redundancies.
Bifu said that unless a settlement was reached soon with TSB it would embark
on a series of selective strikes in different regions.
Industrial action has not been particularly successful at any of the big
banks since 1987 when there was widespread industrial action over pay at
many of them.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Bundesbank rate cut lifts dollar: Pressure on franc eases -
Devaluation fears grow over punt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN EXCHANGE dealers reacted positively yesterday to the Bundesbank's
decision to shave its money-market interest rates earlier this week, pushing
the dollar up to its highest level against the D-Mark since the summer and
easing the selling pressure on the French franc inside the European exchange
rate mechanism.
However, the punt, the victim of intense selling earlier in the week,
continued to perform weakly against the strong ERM currencies, increasing
speculation that the currency may be devalued. In morning trading in Europe,
the punt strengthened after the Bank of Ireland raised the interest rate for
lending punts overnight from 50 per cent to 100 per cent. But it retreated,
falling close to its ERM floor against the guilder by the close.
The dollar rose initially after the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday to cut
the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks in the German money
market by 15 basis points to 8.60 per cent. It rallied to DM1.6490, its
highest level since the summer, but lost momentum following
poorer-than-expected employment figures in the US, which suggested to some
dealers that the US economy may not be growing as fast as anticipated.
The December non-farm payroll rose by 64,000 on the month, less than
expected. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6375, slightly up on the day.
In New York it closed at DM1.6475.
The payroll figure contributed to a sharp decline in US share prices. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 30 points at one stage
before finishing 17.02 lower at 3,251.67. Weak bond prices and US-Iraq
political tensions contributed to the fall.
The Bundesbank move helped the French franc to rally as high as FFr3.3950 to
the D-Mark but it fell back to FFr3.402, more than 3 centimes from its ERM
floor. In New York it closed at FFr3.4025.
The franc may have been boosted by comments from Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a
member of the Bundesbank's general council, who said the bank had taken into
account the slowing economy and the situation on foreign exchanges when
deciding to ease policy.

FT  09 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK savings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the unlikely event that the chancellor runs out of brainstorming material
at Chevening this weekend, he could do worse than cast an eye over the
Personal Equity Plan. Current rules are messy and penalise the less well
off. Reform proposals have been coming thick and fast. Proshare, which
exists to promote wider share ownership, is pressing for a rolling
eight-year contribution limit of Pounds 80,000, to replace the Pounds 9,000
annual limit. That would allow recipients of a lump sum to invest
immediately in equities. Given the size of the public sector borrowing
requirement next year, Mr Lamont might prefer to see redundancy pay invested
in gilts.
The Unit Trust Association would like the PEP widened to cover corporate
bonds and gilts. That might help fund the PSBR - as well as allowing unit
trust companies to sell bond funds under the PEP umbrella. The idea appeals
to corporate treasurers: simplified tax-exempt status for corporate bonds
might give the domestic bond market a lift.
But why stop at equities and bonds? The Institute for Fiscal Studies - which
has no particular axe to grind - has suggested extending PEPs to cover all
forms of financial asset, including cash deposits. The tax shelter would
then cover savers who keep spare cash on deposit - typically the least
well-off. That might be one for the chancellor to consider seriously - as
long as he can overcome any distaste for a measure which would increase
saving rather than spending.

FT  09 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Roche
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bullish trading statement from Roche will doubtless come as a relief to
the faint-hearted. Having seen the shares rise 60 per cent last year, the
market might be forgiven a touch of vertigo. Earnings rose by an
unexpectedly strong 50 per cent in 1991. The shares have been running fast
simply to maintain the rating. The nagging concern has been that Roche might
equally surprise on the way down.
Despite last year's placing of depositary receipts in the US, the quality of
financial disclosure remains distinctively Swiss. Yesterday's sales figures
are some reassurance. But the full-year results announcement next month is
unlikely to include much segmental information. That family interests hold
the majority of the voting shares is another risk for minority shareholders.
While Roche continues to deliver earnings growth comfortably above 20 per
cent, though, investors may be willing to take a lot on trust. Roche's
pipeline of new drugs looks more promising than most. Its position in
over-the-counter products - bolstered by the purchase of Sanatogen in the UK
from Fisons last month - is also strong. If Roche can squeeze something more
from Genentech and the struggling diagnostics business, a multiple of
perhaps 15 times this year's forecast earnings on the non-voting shares
looks undemanding.

FT  09 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Laporte/Evode
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Laporte has made a generous offer to Evode's shareholders to win the
recommendation of their board. Whether it has been as kind to its own
shareholders, though, remains open to doubt. Mr Ken Minton is adamant that
the deal will enhance earnings within the first full year of ownership. But
he places touching faith in how quickly Laporte can get to grips with
Evode's lacklustre businesses. After repaying Evode's preference shares and
assuming its debt, Laporte will be faced with a total cost of more than
Pounds 200m. That is a lot for a business that made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 10.2m last year. The financial challenge has been made all the harder
for Laporte by its accompanying share placing. Although this lowers the risk
for the company, it also lessens the immediate rewards for shareholders. Yet
perhaps it does not do to quibble. The longer-term opportunities are clear
enough. If Laporte can push Evode's margins up from 4 per cent to the 14 per
cent the predator enjoys, shareholders will be amply rewarded. The process
can start rapidly by knocking out overhead costs, squeezing suppliers and
pushing through selective price increases. Provided they have the patience,
Evode's shareholders may do well to opt for Laporte's paper rather than take
the cash.
As for Wassall, which has limped away from the fray, it now rejoins the
unhappy ranks of frustrated conglomerates scouring for prey. But perhaps
such predators have missed their main chance. Recently the market has been
all too active in bidding up the prices of highly-geared recovery stocks
that form the likeliest acquisition fodder.

FT  09 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Threatened rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Much attention has been focused on the tidal wave of gilts sweeping towards
the City. However imaginatively financed, the Pounds 40bn-plus of debt the
government must place in the next fiscal year threatens to swamp both the
gilt and equity markets. Yet that is not the only call on institutional
cash. Company finances may have improved, but the corporate sector is still
in substantial deficit. Many companies need extra funding to take advantage
of any upturn and, with the market at near-record levels, rights issues must
be on the way.
As issuance is unlikely to exceed the 1991 peak of Pounds 10bn, its overall
impact will be less than that of gilts - even after adding in the Pounds
5bn-plus government offer of BT shares. But unlike gilts, rights issues
influence equities directly, and with company finances varying widely, the
effect will hit some sectors more than others. So far the market rally has
been based on the expectation of an earnings recovery, but it may be a
mistake to overlook corporate cash flow and weak balance sheets. Companies
in the building, brewing, textiles, engineering and industrial materials
sectors could all usefully reduce their gearing. Insurers' solvency ratios
are low and BP would have a lot more flexibility after a rights issue,
despite management opposition to the idea.
Fear of high gearing may also be driving boards towards rights issues; few
managements have any desire to repeat the gearing experience of recent
years. That may also limit the number of cash bids, which have had corrosive
effects on predators' balance sheets once debts have been assumed and
provisions written off against equity. It seems paper is heading towards the
market from all directions.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Pioneer shakes Japanese faith in jobs-for-life system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS at Pioneer Electronic, the Japanese maker of compact disc players
and video equipment, have discovered that the country's famed lifetime
employment system is under threat from a new product, compulsory early
retirement.
Like most other leading Japanese companies, Pioneer had already trimmed
capital and advertising spending. It has now told 35 senior managers to
retire or face dismissal.
Pioneer's move creates a precedent for other Japanese managers, who consider
the last years in office to be the most enjoyable. The successful cherish
the view from atop the corporate hierarchy, while the less successful are
known as mado-giwa-zoku, literally, the window-sitting tribe, who spend
their final years in blissful irrelevance.
But recession has amended the terms of Japan's social contract. Pioneer says
the 35 section chiefs and department heads, some as young as 50, were
selected because the company needs to promote younger, more vital managers,
and cannot afford to carry the window-sitters.
'A few days ago, these managers would have been looking forward to a
comfortable last few years. Now they are told the company doesn't want them.
Who will be next?' said an employee.
In trimming staff, companies have usually targeted part-time workers and
women, as both groups tend not to be unionised and are generally thought to
be excluded from the lifetime employment system. But the continuing domestic
slowdown, reflected in a 48.8 per cent fall in interim operating profits at
Pioneer, has forced further job cuts.
The 35, who had presumed that they would be employed until their 60th
birthdays, will be given between 12 and 24 months' salary in compensation if
they accept the offer by the end of this month. If not, they face dismissal.
Managers at two other Japanese electronics makers, NEC and Sanyo Electric,
have already done their bit for their companies by accepting a portion of
their year-end bonus in vouchers which could be swapped for a television or
a rice cooker.

weaken Dow

Wall Street
DISQUIETING news about employment and continuing unease about developments
in the Middle East drove US share prices sharply lower for the second
consecutive day, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off 17.29 at 3,251.67 after dropping
more than 36 points at mid-day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended 1.66 lower at 429.07, while the Amex composite finished down 1.28 at
395.84, and the Nasdaq composite down 1.00 at 677.21. Volume on the NYSE was
265m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 1,175 to 677.
Profit-taking was a factor in the morning decline, but there was no comfort
to be found in the unexpectedly weak employment figures for December.
The market had expected non-farm payrolls to rise by about 83,000, but the
increase was a more modest 64,000, with the rate of civilian unemployment
unchanged at 7.3 per cent.
In addition, investors remain concerned about the prospects of renewed
hostilities in the Middle East which could hurt US consumer confidence and
interfere with economic recovery.
In the retail sector, Woolworth fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 after
the company had revealed a disappointing 1 per cent improvement in domestic
same-store sales for the Christmas period. An analyst at Dean Witter
downgraded his investment rating on the stock and reduced fourth quarter
earnings estimates.
Trading was also heavy in Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer in terms of
sales, which fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 59 3/4 in spite of a 10 per cent
advance in same-store sales.
A number of drug company stocks were actively traded including Merck, up
Dollars 1 at Dollars 42 1/2 and Bristol-Myers Squibb, down Dollars 1/4 at
Dollars 62 5/8 . Johnson &amp; Johnson added Dollars 1 to Dollars 46 5/8 .
IBM lost Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 46 1/2 , a new 52-week low.
On the Nasdaq market Intel slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 98 3/4 ,
Microsoft eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 87 1/8 and Novell fell Dollars 1/8
to Dollars 30 1/4 . The Federal Trade Commission plans to meet in early
February to decide whether it will take anti-trust action against Microsoft,
the world's biggest supplier of computer software, which has been expanding
into a number of market segments.
Biogen soared Dollars 4 to Dollars 43 1/4 following a strong endorsement by
Bear Stearns, which rated the stock a top biotechnology issue.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended a week of heavy trading on a losing note, as did most
important world markets.
The composite index fell 7.10 points, or 0.21%, to 3311.77, for a loss on
the week of about 38 points.
Declining issues were ahead of advances by 318 to 294. Volume fell to
50,887,000 shares from 58,131,000 shares yesterday, and trading value was
CDollars 385.7m as compared with CDollars 457.6m on Thursday.
Among the sub-indices, nine of the 14 were lower and one was unchanged.
Industrial products were off 0.97% on index, while golds and energy fell
moderately.

profit-taking

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO stocks continued to drift downwards yesterday in the absence of any
fresh supporting factors, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average dropped 146.29 to close at 16,634.69, its fourth
consecutive decline, for a 1.7 per cent fall on the week. After rising
briefly on futures arbitrage-linked buying, the market fell steadily from a
high of 16,805.66 in the morning to a low of 16,634.49 towards the close.
Trading volume was estimated at 224m shares, up from 219.8m. In a reversal
of Thursday's position, declining stocks outnumbered gainers by 602 to 301,
with 191 unchanged.
The Topix index closed down 8.73 at 1,289.52, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index rose 1.96 to 1,048.23.
The previous day's mood of comparative buoyancy, stemming from news of the
crown prince's engagement, was not sustained, and the morning price fixing
of the January stock index options contract triggered selling.
Profit-taking weakened some stocks which had made engagement-related gains
on Thursday, while others continued to firm. Mitsukoshi, the department
store group, lost Y3 to finish at Y730 but its rival, Takashimaya, which is
closely linked to the Imperial household, carried on climbing, ending up Y20
at Y896.
Nippon Television gained on expectations of higher audiences for its
coverage of the crown prince's wedding, closing up Y300 at Y13,700. Hitachi
attracted the heaviest trading, dropping Y8 to Y757 in volume of 2.4m
shares. Steel sector stocks experienced a general decline, with Nippon Steel
losing Y4 to end at Y286.
Victor Co. of Japan (JVC) gained Y51 to Y860 in heavy volume, after
announcing its development of a lower-priced high definition television and
a VHS recorder for HDTV, to be launched later this year.
Other consumer electronics stocks declined, in spite of the possibility of
increased sales in the run-up to the royal wedding. Sony fell Y40 to Y4,180,
Matsushita Electric Industrial dropped Y20 to Y1,120, and Pioneer Electronic
closed down Y30 at Y2,580.
In Osaka the OSE index closed down 106.96 at 18,398.98 in volume of 27m
shares.
Roundup
WALL Street's overnight drop gave some markets an unhappy day.
AUSTRALIA, already weakened by uncertainty over the Australian dollar, saw
heavy selling in futures and the All Ordinaries index dropped 28.6 to
1,502.3, 3.1 per cent lower on the week.
Turnover was ADollars 273m. Major stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off,
with BHP 32 cents lower at ADollars 12.82, CRA down 50 cents at ADollars
12.70 and TNT off 5 cents at ADollars 0.75.
NEW ZEALAND fell on Wall Street and caution about higher domestic interest
rates, the NZSE-40 index closing 26.94 lower at 1,526.86, 2.6 per cent down
on the week. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index dipped 17.76 to 5,529.56 in
turnover down from HKDollars 1.69bn to HKDollars 1.49bn, its domestic worry
being the Sino-British row.
TAIWAN ended higher on a technical rebound, and media reports that the
government would consider lowering the stock transaction tax. The weighted
index bounced off support at 3,100 and closed 36.43 up at 3,171.99, 6.1 per
cent lower on a politically fearful week, in moderate turnover of TDollars
9.5bn.
MANILA saw fresh foreign enthusiasm and the composite index breached the
1,300 mark for the first time since November, rising 21.10 to 1,313.31, 4.5
per cent higher on the week.
SEOUL closed comfortably above the 700 mark in spite of profit-taking in
highly-capitalised securities house and construction shares, the composite
index rising 7.54 to 704.49, up 3.8 per cent on the week.
BANGKOK was led by late demand for banks and brokerage shares, as the SET
index rose 6.47 to 920.79, 3.1 per cent up on the week.

FT  09 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt affected by 2 per
cent decline in Siemens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank distanced itself yesterday from assertions by a Paris
representative that German interest rates would fall in the current quarter,
and German equities continued Thursday's decline, writes Our Markets Staff.
Nothing loth, global strategists from the Nomura Research Institute advised
investors to buy in Germany, and sell in the US. The team said that Germany
is already in recession, that its equity market has bottomed, and that it
will now go up as share price multiples expand, in anticipation of recovery
driven by declining interest rates.
FRANKFURT, meanwhile, saw an accelerated downturn in the shares of the
electronics group, Siemens, as the DAX index closed another 10.98 lower at
1,531.52, 0.9 per cent lower on the week. Turnover fell from DM3.9bn to
DM3.7bn.
Siemens fell DM12.90, or more than 2 per cent to DM572.30 as negative
speculation continued ahead of next week's annual press conference. Daimler,
which stirred up the speculation after a stiff earnings downgrade by James
Capel, dropped another DM4.20 to DM532.30.
Kaufhof led retailers down with a fall of DM16.50 to DM398. Mr Roland Wren
of James Capel in Frankfurt said that the brokers have marked a very
significant correlation between the consumer confidence index and, with a
lag of about six months, retail sales; he expects that consumer confidence
in December will have recorded an all time low.
PARIS consolidated, the CAC-40 index rising 8.16 to 1,852.63, barely changed
on the week, with turnover steady at FFr2.8bn.
Strong activity was noted in Michelin, Eurotunnel and Hachette with
respective gains of FFr5.50, 55 centimes and FFr5.80 to FFr195.30, FFr31.10
and FFr83.30. Matra, which is to be merged with Hachette later this month,
also figured with a rise of FFr13.10, or 6.6 per cent to FFr210.00.
Among second liners, Spie Batignolles was suspended briefly, limit up at
FFr315.50. There were reports, later denied, that its parent company,
Schneider, was to buy out the minority shareholders. Spie closed FFr24.60
higher at FFr310.00 while Schneider lost FFr1 to FFr627.
AMSTERDAM sold Akzo, Nedlloyd, and Philips: Akzo, down Fl 3.30 to Fl 135.40,
on disappointing 1993 prospects; Nedlloyd, Fl 3.00 lower at Fl 30.40, on
news after Thursday's close that Mr Torstein Hagen was quitting the
supervisory board and had reduced his stake to under 10 per cent; and
Philips, down 50 cents at Fl 20.80, as it reported that its joint venture
with Siemens in telecommunications cables and optical fibres had been called
off. The CBS Tendency index was 1.0 weaker at 96.6.
ZURICH majored on CS Holding and Roche as the SMI index lost 7.3 to 2,074.9,
0.7 per cent higher on the week. CS Holding, SFr55 better at SFr1,990,
recovered some of its losses on the proposed takeover of Swiss Volksbank.
Roche certificates rose SFr60 to SFr4,160 as it said that 1992 group profits
should rise considerably.
MILAN closed mixed after strong early buying interest in the insurer,
Generali, and other blue chips failed to ignite the market. The Comit index
closed 1.24 higher at 456.69, 2.3 per cent higher on the week.
BRUSSELS strengthened with large volume in Delhaize, up BFr6 at BFr1,220,
ahead of 1992 results. The Bel-20 index rose 10.04 to 1,143.97, up 1.5 per
cent on the week.
STOCKHOLM was firmer in spite of profit-taking in Astra, whose free shares
lost SKr19, or 2.6 per cent to SKr736. The Affarsvarlden index closed 4.3
higher at 948.3, up 4 per cent on the week. Lifted by the stronger dollar,
the market was also hoping that interest rates may be eased after the budget
statement which is due on Monday.
COPENHAGEN saw activity in Danisco, up DKr25 to DKr670 following Thursday's
sale on its engineering division to GEA of Germany for DKr950m. The KFX
index shed just 0.03 to 77.47.

FT  09 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Mixed views on equity prospects after
risky 1992 - A look at global equity performance in 1992, and strategists'
views of the current year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During 1992, most major economies were expected to recover, with good
prospects of growth accelerating into 1993; instead there was a delayed
recovery in the US, and most European economies ended 1992 either in
recession or on the edge of it.
Horror stories included a possible meltdown of the financial system in
Japan, assorted Nordic financial disasters and the fall in the financial
rand which, for dollar investors, seriously exacerbated the domestic decline
in South African equities.
Japan dropped by 22.7 per cent in local currency terms last year, the single
most serious influence on the 3.7 per cent drop in the FT-Actuaries World
Index. The US managed a 4.8 per cent gain and Europe was confused by the
devaluation effect - which, for example, allowed the UK to look good with a
14.9 per cent gain in local currency terms, or pretty sick with a 7 per cent
loss in terms of the dollar.
James Capel's global strategy duo, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey and Mr Martin
Paling, note that the Mexican peso has been stronger than the pound sterling
and the Swiss franc for each of the last two years. The dollar, they add,
has now risen against the D-Mark for two successive years, from DM1.50 to
DM1.52 in 1991 and to DM1.621 by the end of 1992. 'As a result,' they note,
'results in common currency have continued to favour the dollar based
markets.'
In general, however, it was a year to be in bonds rather than equities.
End-1992 figures from Kemper Investment Management show total bond market
returns in local currency terms of 15 per cent plus in the hard currency
markets of the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, and either side of 13 per
cent in Germany and Japan.
Switzerland apart, hard currency countries got little reward in their equity
markets for financial probity in 1992. According to Datastream, the
Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, again, produced an average total return in
local currency terms of less than 2 per cent.
Strategists' opinions vary this year. Kleinwort Benson went along with the
economic arguments at the end of 1991 but, to give it credit, overweighted
the UK and US and underweighted Japan and Continental Europe. Mr Roger
Palmer, global strategist at Kleinwort, says that the bank's biggest mistake
was to raise its weighting in Europe during the course of the year.
Just before Christmas, Kleinwort came out with projections for 1993. It said
that equity returns should exceed those from bonds in 1993; that it expected
France to show the best returns of all major equity markets in 1993; that
all of continental Europe carries high risk; and that the UK stock market
has the most attractive risk/reward profile.
Mr Palmer thinks that the global equity risk is less than it was a year ago,
with the US and the UK on the recovery path. What does worry him is the
unanimity of the regard for French equity assets. A few weeks ago it asked
200 UK fund managers how many of them were not overweight in France; the
answer was under 5 per cent. 'Where's the money going to come from to drive
the market up?' he asks.
Morgan Stanley's chief investment strategist, Mr David Roche, would like a
wider range of options. 'There is no doubt', he said in mid-December, 'that
if Mars were a well run, investable place I'd be overweight there. There are
few bargains around on Earth.'
Mr Roche thought that 1993 could well be a year 'when under-owned,
second-tier stocks (particularly financials) perform better than some that
are gold-plated, and over-owned.' He also saw possibilities in some
'inferior' quality economies and financial assets.
The bank likes, inter alia, Thai, Polish and Hungarian equities, spicing
more heavyweight selections like French short bonds and equities, Hong Kong
equities, and Japanese blue chip industrial exporters.
However, it does not like European industrial cyclicals, growth stocks
around the globe, or D-Mark financial assets.

FT  09 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend worries hit Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL and gas exploration company Lasmo suffered a sharp setback in its share
price yesterday after securities house Hoare Govett slashed earnings
forecasts for the group and argued that it would have to pass its final
dividend. The stock was off 17 at worst but closed a net 9 lower at 156p
with unusually heavy turnover of 14m shares.
Hoare said Lasmo would be hit by a high advanced corporation tax charge and
a larger than expected depreciation charge. As a result, Hoare's oils team
cut earnings per share forecasts for 1992 and 1993 to 3.7p and 4.9p from
5.6p and 8.6p. Analyst Mr Brendan Wilders said; 'When your net gearing is at
100 per cent and the dividend is uncovered for at least two years payment of
the dividend should be seen as financially imprudent.' The shares were under
further pressure from Lehman Brothers which cut its asset valuations for a
number of exploration and production stocks.
DIY groups suffer
The revelation by Boots that the Do-It-All chain, which it co-owns with WH
Smith, had suffered declining sales in the third quarter hit shares in both
companies and dragged down other groups with DIY interests. It also led to a
welter of downgrades.
Most analysts had expected flat sales at Do-It-All and pencilled in losses
this year of around Pounds 20m. The 5 per cent fall in sales announced by
Boots saw loss forecasts for the subsidiary increased by some Pounds 5m and
forecasts for the group as a whole chopped back into a range of Pounds 400
to Pounds 410m.
What worried stores specialists was that Do-It-All had been involved in deep
discounting for a sustained period, thus suffering declines in both margins
and sales. While Boots other divisions peformed satisfactorily, the DIY
buisness is worrying the City, with some analysts questioning the parent
companies' strategy. Mr Andy Hughes at Nomura said: 'Boots and Smiths need
to decide whether they will commit sufficient funds for store refurbishment
and for a new central distribution centre.' Another analyst predicted
pressure on Boots to buy control of Do-It-All and speed up the
rationalisation programme.
WH Smith and Kingfisher, which runs the B&amp;Q chain, were also the subject of
downgrades. Boots shares slumped 26 to 509p in turnover of 5m, with some
analysts predicting further weakness as the rating remains high. However,
the decline in the other two DIY groups was considered somewhat overdone.
Kingfisher dived 18 to 571p, and WH Smith 'A' fell 19 to 469p, the 'B'
shares 4 to 91 1/2 p.
Ladbroke firm
One group with DIY interests to survive the savaging was Ladbroke, which
after an initial fall rallied to a gain of 4 at 194p. Rumours in the market
suggested that Ladbroke had been successful over the last month in making a
number of property disposals, possibly worth around Pounds 80m. These were
thought to mostly consist of UK retail sites. Analysts also suggested that
Ladbroke's problems at its Texas DIY concern had been well heralded and
discounted into the shares.
The battle for the UK holiday market continued to excite interest with one
large institution deciding to exit from the predatory Airtours to be
replaced by another hoping that its Pounds 225m bid for Owners Abroad is
successful. Equitable Life was reported to have sold 5.9m Airtours shares,
around 7 per cent of the company, on Wednesday at 260p, which was around 30p
below the then market price. It was immediately picked up by Morgan
Grenfell. Yesterday, Airtours shares slipped 3 to 288p. Owners slid the same
to 119p.
A large buyer of Forte sent the shares racing forward to 197p, a rise of 8.
Friendly Hotels continued to attract speculative interest and the shares
added 21 to 199p.
Resurgent reports that Rank Organisation would sell its film making business
found little support among analysts. The company also issued a denial. While
a consortium has been brought together to make an offer, observers said such
a sale would be detrimental to Rank's interests. The shares rose 12 to 716p.
Adhesives maker Evode jumped 13p to 119 on news that it had agreed a Pounds
135.5m bid by Laporte, the UK's largest independent chemicals group. It was
also the most heavily traded stock in London with 26m shares dealt. Evode
has been under siege since November from mini-conglomerate Wassall which
made a Pounds 113m increased hostile offer on Monday. Laporte, which is also
raising Pounds 84.4m via a placing and a one-for-10 open offer at 560p per
share, saw its shares drop 27 to 583p. Wassall was unchanged at 209p.
HSBC Holdings rose 23 to 519p on reports in a Chinese newspaper that China
wants a meeting with Britain, scheduled for March, to go ahead. Recent
comments casting doubt on whether the meeting would take place had
undermined market sentiment.
However, the remainder of the banking sector was hampered by continuing debt
worries. Abbey National, heavily exposed to domestic mortgages, fell 12 1/2
to 358 1/2 p.
Nomura Research added weight to the pressure on the pharmaceuticals sector
and contributed to weakness in Wellcome, off 10 at 934p, and Glaxo, down a
further 5 at 732p. The UK arm of the Japanese stockbroker focused on the
large number of patents due to expire over the next 18 months. The house
says invalidation of the US patent Nolvadex, ICI's best-selling cancer drug,
would 'imperil 10 per cent of Zeneca's drug profits'. ICI slipped 7 to
1101p.
SmithKline Beecham was actively traded as selling from the US was countered
by UK buying. Salomon Brothers was bidding aggressively for the stock which
closed steady at 468p with 4.3m shares traded.
British Bio-Technology firmed 2 to 340p responding to a Kleinwort Benson buy
note.
Carlton Communications edged ahead 5 to 800p with Lehman Brothers discussing
the prospects for the company at the orning meeting. Media agency More O
Farrell jumped 28 to 223 following favourable New Year share tipping.
Banknote printer De La Rue added 9 at 657p on buying in a thin market.
Second liners among engineering stocks outshone the sector leaders, the
latter seeing a bout of profit-taking.

FT  09 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Nervousness drags busy equities down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL trading session of the first full working week of the year saw
share prices continue to lose ground following big falls in New York and
amid persistent worries about the possibility of impending rights issues in
London.
News of disappointing trading at Boots was an additionally bearish influence
on the market yesterday. Dealers also fretted about further conflict in
Iraq.
But hefty losses in the Footsie 100 list of stocks and in the Mid 250 list
masked what some traders said was a fresh burst of buying interest by the
big institutions.
The Footsie 100 index ended another very busy session a net 17.3 lower at
2,799.2, only marginally above the day's lowest level, 2,797.9, reached soon
after a disappointing opening by Wall Street. Over the week the 100-share
index has fallen 47.3 points, or 1.7 per cent. The strong run by the Footsie
Mid 250 index, which jumped more than 77 points until yesterday, was halted
with the index slipping 7.6 to 2,932.7.
Wall Street's overnight 36 point fall was the trigger for a weak opening in
London, with the Footsie 100 kicking off more than 14 points lower. This was
in spite of the latest UK takeover move; Laporte made an agreed offer for
Evode and sent its broker, BZW, into the market to buy Evode stock.
Laporte's move is the third bid this week, after Wassall's increased offer
for Evode and Airtours' bid for rival holiday company Owners Abroad.
Attempts by the London market to rally were offset by Wall Street opening
some 30 points lower. However, dealers took heart from continuing heavy
activity. Yesterday's turnover reached 773.1m shares with most of the
business - 502.2m - transacted in the non-Footsie 100 stocks. Senior
marketmakers were not gloomy about prospects: 'We've seen plenty of
profit-taking but it would be foolish to take too bearish a view of the
market,' said one. Sharelink, the largest private client stockbroker in the
UK with more than 300,000 clients, reported strong buying all week. 'There
have been only two days since the beginning of December when the amount of
selling orders has matched buying orders,' said a Sharelink spokesman.
In Saturday editions, we have switched the Commodities Weekly Review and the
FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices. The Review has moved to the page after UK
Company News, which is Page 11 in today's edition. The Share Indices appear
below. The Fixed Interest Indices remain in their usual position. The
government bonds table remains on this page.

ACTIVITY in the derivatives market disappointed yesterday, writes Steve
Thompson.
The weakness of Wall Street overnight, at anxiety about the US budget
deficit and Iraq, saw the March contract on the FT-SE index open about 15
points lower at 3,827 and trade in a narrow range early.
However, activity picked up at lunchtime, with the future rallying to 2,840
on hopes of a better than expected opening on Wall Street. In the event, the
US market opened lower and soon showed a fall of around 30 points, taking
the UK market with it and driving the future to the day's low of 2,817. At
the close, the future was trading at 2,823, a premium of around 10 points to
fair value estimated at around 14 points.
A big buyer of Barclays March 330 puts left the contract as the most active
traded option. Turnover in Barclays options totalled 1,931. Overall traded
options turnover was 26.206, well down on Thursday's 37,711 contracts.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Softer cash rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS in European cash and futures markets eased yesterday as dealers
continued to take the view that this week's cut in German money market rates
marked a significant turning-point in the European currency crisis, writes
James Blitz.
On Thursday afternoon in Europe, dealers barely reacted to Germany's 15
basis point cut in the fixed repo rate. But the market reacted far more
positively yesterday, and a number of dealers were almost ecstatic about the
implications of the Bundesbank's move.
French cash rates softened for the second day running. Three-month money in
the eurodeposit market closed down at 12 per cent from 12 1/2 per cent the
day before. French franc futures enjoyed a good rally, with the March
contract gaining 19 basis points to close at 90.63. Only three days after
the Bank of France was forced to put up short-dated interest rates because
of pressure on the franc, one dealer said yesterday: 'France is now
outstanding value.'
Euromark futures also reflected the bullish sentiment, with the March
contract rising 9 basis points to peak at 92.23, before closing at 92.20.
However, even before Christmas, the market had been pricing in a cut in
official German rates, and yesterday's closing price for the contract was
unchanged on the week. It assumes that 3-month money will fall by 80 basis
points over the next two months.
German call money eased yesterday to reflect the Bundesbank's new dealing
rate. Call money slid to 8.65-8.75 per cent from 8.80-8.85 per cent and
forward money rates were down more strongly.
Trade in sterling markets showed some bullishness about the possibility that
base rates could come down again. Three-month money closed a fraction softer
on the offered side at 7 1/4 per cent. The March short sterling contract was
only a little more optimistic, showing a 3 basis point rise on the day to
close at 93.33. At this level, it assumes that 3-month money will be more
than 90 basis points lower by the spring.
However, this was still not as bullish as the sterling market had been
before Christmas. One dealer reported that sentiment had been slightly
spoiled by what he called 'the erratic shortages' in the discount market in
recent days.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Positive reaction to rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CURRENCY dealers yesterday reacted positively to the Bundesbank's decision
to ease money market rates, pushing the dollar close to DM1.65 against the
D-Mark and taking pressure off the French franc in the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism, writes James Blitz.
In early trading in Europe, the dollar peaked at DM1.6490 to the D-Mark as
the markets assumed that yesterday's 15 basis point cut in money market
rates signalled a greater determination by the Bundesbank to ease policy.
However, when the US employment figures for December were issued at around
lunchtime in London, there was some disappointment. The non-farm payroll
rose by 64,000 last month, but dealers had been looking for a rise of more
than 100,000. The November figure was also revised downwards.
The dollar therefore drifted down again, bottoming out at DM1.6355. It
closed in London at DM1.6375, slightly up on the day.
The dollar's strength may have been undermined by comments from one of the
Bundesbank council's hard-line members, Mr Reimut Jochimsen.
In a news agency interview, Mr Jochimsen said that the Bundesbank had taken
into account both the slowing economy and the situation on foreign exchange
markets when deciding to ease policy on Thursday.
But one dealer said that he was concerned by Mr Jochimsen's comment that
doubts remained over the efforts of the Bonn government to reduce the budget
deficit.
The Bundesbank council member said that changes in the composition of the
Bonn government might cause delays in reaching agreement. And there are
strong suggestions that the Bundesbank will only ease policy again once the
outcome of the budget talks - and the 1993 wage round - become clear.
Thursday's small, if significant, cut in rates was enough to take pressure
off the French franc yesterday. the currency rallied as high as FFr3.3950 in
early trading, but later fell back to close at FFr3.402.
Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank, has always taken the view
that the franc will avoid a devaluation. But he warned yesterday that there
may be new assaults on the currency before the fate of the ERM is finally
resolved for this year. 'You have to be cautious,' he said, 'because a 15
basis point cut has not changed the underlying structure of interest rates.
The market is right to think that German rate cuts will now be accelerated
but wrong to think that they will happen immediately.'

ROCHE, the Basle-based pharmaceutical group, said consolidated sales reached
SFr12.9bn (Dollars 9bn) in 1992, 13 per cent higher than in 1991.
There was a 'gratifying improvement' in operations which, together with
healthy income from investments, resulted in 'another considerable growth in
group profits'. All divisions contributed to the good result.
Pharmaceutical sales were up 16 per cent to SFr6.9bn, with sales of
Rocephin, Dormicum, Roferon-A, Rivotril and Furtulon showing strong volume
growth.
Sales of vitamins and fine chemicals rose 13 per cent to SFr3.1bn. Growing
scientific evidence of the prophylactic effect of important vitamins led to
a rise in the sales volume of vitamin E, vitamin B6, folic acid and
beta-carotene.
Diagnostic product revenues gained 9 per cent to SFr1.55bn, due to the
contribution of US service laboratories.

DELHAIZE 'Le Lion', the Belgian retail group, expects to announce a 'sharp
increase' in consolidated net profit for 1992, boosted by exceptional
profits from the sale of treasury stock and operations in Portugal.
Delhaize said yesterday consolidated sales had risen by 5 per cent in 1992
to BFr326bn (Dollars 10bn) from BFr310bn, in spite of a 7 per cent decline
in the value of the dollar.
Food Lion itself lifted sales 11.8 per cent to Dollars 7.2bn, and Delhaize
said the US stores' sales in the last five weeks of 1992 rose by 28 per
cent. Belgian operations had sales of BFr91.2bn, up 6.4 per cent.
For 1991, Delhaize announced net consolidated profits of BFr4.37bn, and a
dividend of BFr87 a share.

TALKS between Siemens of Germany and Philips of the Netherlands which would
have led to joint ventures in telecommunications cables and optical fibres,
have been abandoned, the two companies groups said yesterday.
The Dutch company blamed falling prices, arguing 'the underlying economics
are no longer attractive', but would not be drawn on plans for the future of
its two businesses.
Siemens said the talks had fallen through because of a variety of reasons. A
spokesman said: 'Economic conditions have changed in the 13 months we have
been negotiating this deal.'
The German company made it clear, however, that it expected its cable
business, second in Europe to Alcatel of France, would continue to grow
strongly. It had sales of about DM2bn (Dollars 1.2bn) last year, about 30
per cent ahead of the preceding year.
'We have no need to look for partners to fulfil our market goals,' a Siemens
spokesman said. 'We have a number of big projects here in Germany and
respectable growth in other countries.'
Philips' activities in telecommunications cables and optical fibres generate
annual turnover of Fl 550m (Dollars 307.2m). A spokesman said turnover
growth in the sectors had been flat in 1992, underlining the company's
argument that prices were weakening.

The Dutch company employs 1,400 people in telecommunications cables and
optical fibres, of whom 1,150 are divided between the German cities of
Cologne and Nuremberg. The remaining 250 are employed in Philips' home base
of Eindhoven.
In December 1991 Philips said it would sell its two businesses outright to
Siemens, but it decided in 1992 to seek joint ventures instead to retain the
technology inside the group.
The European Commission's merger task force said last month it would make a
full and detailed examination of the proposed joint ventures, which would
have had a combined turnover of roughly DM2.5bn and most of its industrial
activities in Germany.

German statistician FO Licht has cuts its estimate for world sugar

tonnes, reports Reuter. Output in 1991-92 was revised up to 116.17m tonnes.
All estimates are based on national crop years. The statistician reduced
forecasts for India and China, which it described as 'two countries whose
stocks figure importantly in the total supply overhanging the market.' But
production in both would drop in 1992-93, Licht said, 'which will presumably

FT  09 JAN 93 / International Company News: CEA-Industrie to issue shares to
private sector

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CEA-INDUSTRIE, the industrial arm of France's atomic energy commission,
plans to issue shares to private investors this year and is preparing a
strategic development plan to encourage more coherence between its disparate
businesses.
The move, by Mr Jean-Claude Hirel, the former chemicals industry executive
who was appointed chairman last September, is the remnant of an abortive
industrial policy initiative by the previous government of Mrs Edith Cresson
to build a diversified nuclear energy to electronics group from various
public sector assets.
Mr Hirel said his plan, to be tabled in the next two months, would seek 'to
bring into play the synergies' between CEA Industrie's different units. It
had the means to become one of France's leading industrial groups in five
years, he maintained.
Fully owned by the CEA state atomic energy commission, CEA-Industrie is a
holding group for diverse businesses to have grown out of CEA research
projects or inherited from other parts of the public sector, with a combined
turnover of FFr46bn (Dollars 8.51bn) and 56,000 employees. It includes an
indirect stake in SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor maker,
Framatome, France's monopoly supplier of nuclear reactors, full ownership of
Cogema, a nuclear fuels group, and control of a series of medical equipment,
engineering and computer services businesses.
Mr Hirel aimed to open CEA-Industrie's capital to institutional investors or
industrial groups, although the French state would keep a majority stake in
line with current law. The group's FFr21bn of money market funds should also
be put to industrial use, he said in a newspaper interview.
Mr Hirel also plans to relaunch efforts by SGS-Thomson, in which
CEA-Industrie was given part ownership operating responsibility late last
year, to seek a research alliance with Siemens, the German engineering to
electronics group.
Siemens last year spurned an approach from SGS-Thomson, despite European
Commission encouragement for European microchip companies to join forces
against US and Japanese competition.
Since then, the cash hungry SGS-Thomson has won agreement for Dollars 2bn of
fresh investment from its state shareholders over the next five years,
potentially improving its partnership prospects.
Mr Hirel said he was seeking an accord of the same type as an agreement
between SGS-Thomson and Philips, the Dutch electronics group, last year to
co-operate on the development of dedicated logic circuits, a kind of
advanced integrated circuit.

FT  09 JAN 93 / International Company News: The enfant terrible of Swiss
banking - Rainer Gut, the man who has taken Credit Suisse to the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rainer Gut, the 61-year-old chairman of the banking group built around
Credit Suisse, has lost none of his taste for a challenge.
CS Holding's decision this week to acquire the flagging Swiss Volksbank, a
mainly domestic retail bank with too many branches and bad customers, shows
that Mr Gut is also still capable of generating a big surprise.
Until now, he has been known mainly for his determined and remarkably
successful drive to make the Credit Suisse group a major international
financial force, with particular emphasis on the hitherto high-flying
investment banking business.
By contrast, Switzerland, Mr Gut seems to feel, has become a rather
lacklustre financial centre. 'Today we could not irritate anybody,' he said
recently, recalling the late 1960s when the gnomes of Zurich dominated
foreign exchange markets and could even rattle British chancellors.
The other two big Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank
Corporation, were much slower in recognising the limited potential at home
and the need to look abroad for growth, but they have gradually followed Mr
Gut's lead.
Mr Gut's views on banking were formed mainly in New York, where UBS sent him
as a young representative in the late 1950s. He honed his understanding of
US investment banking during a four-year stint at Lazard Freres and looks
back on its legendary innovative former chairman, Mr Andre Meyer, as an
inspiration.
He moved to Credit Suisse's US subsidiary in 1971 and two years later joined
the executive board in Zurich where he was instrumental in setting up a
joint venture to exploit the fledgling Eurobond market in London with the
New York investment bankers White Weld. Then, when White Weld was taken over
by another US firm, he put together what would become a famous partnership
with First Boston.
Within a short time, and with Mr Gut's aggressive backing, Credit Suisse
First Boston became the top London Eurobond house, a position it has held
more or less steadily ever since.
Mr Gut likes to say that he would rather be lucky than smart, and he has
often been blessed with good fortune. No more so than in 1977 when the bank
became engulfed in what became known as the Chiasso scandal.
To this day, CS has not revealed exactly how many millions of francs it lost
as a result of sums creamed from customer accounts at its Chiasso branch in
southern Switzerland and hidden in Liechtenstein.
But Mr Gut was one of the few on the executive committee whose hands were
indisputably not dirty. Although the bank is traditionally the preserve of
the Zurich protestant establishment and the Swiss corporate elite, Mr Gut, a
Catholic from Zug, became executive board spokesman in 1977 and chief
executive in 1982. He has totally dominated the group ever since.
The driving vision of his stewardship has been, and remains, that a bank
with aspirations to being globally active must be strong in both investment
and commercial banking. But the two banking cultures are so different that
they should be kept in strictly separate organisations.
The vision was given concrete form in 1989 when Mr Gut created a holding
structure under CS Holding for the various activities grouped around Credit
Suisse.
The move was hugely expensive, both in terms of taxes on the securities
transfers involved and as a result of the Swiss Federal Banking Commission's
insistence that Credit Suisse itself continue to have sufficient capital to
back all the group's subsidiaries.
And for once, Mr Gut's timing was off. Just as the deal was being completed,
the bottom fell out of the US leveraged buyout and junk bond jamboree,
leaving First Boston stuck with a huge pile of dodgy bridging loans.
Mr Gut gritted his teeth and bailed out his New York friends, taking full
control of First Boston in the process. But ever since, the CS group has
appeared to be scrambling for capital. The acquisition of Volksbank at a
substantial discount to book value is, some think, aimed partly at boosting
the group's capital base, although Mr Gut denies it.
Typically, the First Boston setback did not slow him down. He was the first
of the big three Swiss banks to see the potential of the swaps and options
business and daringly poached a team of specialists from Bankers Trust in
London in 1991 to launch Credit Suisse Financial Products, now one of the
top players in this trendy sector.
All of this activity was, of course, happening outside Switzerland, and it
looked for a long time as if Mr Gut was content to leave the bank in Zurich
to the Swiss army colonels who had always run it.
But in late 1990 CS pounced on Bank Leu, the country's fifth largest bank,
then mired in a dispute over a merger plan with another bank, and now
Volksbank, a SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) takeover that will catapult CS over
the head of UBS to become the country's largest banking group.
While the takeover has been greeted sceptically in many quarters, not least
because of the large amount of rationalisation that needs to be done to
eliminate duplication between the two banks, Mr Gut is unrepentant.
He was right in moving boldly into investment banking in the 1970s, and he
believes that retail banking is going to be a good place for an efficient
operator in the more austere economic environment of the late 1990s. He
points to Citicorp in the US, which has been saved by its strengths in
retail banking.
Moreover, ever the good investment banker, he is delighted to have bought at
what looks like the bottom of the market.

attract local visitors

<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY is slashing the price of entry for local residents to the
EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris in an attempt to boost attendance
during the slack winter season.
For the next three months people living in Ile de France, the region around
the FFr4.2bn (Dollars 770m) park including Paris and its suburbs, will be
able to visit EuroDisneyland for FFr150, rather than the usual FFr225.
Tickets for children under 12 have been reduced, from FFr150 to FFr100.
The price-cuts will be accompanied by extensive advertising in Ile de
France. Euro Disney, which has been clouded by speculation about
disappointing attendance and merchandise sales, said the programme was
similar to local promotions run by the original US theme parks owned by Walt
Disney, its parent company.
One problem has been the unexpectedly low level of attendance by the French.
Originally Euro Disney had expected to attract 11m visitors in the park's
first year. But executives have recently confirmed the level of attendance
is likely to be around 10.5m. The park had 7m visitors in its first six
months. Euro Disney said yesterday October was a 'good' month, November was
'slow', but Christmas was 'very good'.
Euro Disney recently announced a pre-tax loss of FFr339m for the year to
September 30. Mr Richard Simon, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York,
forecasts a steeper pre-tax loss of FFr750m for the current year.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Down but still not out - The resilience of
George Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a resilience to George Walker which says that he will not lie down
under the weight of a pending criminal trial.
Having fought off a Pounds 180m bankruptcy petition last autumn, his defence
of yesterday's charges of theft and false accounting will no doubt be as
pugnacious.
But his arrival at Holborn police station in London yesterday morning to be
arrested, apparently by appointment with the Serious Fraud Office, also
suggests he will not waste his strength on being unnecessarily
unco-operative.
Mr Walker's life can been regarded as a catalogue of setbacks or
disadvantages overcome, not that he would see it that way.
He was the East End boy who left school at 14; the light heavyweight boxer
on the verge of the big-time when a fight ended with his eyesight
permanently impaired; the lad who got mixed up with the wrong crowd and
ended up in prison; the businessman who built a public company and took it
private under threat of a takeover; the entrepreneur who made a comeback on
the stock market with a second public company, Brent Walker.
But equally he was the author of his ultimate downfall. His deals became
larger, and eventually the market turned against him soon after the last,
and biggest purchase - that of the William Hill betting shop business for
Pounds 685m - was completed.
By the middle of 1990 Brent Walker was desperate for cash and unable to sell
assets in a falling property market. In an attempt to raise some money, Mr
Walker arranged a Pounds 100m convertible bond issue, investing Pounds 30m
of his and his family's money - much of which was borrowed from banks now
anxious to see it returned - and recruiting many of the other investors
personally.
Again this episode characterises the man. The company would probably have
done better to go to its bankers and start the whole process of a financial
restructuring earlier. When the legal documents for the bond issue were
being drafted it rapidly became apparent that the company was in deep
trouble and a refinancing was inevitable.
But Mr Walker is a proud man, and would have hated to admit that he could
not sort out any difficulties the group had.
As the refinancing talks progressed, the bankers involved found him
difficult to deal with, and eventually demanded his removal from the board.
He lost his position as chairman in January 1991 and ceased being chief
executive in May that year. But he fought so fiercely that he was not
removed from the board until December, when shareholders approved the
refinancing plans.
He has also overcome severe health problems, having suffered two heart
attacks and major surgery for stomach ulcers. Nevertheless he still has the
look of a fighting fit man at the age of 62.
While bankers and some who did business with Mr Walker are little short of
vitriolic about him, he has throughout his life and business career,
inspired deep loyalties and friendships.
His family has always come first with him. He married his boss's daughter
and although he and his wife Jean make a most unlikely looking couple - he
has the build of a boxer and she is on the tiny side of petite - it seems to
be a devoted marriage.
Despite his hard image, his wife has described him as 'a big softie'
underneath. His children, and now his grandchildren, are a source of
delight.
Whatever the outcome of the trial, and Mr Walker, through his solicitor,
yesterday proclaimed his innocence of any dishonesty, he has a record as a
survivor.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Chinese
buying lifts copper market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSISTENT Chinese buying helped copper prices to break into higher ground
at the London Metal Exchange this week.
A successful assault on resistance a little above Dollars 2,300 a tonne on
Monday took the three months price to a three month high, and the
announcement on Tuesday of an unexpectedly-large 26,625-tonne fall in LME
warehouse stocks encouraged a further rise that peaked just short of Dollars
2,400 a tonne. News of a 2.1 per cent rise in US construction spending in
November was another factor encouraging buyers.
There was a substantial shake-out on Wednesday but support levels held, with
Chinese buying reappearing on dips towards Dollars 2,350 a tonne.
Yesterday saw a Dollars 20 rally, despite disappointment at the announcement
of an LME stocks fall of only 875 tonnes, and the three months price closed
at Dollars 2,378.50 a tonne, up Dollars 70 on the week. The pound's strength
against the dollar this week meant, however, that in sterling terms the
weekly rise was only Pounds 19.25 a tonne.
Chinese buying was also an important factor in the nickel market's advance
early in the week. With extra interest being generated by news that
Falconbridge Dominicana, the Dominican Republic's 29,000-tonnes a year
producer, had suspended production until the end of March because of low
world prices, the cash price rose by a total of Dollars 380 on Monday and
Tuesday. But a wave of profit-taking, exacerbated by the operation of
stop-loss selling orders, trimmed back the gains and at yesterday's close
the cash price was showing a rise of only Dollars 212.50 on the week at
Dollars 6,172.50 a tonne.
Tin prices followed a similar pattern, the cash position losing all but
Dollars 100 of an early Dollars 262.50-a-tonne rise to end at Dollars 5,885
a tonne. Dealers said the rise on Monday and Tuesday was largely a
reflection of improved sentiment in the copper market. In the tin market
itself, they noted, trading had remained extremely thin.
An early rise in aluminium prices was snuffed out even more quickly,
following the announcement on Tuesday of a massive 51,975-tonne rise in LME
stocks. Technically-inspired selling emanating principally from the US kept
the market under pressure and by yesterday's close the cash position at the
LME, which had peaked at Dollars 1,236.50 a tonne on Monday, was down
Dollars 43 on the week at Dollars 1,184.50 a tonne.
At the London bullion market the gold price slumped on Monday to a
seven-year low of Dollars 329.15 a troy ounce; and it remained close to that
for the rest of the week, in spite of the Middle East tension that in times
past would have been expected to boost the yellow metal.
Monday's fall was attributed to selling by South African and Australian
producers, for whom the depressed dollar price of gold was made relatively
attractive by the extreme weakness of their own national currencies. As the
price slid Swiss and Middle Eastern speculators were reported to have
swelled the wave of selling.
The depth of the gold market's present depression was underlined towards the
end of the weak by its failure to respond positively to the growing unease
engendered by the approach of the allied powers' deadline for Iraq to
withdraw anti-aircraft missiles from the southern 'no-fly' zone. 'The
business with Iraq is not causing anyone to go long (buy gold for future
delivery) but it's having enough of an effect to hold off the would-be
sellers,' one trader told the Reuter news agency.
The other market that could have been expected to be buoyed up by the Iraq
crisis was, of course, oil. But here again bearish sentiment was too deeply
entrenched to be dispelled by the sound of Middle East sabre-rattling. With
stocks of oil products remaining very high and members of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries still producing at above their allocated
levels the recent downward pressure on prices was still much in evidence. In
late trading yesterday the March futures position at the London
International Petroleum Exchange's crude oil market was quoted at Dollars
17.75 a barrel, down 61 cents on the week.
An accelerating fall in coffee prices at the London Futures and Options
Exchange took nearby positions about Dollars 90 lower by mid-week,
decisively ending the strong rally that had boosted prices more than Dollars
270 in the final quarter of last year. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI,
the London futures broker, suggested that the fall marked the end of a
classic squeeze in a market that was 'not rational'.
Others thought the London market was merely responding to a
technically-inspired fall in New York coffee prices, reflecting liquidation
by investment funds and speculators. One New York analyst, Ms Judy Ganes of
Merrill Lynch, said she remained convinced that the fall did not spell the
end of the bull run, which had been underpinned by constructive
fundamentals, particularly and an expected production fall in Brazil, the
biggest producer.
London prices recovered somewhat on Thursday and yesterday, but in New York
yesterday Thursday's sharp rally was more or less wiped out by
mid-afternoon. London traders said the market was delicately balanced and a
resumption of the decline looked possible in the short term before prices
started to move higher again.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Threat to creditor agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARGES brought yesterday against Mr George Walker, former head of the Brent
Walker property, pubs and betting group, centred on Pounds 12.5m of money
said to be missing from the group, writes Maggie Urry.
The sum relates to two payments. A Pounds 5m payment made in connection with
a French property deal, and a Pounds 7.5m payment to Goldcrest Films and
Television, then owned by Brent Walker, but allegedly not received by the
company.
Brent Walker said yesterday that the arrest of Mr Walker, and Mr Wilfred
Aquilina, the former finance director, had no impact on the group.
Lawyers acting for six banks pursuing Mr George Walker with a claim for
Pounds 40m, said yesterday that his arrest could affect his chances of
continuing to stave off bankruptcy.
The lawyers said yesterday that Mr Walker's defence costs could be so large
as to prevent him making payments to creditors agreed under a voluntary
arrangement.
Mr Walker persuaded sufficient of his creditors to agree to the arrangement
that he was able to defeat a petition for bankruptcy last autumn. However,
the banks have continued to fight it.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Analysts downgrade forecasts for Boots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Boots Company fell yesterday after analysts downgraded their
profit forecasts following disappointing final quarter sales figures from Do
It All, the retail group's loss-making DIY joint venture with WH Smith.
Boots' shares fell 26p to 509p while those of WH Smith declined by 19p to
469p.
The City had been eagerly awaiting the trading statement from Boots for
further signs that Christmas trading was stronger than in the previous year.
January sales were widely reported to have enjoyed their busiest start for
years.
The main sales figures from the group's chemist division were in line with
both the directors' and analysts' expectations. Sales increased by 5.5 per
cent in the last quarter of 1992 compared to the previous year.
Commenting on the figures Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said: 'In common
with many other retailers the Boots' businesses, which are Christmas
sensitive, demonstrated a late sales peak.'
Boots Opticians showed a particularly strong 11.7 per cent sales gain, but
the company said results in Childrens World with 2.3 per cent sales growth,
and Halfords, with a 3.1 per cent gain, were 'somewhat lower.' However, the
group said there have been improvements in post-Christmas sales.
In the wake of the announcement most analysts cut their profit forecasts for
Boots by between Pounds 5m and Pounds 15m.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Power makes full provision against
Trocadero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWER CORPORATION, the Irish property group, last night made a 'full
provision' against its Trocadero and Island Site properties, after its
subsidiaries owning the sites were put into receivership. The company added
that its own bankers 'continue to be supportive'.
It brought forward the announcement of its interim results for the period to
September 30, which revealed retained losses of IPounds 75.1m (Pounds
78.8m), compared with profits of IPounds 1.66m, after an extraordinary
provision of IPounds 55.7m relating to its investment in the properties.
There was a write down of IPounds 23.7m against revaluation reserves also
relating to them.
The pre-tax loss was IPounds 19.4m (profits IPounds 5.1m) after an
exceptional write down relating to other properties of IPounds 17m. Losses
per share were 16.68p (earnings 3.42p) and the interim dividend has been
passed, against 2p. Shareholders' funds fell from IPounds 234.4m to IPounds
135.6m over the six months.
KPMG Peat Marwick was appointed as administrative receiver to five companies
owned by Power, known collectively as the Power Trocadero group, which own
the Trocadero leisure, cinema and office complex in Piccadilly, central
London, and the adjacent Island Site. The five companies have borrowings
totalling Pounds 225m.
The development of the Trocadero and the Island Site had been a joint
venture between Power Corporation and Brent Walker, the overborrowed
property and leisure group.
In March last year Power Corporation bought the Brent Walker stake. The
terms of the deal put a value on the properties of about Pounds 300m, but
property values have fallen since then. Brent Walker is still a significant
tenant in the Trocadero.
Power Corporation had intended to complete the development and find another
partner to buy the Brent Walker half share. Borrowings relating to the Power
Trocadero group were 'non-recourse' to Power.
Rents from the properties were running at about Pounds 8m a year,
insufficient to service debts. An application to turn 70,000 sq ft of unlet
offices into leisure space was turned down late last year.
Mr Robin Power, chairman, said that there had been negotiations on a new
longer term banking arrangement for the Power Trocadero companies but
agreement could not be reached after the failure to get the planning
permission. Sanwa Bank, the lead bank to the syndicate which lent to the
Power Trocadero group, called in the receiver.
Last summer Power Corporation passed its final dividend when profits for the
15 months to March 1992 fell and because of what was then termed
'temporarily high' gearing as a result of buying the Brent Walker interest.
Mr Power said the six months to September 30 had been difficult for property
and no sales were made during the period. He added that reducing gearing,
which after the removal of the Power Trocadero companies and the write downs
was still about 145 per cent, remained a priority.
The receivers said that the Power Trocadero companies would be run on a
going concern basis and orderly disposals of assets sought.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Herring Baker Harris Group, the chartered surveyors, fell 27p to
103p yesterday on news that the group expected to report a small second half
loss.
It was also planning to cut its final dividend from 3.75p to 0.5p to make a
total of 3.75p, against 7p.
Taxable profits for the 1991-92 year totalled Pounds 3.51m with the second
half con-tribution amounting to Pounds 1.7m.
Since the interim results for the current year, when a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 1.81m) was reported, the company said that property
markets had continued to be difficult with activity in the agency and
investment sectors lower than expected.
During the year a programme of cost savings was implemented, the full
benefits of which the company expected to see in the next financial year.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Call to remove A Shaw chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of Arthur Shaw &amp; Company, the USM-quoted builders' materials
group, have received a notice convening an extraordinary general meeting to
propose the removal from the board of Mr Gordon Pearson, the chairman, and
the appointment of Mr Ian Tickler and Mr Donald Crammond.
The notice was issued by two accounts in the name of Grange Nominees in
respect of a holding of 1.17m shares, or 13.4 per cent, which the directors
understand represents the Tickler family interests.
Certain other shareholders are thought to have indicated their support. The
combined total of all these interests represents more than 49 per cent of
Shaw's equity.
Talks between the directors, Mr Tickler and Granville &amp; Co, acting as
adviser for the 49 per cent interest, failed to reach a negotiated
settlement on the differences between the parties and the Tickler family
interests declined to withdraw the notice.
Shareholders will be notified of the meeting in due course.

Grosvenor Inns, a pub operator in and around London and in the Midlands,
returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 319,000 from a turnover of Pounds 3.52m
for the half year ended November 28.
The group came to the USM in May 1992. The directors said turnover and
profits had been adjusted to exclude the disposal of two loss-making pubs
and others earmarked for disposal.
They added that with improved operating margins and the acquisition and
disposal programme well under way they were confident of a 'much stronger
performance' in the second half.
An interim dividend of 2p is being paid from earnings of 2.8p. The shares
rose 7p to 85p.

That compared with a loss of Pounds 297,000 last time and with a deficit of
Pounds 162,000 at the halfway stage. Turnover for the year fell from Pounds
34m to Pounds 32.2m. Losses per share came out at 2.85p (9.3p).
In August last year the Cheshire-based maker of sports, leisure, baby and
children's wear and which also has interests in printing and packaging,
warned that action had to be taken to reduce production capacity because of
the fall in demand. This led to exceptional expenses of Pounds 529,000 and
an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.31m.
Mr David Sebire, chairman, said the group would not be in a position to pay
dividends until there was a return to profitability.
The company also announced that Mr Colin Greenhalgh had replaced Mr Tony
Cant as chief executive.
Mr Cant will be leaving the company.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone in Pounds 10m lingerie purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods distributor, has moved into the
lingerie market with the purchase of Spanish company Aznar Industrial for
Pounds 10.4m.
The purchase price was higher than the Pounds 9m foreshadowed at the time of
Hartstone's results in November.
However, Mr David Grattan, finance director, said this had been due to the
acquisition of slightly more net assets than originally planned, as well as
the effect of currency movements since the deal was initially agreed.
The price of the goodwill had remained firm at about Pounds 8m.
The acquisition will be financed with an initial cash consideration of
Pounds 3.6m. There will be a further cash payment of Pounds 5.6m, in
addition to the allotment of 596,000 shares. Hartstone's shares closed 7p
higher at 237p.
Aznar Industrial was a sister company of the hosiery manufacturer, Aznar,
acquired by Hartstone in January last year.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Laporte wins the battle for Evode
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAPORTE yesterday won its battle with Wassall for control of Evode with a
recommended Pounds 129.4m bid for the chemicals and plastics group.
Wassall, the mini-conglomerate, immediately dropped its hostile offer worth
Pounds 113.2m. Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, said: 'It took us just 50
seconds to make our exit. We were outbid by an expensive strategic buyer.
Laporte must have really wanted it.'
Laporte is also offering a full cash alternative of 115p a share compared
with Wassall's 95p in cash.
Mr Andrew Simon, Evode's chief executive, said the fight for Evode had
enabled him to secure the best price. 'Laporte's offer has blown Wassall out
of the water. It is the best possible deal for shareholders.'
Mr Simon is to become a non-executive director of the enlarged Laporte,
while Mr David Winterbottom, Evode's chief executive, is to become a full
time consultant for a year.
It is the first deal Wassall has failed to win since the two former Hanson
exectuives founded the group four years ago.
Mr Miller, said: 'We identified a good target which was undervalued and
badly managed but we were not willing to overpay. Our failure to win does
not put us off from going hostile again.'
Laporte's shares fell by 27p to 583p. Since announcing its talks with Evode,
its share price has fallen by 10 per cent. Evode's shares rose 13p to 119p,
while Wassall's firmed 1p to 210p.
Schroders, which is advising Laporte, yesterday bought another 6.1 per cent
of Evode, which with irrevocable undertakings from shareholders, took
Laporte's stake in Evode above 20 per cent.
Laporte is also raising Pounds 84.4m via a placing and 1-for-10 open offer
at 560p per share. At the close of business on December 13, it had
outstanding net debts of Pounds 127.3m, while Evode had net debts of Pounds
41.9m.
Laporte is offering 23 new shares for every 112 Evode shares, valuing each
Evode share at 120p.
The offer values Evode's convertible preference shares at 104p on the basis
of five new Laporte shares for every 28 preference shares. There is also a
full cash alternative worth 100p.
The chemicals company has focused its activities into five core areas which
comprise construction chemicals, organic speciality chemicals, absorbent
chemicals, hygiene and process chemicals and metals and electronics
chemicals.
For the financial year to January 3 1993 Laporte is forecasting pre-tax
profits of at least Pounds 86m (Pounds 97.2m) and earnings per share of not
less than 39p (50p) with a total dividend of at least 19.5p (18.9p).
Laporte also announced the acquisition of Silo, the Italian manufacturer of
synthetic iron oxide colouring pigments, for Pounds 6m. Silo also has
borrowings of Pounds 17m. In 1991, Silo's sales were Pounds 16.1m and
operating profits Pounds 2.8m.
Wassall is likely to cover the expense of its failed bid with the Pounds 1m
it made from the sale of its 2.5m Evode shares which it bought at around 80p
a share.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: A tough task of blending the chemicals -
Rationalisation lies ahead for Evode
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAPORTE, the UK's second largest quoted chemical company, appears to be
paying a stiff price for Evode, the chemicals and plastics concern.
The company, led by its ebullient chief executive, Mr Ken Minton, will be
stumping up Pounds 129.4m to acquire Evode's shares, debt instruments and
debt. That is some Pounds 16.2m more than the sum proposed by Wassall, the
mini-conglomerate that was contesting a hostile bid for Evode.
When it comes to bidding for companies Mr Chris Miller, Wassall's chief
executive, says he always sticks to the rule laid down by his former boss
Lord Hanson, the eponymous chairman: write down the maximum price you are
willing to pay for a company before bidding and then put it away.
Mr Miller, while declining to reveal what his maximum price may have been
for Evode, says: 'Laporte's recommended offer slipped past it quite easily.'
Mr Minton promises the deal will not dilute Laporte's earnings during the
first 12 months following the acquisition's completion. He claims the
target, even without an economic recovery, should not prove demanding.
Disposals will not be needed to achieve its aim, he adds. But analysts
believe the purchase is likely to stretch Laporte's management skills.
Its borrowings will rise significantly. It is inheriting Pounds 41.9m debt
from Evode and Pounds 17m from Silo, the Italian acquisition it announced
yesterday. The group will also have to spend Pounds 28m in paying off
Evode's unlisted US redeemable preference shareholders. Gearing, however,
will remain just under 40 per cent because of the issuing of 37.6m new
shares (15.4m in the placing and open offer and 22.2m in the share swap).
Evode made pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.2m last year on turnover of Pounds
271m - not a particularly distinguished set of results, admits Mr Minton.
The aim will be to improve margins from the existing 3.8 per cent. Laporte's
margins are about 14.2 per cent.
The margin improvement will partly be driven by cost savings, according to
Mr Minton.
Mr Minton believes Evode's businesses can be managed more effectively. 'We
can make money by being ruthlessly efficient and adding technology,' he
explains.
Laporte is no stranger to rationalisation, says Mr Minton. He points out
that over the last two years the number of sites in the European absorbents
business has been reduced from five to three, saving Pounds 6m. Meanwhile,
the number of worldwide locations manufacturing construction chemicals has
been cut from 26 to 14, saving Pounds 2.5m.
Two of Evode's businesses - adhesives and sealants operations and the
polymer compounding subsidiaries - are viewed as core by Mr Minton. These
represent about 67 per cent of Evode's continuing turnover of about Pounds
240m and will be integrated into Laporte.
Evode's adhesives and sealants operations with sales of Pounds 81m will be
integrated with Laporte's construction division. The US specialty polymer
compound businesses, involved in flame retardant wires, medical and beverage
plastics and footwear, are high margin operations, says Mr Minton. The
Italian subsidiary is efficient, but Evode Plastics in the UK needs to be
rationalised and moved into higher margin areas. The whole division has a
turnover of Pounds 85.1m.
The bulk of rationalisation will fall on Evode's three other business areas
 -plastics fabrication, powder coatings and a grouping of other businesses.
Mr Minton says these contain some good subsidiaries and some that need
dealing with.
In plastics fabrication businesses - generating annual sales of Pounds 22.4m
 -the US and Italian companies are fine, as is Chamberlain Plastics in the
UK, according to Mr Minton. However, the weaker companies, Evode Clearex,
making injection and reaction moulding chemicals, and Rushden Granulating,
manufacturer of rubber granules, require refocusing and rationalisation.
Mr Minton says he is open-minded about the powder coatings businesses which
generate annual sales of Pounds 19.4m. Margins are not sufficient and the
subsidiaries have to cope with large competitors such as Imperial Chemical
Industries and Courtaulds. There are also problems with the German
operations.
The fifth and final grouping of Evode companies does not make sense, says Mr
Minton. CP Coatings, a UK subsidiary making vinyl wallpaper base, and
Sterling Coatings, another UK company manufacturer of resin insulators, are
profitable but non-core.
In spite of Mr Minton's plans, analysts remain to be convinced that
Laporte's move makes sense either strategically or financially.
Whether Laporte's chief executive is right will only be finally decided in
March 1994, a year after the group takes control of Evode.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: EFM pays Pounds 2.5m for 10 Target Life
unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDINBURGH FUND Managers is acquiring the 10 unit trusts of Target Life
Assurance Company. The move is a further sign of consolidation in the retail
investment fund industry.
EFM is paying Pounds 2.5m cash, which is a little more than 2.25 per cent of
the Pounds 110m in funds under management in the unit trusts. EFM expects
the transaction to increase its earnings per share.
The move gives EFM Pounds 320m in unit trusts under management and
approximately 60,000 unit holders and make it the UK's 20th largest unit
trust manager in terms of clients.
Annual unit trust fund management fees are about 1 per cent of funds under
management and EFM could recoup its costs in under three years, industry
analysts said.
EFM is buying the share capital of Target Trust Managers but will not be
employing any of the current staff or management of the company.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Equitable Life places Airtours stake at
260p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS' hostile Pounds 214.5m bid for rival holiday tour operator, Owners
Abroad, showed signs yesterday that it has met with a less than unanimous
welcome from shareholders.
Equitable Life Assurance, the fund manager, placed a 6.4 per cent stake with
Morgan Grenfell at 260p, about 31p below the price at which Airtours closed
on Thursday night.
Airtours shares dipped below 280p yesterday, some 8p below the price at
which the partial cash alternative is being underwritten by BZW and The
British Linen Bank. However, they ended the day 3p down at 288p.
Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, said he was sorry to see Equitable
go but was pleased that BZW had placed the block so quickly and with one
share-holder.
'During the course of the bid there will be ups and downs, he said. 'It's
early days yet.'
Meanwhile, Thomas Cook denied market rumours that it had withdrawn its offer
of a tie-up with Owners Abroad, which was announced last month.
Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, said its offer
remained 'a very strong commercial proposition'. It has proposed to take a
10 per cent stake in Owners Abroad and form the basis for Owners to develop
a pan-european holiday company,
'We have every expectation and hope that the offer will be accepted' by
Owners Abroad shareholders, he said. Owners has adjourned the EGM at which
this proposal was to be addressed.
Equitable is understood to have become an Airtours shareholder in 1990 and
was sitting on a substantial profit.
Owners Abroad shares slipped 3p to 119p.

FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Pizza Express to join market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIZZA EXPRESS, the privately-owned restaurant chain founded by Mr Peter
Boizot in 1965, is coming to market through a reverse takeover organised by
the Watford-based Star Computer Group.
Trading in Star Computer's shares was suspended at 47p on December 22 at the
company's request pending an announcement about a 'substantial acquisition'.
Yesterday Mr Boizot and Mr David Blechner, Star's chairman, confirmed that a
deal should be finalised next month. 'We are at the paperwork stage,' said
Mr Blechner.
Under the terms of the proposed deal Star will fund the acquisition of Pizza
Express by issuing some 35m new shares at about 40p each.
The Pizza Express chain comprises 70 restaurants, mostly in London and the
south-east, including 49 independent franchises and nine restaurants run by
Mr David Page who is expected to be in charge of the day-to-day operations
of the company.
It is the oldest and probably the most successful of the pizza chains in
Britain with profits last year of about Pounds 2.4m on turnover of Pounds
29m.
Mr Boizot, who acknowledged that he will receive a 'substantial cash sum' as
a result of the deal, will become chairman of the new publicly-quoted
company and its largest shareholder with 'at least' a 20 per cent equity
stake.
He is also keeping two of his London restaurants, Pizza on the Park in
Knightsbridge, and Kettners, in Soho, which together have an annual turnover
of between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m. The deal will also allow Mr Boizot's
current minority partners, with whom he has had some recent disagreements,
to cash in their stakes.
After the acquisition, and a proposed rights issue to pay off debts and
provide capital for expansion, Star will become a self-contained subsidiary
of Pizza Express.
Star supplies software and services to specialist markets and has been
substantially restructured by its current management led by Mr Blechner. It
returned to profitability in its latest financial year posting a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 119,000 against a loss of Pounds 886,000 in the previous
year.

<BYLINE>
   From Dr STEPHEN CASTELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Taylor's lacey, crinkly ruff model to explain the missing mass
in the universe (Letters, January 6) is supported by the idea developed by
my children (then aged 13 and 15) a few years ago.
This is the 'isochronous universe' - a universe awash with 'isobars' of
equal time. If the technology could be developed, so the idea goes, to find
and use such isochrones, a traveller could simply slip along them (rather
than across them, the normal way we experience time) and could traverse vast
interstellar distances essentially 'instantaneously'.
I agree with Mr Taylor that it is unthinkable that we should not be able to
explore the whole of creation, and not just this tiny earth-speck. The
isochrone traveller may well one day easily manage it.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Superwoman is shackled: The reaction to Japan's royal
bride-to-be
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has a severe case of royal fever. Amid the gloom of recession, this
week's announcement that Crown Prince Naruhito, seemingly destined to a
lonely life of bachelorhood, has finally found a bride, has provoked a range
of emotions from tears of joy among shoppers to a forecast that the economy
will grow by an extra 0.8 per cent this year.
There is a general sense that the crown prince, the 32-year-old heir to
Japan's Chrysanthemum Throne, has chosen well. Miss Masako Owada, 29, a
career diplomat, speaks English, French and German, shares his love of
ski-ing and tennis and, after a stint at Harvard, studied, like the prince,
at Oxford University.
But his choice has also provoked a debate about the role of women in Japan.
Miss Owada, whose father is vice foreign minister, is on a fast track in her
career. She has sat in on negotiations with Mr James Baker, the former US
secretary of state, and Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative. She
has also been responsible for policy formulation on semiconductors, one of
the most sensitive trade issues between the US and Japan.
Her career will be sacrificed for the cloistered life of loyal wife to the
crown prince, responsible for official tree planting and paper-folding
festivals. Miss Owada, likely to be wed in May, has already handed in her
notice, and her decision has provoked dismay among some Japanese women, who
are painfully making their way through the male-dominated hierarchies of
business and the government bureaucracy. 'I can't believe she's giving up
her job,' said one career woman, expressing her shock over the resignation
of Miss Owada, dubbed 'Superwoman' by the media.
By contrast, many Japanese men, who feel threatened by the emergence of
stronger career women, are sure she has done the right thing. 'Japanese
women should follow her example, they're just not made for the workplace,'
says one male office worker.
But Miss Owada's acceptance of the imperial proposal has also inspired hope
that she may be able to weaken the stifling influence of the Imperial
Household Agency, the division of the civil service that is in charge of
imperial matters and keeps the imperial family aloof from the public. Many
Japanese want their royal family to become more accessible, and see the
British royal family as a model.
The agency's determination to maintain its tight control over royal affairs
and the mystique of the imperial family was shown in a recent controversy
over Prince's Aki's hair.
The agency was outraged by an unauthorised snapshot of Prince Akishino, the
younger brother of the crown prince, having a strand of hair swept from his
forehead by Princess Kiko, his wife, moments before their wedding. The
picture was banned by news agencies and the photographer was sacked.
Another sign of the agency's strong grip on royal affairs was its ability to
impose a black-out on media coverage of Prince Naruhito's search for a
bride. It blamed previous media reports for his difficulty in finding a
match and said that, as the next emperor and spiritual head of the Shinto
religion, Naruhito should be protected from press intrusion.
On a more worldly level, Japanese businessmen are hoping that the imperial
marriage will stimulate the sluggish economy. Consumer spending revived
before the wedding of Akihito, the current emperor, and empress Michiko in
1959. The research arm of Nippon Life, the country's largest life assurer,
estimates the royal engagement could add as much as Y3,300bn (Pounds 17bn)
in consumer spending this year through sales of commemorative souvenirs and
new housing demand triggered by an increase in the number of couples getting
married.
Electronics manufacturers hope for a boost from a new 'Michi boom' - the
sharp increase in sales of television sets to people wanting to watch the
1959 wedding. Most Japanese now have a television set, but that has not
stopped profit-starved executives from suggesting that a royal wedding could
be just the thing for high-definition television, which has so far been an
over-priced flop.
The imperial wedding will certainly be over-promoted, with the Japanese
government suggesting yesterday that it would be made a national holiday,
and media organisations already assigning squadrons of reporters to prepare
programmes on every conceivable royal issue. But whether the imperial
marriage is a flop depends on Prince Naruhito, who will either take Miss
Owada by the hand and lead her into a new era of openness or ensure a life
of frustrating, refined confinement.
The prince has expressed a desire for a more informal relationship between
the imperial family and the people, and has complained about excess security
precautions. Film footage of the prince's life behind the palace walls this
week showed him jogging, apparently alone, until the camera panned to the
right, showing a pack of security officials scurrying behind him.
Having observed the British royal family during his time as a graduate
student at Oxford, the prince recently expressed his admiration for the
Windsors' social profile. After their recent problems, however, the crown
prince may well be hoping that his journey through married life proves
somewhat smoother.

Is the prestige worth the pain? That is the question which President
Francois Mitterrand and most of France's political and business
establishment must ask themselves as they soldier on in defence of the
franc's present parity with the D-mark.
Mr Mitterrand believes there is far more than prestige at stake in keeping
the franc level-pegging with the D-mark. For him, there is the overwhelming
political importance of preserving the dream of monetary union. And there is
no one in France who disagrees that the present link between the franc and
the D-mark is all that pins the European Monetary System together at the
moment.
But it is the economic rationale of the franc fort policy that is seriously
weakening in the face of growing redundancies and record real interest
rates, shoving up the misery index for many French companies and citzens.
Underneath the political crust of support for the franc fort, the economy is
rumbling with discontent. Peugeot's announcement this week that it was
laying off 2,600 jobs - 4 per cent of its workforce - made clear that there
will be no respite this year in the trend that saw a record 600,000 job
losses last year. This took the total number of unemployed to 3m, or 10.4
per cent of the workforce.
The lay-offs have come in every branch of industry and have not spared the
service sector. Every time there is a run on the franc, higher market
interest rates present banks with the choice of seeing clients go under or
themselves losing money. Banks and insurance companies are having to
practise various forms of financial engineering - assets swaps, selling and
leasing back buildings - to limit the impact of the slide in the value of
their property holdings.
The unrelenting pace of redundancies may be as much the result of domestic
fiscal and social policies as of the battle on the foreign exchanges to
maintain the value of the French currency. But an increasing number of those
doing the firing seem to put the blame on the franc fort policy and the high
levels of interest rates it requires. In a survey by the business paper, Les
Echos, this week, 71 per cent of a sample of 402 company bosses said they
hoped that, if the centre-right parties carried the March parliamentary
elections, the new government would abandon monetary rigour for interest
rate cuts.
For the opposition, this is a highly unwelcome view from its natural
business constituency. The single element of support for Minister Pierre
Beregovoy's socialist government from the top leaders of the Gaullist RPR
and Giscardian UDF parties is for its exchange rate policy. Indeed, they are
actively conspiring with the government's efforts to talk up the franc.
Socialist and opposition leaders have joined in disparaging the minority
advocates of 'soft money' in each other's camp. Such disparagement became
slightly more difficult when Mr Alain Madelin, a former UDF minister and
pro-European, last month urged a floating of the franc from the European
Monetary System.
Equally, both government and opposition leaders now talk in non-partisan
terms about the need to give the Banque de France statutory independence
from the government of the day, a move considered vital to bolster the franc
and necessary to comply with the Maastricht treaty on eventual monetary
union.
Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, has said that to try to rush through
a new central bank statute before the March election would show 'a lack of
confidence' in the opposition, which he, like every other reader of French
opinion polls, expects to form the next government.
For his part, Mr Edouard Balladur, tipped as prime minister in that new
government, yesterday admitted his 'error' in not pushing autonomy for the
Banque de France, when he was finance minister in the 1986-88 conservative
government.
The same consensus does not exist on public finances, which according to an
independent estimate yesterday by the Centre for Economic Studies are likely
to be FFr220m (Pounds 25.8m) in the red this year and FFr250m next year. Mr
Beregovoy more or less conceded these estimates, when he admitted this week
that the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic
Development and Cooperation had been more accurate in estimating growth this
year at around 1.5-1.6 per cent than his own government's estimate of 2.6
per cent.
But a charge of fiscal extravagance is hard for the oppostion to level at Mr
Beregovoy, who throughout the dour nine months of his premiership has only
come up with penny packets of reflation - some low-interest loans for small
business in October, some tax relief for the sick property sector in
December, and this week's announcement of speedier VAT refunds to help
companies' cash flow. Equally, Mr Balladur said yesterday that he looked
first to tax reform and German-led interest rate cuts to spur economic
revival, which only over time would boost tax receipts to reduce the budget
deficit.
Despite the fact that the economy is likely to grow by more than 1 per cent
this year, there is increasing frustration that the past ten years of
austerity have failed to yield the expected benefits.
France has now achieved lower inflation than Germany, but its interests
rates remain higher. Its trade surplus - FFr23bn in the first nine months of
last year - is now threatened by the depreciation of many of its neighbours'
currencies. Blackest of all is the unemployment picture.
Much of the jobless increase can be blamed on the high level of real
interest rates, which but for the need to keep the franc in lock-step with
the D-Mark should have fallen over the past two years as inflation,
investment and economic activity have sunk together.
The banks have tried to diminish the pain to their lenders at some cost to
themselves, claims Mr Robert de Bruin, director of the Association of French
Banks. Keeping their base rates below 10 per cent, when measures to defend
the franc in September and early October last year drove money market rates
to a peak of 20 per cent, cost the banks FFr400m, he says.
Since then, however, banks have raised their base rates to 10 per cent or
above. 'It is good commercial sense not to hurt our clients', says Mr de
Bruin. 'We can hold the line on rates, but only for short periods.'
A host of structural factors are also to blame for the mismatch of supply
and demand in France's labour market. But one fact has now shot to political
prominence. This is the new freedom with which French firms lay off their
workers. Their motive is the high social payroll charges, which, as Mr
Balladur was complaining yesterday, mean that total wage costs in France
amount to 19 per cent of GDP, compared to 11 per cent in Germany.
The last conservative government repealed in 1986 the law that made
redundancies subject to the public authorities' approval. But only in the
past 18 months have companies really exploited their freedom to shed labour.
The wave of recent lay-offs, some of them perhaps long overdue from before
1986, has hit far more sectors than in any previous economic downturn. Some
of them are perhaps long-overdue. Air France, for example, is making forced
redundancies for the first time.
The Patronat employers' federation naturally rejects charges that its
members are trigger happy in firing people, and it and the unions are
embroiled in a separate dispute over unemployment insurance, accusing the
state (with some justice) of shirking its responsibilities. Indeed, issuing
a report this week on French competitiviness, Mr Jean Gandois, the head of
Pechiney, the metals group, complained that companies are further
handicapped by the unfair share of unemployment insurance costs they have to
shoulder.
It is hardly surprising, in present circumstances, that the Beregovoy
government should hanker after the old 1986 law. Nor was it surprising that
last month it passed a law requiring companies to first present a plan to
try to give workers alternative jobs before making them redundant. In the
absence of such plans, redundancies can be declared legally invalid. Mr
Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, said employers should think twice
before laying people off. Mr Balladur even floated the idea of levying
social charges on a company's turnover, not its payroll, thereby denying it
cost savings from lay-offs.
The opposition is clearly growing anxious about the state of the economy for
which it is likely to inherit responsibility. Precisely because the
unemployment crisis is intractable, there is always the temptation to reach
for a simplistic solution, such as abandoning the franc's present parity
with the D-mark.
The deeper France enters into its election campaign, and the longer the
Bundesbank maintains its rates at the present level, the greater that
temptation grows.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Letter: UK needs to lift costly artificial barriers to
employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HENRY LAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Percy Barnevik expresses his concern about the large-scale job losses
which will result from the industrial restructuring the single market will
bring about ('Life in the Single Market', January 4).
In any normally functioning economy, such surplus labour would be promptly
re-employed. Most of us could compile a long list of jobs which need to be
done. Pavements need mending, supermarket checkouts are under-staffed and
hospitals have pared down their workforce of ancillaries to a bare minimum.
Bus conductors and station porters vanished long ago even though many of us
would still welcome their services.
Probably the most important reason why labour is difficult to re-employ is
the overall shape of the tax and benefit system. This sends the wrong
signals both to the individual who is unemployed, and to any potential
employer. The combination of means-tested benefits and low tax thresholds
effectively acts as a very high marginal rate of tax for anyone moving from
unemployment to employment. This creates an artificial barrier to employment
which amounts to a lock-out of labour. In the beleaguered public sector,
this mechanism means that it is apparently very costly to take someone out
of unemployment into a low-paid job. The necessary reform would ensure that,
however little a worker was paid, he would be better off than not working at
all. It is a matter of getting the arithmetic right. The issue was discussed
in detail in Beyond the Welfare State, by Samuel Brittan and Steven Webb,
who concluded that what is required, among other things, is a change to some
form of universal benefit, not means-tested, on the lines of the basic
income or negative income tax schemes. This is the only way of reducing the
present barrier to employment.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Letter: Advantages of BBC licence fee must not be ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms PAMELA TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Sawers ignores some telling advantages for retaining the licence
fee in his Personal View (January 6).
He claims the license fee will be harder to sustain as a fair method of
funding the BBC as new broadcasting services proliferate. Certainly,
audiences will fragment and BBC audience share will therefore reduce, as
John Birt, the director-general, has stated, by the end of the decade.
However, best estimates suggest that rather more than 90 per cent of
households will still be watching or listening to an average of 24 hours of
BBC programmes each week and the BBC is determined that its 24 hours of
enjoyment will include distinctive programmes not matched elsewhere for
range and quality.
At present the full range of BBC services for a week - television, radio,
regional, local and Ceefax - costs less than one video hire, satellite and
cable subscriptions or the single ITV channel. In fact, research shows the
public may be willing to pay a higher licence fee than at present.
Mr Sawers also misses an important advantage of the licence fee system - as
a direct link between the BBC and its audiences, by-passing politicians.
A retail prices index-linked licence fee minimises political pressure which
can never be entirely removed from the electronic media, as the recent ITV
franchises round has demonstrated.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Letter: Sunday trading: protect staff or follow Scotland?
(2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL COULSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Act swiftly on Sunday trading', is timely and commands
overwhelming support among the public.
That the law in England and Wales regarding Sunday trading is an ass is
easily demonstrated. First, retailing and shopping is a wholly legal and
desirable activity, but it is restricted by the mores and conditions current
in 1950. Also ridiculous is the fact that unregulated Sunday trading is
legal in an important part of the UK, to wit Scotland.
What is required now is action to bring the law on Sunday trading in England
and Wales into line with the law in Scotland.
If, however, parliament insists on defying the will of the people then I am
afraid that the law in Scotland must be brought into line with the
restrictions in England and Wales. If Sunday trading is judged by our
legislators, some of whom represent Scottish parliamentary seats, to be bad
for the English and the Welsh, it must also be bad for the Scots. Michael

Sir, I fully agree with the heading to your editorial that the government
should 'Act swiftly on Sunday trading' (December 30).
It is surprising that you seem to believe that effective legal protection of
staff not wishing to work on Sundays is possible. Yet you frequently report
cases of discrimination because of race or sex. Quite recently you reported
that even women barristers feel they are discriminated against. Then, of
course, there are those who suffer in silence knowing that the effectiveness
of anti-discrimination laws is nothing but a mirage.
Let's be realistic and find a new way to restrict Sunday trading. Sunday
trading is significantly restricted in most of Europe. We would be foolish
to step out of line.

FT  09 JAN 93 / No easy solution to spills at sea: Measures to prevent
shipping accidents have failings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gales and bad weather continued to hamper the clean-up process yesterday
after the oil tanker, Braer, crashed on rocks to the south of the Shetland
Isles on Tuesday. While salvage crews lost hope of boarding the stricken
vessel this weekend to pump out oil, environmentalists and opposition MPs
demanded to know why two similar disasters should have happened in European
waters in the past month.
The tanker Aegean Sea broke up off the coast of north-west Spain in early
December, causing widespread environmental pollution. In the wake of both
disasters, the EC is looking at tightening rules governing tanker traffic.
Politicians in the UK are calling on the government to widen the inquiry
into the cause of the Braer wreck to cover tanker safety in general.
Are tougher controls needed, or would they only further burden an industry
which is vital to the world economy, yet labouring under the pressures of
recession and low oil prices?
The oil and shipping industries are already campaigning against new
controls. They point out that tougher regulation - and declining tanker
traffic - has meant that the amount of oil spilled at sea has been steadily
declining throughout the 1980s. The number of accidental spills has risen in
the past couple of years, but remains much lower than in 1974. The oil lobby
argues that some spills are inevitable.
However the economics of the business has also deteriorated with the sharp
fall in freight rates, raising the question of whether forced economies
contributed to the recent spate of incidents.
Shipping organisations estimate, for example, that freight rates would have
to increase three-fold from their current level of about Dollars 15,000 a
day for an average vessel to provide shipowners with an adequate return on
new investment. Scrap values have also fallen so low that tanker owners may
find it more economic to keep ageing ships than to sell them to
shipbreakers.
Numast, the maritime officers union, maintains that out of the ships checked
in British ports in 1991, more than half were found to have defects that
could affect the safe operation of the vessels.
'There has been savage cost-cutting in world shipping, particularly in the
tanker industry, and we are paying the price for it with a declining safety
record,' said Mr Andrew Linington at Numast.
Tanker owners agree the ageing of the world's fleet has resulted in more
defects. But they say that freight rates have been forced down to such a low
level that they cannot afford to modernise their fleets.
'A shipowner is responsible for maintaining his ships at high standard, but
he must be given the means to do so,' said Mr Andreas Ugland, chairman of
Intertanko, the independent tanker owners' association.
There are also signs that cost-cutting has led to the use of cheaper and
poorly trained crews. According to the International Chamber of Shipping, 80
per cent of tanker accidents can be traced to human error. Standards of
training colleges in countries such as the Philippines, which contributes
more seafarers to the world fleet than any other country, vary widely.
Although there are international certificates of seamanship, the fact that
they are awarded locally makes it hard to enforce uniform standards.
If the investigation now underway concludes that the Braer disaster was due
to more than bad luck, neither the distressed state of the industry nor its
improving record will check public pressure for better controls. Several
potential areas for action are being debated.
Given the central role played by human error in accidents, maritime unions
and shipping representatives demand an improvement in training standards.
Such standards are set by the International Maritime Organisation - the
United Nations body responsible for regulations on world shipping. But the
organisation accepts that its rules, last amended in 1978, are out of date.
The IMO is considering updating its training requirements. But this is a
lengthy process and could take several years. In the meantime, maritime
bodies such as the International Shipping Federation are involved in
regional efforts to improve standards, but there has been little
co-ordination.
However, the IMO has managed to reach a broad consensus on changes to tanker
design that will improve safety. Under rules recently passed, it requires
all new tankers to be built with double hulls - an extra protective casing
which can help to contain spills in an accident - or similar pollution
control measures.
Under the same new regulations, all tankers older than 25 years must be
refitted with additional pollution control measures after 1995.
All the proposals have shortcomings. Double hulls would prevent some
disasters, but would probably have been irrelevant in the Braer's case,
given the force of the waves throwing the boat onto the rocks. Double hulls
can also cause other safety problems, such as the build-up of dangerous
gases between the inner and outer hull, which could result in an explosion.
Worry and frustration about low international standards has led some
countries to consider their own regulations, raising fears on the part of
tanker owners that a patchwork of different national standards will emerge.
The US is the only country to have passed its own rules, which are tougher
than the IMO's standards. These were devised in response to the Exxon Valdez
oil disaster in 1989.
They stipulate that after the next 15 years all ships calling at US ports
must have double hulls. The US has also introduced unlimited liability on
tanker owners for the entire costs of cleaning up an oil spill and for
compensating people whose livelihoods are affected by a spill.
Yesterday, European politicians took a step closer to the American model by
urging the EC to restrict dangerous cargoes passing through its waters and
to adopt improved standards for shipbuilding.
Even before the Shetland wreck, the UK had banned loaded tankers through the
Minches - the channel separating the Hebrides from the Scottish mainland -
for environmental and safety reasons. Present IMO guidelines also advise
tankers to keep 10 miles away from the Shetland coast. Environmentalists and
opposition MPS would like the UK to put pressure on the EC to ban ships in
the region.
Route restriction would go some way towards appeasing the environmentalists,
and might be enforceable even on a financially precarious oil industry. But
the past decade's international experience of trying to tighten regulation
and encourage the oil industry to take more care shows that there are no
easy solutions.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Nature to the rescue: The resilience of the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television pictures of dying birds covered in thick black oil, heads lolling
out of the gloved hands of rescue workers, are always shocking. But
according to studies of previous oil spills, predictions of permanent
environmental damage may be unfounded.
The short-term risk posed to wildlife from the wrecked Braer is nevertheless
considerable. The southern cliffs of the Shetland islands are some of the
UK's richest breeding grounds for birds, including puffins, guillemots,
kittiwakes, and eider. As many as 10,000 could eventually die from the oil
spillage according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The
Shetland waters also support seals, whales and about 800 sea otters, one of
the largest populations of these mammals in the UK.
Environmentalists fear that casualties will increase over the next two
months as migratory birds arrive to nest on Shetland - black guillemots are
flying in already. There is little hope that they will detect the oil and
move elsewhere. According to Dr Jeremy Leggett, scientific director of
Greenpeace, the campaign group: 'They're a bit stupid, they persist with
business as usual, poor things.'
The main effect of the oil is simply to smother wildlife, or to overwhelm
digestive systems. Dr Paul Johnston, toxicologist at Exeter University,
says: 'There are mechanisms in most animals for detoxifying themselves from
hydrocarbons (the main type of chemical in oil), but not in those
quantities.'
However, some of the most poisonous hydrocarbons, such as benzene, evaporate
rapidly, while many of the rest break down naturally into carbon dioxide and
water. Many scientists stress that oil kills a lot of wildlife immediately,
but is less ecologically damaging in the long term than other less visible
pollutants such as pesticides. Those do not break down naturally, cannot be
metabolised or excreted by organisms, and so build up in the foodchain.
A series of reports on the recovery of the Prince William Sound in Alaska
after the 1989 Exxon Valdez wreck, paid for by Exxon but commissioned from a
team of internationally respected scientists, concluded that recovery was
'well under way' a year after the spillage, and that most visible oil had
gone. Seals and birds had returned, although in lower numbers, and seaweed
and barnacles had colonised the rocks.
According to the team: 'Experience has shown that exposed, rocky shores
usually recover in two to three years. Others show substantial recovery in
one to five years, with the exception of sheltered shores such as salt
marshes which may take 10 years or more.'
They point out, too, that species which have adapted to live in harsh
climates such as Alaska - or the Shetlands - are unusually resilient.
However, scientists acknowledge that the taste of oil may be detectable in
fish for many years, with possible serious consequences for the Shetlands'
salmon industry.
Experience has given grounds for optimism about long-term ecological
recovery, but it has not produced a consensus on how to treat oil slicks.
Environmentalists have attacked the decision to spray the Braer slick with
detergents, arguing that they make the oil sink to the seabed where its
effects are prolonged. Other methods such as hosing the beach destroy
plantlife and small shellfish.
In the case of the Alaskan spill, workers from Exxon and US environmental
groups spent much time sitting on the shingle scrubbing boulders and pebbles
individually. But according to Mr Peter Taylor of the Oil Pollution Research
Unit, a leading environmental consultancy, 'the amount of oil recovered (by
people's efforts) is relatively small compared to the oil spilled'. He adds;
'studies have shown that the best cleaner is nature itself'.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Man in the News: Driven to his destination - David Crossland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Crossland sold 1.7m holidays last year. When it came to going away
himself, however, the chairman and founder of Airtours persuaded his wife
not to take a summer break. Instead, he spent two weeks in front of a
computer screen, selling holidays.
In spite of owning 35 per cent of the UK's third-largest holiday tour
operator, now capitalised at about Pounds 250m, Crossland's appetite for
deal-making is undiminished. 'I really like parting people from their money.
It's an art form to give good service.'
This week, Crossland embarked upon his largest transaction. In a move that
could bring Airtours into a bruising price war with Thomson, the dominant
holiday company in the UK for more than a decade, he launched a Pounds 215m
bid for Owners Abroad, number two in the UK market.
If successful, the bid will put him in charge of a Pounds 500m holiday
empire that is run from a converted Lancashire mill known as the Tardis
surrounded by a field of sheep.
A quiet and - for the travel business - uncharacteristically retiring boss,
Crossland, a 46-year-old native of Burnley, appears the antithesis of more
colourful characters such as Harry Goodman of ILG, and Sir Freddie Laker,
who have passed through the travel industry's revolving door.
'I'm a boring workaholic, so my wife says,' Crossland repeatedly jokes.
Though his house backs on to the fairway of a golf course, he says he does
not play. He likes music and tennis and relishes the time he spends with a
family. Nevertheless, he sees little of them because of his consuming
passion, the travel business.
Rising before dawn, he drives his red Jaguar XJ12 from Cheshire to the
office at Helmshore, in the Pennines, by 6 am. The review of the previous
day's work is complete by 8 am, and he says he is exhausted two hours before
he goes home at about 8 pm.
Asked why he is driven to work so hard, in spite of his now substantial
wealth, Crossland's explanation is compelling in its simplicity. 'I actually
enjoy it,' he says, almost apologetically. 'Every day I get up, it's as good
as the second day at the travel agency - the first day I was frightened.'
That first day, 30 years ago, followed a less than easy childhood. His
father was a wholesale fruit and vegetable trader but also played football
for Burnley, and worked in the evenings as a toast-master and club singer.
The family took one-week holidays in traditional working-class resorts like
Skegness. 'We were not a very well-off family but we were all very well
looked after.'
But it was only after he 'struggled' to pass three 'O' levels and was
prevented from following his mother into hospital administration that he
went to work in the travel agency.
Crossland talks about his school days with the candour of a man who has
proved he can be successful without conventional qualifications. 'Maybe I
was not capable of taking in things very fast,' he says. 'I changed the day
I walked into a travel agency - it was like someone turned the key. It was
this amazing place with unbelievably cheap prices.'
Nine years later, aged 25, a client asked if Crossland would buy his two
holiday businesses. 'I cannot to this day say why I did not say I had no
money.' But most of money he borrowed - amounting to some Pounds 8m - was
paid back in nine months. From 1972 to 1980 most of the profits were
ploughed back into buying more travel agencies.
From this base in the Manchester area, Crossland cut his teeth as a tour
operator, developing an instinct for destinations that would sell. 'We had
begun to buy blocks of tours from (the tour company) Intasun,' he says. 'We
bought whatever we could see there was a demand for over the counter; you
can tell on the first day a brochure comes out.'
Crossland then took one of the key decisions that led to a change in
Airtours' fortunes. 'I could see retail margins were going to get quite
fine,' he says. He also spotted a lack of flexibility in the market.
Existing tour operators would, for example, insist that if you wanted Malta,
you flew on a Wednesday - most working people in the Manchester area could
only fly at weekends.
He began direct buying of aircraft seats and accommodation in resorts,
selling the packages through his Manchester-based travel agencies. In 1980,
his first year, he sold 900 packages; the second 23,000, and by 1985,
250,000.
Crossland jokes this was, in fact, a bigger transformation than Airtours
will undergo if it is successful in taking over Owners Abroad's 2m holiday
packages. 'There was no management in Airtours. I wrote the brochures, did
all the hotel buying, costed it, priced it and sold it over the counter.'
Only after 1985 did Crossland begin to bring in the managers and accountants
who provided the professional support that helped him to float Airtours in
1987, just before the stock market crash.
For three years the shares fluctuated between 24p and 42p. But in 1991,
Airtours was the best-performing stock in London, rising to a peak of 334p
in 1992, confirming Crossland's super-rich status.
What Crossland is attempting now, however, is in a different league. Almost
overnight he plans to double Airtours' size through an acquisition after
years of organic growth. And Thomson, which has not faced a similar sized
competitor in 20 years, is unlikely to watch placidly as its dominance is
challenged.
While Crossland's knowledge of the business and tight control of Airtours is
grudgingly acknowledged in the industry, there are competitors who think he
may be moving too fast. 'He has grow up in the business and is a loner,'
says one rival. 'But he has changed and is beginning to believe his own
propaganda. I believe in walking; he is running and he might trip up.'
Crossland disagrees and is at pains to dispel the idea that he is throwing a
gauntlet at Thomson's feet. His advisers maintain that a man who would
retain a 17 per cent stake in Airtours after a merger is likely to have
calculated the risks of a price war. Crossland says he is simply working for
shareholders and trying 'to turn the holiday business into a credible
business', trying to win respectability for an industry that is only 30
years old.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Choices at Chevening
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUESTION that Mr Norman Lamont, the host of this weekend's Treasury
house party at Chevening, should be asked is not whether he should have
stayed on after the exchange rate mechanism debacle, but whether he should
have wanted to do so. The charades may be fun. Discussions of the UK's
fiscal prospects will not be, unless they too are turned into a charade.
British economic policy is on an unsustainable course. What is not
sustainable will not endure, as was demonstrated so dramatically on
September 16 1992. The question therefore is not what the government says.
Governments say many things, most of them beside the point. What matters is
what the government will choose to do.
In 1993-94 the public sector borrowing requirement is forecast by the
Treasury to be 7 per cent of gross domestic product. Without privatisation
receipts it will be close to 8 1/2 per cent of GDP. This is fiscal policy
Italian-style. Even if the Treasury were to prove right in its working
assumption of economic growth between 1993-94 and 1995-96 of 3 1/2 -4 per
cent a year, the PSBR is likely to remain over 6 per cent of GDP in the
latter year.
This uncomfortable fiscal outcome rests on the assumption that every throw
of the policy dice will turn up a six. The UK has had several chancellors
who acted upon that assumption. They have all lost their gambles.
The traditional British cure for an economic depression is increased
consumer spending. This is precisely what the prime minister has suggested
with his misleading references to the recovery of the 1980s. But for the
personal sector to shrug off its debt-induced woes and go out and spend once
more would prove a cure as bad as the current disease.
On plausible assumptions, a recovery in demand sufficient to lower the PSBR
substantially would also increase the current account deficit, from 2 1/2
per cent of GDP this year to perhaps twice that level two to three years
from now. Yet if the economy were to grow at, say, 1 per cent this year and
2 per cent a year thereafter, so limiting the rise in the current account
deficit, the PSBR could be 10 per cent of GDP by 1995-96.
Lower output
The cause of the government's predicament is clear. According to the 1990
autumn statement, total general government spending should have risen only 6
1/2 per cent between 1990-91 and 1993-94 in real terms. Now the Treasury
says it will rise 12 1/2 per cent. The 1990 Financial Statement and Budget
Report forecast that in 1993-94 real GDP would be 9 per cent bigger than in
1990-91. In fact, it may be 2 per cent smaller. Higher spending is one blade
of the scissor; lower economic output is the other; what has been cut up is
the government's reputation for fiscal prudence.
Export-led growth is the solution. But that would mean a further
depreciation, probably brought about by lower interest rates. Such a
depreciation would threaten achievement of the chancellor's target of 1-4
per cent annual inflation.
Fiscal tightening
Looser monetary policy would have to be offset by fiscal tightening. Such a
tightening should be designed to deliver a sustainable fiscal position in
the medium term. On plausible assumptions, the structural fiscal deficit may
be as much as 6 per cent of GDP. Reducing that to sustainable levels could
take an adjustment of perhaps 4 per cent of GDP, or about Pounds 25bn. If
all went well, maybe half of this could come from a decline in the share of
public spending in GDP as the economy recovers. Even so, taxation would have
to rise by the equivalent of 6p on the basic rate of tax.
The likely fate of the chancellor, or his successors, is to preside over an
economy that does not grow fast enough to prevent further increases in
unemployment. It is to watch the one achievement, that of low inflation,
endangered by a probably inescapable depreciation of the real exchange rate.
It is to impose the tightest possible constraints on those parts of public
spending that are not purely cyclical. Last and worst of all, it is to raise
taxes.
Yet if this is, indeed, to be the chancellor's fate, it need not be now.
Given the strong inherited fiscal position and the uncertainty about the
pace of the recovery, it would make sense for the chancellor to duck the
March Budget altogether, leaving any significant changes to the first
integrated budget, due in the autumn.
If there is to be a budget, however, it would be absurd to fiddle with
trivial fiscal changes, such as offsetting the money lost when car tax was
abolished. It would be better to do something dramatic, such as coupling the
abolition of mortgage interest relief (worth maybe Pounds 5bn) with lower
interest rates or abolishing the upper earnings limit on national insurance,
thereby eliminating two large anomalies in the current fiscal structure.
A chancellor who has remained in office after the recent disasters certainly
wants the job. But if he wishes to go on enjoying it a while longer, he
might do best to have fun this weekend and postpone both the serious
discussions and the budget until next autumn.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Honda's Indy will be used in UK built cars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Indy Honda: Honda's announcement in Detroit this week that it is to develop
and supply engines for Indy cars, North America's equivalent of grand prix,
means that they will almost certainly be used in cars built in the UK.
Honda's grand prix successes - it withdrew a few weeks ago having lost this
year's championship to Williams-Renault - were won in conjunction with
McLaren, another leading UK constructor.
All but one of the 33 cars on the starting grid of the Indianapolis 500 last
year were built in the UK, by a specialist motor sport industry which is
widely acknowledged to lead the world. Huntingdon-based Lola Cars produced
27 of the cars, while Penske of Dorset and Galmer of Oxfordshire were the
other manufacturers.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Court guidance sought on BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUCHE ROSS, the liquidator of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, is seeking directions from the High Court on whether it
should hold a meeting of creditors to elect a liquidation committee as
provided for in the 1986 Insolvency Act.
A hearing has been fixed for Tuesday to consider an application in respect
of BCCI SA, one of the two main banking arms of BCCI. It was not clear last
night what had prompted the approach to the court. The Insolvency Act of
1986 allows a liquidator to summon meetings of creditors at any time to
decide whether a committee should be established.
It appears, however, that the liquidator wants a court to set the parameters
of any meeting. In the Court of Appeal last October Lord Justice Dillon said
it was 'wholly impracticable' to hold a creditors' meeting of BCCI SA, which
includes the UK arm of the bank.
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, said: 'We have been campaigning
for 16 months for a general meeting of creditors. The liquidators have told
the court, the DTI and creditors that such a meeting was impractical. This
decision represents a considerable U-turn but we welcome it.
'It is time a properly elected creditors' committee took this liquidation by
the scruff of its neck and asked crucial questions about the recovery of
assets and the cost of liquidation.'
The timing of the move suggests it may have been the result of a rethink
following the appeal filed by three individual creditors against the
Luxembourg court approval of the Pounds 1.7bn compensation package agreed
between the liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders.
When Touche Ross took a sounding of BCCI creditors last year, 94 per cent of
those that replied were in favour of the agreement. A meeting of creditors
that reflected those findings might be expected to elect a liquidation
committee that was favourable to the deal. The present UK creditors'
committee consists of some members opposed to the deal.
Mr Vaz is suggesting the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham or the
Wembley conference centre in London as possible venues for a meeting which
several thousand creditors might be expected to attend. Touche Ross could
not be contacted last night.

A SELF-HELP campaign to double the northern region's manufacturing base and
to treble its export performance within 10 years was launched yesterday
The 'manufacturing challenge' was welcomed and strongly endorsed by many of
the region's business leaders at a packed breakfast-time meeting in
Newcastle upon Tyne.
The campaign is the brainchild of Northern Businessman of the Year Mr Karl
Watkin, chairman of Gateshead-based Crabtree Holdings. The company is the
UK's leading manufacturer of metal-printing machinery, and exports virtually
all its output.
The challenge is supported by union leaders and the Northern Development
Company, the regeneration body for north-east England and Cumbria.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Grade names new director of programmes at Channel 4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, demonstrated some of his
legendary chutzpah yesterday when he named the successor to Ms Liz Forgan,
director of programmes, before her departure was formally announced.
The BBC will announce on Monday that Ms Forgan - who was hired by Channel
4's founding chief executive Mr Jeremy Isaacs when she went to interview him
for The Guardian newspaper - will be moving to the corporation. It is
believed her new job will be to run BBC Television, but not as deputy
director-general.
Mr Grade, a former managing director-designate of BBC Television, decided to
make his move in advance of the BBC's announcement by naming Mr John Willis,
Ms Forgan's deputy, as her successor.
Channel 4 issued a statement yesterday: 'Commenting on Liz Forgan's
departure, Michael Grade said: 'We are all very sad to say farewell to
Liz',' it said.
Channel 4 also paid tribute to her commissioning of Channel 4 News; the
creation of Right to Reply, the programme for viewers to comment on
programmes; and for originating the Video Box, which allows people to walk
in off the street and record their views for the programme. However, it did
not say where she was going.
The announcement of Ms Forgan's appointment to the BBC will be accompanied
by the first public indications of Mr John Birt's philosophy since he took
over formally as director-general of the BBC on Monday.
All the signs are that Mr Birt will be looking for a powerful deputy to
handle a fundamental reorganisation of the corporation.
The BBC has been embarrassed by an overspend in its television budget which
totalled Pounds 38m in the 1991-92 financial year. It is facing a potential
overspend this year of at least Pounds 20m.
The BBC refuses to put a final figure on the overspend but some in the
organisation believe the total could be about Pounds 90m over the two-year
period.
An obvious candidate to be Mr Birt's deputy would be Mr Bob Phillis, chief
executive of Independent Television News and former managing director of
Central Independent Television.
Mr Phillis is credited with improving financial disciplines at ITN where
there were embarrassing, but smaller, overspends. ITN is in the middle of a
shake-up of its ownership - some conditions of a transfer of its ownership
from the original 15 ITV companies to a seven-company consortium led by
Carlton Communications have been met, but the deal has not yet been
completed.
There has also been unconfirmed speculation that Mr David Hatch, managing
director of BBC Radio, may soon decide to leave.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Gas power plants 'may be barred'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT power generators fear the government will try to widen the
market for coal by blocking plans to proceed with gas-fired power station
projects as part of its energy review.
Mr David Lewis, vice-president of business operations at Enron Europe, the
UK arm of the US utility company, said: 'We were given some assurances . . .
that the government would leave gas alone, but what we're now hearing
suggests it could take some radical steps with gas.'
Mr Lewis is concerned that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, will block power stations that have not yet received government
approval. He also fears the government might call a halt to stations that
have been approved but where construction has not yet begun.
This could affect about six planned gas-fired power stations, including one
at Connah's Quay, Clywd.
The Department of Trade and Industry said: 'Technically it is possible to
reverse consents given to power projects but it would be very difficult.'
Mr Tony Craven-Walker, chief executive of Monument Oil and Gas, a partner in
the project to supply the Connah's Quay station, said: 'We've already spent
about Pounds 75m to Pounds 100m on the project, but because of the
uncertainty surrounding Connah's Quay we're looking at cancelling orders
we've placed.'
Hamilton Oil and Gas, the US company involved in Connah's Quay, has laid off
about 400 people among its contracting teams because of doubt over whether
the scheme will be approved.
Mr Lewis said: 'It will be a serious blow to the independent power sector if
the government blocks these gas stations. We don't invest in other parts of
the world because this sort of thing happens and we'd have to ask questions
about future investment in the UK.'
Enron's 1,875MW gas-fired station on Teesside will be the second independent
generating project to become operational when it starts production in April.
The company is also involved in negotiations about becoming a partner in at
least three other gas-fired stations.
However, Mr Lewis said there is a stand-off between developers in the power
projects and power customers as they await the outcome of the energy review.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Disclosure of share options urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES should be required to disclose their directors' share options,
three academics said yesterday.
Mr Don Egginton, Mr John Forker and Mr Paul Grout of the University of
Bristol told a conference on corporate governance at Nottingham University
that disclosure would be inexpensive and could probably be introduced simply
through an accounting standard.
Annual reports could show in a simple table the rights of executives to
acquire shares, and the options granted, exercised and lapsed during the
year. The academics said existing disclosure requirements were complex,
erratic, incomplete and met with imperfect compliance by companies.
They added that options that could be satisfied with existing shares offered
the greatest tax concessions and yet had the least demanding disclosure
requirements.
They found that options to subscribe for shares were most commonly used by
British companies.
Their conclusions came shortly after the US Securities and Exchange
Commission issued tough new disclosure guidelines on stock options for
company executives.
The profit-and-loss account should also be debited to show the cost of the
options, with a corresponding adjustment in reserves on the balance sheet,
they recommended.
Large quoted UK companies in which the directors own a small proportion of
the shares are more likely to create audit committees voluntarily, the
conference heard.
In an analysis of 142 companies, Mr Paul Collier of Exeter University found
clearly differing characteristics between companies with and without
voluntarily formed audit committees. Companies with committees tended to
have a higher level of gearing, more non-executive directors and an internal
audit department.
He concluded that as a result businesses with low gearing and high levels of
share ownership by directors would disproportionately face the costs of
introducing audit committees.
Extending auditors' liability to parties other than their clients would not
improve the quality of auditing, Mr Noel O'Sullivan told the conference.
Auditors would adopt risk-avoidance strategies rather than making their
audits more extensive, said Mr O'Sullivan, an Association of British
Insurers' research fellow. They would be likely to avoid clients in
high-risk industries, he added.
His analysis goes against critics who have called for a re-examination of
the Caparo judgment in the Lords which restricted an auditor's duty of care
to the existing shareholders of a company collectively.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Health chairman resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JAMES Ackers has resigned as chairman of West Midlands regional health
authority, which has been the subject of criticism for inadequate financial
controls.
A National Audit Office report in October found that a consultancy exercise
intended to generate Pounds 50m savings had cost the authority some Pounds
4m.
Expenditure on the consultant's expenses, said the report, included leased
houses in London for executives and their wives, chartered aircraft and
lavish entertainment.
West Midlands regional health authority, the report added, had sometimes
paid invoices without seeing supporting bills.
After compilation of the NAO report Sir Roy Griffiths, deputy chairman of
the National Health Service policy board, was sent to the West Midlands to
strengthen management controls.
Sir James, 57, had been chairman of England's biggest regional health
authority since 1982 and received Pounds 20,925 a year for the part-time
role. He said in his resignation letter to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary: 'Now that the task of rectifying matters is almost complete, I am
quite certain that it is in the interests of the regional health authority
to have a clean sheet and a fresh start.'
Mrs Bottomley responded by speaking of Sir James's valuable contribution and
many improvements in the West Midlands.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, called on Mrs Bottomley to make
a full statement when the Commons returns next week.
Sir James will be replaced temporarily by Sir Donald Wilson, chairman of
Mersey regional health authority.

The 'manufacturing challenge' was welcomed and strongly endorsed by many of

Newcastle upon Tyne.
The campaign is the brainchild of Northern Businessman of the Year Mr Karl

The challenge is supported by union leaders and the Northern Development

hosting three brainstorming sessions during the next few weeks to determine
how the campaign will achieve its aims.
The region was one of the world's pre-eminent manufacturing centres in the
Victorian and Edwardian eras, with a reputation for inventiveness and

Today it exports 44.9 per cent of its manufacturing output, the highest

FT  09 JAN 93 / Chairman of health region resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JAMES ACKERS has resigned as chairman of West Midlands Regional Health
Authority, which has been the subject of criticism for inadequate financial
controls.
A National Audit Office report in October found that a consultancy exercise
intended to generate Pounds 50m of savings had cost the authority some
Pounds 4m.
After the report was compiled Sir Roy Griffiths, deputy chairman of the
National Health Service policy board, was sent to the West Midlands
authority to strengthen management controls.
Sir James, 57, had been chairman of the authority - England's biggest -
since 1982 and received Pounds 20,925 a year for the part-time role.
He said in his resignation letter to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary: 'Now that the task of rectifying matters is almost complete, I am
quite certain that it is in the interests of the regional health authority
to have a clean sheet and a fresh start.'

FT  09 JAN 93 / Art dealer goes into receivership
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUETTS, one of the leading British dealers in oriental art, has gone into
receivership. The private company was refinanced a year ago, with Chelsfield
Group underwriting a management buyout by directors Mr Anthony Carter and Mr
Dominic Jellinek.
A move to premises in Brook Street in London's Mayfair followed, but
business has not improved and Chelsfield is withdrawing its support.
The stock will be auctioned by Sotheby's and the directors will probably
continue as private dealers.
Although oriental art has not suffered as badly as post-1870 pictures in the
recession, the main buyers are now in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, and
the centre of the market has moved to the Far East.

MR Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
yesterday urged teachers, unions and the government to 'retreat from the
barricades' and bring peace to education.
He told the North of England Education Conference in Blackpool that a recent
report ranked Britain 20th out of 22 developed countries - ahead only of
Greece and Turkey - on the quality of its people's skills.
Mr Davies said: 'What is now required above all else is for peace to break
out within the education system, and for a general retreat from the
barricades in the interests of the children within the system and our future
prosperity as a nation.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING on credit and debit cards reached an unexpectedly high Pounds 2bn
over Christmas.
Mr John Eaton, managing director of Barclays Merchant Services, which has 45
per cent of the plastic card processing market, said that, although some of
the increased use of cards was due to a bigger market share, the figures
still indicated higher-than-expected spending.
The largest rise in spending was on computers and games which increased by
67 per cent. The use of direct debit cards increased by 54 per cent to
Pounds 550m but much of that was due to the move away from writing cheques.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Major sets sights on new political agenda: A look at the
formidable tasks facing the policymakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN government, momentum is vital. But it is worthless without a clear sense
of direction. The turmoil of the past few months has deprived Mr John
Major's government of both.
So when the prime minister sits down with policy advisers at his Chequers
country mansion tomorrow for a two-day seminar to relaunch his domestic
political agenda, he will face two formidable tasks.
The first is to define with greater clarity the destination to which he
intends to take the country over the next four years. The second is to
regain the momentum needed to go in that direction. It will not be easy.
His advisers from the Downing Street policy unit will arrive at Chequers
with a bagful of ideas. Some of the ideas represent developments of existing
policies - designed, for example, to give added impetus to the education and
health reforms and to the establishment of higher public service standards
under the Citizen's Charter.
Others ideas are fresher. Ministers are promising to shrink the public
sector to its core functions through a mixture of privatisation and
commercialisation of much of central and local government.
The move to allow private-sector participation in large-scale capital
projects is seen by some as the thin end of a wedge allowing the state
eventually to withdraw from many infrastructure schemes.
The prospect that unemployment will soon reach 3m has given urgency to plans
to dovetail an expansion of further education with enhanced training
opportunities and vocational qualifications for those aged 16 to 19. There
are proposals also for a temporary work scheme for the long-term unemployed,
combined perhaps with a step in the direction of 'workfare'.
Housing remains a central if sometimes muddled preoccupation. There are
powerful advocates within Whitehall of new incentives - fiscal or otherwise
 -to expand the rented housing sector. Others want a more rapid extension of
home-ownership into inner-city council estates.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, plans to combine a shake-up of the
police with tougher legislation to cope with the juvenile crime epidemic.
Other issues impose themselves on the domestic agenda. The coal industry
review is forcing the government to confront the distortions in the energy
market. The Tomlinson report demands a policy to recast the National Health
Service in London, and the British Rail privatisation bill will herald an
intense debate about the future of public transport.
The many initiatives promised by the policy unit and by individual
departments have yet to be welded into a coherent strategy, and senior
ministers acknowledge that the prime minister needs to be much more certain
about his strategic ambitions.
During the mid 1980s - the period that Mr Major regards as the heyday of the
enterprise culture - the government was anchored by ideological certainties.
Individual policies were often inconsistent with the ideology. But the
long-term objectives of Baroness Thatcher as prime minister and Lord Lawson
as chancellor - above all those of establishing the primacy of the market
and of shrinking the state - were sufficiently firmly rooted for the
occasional deviation to be overlooked.
Mr Major has set out his guiding themes: a market-driven economy alongside
social policies designed to extend choice, ownership and opportunity. Low
taxation and low inflation are taken as a sine qua non.
Those objectives are familiar to any right-of-centre Conservative
government. What is missing is a distinctive and robust enough framework to
illuminate the government's destination. Many in his own party remain unsure
of the extent to which Mr Major will opt for the status quo rather than the
risks of change.
In part, the confusion is the result of the economic upheavals of the past
two years. It is hard to re-establish tax cuts or sound public finances as
lodestars when the recession has led to an explosion of public borrowing.
The debacle surrounding sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism has
left an important questionmark over the strength of the commitment to
permanently low inflation. Ministers are conscious that the government lacks
a coherent framework against which its economic strategy can be judged. Even
those ministers implacably opposed to any return to the ERM agree that ad
hoc monitoring of a handful of monetary indicators is no real substitute.
There are other areas of confusion. The policy unit will this weekend be
tabling proposals to give substance to the prime minister's promise of a new
burst of deregulation to lift the burdens on business.
But the Thatcherite rhetoric behind that pledge sits uneasily with Mr
Major's new commitment to government help for manufacturing companies. The
prime minister has been talking of a Budget for industry in March, but
nobody is quite sure what that means.
There is a growing realisation among ministers that the dozens of individual
ideas being canvassed by Downing Street are a poor substitute for a handful
of bold, radical projects to map out the government's direction.
If Mr Major is to cut direct taxes during this parliament he will have to
make a start on radical reform of the tax privileges offered on pension
provisions and home ownership. He may also be obliged to change a political
climate which has so far ensured that the government cannot escape its
responsibility for a universal state pension or for unemployment and other
social benefits.
There are one or two straws in the wind. The size of the borrowing
requirement has reopened debate about the logic and sustainability of
mortgage-interest tax relief. The more radical members of the cabinet are
floating the possibility of private insurance schemes to reduce gradually
the state's responsibility for unemployment benefit.
If he is to define his premiership, Mr Major needs to demonstrate that he
can be bold as well as careful. An unspectacular economic recovery will not
be enough.

FT  09 JAN 93 / TGWU gives backing to electoral reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of Labour endorsing some version of proportional representation
came closer yesterday when the biggest union affiliated to the party gave
strong backing to electoral reform.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said the party
could no longer support a status quo which continued to return governments
backed by only a minority of the popular vote.
'The electoral options should be actively examined,' he said. 'I would not
be averse to seeing some sort of new arrangement, but exactly which system I
do not know.' Mr Morris stressed that this was the consensus of an internal
union debate on the subject.
'The great weight of opinion has shifted in favour of some sort of change',
he said. The union's change of position may have a significant influence on
the final outcome of Labour's commission on electoral reform under Lord
Plant.
A two-day meeting to discuss systems for the Commons ended inconclusively
yesterday with the committee reporting that it was examining three systems.
One is the existing first-past-the-post system; a second is the alternative
vote system in which voters number candidates in order of preference, and if
no candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the votes then the votes for the
candidate at the bottom of the poll are reallocated among all the other
candidates until somebody acquires more than 50 per cent.
But the system thought most likely to be adopted if first-past-the-post is
rejected is a version of the alternative member system in which 150 Commons
seats would be reserved for 'best losers' and allocated by means of an
equation intended to reflect the performance of parties on a proportional
basis. A final report to the national executive committee is due to be
submitted in April.
Support for proportional representation from the left-of-centre TGWU has
taken some observers by surprise as the union continues to be associated
with conservative positions on many other issues, such as links with the
unions.
The union seems more disillusioned than many others with the Labour party.
It is to scale down its affiliation with the party, reflecting both its
falling membership and a change in its political priorities, although it
will still wield 10 per cent of the vote at this year's party conference.
Of the other large unions the GMB general union continues to support a
first-past-the-post system while the AEEU engineering and electricians'
union has long been a supporter of electoral reform.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Staff vote to fight market testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST serious union resistance to the government's plans to contract out
Civil Service jobs to the private sector has come from the traditionally
moderate Inland Revenue Staff Federation.
IRSF members have voted by six to one to take industrial action against the
market testing of secretarial work in the Inland Revenue. Nearly three
quarters of the union's 56,000 members - an unusually high proportion -
voted in the ballot.
Mr Clive Brooke, the IRSF general secretary, insisted last night that the
union was not trying to halt market testing - a preparatory stage to the
putting of government functions out to tender - but merely to set conditions
on the way it was organised.
One union condition is that there should be no extension of such testing
until the results of four prototype schemes are known. They have involved
200 secretarial staff at four sites. A second round of market testing
involving about 4,000 secretarial staff is being prepared.
The second condition is that there should be no deterioration in the pay and
conditions of staff transferred to the private sector. The union argues that
such protection is, in any case, required by the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) regulations of 1981, based on a European
Community directive.
Apart from some industrial action at the Scottish Office the Civil Service
unions have, until now, been uncertain how to respond to contracting-out,
with most emphasis being placed on the transfer of undertakings legislation.
The IRSF vote may encourage activists to believe that industrial as well as
legal action can be used against the government.
However, the question that IRSF members voted on was carefully worded and
specifically emphasised industrial action short of a strike. The question
did call on members 'not to co-operate with any further market testing'
until the outcome of the four prototype schemes was known and assessed.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Barclays introduces extra loan charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS is introducing controversial new charges for thousands of
customers, including small businesses, who have pledged shares as security
against loans.
The annual charges, which can run to hundreds of pounds on comparatively
small loans, will probably provoke an outcry from the small business lobby,
which has complained that UK banks have been treating small companies
insensitively during the recession.
The new charges are in part a response to Taurus, the Stock Exchange's
proposed computerised system for registration of shares and settlement of
share transactions. Small shareholders have been concerned that they will be
penalised under the new system, scheduled to be introduced in the autumn.
The other reason for the charges is a policy change by the bank on the way
it holds collateral.
Traditionally Barclays has taken an equitable charge over shares pledged by
a customer as security for a loan. This means the customer's share
certificates are held at a bank branch and that he or she has filled out a
form allowing the bank to take possession of the shares should the customer
fail to keep up loan payments.
A Barclays' executive said there 'was an unacceptable level of fraud risk'
in having the shares pledged in this way.
Another manager explained the bank had lost money in the past after
discovering it was holding forged certificates. On other occasions it
suffered because some customers held duplicate certificates elsewhere and
had been able to sell pledged shares without the bank knowing.
The bank has decided to take a legal charge over pledged shares. As a
result, customers are being forced to transfer their pledged shares to
Barclays' own nominee company.
Even though the bank is taking the step to protect itself, it wants
customers to pay Pounds 20 per shareholding to cover the costs of the
transfer and a further annual charge of Pounds 20, which it says will help
cover Taurus costs.
There will be further charges if the customer decides to change the
composition of shares held as security.
Thus a customer who provided 20 shareholdings as security against a loan
would face annual charges of at least Pounds 400, when previously they paid
no fee.
The bank said yesterday that anyone whose current loan is less than Pounds
15,000 would not be charged, because of complications in changing the
borrowing agreement. However, anyone borrowing more and all new customers
would face the charges.
Mr Roger Peters, a Barclays customer who is managing director of Posh Pets,
a North London petshop, has been told he faces a transfer charge of Pounds
620 and an annual charge of the same amount.
He said: 'If a Barclays executive came and bought a packet of Shirleys
diarrhoea tablets from me and I doubled the cost, he would soon be jumping
up and down.'

FT  09 JAN 93 / Pickets hold line in TSB dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG BEFORE dawn yesterday Mr David Carter slipped out of his Middlesbrough
terraced home and drove north in his K-registered Cavalier to TSB's large
Tyneside branch beside Newcastle upon Tyne's Haymarket bus station.
For Mr Carter, a former Inland Revenue executive officer, yesterday's strike
was the biggest organisational challenge in the six years since he became
the Bifu banking union's organiser in north-east England, a TSB stronghold.
Haymarket was a symbolic battleground. TSB chose this large branch as its
flagship for an experiment - to be piloted on Tyneside but with far-reaching
implications within TSB - in increased automation and 24-hour telephone
banking.
Before daybreak the pickets were in place. Mr Carter, having aroused the
regional media with a faxed press release about 'the bank that likes to say,
you're sacked', was briefing reporters using his new mobile telephone.
At 8.15am TSB managers filed into the offices upstairs. The pickets handed
out leaflets to members of the public eyeing the cash dispensers. The
branch, to Mr Carter's delight, remained closed.
He estimated that about 75 per cent of the 100-plus TSB branches between
Berwick and Scarborough were shut yesterday. TSB disputed this figure,
saying 30 per cent of branches in northern Britain closed, but confirmed
there were strong pockets of action.
Local TSB management said half the 60 branches between Tweed and Tees were
shut.
The other central Newcastle branch stayed open but, Mr Carter claimed,
security men delivering money and postmen refused to cross the picket line.
Nor, he said, would British Telecommunications staff cross the line at TSB's
Gateshead Teleservice centre.
After taking six of the most frozen pickets to thaw out over bacon
sandwiches, he drove to Sunderland, where only one branch out of eight
opened. Then it was down to East Durham's coastal coalfield areas where bank
staff had organised detailed picketing rotas.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Unions may lose more members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS are likely to lose a further 8 per cent of their members this year,
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said yesterday.
In 1991 unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress lost only about 5 per
cent of their members and last year's figure is expected to be only slightly
higher.
However, a disproportionate number of the big job losses announced over the
past few weeks have come from large unionised companies. There will also be
greater pressure on jobs in the public sector with this year expected to be
the toughest for them since the recession began. The membership of TUC
unions will probably fall below 7m.
The TGWU expects to lose about 8 per cent of its members - a slightly better
record than in the past two years - and total membership will probably fall
to just under 1m. The union has been hit by some examples of derecognition
in the past year, but most of the membership loss has come through
redundancies.
Mr Morris said the financial and organisational state of the union had
improved substantially since he took office nine months ago and would
continue to do so this year.
For the past year the TGWU is expected to report a surplus of nearly Pounds
5m compared with a deficit of Pounds 12m in 1991. That was achieved through
cost-cutting and increasing subscriptions. Mr Morris stressed that internal
reorganisation would continue this year.
He said that the union had 'moved beyond factionalism and is now driven by a
unity of purpose that has not been seen for a very long time'. He even
predicted some areas of membership growth this year, particularly in civil
air transport and among women.
Union mergers could also boost the union and yesterday Mr Morris met leaders
of FTAT, the 34,000-strong furniture union, to discuss possible terms for a
merger.
He called the planned change to the law which would require more regular
approval of the automatic check-off of union subscriptions by employers 'a
vindictive act by small-minded people'. But he added that it could have the
benefit of forcing activists to collect union dues personally thus helping
to put them back in touch with the members.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Indicators point to hesitant recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE longer leading index of economic indicators, which highlights turning
points in the economic activity about 11 months in advance, rose from 105.9
in October to 107.6 in November. The Central Statistical Office said the
change resulted from lower interest rates and higher share prices after
sterling's devaluation.
The shorter leading index, indicating turning points about four months in
advance, rose from early last year but has flattened since July, reflecting
the results of the Confederation of British Industry survey of new orders
and expected changes in stocks.
The decline in the coincident index, which moves in line with the business
cycle, halted last spring and a rise since reflects some upturn in all
components of the index except gross domestic product.
The CSO said that although the coincident index has been rising, hesitation
in the longer and shorter leading indicators may suggest that its rise will
not be rapid in the short term.

AT LEAST 30 people were killed and 120 hurt in Bombay as the commercial
capital of India reeled under communal violence for a fourth consecutive
day, writes Shiraz Sidhva from New Delhi.
Mobs set ablaze a cluster of tenements in the north-western suburb of
Jogeshwari yesterday, burning alive at least 11 people, including three
women, after a tense night in which police opened fire in four areas to
disperse rioting mobs.
Police said at least eight people succumbed to stab wounds in hospital after
street clashes between Hindus and Moslems which began on Tuesday.
This week's tension is a fall-out from the communal violence that brought
Bombay to a halt for over a week in December with over 300 dead, after Hindu
militants destroyed an ancient mosque in Ayodhya on December 6.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Partial peace pact signed in Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ADDIS ABABA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOMALI warlords and faction leaders signed a partial peace agreement last
night which fell far short of offering lasting peace to the country.
Diplomats observing the signing of the hastily-drafted pact by all 15
warlords and faction leaders in Addis Ababa said the peace commitment of Gen
Mohamed Farrar Aideed, the dominant warlord, was still uncertain.
The signing occurred hours after one of the factions - the Somali Salvation
Democratic Front, which controls a large swathe of northeastern Somalia -
said it had fought off a heavy attack by Gen Aideed's gunmen yesterday
morning, and captured 10 tanks.
In the accord the 15 signatories agreed to hold a national reconciliation
conference in Addis Ababa on March 15, in the middle of the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan. The conference would aim to establish an interim assembly
and executive authority which could pave the way for reconstruction and
democratic elections.
The Somalis also agreed on an immediate and binding ceasefire and cessation
of hostile propaganda, and pledged to promote further dialogue and the free
movement of Somalis inside the country.
However, three critical issues were left to be decided by the factions over
the weekend. Failure to agree on the three remaining points - the procedure
for implementing a ceasefire and disarmament, the agenda and list of
participants for the conference - could yet scupper the tentative agreement
signed yesterday.
Observers said the breakthrough after five days of talks came suddenly, as
Gen Aideed, who had been blocking agreement, realised he was isolated both
among Somalis and internationally after a US attack in Mogadishu on Thursday
in which seven of his men died.
They said he suddenly demanded a March date during Ramadan, after having
consistently said the conference could not be convened before June.
Political analysts say the signatories have no real political legitimacy and
the power base of Gen Aideed and other warlords will quickly crumble as they
lose their monopoly over food aid and guns. Many Somalis say it is in the
warlords' interests to convene a national reconciliation conference quickly
to hold on to their rapidly evaporating authority.
US Marines in Mogadishu yesterday continued their policy of unofficial
disarmament, confiscating weapons at a gun market and handing out food to
other Somalis who turned in their rifles voluntarily.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US recovery is generating far fewer jobs than past upturns, adding to
the economic pressure on President-elect Bill Clinton, Labour Department
figures indicated yesterday.
The unemployment rate last month held steady at 7.3 per cent, half a point
higher than at the official end of the recession in March 1991, although
below the 7.7 per cent peak reached in June of last year. The failure of
unemployment to fall reflected unusually weak employment growth for this
stage of an economic recovery.
Non-farm employment rose 64,000 to 108.7m last month, less than most
analysts expected. Figures for November were also revised down to show an
increase of only 76,000, against an initial estimate of 105,000.
No job gains were registered in goods-producing industries last month.
Analysts were also disturbed by a decline in the length of the average
work-week last month.
During 1992 payroll employment rose by a total of 600,000, far less than in
past recoveries, when this many jobs were typically created in two months.
The unemployment rate averaged 7.4 per cent, the worst result for nearly a
decade.
The jobs figures contrast with other, more encouraging economic news.
Retailers this week reported a 7-10 per cent increase in sales last month
compared to December 1991.
High levels of unemployment, complicate the economic challenge facing Mr
Clinton, who met senior economic advisers in Little Rock on Thursday.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S inflation rate fell to 11.9 per cent last year, the lowest for 17
years, although still higher than the government's single-digit forecast.
The Mexican government has made the reduction of inflation the central plank
of macro-economic policy, and may be disappointed that the figure for
December was 4 per cent. It would have been worse had the government not
arrested in mid-December the leader of the 16,000 tortilla producers for
trying to raise prices of the maize-based staple food. The government
subsequently closed or fined 572 tortilla outlets.
The inflation rate implies the peso appreciated in real terms by about 6 per
cent last year, building on real appreciation in previous years. President
Carlos Salinas and US President-elect Bill Clinton were due to meet
yesterday in Austin, Texas. The two leaders expected to discuss the North
American Free Trade Agreement, and the details of Mr Clinton's proposed
parallel agreements on labour and the environment.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Japan freezes car export quota for US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government has decided not to alter the country's voluntary car
export quota for the US from last year's level of 1.65m units, claiming that
the freeze will 'assist the rehabilitation' of US car makers.
Japan had reduced the quota from 2.3m units in 1991, but the US car industry
demanded further cuts, arguing that the figure had become meaningless as it
did not take into account the US production capacity of Japanese makers.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, the minister of international trade and industry, said the
freeze would assist one struggling US car maker in particular.
Mr Mori did not name the company, but was apparently referring to General
Motors, the largest US maker.
Voluntary restraint began in 1981, under pressure from the US government,
when the quota was set at 1.68m units. It was lifted to 2.3m units from
1985, where it remained until the revision in March,last year.
Japan's quota announcement coincided with the release of a US Commerce
Department forecast that the US is likely to see a 9.5 per cent increase to
Dollars 21.9bn in the deficit this year in car and car parts trade with
Japan.
The Japanese government argues that US makers are likely to benefit from an
increase in consumer demand this year, and the restraint on exports will
limit the ability of Japanese to profit from the recovery.
'The US automobile industry now looks like it is recovering but there is
still uncertainty over its outlook,' Mr Mori said.
Meanwhile, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association said imported vehicle
sales fell 7.7 per cent last year to 184,615 units, the second consecutive
year of decline.
Total sales in the Japanese market fell 7.2 per cent to 5.3m units.
Sales of US-made cars rose 23.1 per cent, but the largest increase was in
imports of Japanese makers' vehicles.
Ford Motor sales rose 15 per cent and Chrysler reported sales 7.4 per cent
higher, though GM had a 1.9 per cent decline in sales.

High levels of unemployment, however, complicate the economic challenge

Thursday. They may increase the political pressure on him to try to
accelerate the recovery by announcing a short-term economic stimulus after
his inauguration this month.
However, the Bush administration's final budget, published this week,
revealed a substantial deterioration in the US fiscal outlook, with
prospective budget deficits much higher than Mr Clinton assumed during the
election campaign.
No decisions were made at the meeting, but aides acknowledged that Mr
Clinton might have to choose between campaign pledges which included halving
the Dollars 300bn (Pounds 197.3bn) budget deficit within four years, sharply
increasing federal investment spending, and cutting taxes on middle-income
families.

EXECUTIVES of the big three US car makers say President-elect Bill Clinton
has undertaken not to do anything to harm the domestic industry, writes our
Washington staff. They said that the assurance came during talks with Mr
Clinton and his economic advisers in Little Rock this week.
The talks seem to have centred on international trade and costs such as
health care which affect US competitiveness, with no decision taken on a
possible new tax on petrol.
Mr Clinton's aides said he had reaffirmed his commitment to higher fuel
efficiency standards. Detroit's recent conversion to support of a petrol tax
has been predicated on a relaxation by the incoming administration of these
standards.
Some senior members of the new government, such as Dr Alice Rivlin, deputy
budget director, have also recommended higher taxes on petrol, as has the
environmental lobby, of which Mr Al Gore, about to become vice president, is
a leading member.
But the coalition of interests arrayed against - including the oil and
trucking lobbies and rural constituencies - threaten a tough legislative
battle against any such proposal. Mr Clinton has not yet finalised the
programme he will present to Congress when he takes office.
The US trade delegation sent its long-awaited proposal for cutting
industrial tariffs to Uruguay Round world trade negotiators yesterday, a US
official said, Reuter reports from Geneva.
Meanwhile, senior trade envoys from the US and the European Community flew
to Geneva to discuss advancing the stalled 108-nation talks, an EC source
told Reuters.
The US offer, which follows a revised EC draft plan presented in December,
comes ahead of a meeting of the round's top-level Trade Negotiations
Committee on January 15.

British troops stationed in Tomislavgrad, Bosnia, came under shellfire for

yesterday afternoon. An officer with the British unit, one of three units of
Royal Engineers responsible for maintaining a critical relief supply road
over the mountains to the central Bosnian town of Vitez, said about 140
shells fell in the immediate vicinity of their base, which lies in a factory

No one was injured, but vehicles and equipment were damaged. One officer
said: 'We've expected this for a long time. We don't know if we were the
actual target because there are Croat gun positions right behind the
grounds.'

FT  09 JAN 93 / Bundesbank support for Kohl solidarity pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RAPID agreement on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's proposed
government-employers-unions solidarity pact will provide a sound basis for
cuts in Germany's leading interest rates, Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a member of
the Bundesbank's central council, said yesterday.
This week's changes in money market rates demonstrated that the central bank
was persisting with its relaxation of monetary policy, he said, although
lower lending rates alone would not revive the economy.
Mr Jochimsen's remarks, made in a television interview yesterday, stepped up
the pressure on political, industrial and union leaders to make firm
commitments on pay, investment and public spending cuts to aid recovery in
the east.
The offer of rate cuts as an incentive for success came as the Chancellor's
office promised that negotiations, hampered by disagreement over social
spending cuts, would be speeded and the pact finalised this month.
The intervention from Mr Jochimsen, president of the North-Rhine Westphalian
state bank, followed a series of broad hints from Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
Bundesbank president, that reductions in the Lombard and discount rates
would not be possible without a pact and consequent cuts in budget deficits.
It coincided with the start of crucial negotiations on public sector pay at
which government representatives offered the 2.3m members of the oTV union a
2.5 per cent rise this year.
This matches the federal government's target for overall spending growth
this year. Regional governments, for which pay bills are the biggest single
budget item, are under pressure to keep expenditure increases to 3 per cent.
West German inflation is expected to average between 3.5 per cent and 4 per
cent this year.
Although public service unions have claimed average increases of 5.5 per
cent, they are expected eventually to settle for a figure close to or under
the inflation rate. This would be an important indicator, both for the
success of the solidarity pact and for the chances of action from the
central bank.
Negotiations ended without result yesterday and are expected to resume on
January 22.
Mr Jochimsen criticised the popular 'fixation' on the Lombard and discount
rates as creating the impression that nothing had changed, while short-term
money market rates had fallen about one percentage point since September and
long-term rates had dropped 1.3 points.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Serbian gunmen kill Bosnian deputy prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOSNIAN deputy prime minister was killed yesterday by Serb gunmen who
dragged him out of a UN convoy near Sarejevo airport, a UN spokesman said.
The killing threw new shadows over the prospects for peace talks in Geneva.
The Bosnian mission to the United Nations said the country's deputy prime
minister Mr Hakija Turalic, believed to be in his late 40s, was shot seven
times and killed while riding in a UN convoy from the airport to the city
centre.
Mr Turalic was returning from the airport when two Serbian tanks blocked the
road and he was dragged from the car. He was then identified and killed.
Meanwhile talks between the warring factions in Bosnia resume in Geneva
tomorrow with few prospects for an early agreement, amid renewed fighting in
Sarajevo and other parts of the country.
After failing last Tuesday to persuade the main combatants - the Bosnian
Moslems and Serbs - to endorse a draft constitutional and ceasefire
agreement, international mediators are attempting to broaden the
negotiations to include Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the hardline president of
Serbia.
The mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance, representing the United Nations, and Lord
Owen, the European Community representative, have written to Mr Dobrica
Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslavia, asking him if he would consider
including Mr Milosevic in his delegation.
It can be assumed that the mediators would not have written to Mr Cosic
unless they had won Mr Milosevic's prior approval for such a move during
their meeting with him in Belgrade this week.
After their meeting, Mr Milosevic said he was willing to support all efforts
which would lead to a peaceful solution of the Bosnian conflict and that the
mediators' plan was 'a good approach' to a settlement.
Mr Fred Eckhard, the mediators' spokesman, said in Geneva that they hoped Mr
Milosevic could play the same kind of brokering role as he did when Mr Vance
was negotiating the end of the war between the Yugoslav federation and
Croatia a year ago.
The mediators appear to believe that only Mr Milosevic can exercise enough
pressure to persuade Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs,
to accept their peace plan, which he has so far rejected.
Specifically, Mr Karadzic is insisting that the Serbs, who currently hold 70
per cent of Bosnia-Hercegovina after pursuing a relentless campaign of
'ethnic cleansing', should be allowed to have their own independent 'state
within a state'. Their ultimate, if undeclared, objective is that such an
entity should eventually be absorbed into a Greater Serbia.
However, the mediators, who have proposed the creation of an independent,
sovereign Bosnia-Hercegovina divided into 10 internally self-governing
provinces without an international legal status, have stressed that such a
solution would be unacceptable to the international community.
More important, the Serbs' demands have also been firmly rejected by
President Alijah Izetbegovic of the Moslem-led Bosnian government, who had
talks with US Senate leaders in Washington on Thursday and is to meet French
President Francois Mitterrand on his way back to Geneva today.
While approving in principle a separate draft agreement on a cessation of
hostilities, which only the Bosnian Croats have so far signed, Mr
Izetbegovic has made clear that he cannot countenance an independent Bosnian
Serb state.
He has also demanded modifications to the provincial map tabled by the
mediators, which would give the Serbs control of about 50 per cent of the
country and the Moslems about 25 per cent, including the main urban and
industrial areas. The remaining territory would have either Croat majorities
or mixed populations.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Currencies' wobbly week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORTLY before the new year, foreign exchange dealers warned that the first
week of 1993 would see intense volatility in the currency markets. The last
five days have proved them true, writes James Blitz.
The start of every year tends to be marked by heavy trading in currencies.
Dealers in the main banks start off with new balance sheets: they have no
profits to lose and are therefore less averse to taking risks when buying
currencies. Many fund managers also make their portfolio allocations for the
year at about this time, increasing financial flows around the world.
This week, the trading has been more intense because of speculation that the
French franc might need to be devalued inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
At the start of the week, the Bundesbank showed no sign of reducing its
short-term interest rates, a stance that led to heavy flows into the D-Mark.
This put renewed pressure on the franc, raising suspicions that France would
be unable to maintain the high interest rates needed to support the franc
within the system.
On Thursday, the Bundesbank made what may have been a significant move,
cutting its money market dealing rate by 15 basis points to 8.60 per cent.
The cut may have been small, but it was seen as an important signal that
Germany will defend the franc at any cost. However, the Bundesbank may have
to cut rates again, if it is to avoid renewed volatility.
*****
The French franc came under strong selling pressure on Monday, bottoming out
at FFr3.4190 to the D-Mark, just above its ERM floor of FFr3.4305. France
raised rates on Tuesday to counter the moves. The franc rallied back above
the FFr3.40 on Thursday night after the Bundesbank had cut money market
rates earlier in the day.
*****
The punt fell below its ERM floor of BFr54.025 against the Belgian franc on
Wednesday, as devaluation fears grew. Ireland's central bank raised the
overnight lending rate to 100 per cent on Thursday night, but the punt was
still below its ERM floor yesterday. Dealers remained pessimistic about
chances of avoiding a realignment.
*****
The Danish krone came under renewed pressure on Monday falling to DKr3.8800
to the D-Mark, in relation to its ERM floor of DKr3.9016. The currency
appreciated to around DKr3.862 to the D-Mark yesterday, following Germany's
move on rates. Growing political problems in Denmark may affect the currency
in the next few weeks.
*****
The dollar broke through Dollars 1.64 to the D-Mark yesterday, following
stronger-than-expected employment figures, but it later fell back to close
at DM1.6375. There were rumours that the Bundesbank intervened on Thursday
and Friday, selling the US currency, for fear that a strong dollar will add
to imported inflation in Germany.
*****
Sterling rallied 4 cents against the dollar in London on Wednesday, closing
at Dollars 1.5455. However, it slipped back sharply against the US currency
yesterday, as investors grew increasingly confident about the scale of the
economic upturn in the US. Some investors believe the pound could slip as
low as Dollars 1.40 later this year.
*****
Sterling enjoyed a remarkable six-pfennig rally against the D-Mark on
Wednesday and Thursday as ERM tensions encoyuraged investors to buy pounds
as a temporary 'safe haven'. Sterling temporarily slipped at one stage
yesterday, after Germany's rates cut eased pressures in the ERM. But the
pound remains well underpinned.
*****
The Italian lira slipped sharply against European currencies as dealers took
a negative view of the Bank of Italy's easing of monetary policy late last
year. After closing at L909.5 to the D-Mark in London last weekend, the
Italian currency was as low as L940.00 to the D-Mark at Tuesday night's
close but rose to L925.00 yesterday.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Norway says it will keep currency floating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY said yesterday that the krone, which it uncoupled from the European
currency unit on December 10, would continue to float until international
conditions permitted a stable exchange rate to be established.
Norway was the first Nordic country to link its currency to the Ecu, from
October 19 1990.
The government said there was currently no basis for re-establishing a fixed
exchange rate for the krone, whose value would be determined in foreign
exchange markets.
Bank of Norway officials said yesterday that the currency had remained
stable since the float, in contrast to the currencies of Sweden and Finland,
whose values had fallen sharply since they were uncoupled from the Ecu in
the autumn.
Following the announcement, the krone traded at NKr8.4298 against the Ecu,
5.45 per cent below its former central rate of NKr7.9940.
Central bank officials said they were not surprised that the krone, since
the float, had fallen little, because Norway's economy is stronger than that
of its Nordic neighbours, underpinned as it is by a healthy current account
surplus and small public deficit.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Torras files suit against top Kuwaitis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO TORRAS, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office
which went into receivership last month, yesterday filed a criminal lawsuit
against seven former senior executives alleging that they had committed
financial irregularities which had cost the company millions of dollars.
They include Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the KIO's former chairman and a cousin
of the Emir of Kuwait.
The lawsuit, which included allegations of fraud, tax evasion, falsifying
public deeds and price manipulation, was brought before Spain's senior
monetary court by lawyers acting on behalf of the executive team that took
over management of the KIO and of Torras midway through last year.
The potential litigation - the monetary court now has to rule on whether to
investigate the charges - suggests that an explosive process of claims and
counter-claims may take place which could damage the KIO's reputation in the
financial world.
At the heart of the Torras dispute is the allegation by its new management
that company profits were routed towards external offshore accounts held by
members of Kuwait's ruling establishment. When Torras applied for protection
from its creditors last month citing losses of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) it
claimed that an 'apparent misappropriation' of funds had taken place in
addition to 'mismanagement on a massive scale'.
Yesterday's statement alleged that irregularities commited by Sheikh Fahad,
by the KIO's former general manager Mr Fouad Jaffar, by Torras' former
deputy chairman Mr Javier de la Rosa and by four other former senior Torras
managers had caused 'fraudulent losses for the company well in excess of
Pta100bn'.
Mr de la Rosa said he was 'delighted' that the lawsuit had been filed
because 'we are now going to demonstrate the truth'. Claiming that 'Torras
is not the important issue' and that its new management was acting 'like a
bull in a china shop', Mr de la Rosa said he and his associates would file
their own lawsuits against those who had brought charges against them.
'We are going to shed a lot of light on the KIO's dealings in London (the
office's headquarters) and on the internal political situation in Kuwait,'
Mr de la Rosa said.
Meanwhile Ercros, the Torras-controlled chemical conglomerate which went
into receivership last July, announced yesterday the closure of five of the
12 plants in its fertiliser division and the loss of 1,900 jobs in the
division, half the total. The cuts form part of a salvage plan prior to the
hoped for disposal of Ercros.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Soaring interest rates take pressure off punt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SELLING pressure on the punt eased slightly yesterday, as interest rates
soared on the Dublin interbank money market. The doubling of the central
bank's overnight rate to 100 per cent on Thursday forced up one-week rates
for wholesale funds to between 80 and 100 per cent, effectively damping down
speculative selling of the punt from overseas which had dominated trading on
Wednesday and Thursday.
In thinner trading than the previous two days, the punt was lifted from its
ERM floor against the Dutch guilder in the morning, although it was forced
back again by the afternoon.
Raising its overnight rate has become the central bank's main weapon in
defending the punt, since exchange controls were lifted at the beginning of
the year. It is the rate at which the clearing banks are able to borrow
funds if they are left short at the end of a day's trading, which is usually
the case during heavy speculative attacks on the currency.
Although it has no immediate impact on commercial lending rates, which are
set on the basis of financial institutions' average cost of funds, it has
put a severe squeeze on their margins and unleashed a battle for deposits.
Depositors with sums as small as IPounds 5,000 were yesterday able to obtain
interest rates in Dublin in excess of 25 per cent for one-month deposits,
while larger sums were attracting rates as high as 40 per cent. In contrast,
overdraft rates for businesses are currently around 16 per cent, while
personal overdrafts are around 19 per cent.
A spokesman for the Bank of Ireland, one of the main clearing banks, said
yesterday: 'It will be very difficult to hold on to deposits if we are not
out there competing for them.' He said an upward adjustment of commercial
rates 'is not being actively considered at the moment. We have been living
with this situation since last October, and we will wait as long as we can.'
A number of building societies however are apparently considering raising
mortgage rates, possibly as early as next week.
The Finance Ministry yesterday reaffirmed that it has no intention of
devaluing the punt, and there are now expectations in the market that a
reimposition of exchange controls might be resorted to next week. The only
alternative would seem to be that interest rates will continue to spiral
upwards if the pressure continues.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE'S year-on-year inflation rate dropped to 14.4 per cent in 1992, down
from 18.0 per cent the previous year but still more than twice the European
Community average.
Consumer prices rose 1.3 per cent in December, compared with 1.7 per cent
the previous December.
The government has underlined its commitment to bringing inflation under
control by restricting public sector wage rises to 9.1 per cent this year,
when inflation is projected at 12 per cent.
Public-sector price increases are to be held below 8 per cent, with the
exception of domestic telephone tariffs and flights on Olympic Airways, the
loss-making state carrier.
The Economy Ministry forecasts that year-on-year inflation will fall below
10 per cent by November 1993, making it possible for the drachma to join the
Exchange Rate Mechanism at the end of the year.
The impact of recession has also helped to keep down domestic price rises
despite the lifting of controls in 1992 on a wide range of goods, from bread
and other foods to petroleum products.
Private-sector wage rises this year, now being negotiated, are expected to
average around 12 to 13 per cent.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Rexrodt named for Bonn economics job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER banker and privatisation expert was yesterday nominated as
Germany's economics minister after a scandal forced the resignation of Mr
Jurgen Mollemann last Sunday.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, 51, who was overwhelmingly chosen by the parliamentary
faction and executive committee of the Free Democrats, the junior partner in
the ruling coalition which holds the economics portfolio, said he faced 'a
hard, but engaging job'.
His nomination, which coincides with a continuing rise in unemployment and a
decline in industrial production, has to be approved by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl. Mr Kohl, who is due to announce a cabinet reshuffle late this month,
is expected to confirm Mr Rexrodt's nomination as part of the reshuffle.
However, Mr Kohl might face some resistance from officials from the
governing Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union parties, and
from the opposition Social Democratic Party, which earlier this week said
they preferred a candidate to be chosen from outside the party's ranks.
Mr Rexrodt joined the FDP in 1980, was Berlin's senator (minister) for
finance between 1985 and 1989, and joined the party's federal exeuctive
committee in 1990.
If his nomination is accepted, he faces the task of carving out a clear role
for the Economics Ministry, pushing ahead with deregulation and forging a
long-term strategy for the restructuring of the economy of east Germany,
which he knows well.
Born in 1941 in Berlin, Mr Rexrodt was educated in Thuringen, former east
Germany, and studied in Berlin in 1960, settling in the western part of the
city before the Berlin Wall was built in 1961.
Since then, he has worked largely in the banking sector. In 1989, he was
employed by Citibank, in Frankfurt, with responsibility for corporate
banking. In late 1991, he joined the board of the Treuhandanstalt, the
agency set up to oversee the privatisation of eastern German industry, where
he oversaw the privatisation of the textile sector.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Ministers look at cuts in mortgage tax relief: System no
longer 'sacrosanct'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTIVE surge in Britain's public borrowing has opened up a
high-level debate within the government about the future of mortgage
interest tax relief.
As Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, studied the options for his March
Budget at a meeting with Treasury colleagues yesterday, senior government
insiders said the present tax regime for homeowners was no longer
'sacrosanct'.
The chancellor's traditional talks at Chevening in Kent came as cabinet
colleagues said an extension of value added tax and curbs in the allowances
against income tax appeared inevitable in one of the two Budgets planned for
1993.
But the ministers said Mr John Major, the prime minister, who has indicated
he will take the pivotal role in budget planning, would be reluctant to risk
stalling the economic recovery with large tax increases in March.
Mr Major's aides are emphasising that he wants a 'Budget for industry'
designed to underpin business confidence and investment. He will explore the
options with his Downing Street policy advisers at a separate meeting this
weekend at Chequers, his official country residence.
Mortgage tax relief will cost the Treasury Pounds 5.2bn this year, down from
more than Pounds 7bn in 1991-92. The saving reflects the sharp fall in
interest rates and the bill will begin to rise again if interest rates move
higher.
Some of Mr Lamont's cabinet colleagues want him to consider a package
combining more short-term help - particularly for first-time buyers - with a
long-term programme to scale it down. At present, relief is given at the
basic income tax rate of 25 per cent on interest paid on the first Pounds
30,000 principal of a mortgage.
One suggestion is that the tax concession should be 'front-loaded' to help
people with their first house purchase but it would then be 'capped' after
they had established a foothold in the housing market.
Advocates in the government of the reform believe public attitudes have
changed sufficiently to allow a gradual shift towards abolition without
raising a political storm. Labour would find it difficult to oppose such a
move.
The Conservatives pledged in last year's election manifesto that: 'We will
maintain mortgage tax relief.' However no specific commitment was given as
to the level or the distribution.
The change now being floated would deliver little or nothing in the way of
immediate savings since it would be impossible to change the regime for
those with existing mortgages.
But it would signal to financial markets that the government was committed
over the medium term to raising additional revenue and cutting borrowing. It
would also dovetail with ministerial concern that the government should do
more to stimulate the rented housing sector.
More broadly, the chancellor is under intense pressure from within the
Treasury to raise taxation in March or in the second Budget, which is
planned for December. Officials are sceptical about Mr Major's public
optimism that most of the borrowing requirement will melt away with economic
recovery.
They expect the deficit for the financial year beginning in April to
approach Pounds 50bn. The Treasury is concerned that sterling will remain
dangerously vulnerable unless the government is seen to be ready to take
hard decisions about taxation and spending.
Despite the obvious political objections, Mr Lamont is ready to consider
extending VAT to newspapers and books, public transport, domestic fuel, new
construction and, most controversially, to food. Ministers stress that any
move in that direction would be gradual.

FT  09 JAN 93 / Walker accused of Pounds 12.5m theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE WALKER, former head of the Brent Walker leisure and property
group, was arrested yesterday and charged with the theft of Pounds 12.5m
from his old company.
His arrest marks another step in the former boxer's fall from grace. In May
1991, he was ousted as chief executive of Brent Walker, which he had built
up through a series of deals but had overburdened with debt.
However, last September he fought off his creditors' petition for personal
bankruptcy. Since then he has been building a new business importing
cigarettes and cosmetics into Russia.
The two counts of theft allege he stole Pounds 7.5m from Brent Walker in May
1989 and a further Pounds 5m in August that year.
Mr Walker was also charged, along with Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the group's
former finance director, with two counts of false accounting relating to the
thefts.
The arrests follow an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the
affairs of Brent Walker. The investigation was started in August 1991 at the
request of the company's then new management.
Both Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina, accompanied by their solicitors, walked into
London's Holborn police station at 9am yesterday, to be arrested and charged
by Metropolitan Fraud Squad officers. They appeared later at Bow Street
magistrates court and were released on bail until April 2.
Mr Walker left the court without making any comment. His solicitor, Mr
Michael Coleman, said the former Brent Walker chief executive denied any
dishonesty.
'Mr Walker has been charged with a number of very serious offences at the
conclusion of a lengthy and detailed investigation by the Serious Fraud
Office,' Mr Coleman said. 'Throughout the inquiry Mr Walker has co-operated
completely with the SFO and has throughout denied his involvement in any
dishonesty. He and his family are disappointed that these charges have been
made.'
Mr Walker was released on bail of Pounds 500,000. However, his passport was
not taken away, allowing him to continue with his business activities
abroad.
Mr Aquilina was released on bail of Pounds 100,000 and ordered to surrender
his passport. He left court without making any comment.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Sellafield 'a poor site' for N-waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SITE selected by UK Nirex for its proposed pounds 2.5bn underground
nuclear-waste repository at Sellafield, Cumbria, is a 'poor site' with
inherent hydrogeological problems, according to a report by independent
consultants.
The report, published yesterday is the latest and most critical in a series
commissioned by Cumbria County Council from Environmental Resources. It
suggests that groundwater from the repository could reach the surface in
around 300 years.
Cautioning however against attaching too much significance to this
calculation, the report says that only further investigation will show if
the site is safe.
The report criticises the timetable proposed by Nirex, the nuclear waste
consortium, as unrealistically short, and says the application for the
repository, to be built half a mile underground and to operate for 50 years,
will be made before a complete assessment of information can be provided.
Nirex yesterday criticised calculations in the report as 'off-beam'. It said
the Sellafield site continued to 'show promise as a repository location' and
the claim it was a poor site was not supportable.
British Nuclear Fuels admitted yesterday that it had made errors in figures
in its application to operate a new reprocessing plant in Sellafield.
The errors were announced only four days before the end of an eight-week
consultation period for objections to new radiation discharge levels for the
Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) to be received.
That period will be extended by two weeks following the release of the
amended figures on the discharge of radioactive gas.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Timothy Plaut, the number one Extel-rated analyst for German equities, has
left SG Warburg after six years. Plaut, along with the rest of the team,
Nick Jones and Stefan Sanne, will be joining Goldman Sachs at the start of
February.
Goldman, which two years ago had no physical presence in Germany, has
expanded rapidly with around 75 staff now based in Frankfurt. The US
investment bank says the Warburg hiring reflects the need to expand its
German equity coverage.
However, Plaut and his team will be based in London, along with all the rest
of the European research team - save one or two economists.
In an unusual move, the previous head of equity research, Mark Edmiston, is
transferring to New York as a senior European equity salesman.

Ian Brindle, senior partner of accountants Price Waterhouse, has been
appointed a member of the Accounting Standards Board, the UK accounting
standards body.
Brindle, 49, replaces Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young, who
resigned from the ASB recently.
He is no stranger to professional bodies, having been a member and then
chairman of the Auditing Practices Committee from 1986-90.
He brings membership of the ASB back to nine voting members at a time when
it is entering the most testing phase since its creation in August 1990. The
others are David Tweedie, Alan Cook, Robert Bradfield, Sir Bryan Carsberg,
Michael Garner, Donald Main, Roger Munson and Graham Stacy.
Until his new appointment, Brindle was also a member of the ASB's urgent
issues task force, which produces judgments on newly emerging accounting
approaches. He has been temporarily replaced by Mary Keegan, another PW
partner, who is likely to take his place permanently.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: US retailers post strong advance
over Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST leading US retailers sounded a cheery note yesterday as they reported
the best Christmas period sales for several years. Improvements were
particularly noticeable among leading department stores, and many said
results had come in above their expectations.
Federated Department Stores, which takes in chains such as Bloomingdale's,
Abraham &amp; Straus and The Bon Marche, reported a same-store sales increase of
about 10 per cent in December. 'December sales were the strongest we've seen
in several years,' noted Mr Allen Questrom, chairman. He added the company
was encouraged about 1993 although it expected some cooling-off in levels of
consumer activity in the first quarter.
JC Penney, based in Texas, saw a 9.1 per cent advance in same-store sales,
with strong gains in the women's, men's, children's and home merchandise
divisions.
At May Department Stores, December same-store sales were up by 8.4 per cent,
and at Dayton Hudson 9.5 per cent. Many analysts had forecast same-store
sales improvements for the department store sector of 4 per cent to 7 per
cent.
In the discount sector, Wal-Mart, the nation's top-selling store chain, saw
a 27 per cent rise in total sales during December, to Dollars 5.86bn, and an
increase from comparable stores of 10 per cent. This means the group's
like-for-like sales in the first 11 months of the financial year were
running at 11 per cent.
K mart, Wal-Mart's rival in the discount sector, saw a smaller 2.5 per cent
gain in like-for-like general merchandise sales, and a 2.2 per cent
improvement from its speciality chains. It predicted record after-tax
profits for 1992 - exceeding the Dollars 859m seen in 1991 - but said
earnings per share would probably be static at around Dollars 2.02.
Woolworth fared poorly, posting only a 1 per cent improvement in domestic
same-store sales in December.
Sears, Roebuck - whose retail operations have been the focus of much
shareholder disquiet - ended 1992 in much-improved form, posting an 8.2 per
cent advance in same-store sales for the month.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why are certain staff of TV's Channel 4 referring to its formidable director
of programmes Liz Forgan as 'Birt In A Skirt'?
Although she remains uncharacteristically silent, growing numbers of
colleagues believe that new BBC director-general John Birt will announce
next week that the former Guardian women's page editor is joining him in a
senior role. It could even be, some say, as managing director of
broadcasting.
If so, crusty Baron Wyatt of Weeford will no doubt become even crustier. He
lately told the House of Lords that 'this fearsome lady 'of staunch
left-wing opinions was not fit to be in charge of any programmes anywhere'.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Letter: BBC should give customers what they want with Radio
4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From P H BALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have heard that the BBC intends to stop broadcasting Radio 4 on long
wave.
There must be thousands of British expatriates like myself for whom Radio 4
is the main cultural link with Britain. To me Radio 4 is simply one of the
pleasures of life, and the idea of it being replaced by a continuous news
programme seems quite absurd.
We have quite enough of these already, including the BBC's own '648', Radio
Europe, and I cannot see anyone wanting to listen to the same items of news
being repeated endlessly (except in times of emergency like the Gulf war,
but then schedules can be rearranged anyway).
The BBC is supposed to be a public service which should give its customers
what they want. I, and by all accounts more than 90 per cent of listeners,
want Radio 4.
I should be grateful if you would use your influence to see that the BBC
abandons its plans for an unwanted new service and keeps Radio 4 on long
wave.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner issues Dollars 1bn
debenture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment company, yesterday
launched a Dollars 1bn debenture offer designed to reduce the burden of the
group's outstanding Dollars 6.5bn of preferred stock.
The Dollars 1bn offer is part of Time Warner's effort to work through its
heavy debt load, a result of the company's formation following the merger
agreement in 1989 between Time and Warner.
The company, which last year made strides toward rescheduling its bank debt,
recently indicated it may sell up to Dollars 3bn of assets over the next two
or three years as part of the move to strengthen its balance sheet.
Net proceeds of the debenture issue, which mature in 2013 and carry a coupon
of 9.125 per cent, would be used to repurchase or redeem preferred stock.
The preferred stock, which in 1991 cost Time Warner Dollars 579m in dividend
payments, was issued as a result of the merger agreement between Time and
Warner. The dividends have plunged Time Warner into a bottom-line loss in
spite of strong operating earnings from its music, film, publishing and
cable television divisions.
In the first nine months of 1992 it made Dollars 926m of operating income,
but its debt servicing reduced net profits to just Dollars 18m and its loss
after payment dividends on preferred stock was Dollars 449m.
The offer, scheduled to close on January 19, is being underwritten by
Merrill Lynch, BT Securities Corporation and JP Morgan Securities.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, which is expected to report the largest
corporate losses in history for 1992, sounded a happier note at the consumer
electronics show in Las Vegas yesterday. It revealed it had attained record
sales of its PS/1 consumer personal computers
'We have just completed our best quarter ever, selling more than six times
the number of PS/1s than we did in the fourth quarter of 1991,' said Mr Jim
Keenan, director of consumer brands and retail channels, at IBM Personal
Computer, the new business unit.
Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM president, demonstrated prototype products and services
that apply computer power to consumer entertainment.
In a joint venture with Blockbuster Entertainment, IBM has developed a
digital video and audio delivery system for record stores. The system
provides consumers with a virtually unlimited selection of music and video
titles which can be electronically downloaded to the store where a compact
disk or cassette recording can be produced.
Cray Research, the leading manufacturer of supercomputers, said it would
report a loss for 1992 because the acceptance of one of its large systems
had been delayed.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Hagen leaves Nedlloyd board and
cuts stake
</HEADLINE>

   By RONALD VAN DE KROL and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEDLLOYD, the Dutch trans-port group, said yesterday that Mr Torstein Hagen,
the Norwegian investor, had resigned his seat on the company's supervisory
board and withdrawn his request for an extraordinary shareholders' meeting
to discuss radical changes to the way the board is elected.
Mr Hagen, who was admitted to the board in October after a long battle, also
announced that he had sold a 5 per cent stake in Nedlloyd, reducing his
holding to less than 10 per cent. He had promised that he would resign his
seat as soon as the shareholding fell below 15 per cent, he said.
Mr Hagen angered his fellow board members in December when he called for the
board to be elected by shareholders.
Supervisory boards in the Netherlands are self-perpetuating and nominate
their own members, providing an in-built form of protection from unwanted
takeovers.
However, in a partial recognition of Mr Hagen's self-styled crusade for
shareholder rights, Nedlloyd said that 'when filling the vacancy that has
arisen, special attention will be paid to candidates brought forward by
shareholders.' It added that 'both parties have expressed the wish for a
positive relationship'.
Mr Hagen is facing more difficult financial conditions. This was underscored
yesterday by a statement from Oslobanken, a small Oslo-based bank, that DNO,
a company controlled by Mr Hagen, had pledged 53.8 per cent of its shares as
security for a loan which the bank provided for Marine Investment, one of
his main investment vehicles.
Last month, Mr Hagen was forced to dispose of his DNO subsidiary, DNO Olje,
for NKr235m (Dollars 33.7m), far below his original asking price. The assets
were acquired by Saga Petroleum.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: SKr10bn state guarantees for
Gota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government yesterday said it would provide SKr10bn (Dollars
1.37bn) in guarantees to the troubled Gota Bank to cover part of the bank's
anticipated credit losses in 1992 and 1993.
It said it was making the move because Gota, Sweden's fourth-largest bank,
needed new support immediately to continue operating.
The bank would otherwise have fallen well below the 8 per cent minimum
international capital adequacy requirement.
The guarantee is a temporary measure until the state has been able to
complete an orderly reconstruction of the bank. This reconstruction has been
facilitated following the state's acquisition of Gota Bank's shares last
month after Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, which acquired them as collateral
against a loan to the bank's collapsed holding group Gota AB, decided they
were worthless.
Gota Bank estimated last September that credit losses for the whole of 1992
would amount to some SKr8bn, although it is believed there has been a
further deterioration in its position since. One estimate suggests the
bank's total 1992 credit losses may amount to SKr10bn-SKr12bn.
As a result of the guarantee, Gota Bank's capital adequacy ratio amounts to
some 8 per cent.
Last month the state was compelled to provide further support for Nordbanken
as part of its continuing efforts to prop up Sweden's ailing financial
system.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Management: Engineers learn the value of training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the UK engineering industry looks ahead to the end of the recession, the
effect of the downturn on companies' investment in the long-term
requirements for competitiveness will become increasingly significant.
Apart from product development, perhaps the most important internal
investment a company can make is in training. But have British engineering
companies maintained their skill levels as markets have fallen or collapsed
and workforces are reduced?
The answer is a qualified yes, according to an informal survey of the six
engineering companies taking part in the FT's occasional series tracking the
industry out of recession. Spending on training has not been cut
significantly, although it may have been redirected, and in one or two cases
it has even been increased.
The smallest of the six, Posiva, is German-owned and has an embedded
commitment to vocational training and engineering literacy. This starts with
managing director Reg Bricknell and continues throughout the
Scunthorpe-based gears and drives company.
But the other five, all public or private UK-owned companies, have also
resisted the temptation to slash training budgets despite sometimes heavy
cuts in their workforces. Recession or no recession, says Peter Burton at
Bloxwich Engineering, the Walsall vehicle parts producer, 'the main skill we
have been working on is getting the entire workforce to be aware of the need
for absolute quality.'
There has, inevitably, been less need for engineering training because
recruitment is on hold and manufacturing staff have been made redundant. 'It
did not make sense to bring apprentices in when we were making skilled men
redundant,' says Colin Gaskell, managing director of 600 Group.
But that has shifted the emphasis on to commercial training, says John Bell,
chief executive of Senior Engineering. 'We are acutely aware that the way we
respond and handle customers, and the way in which we address short-term
demand, is crucial to the way the business develops.'
The survey underlines a number of issues about training that may strike a
chord with other engineering companies. First, a relatively modest
investment can achieve a great deal if it is accompanied by plenty of effort
and commitment.
Senior has done its commercial training almost 'on the cheap', says Bell, by
avoiding mainline consultants and using smaller firms.
Second, it suggests that companies are thinking hard before swallowing the
latest buzzwords from consultants.
At JCB, the main training initiative has been a customer quality programme
introduced in 1990. Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman, says: 'We felt that
total quality management wasn't for us - it's too glib a method of
management. We wanted our own banner which people can identify with.'
The type of, and need for, training may vary among the six but they all
believe they are either matching or exceeding the commitment to training and
skills retention among domestic or overseas competitors. 'I don't think
we'll be facing a skills shortage when the recession ends,' says Gaskell.
The question, though, is whether the companies can continue this commitment
during 1993. Peter Barker, chairman of Hull-based Fenner and also chairman
of the Yorkshire and Humberside CBI, says three-quarters of its 40 members
have either maintained or increased spending on training during the
recession. But, he says, unless the recession eases attitudes towards
training investment might change for the worse.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ford drives Honda out of US top
spot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORD Motor claimed a symbolic victory over Japan when its Taurus mid-sized
car narrowly beat the Honda Accord to be the top-selling car in the US in
1992. The Accord has held the number one position since 1989.
Ford's recapture of the top spot will be taken as a further sign of the
renewed competitiveness of the US motor industry against Japanese rivals,
which was indicated yesterday by 1992 sales figures for the US vehicle
industry as a whole.
Japanese manufacturers saw their share of the US car market dip to 30 per
cent, from 31 per cent, the first reversal in several years.
Ford's car market share rose to 21.6 per cent from 19.9 per cent but ailing
General Motors dipped to 34.5 per cent from 35.4 per cent and Chrysler was
lower at 8.3 per cent, compared with 8.5 per cent.
In the combined car and light truck market, the Japanese share dipped to 24
per cent from 26 per cent due to some strong US products and tariff
barriers.
The Ford Taurus, relaunched in the autumn of 1991 sold 409,751 units, up
from 299,700, while the Honda Accord dipped to 393,477 from 399,297.
However, Ford's victory was only achieved by offering big discounts and
cheap lease finance to customers. The drive began in August and reached a
peak last month as the company scrambled to close the gap with Honda,
offering even more lavish incentives, including rebates to dealers willing
to put additional Tauruses into their demonstration fleets.
Honda replied with cheap financial packages of its own.
Ford was helped by its far greater number of dealer outlets across the US -
some 4,300 to Honda's 1,000 - and while Honda's sales go mainly to retail
customers, a large proportion of Tauruses go to fleet buyers, such as rental
companies.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, which is expected to report the largest
corporate losses in history for 1992, sounded a happier note at the consumer
electronics show in Las Vegas yesterday. It revealed it had attained record
sales of its PS/1 consumer personal computers
'We have just completed our best quarter ever, selling more than six times
the number of PS/1s than we did in the fourth quarter of 1991,' said Mr Jim
Keenan, director of consumer brands and retail channels, at IBM Personal
Computer, the new business unit.
Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM president, demonstrated prototype products and services
that apply computer power to consumer entertainment.
In a joint venture with Blockbuster Entertainment, IBM has developed a
digital video and audio delivery system for record stores. The system
provides consumers with a virtually unlimited selection of music and video
titles which can be electronically downloaded to the store where a compact
disk or cassette recording can be produced.
Cray Research, the leading manufacturer of supercomputers, said it would
report a loss for 1992 because the acceptance of one of its large systems
had been delayed.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: IRI approves break-up of SME
foods side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, the Italian state holding company, yesterday formally approved the
break-up and partial disposal of its SME foods, catering and retailing unit
in what could be one of the country's biggest sales this year.
SME, which made net profits of L125.6bn (Dollars 91.18m) on turnover of
L5,814bn in 1991, will be broken into at least three, and possibly four,
operations, most of which will be sold. Shares in SME, which have risen
sharply on privatisation hopes, climbed L95 to L5,845 in Milan yesterday.
IRI has appointed Wasserstein Perella, the US investment bank, to prepare
the break-up plan. Once the reorganisation is complete, private investors in
SME, which is almost 65 per cent owned by IRI, will be offered shares in the
new divisions, which will be quoted. Once IRI has picked buyers via
competitive auctions, the successful bidders are expected to launch public
tender offers for the remaining shares floating.
Only SME's GS supermarket chain and Autogrill catering division will be
retained, at least in the short term. SME's other activities, concentrated
in food production, will be split into two, or possibly three, units. One
will comprise frozen foods and sweets, the other vegetable oils, canned
vegetables and fresh milk. Milk may be split off separately.
Investors will also be invited into the retailing and catering business,
although IRI has said it would expect to retain a significant stake.
Public-sector control could be guaranteed through the arrival of other state
or municipal shareholders.
Retailing and catering accounted for L3,525bn of SME's sales in 1991.
Turnover at GS and smaller retailing units was around L2,500bn while
Autogrill's sales were about L1,000bn.
SME's food sales reached L2,323bn in 1991. Its Bertolli vegetable oils and
Cirio canned vegetables brands are household names in Italy. Cirio and
linked companies have almost 28 per cent of the domestic tinned tomato
market, while SME group concerns come second to Unilever in olive oil.
The foods business is likely to appeal to a number of Italian and
multinational concerns. The frozen foods side, concentrated in the Italgel
division, could interest multinationals like Nestle or Unilever. The Italian
Ferruzzi agro-industrial group has expressed interest in the food production
business, though its ambitions could be clipped by its current high
indebtedness.

MR JOHN MacGREGOR, transport secretary, yesterday signalled a new phase in
attempts to resolve the dispute with the US over air services, saying he
looked forward to working towards a more liberal agreement on flights
between the two countries with the incoming Clinton administration.
Speaking in Brussels, Mr MacGregor renewed calls for UK airlines to be given
greater access to the US domestic market.
He acknowledged this would present the US with 'difficult decisions about
changing their 50-year-old restrictions on foreign ownership and control of
US carriers.
'I had hoped that we and the US government would have been able to agree to
a step-by-step programme to open skies, with the next major change achieved
just as quickly as the US Congress were prepared to change their laws on
foreign control,' Mr Mac - Gregor added.
His remarks came two weeks after a proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 493.40m)
deal collapsed when British Airways pulled out because of 'excessive
demands' by the US government. Under the deal, British Airways would have
bought a 44 per cent stake in USAir.
Mr MacGregor yesterday expressed his regret that BA had had to withdraw its
offer. 'The proposed alliance between BA and USAir was a bold and
imaginative one, which could have greatly assisted progress towards removing
restrictions in the present air services agreement between our two
countries,' he said.

<TEXT>
HONDA, the Japanese car-maker, is to begin supplying engines for motor
racing in North America in 1994. The announcement that it will participate
in the US Indy Car World Series follows only weeks after its withdrawal from
Formula One racing.
Honda's move reflects its need to boost its presence in the North American
market, where its sales have begun to weaken in the face of the resurgence
in the fortunes of the domestic US car-makers.
The company was forced to announce this week that the Honda Accord had lost
its place in 1992 as the best-selling car in America, a position it had held
for three years. It was beaten into second place by the Ford Taurus.
Honda, with the Marlboro McLaren team, dominated Formula One for several
years, but was beaten in last year's world championship by the Canon
Williams Renault team. Nigel Mansell, the British Formula One world champion
last year, is also moving to the Indy series in the US.
Honda said yesterday it had established a new racing subsidiary in the US,
Honda Performance Development, which would begin testing engines this year.
The company said its switch to the Indy series would help it expand its R&amp;D
and engineering capabilities in the US and would provide it with 'distinct
marketing opportunities'.

<TEXT>
MOST leading US retailers sounded a cheery note yesterday as they reported
the best Christmas period sales for several years. Improvements were
particularly noticeable among leading department stores, and many said
results had come in above their expectations.
Federated Department Stores, which takes in chains such as Bloomingdale's,
Abraham &amp; Straus and The Bon Marche, reported a same-store sales increase of
about 10 per cent in December. 'December sales were the strongest we've seen
in several years,' noted Mr Allen Questrom, chairman. He added the company
was encouraged about 1993 although it expected some cooling-off in levels of
consumer activity in the first quarter.
JC Penney, based in Texas, saw a 9.1 per cent advance in same-store sales,
with strong gains in the women's, men's, children's and home merchandise
divisions.
At May Department Stores, December same-store sales were up by 8.4 per cent,
and at Dayton Hudson 9.5 per cent. Many analysts had forecast same-store
sales improvements for the department store sector of 4 per cent to 7 per
cent.
In the discount sector, Wal-Mart, the nation's top-selling store chain, saw
a 27 per cent rise in total sales during December, to Dollars 5.86bn, and an
increase from comparable stores of 10 per cent. This means the group's
like-for-like sales in the first 11 months of the financial year were
running at 11 per cent.
K mart, Wal-Mart's rival in the discount sector, saw a smaller 2.5 per cent
gain in like-for-like general merchandise sales, and a 2.2 per cent
improvement from its speciality chains. It predicted record after-tax
profits for 1992 - exceeding the Dollars 859m seen in 1991 - but said
earnings per share would probably be static at around Dollars 2.02.
Woolworth fared poorly, posting only a 1 per cent improvement in domestic
same-store sales in December.
Sears, Roebuck - whose retail operations have been the focus of much
shareholder disquiet - ended 1992 in much-improved form, posting an 8.2 per
cent advance in same-store sales for the month.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Eastern fledglings seek western
partners - The former Communist-run airlines of eastern Europe need to
modernise their ageing fleets fast, but most of them lack resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI, NICHOLAS DENTON and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BALKAN, the Bulgarian airline, this week added its name to the growing list
of eastern European carriers that are queueing to find western partners. The
country's privatisation agency said that SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank,
had been appointed to help find one or more 'strategic partners' as part of
a privatisation plan.
The Bulgarian move follows similar deals elsewhere in eastern Europe. Last
month, Malev, the Hungarian flag carrier, made Dollars 77m by selling 35 per
cent of its shares to Italian investors led by Alitalia, the state airline.
Earlier in 1992, an Air France-led consortium paid Dollars 60m for 40 per
cent of CSA, the airline of the Czech and Slovak republics.
Airlines such as Malev, CSA and LOT of Poland need to modernise fast. Noise
restrictions at many western airports are limiting opportunities for fleets
still dominated by ageing Soviet-built jets. Compared with their
latest-generation western rivals, the ageing aircraft also guzzle prodigious
amounts of fuel.
East European carriers lack the resources to replace their fleets overnight.
Some have acquired, on lease, a handful of new aircraft for their most
important European or intercontinental routes. But so far, such aircraft
form only a fraction of their fleets.
'As far as western European traffic is concerned, we have to modernise and
buy western aircraft,' says Mr Andras Pakay, Malev's chief executive. 'The
market demands that.'
Linking with a western partner provides not just cash for the airline - as
in the Malev deal - or the government, but technical and commercial know-how
too. A year after its deal with Air France, CSA's advertising has smartened
up noticeably. The airline's commercial edge will be 'even sharper this
year', says one banker closely involved in the deal. CSA's catering building
has been upgraded, and the arrival of two French chefs 'didn't do any harm'.
Above all, the company's commercial team gained 'a new lease of life'
following the transaction, he believes.
Most east European airlines fear their domestic markets are too small to
support the kind of growth they envisage. And with the airline business
gradually moving towards bigger, 'global' carriers, many east European
executives fear their companies will be sidelined. Selling a stake to a
western partner can provide cash and expertise without sacrificing
independence, but so far, only Malev and CSA have succeeded.
Balkan hopes to sell up to 49 per cent of its stock to foreigners, while
letting employees take up to 20 per cent at discounted prices. The
government would keep at least 40 per cent in order to guarantee the
company's independence. 'A key element of our strategy is to enter a
strategic alliance with an airline partner,' says Mr Kostadin Botev,
Balkan's managing director. 'We believe potential partners will be attracted
by our route network and low labour cost base.'
But making a match is not easy, even for an airline like Malev with a
relatively good reputation and consistent profits over the past four years.
Malev's productivity, at Dollars 66,000 operating revenue per employee, is
50 per cent above the average for eastern Europe's five flag-carriers: net
earnings last year amounted to Dollars 28m on sales of Dollars 315m.
Credit Suisse First Boston, the adviser to the Hungarian government, had to
tout Malev widely before securing a partner. Alitalia, Lufthansa of Germany,
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and British Airways all showed interest, although
BA and KLM quickly dropped out. That left Alitalia and Lufthansa. Although
the latter seemed the obvious choice, given the strong commercial and
cultural links between Bonn and Budapest, Alitalia's cash offer easily beat
the Dollars 59m put forward by the Germans, of which just Dollars 10m was in
cash and the remainder in know-how and equipment.
The terms from Lufthansa, which faces an estimated DM600m (Dollars 377.3m)
loss for 1992, and the other airlines' decisions to pull out shows how the
recession has complicated matters for the east Europeans. Alitalia's
managing director, Mr Giovanni Bisignani, says any airline carrying less
than 25m passengers a year - what he calls the 'critical mass' - will have
to look for allies. But with growing financial difficulties, even western
Europe's smaller carriers are not rushing to buy market share in the east
through alliances.
In the circumstances, some east European companies may prefer to go it
alone: hence the confusion over plans by LOT. Some bankers say LOT has
already hired and fired at least one set of advisers.
However, LOT executives claim it is in a relatively strong position, in
spite of Poland's economic difficulties. Their confidence is based on its
large home market: Poland's population is around 40m and it lies on the
major east-west air corridor. 'We haven't received any special offers and
we're not looking too hard at the moment,' says Mr Zbigniew Kiszczak, LOT's
deputy chairman.
LOT wants a 'strategic alliance' with a European or US airline, while
retaining its independence. The Poles are seeking mutual access to booking
systems and ticket sales, and an agreement on routes and servicing, but are
not rushing to sell equity, in spite of the burden of 600bn zloty (Dollars
38.1m) in unpaid taxes and a 240bn zloty debt to Warsaw's Okecie airport.
'LOT is the most attractive of the remaining east European airlines without
partners,' says one banker. With Lufthansa probably ruled out on political
and historical grounds, and British Airways already commited to ventures in
Moscow and Berlin, partnership with the Poles could appeal to a regional
carrier such as Scandinavia's SAS, which has so far been disappointed in its
plans to build alliances, he reckons.
Confidence among some east European carriers has been boosted by the arrival
of new western aircraft, which have helped to redress some of the
competitive balance with west European rivals and let them into profitable
expatriate markets. LOT, which has used its Boeing 767s to develop US and
Canadian routes, would like to establish regular flights to Australia to tap
the ethnic Polish market there. Malev has similar ambitions for its two new
Boeing 767s. Balkan, which has substantial business taking tourists to Black
Sea resorts, already operates some 737s, 767s and Airbus A320s.
Both Malev and LOT - which moved into profit in July and is managing to
cover its operating costs as well as interest charges on the Dollars 200m
borrowed to acquire the 767s - have also been bolstered by more
commercially-minded and realistic managements. Malev's Mr Pakay, for
example, has dropped his predecessor's high ambitions to develop the company
into the centrepiece of a three-way global alliance with big US and far
eastern carriers. Likewise, LOT's improvement has been aided by more
down-to-earth aims. Ambitions to create a wider international network have
been scaled down in favour of closer regional links with former Soviet
states such as Belarus or Ukraine.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Danisco sells engineering unit

<TEXT>
DANISCO, the big distilling, sugar and food processing group, has sold Niro,
an engineering subsidiary, to Germany's GEA for DKr950m (Dollars 150.5m)
cash.
Niro is a leading company in the manufacture of spray-drying equipment for
the food and other industries.
It has a workforce of about 2,200 worldwide.
Turnover last year was DKr2.35bn, and pre-tax earnings were DKr141m.
The sale of Niro to a German company means that both Denmark's spray-drying
manufacturers will be under foreign control. The other, Anhydro, is a
subsidiary of the UK-based APV.
Danisco said it was selling Niro, which it has controlled since 1976,
because the engineering company did not fit the group's focus on
food-related business.
GEA is an engineering group with turnover of about DKr8bn and 10,000
employees.
One of its business areas is food and process engineering, but not related
to Niro's area, said Danisco.
Danisco also announced yesterday a strategic alliance between its seeds
business, Maribo Seeds, and Switzerland's Sandoz Seeds for research and
development on sugar beet.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: TT declares bid for AB unconditional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TT Group, the industrial holding company which has recently been
transforming itself into a more specialised electronics company, yesterday
declared unconditional its recommended offer for AB Electronics.
At the first closing date TT had received acceptances in respect of 52 per
cent of AB shares. It bought a 6.3 per cent stake last July and a further
1.1 per cent during the offer.
TT also announced that the open offer of shares to raise Pounds 7.7m was
subscribed 1.4 times.
Since the bid was launched TT's share has risen from 186p to yesterday's
close of 240.5p, up 3.5p on the day. As a result the value of TT's share
offer has risen from 50p to 65p, while the cash alternative has remained at
45p.
In spite of this disparity, the company received acceptances for the cash
alternative in respect of 438,251 AB shares.
The share offer remains open until further notice.
Advisers to TT said the share price had been depressed ahead of the bid
because of talks taking place with AB. Mr John Newman, TT chief executive,
had also spent time raising TT's profile with institutions.

FT  08 JAN 93 / AT&amp;T in CDollars 150m cross-border service alliance with
Unitel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, angered by an alliance between rival MCI
Communications and Canada's dominant telephone consortium, has forged an
alliance of its own with the newest company in the Canadian long-distance
market.
AT&amp;T said the deal will allow it to offer seamless cross-border services to
US subsidiaries in Canada, which accounts for about 15 per cent of its
international telephone calls.
The US group said yesterday it was acquiring a 20 per cent stake in Unitel
Communications of Toronto, in exchange for access to AT&amp;T's intelligent
network software and its marketing, operations and research expertise. The
deal is valued at about CDollars 150m (Pounds 76m).
AT&amp;T and Unitel's shareholders, Canadian Pacific and Rogers Communications,
also plan to inject CDollars 200m of new equity into Unitel. Canadian
Pacific will end up with 48 per cent of Unitel and Rogers 32 per cent. Final
terms have yet to be negotiated and approved by the boards of the
participants.
Unitel gained regulatory clearance last year to set up a long-distance
telephone network in competition with the long-standing monopoly held by
Stentor, a consortium comprising Bell Canada, the country's biggest
telephone operator, and various provincial telephone utilities.
Ms Bette Ann Massick, analyst at SG Warburg in New York, said AT&amp;T's move
was largely a response to the exclusive cross-border marketing and
technology agreement forged last year between MCI and Stentor.
AT&amp;T has launched legal proceedings against MCI, alleging that technology
which MCI is providing to Sentor infringes AT&amp;T's patents. MCI has applied
to have the patents nullified. Ms Massick said that by teaming with Unitel,
AT&amp;T has served notice that it planned to use its marketing and financial
clout to attack the MCI/Stentor alliance.
The forays by AT&amp;T and MCI into Canada are likely to lead to a further
integration of services across the world's busiest international telephone
network.
Mr George Harvey, Unitel president, said the alliance with AT&amp;T 'will
accelerate Unitel's aggressive expansion' in Canada.
Bell Canada said the Unitel deal proved the real competition in Canada's
telecommunications market would come from global players such as AT&amp;T. Other
large telecommunications groups are expected to join the fray.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Citic in HKDollars 10bn asset reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese government's main domestic and international investment agency
last night unveiled a HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 837m) asset reshuffle which
will see its listed Hong Kong entity take a 12 per cent interest in Hongkong
Telecom and controlling stakes in power stations on the Chinese mainland.
Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong quoted subsidiary of China International Trust
and Investment Corporation of Beijing, will make a HKDollars 7.17bn
placement and borrow HKDollars 3.3bn to finance the deals, which include
buying a chemical waste management business in Hong Kong.
The timing of Citic's asset sales was the subject of much speculation in
Hong Kong. Some analysts saw it as a vote of confidence by China in the
colony's economy. Others interpreted it as preparation by Citic for stock
market volatility relating to governor Mr Chris Patten's plans for greater
democracy in Hong Kong.
Citic Pacific, which a year ago acquired Hang Chong, a trading company, has
been keen to throw off its image as an investment company and present itself
as a manager of businesses. Analysts said last night's transactions would
reinforce the company's old image. Its share of Hongkong Telecom's dividends
was estimated by Smith New Court to account for 35 per cent of its earnings.
The assets which Citic Beijing is selling to Citic Pacific are held by its
wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary, Citic (HK). The latter company acquired a
20 per cent interest in Hongkong Telecom in April 1990 from Cable and
Wireless of the UK.
Last night's statement said that Citic (HK) will sell 12 per cent of
Hongkong Telecom to Citic Pacific at HKDollars 7.8 a share - representing a
19.6 per cent discount to Hongkong Telecom's current share price. At that
price Citic (HK) stands to make a profit of HKDollars 4.2bn.
Citic (HK) will also sell control of two power stations and an interest in a
chemical waste treatment company.
Before the transaction Citic (HK) owned 43 per cent of Citic Pacific. It
will subscribe to 420.4m new shares at HKDollars 13 each in Citic Pacific
(of a total of 551.8m to be issued) which will leave it owning 45.9 per cent
of the company. It will also make the HKDollars 3bn loan to Citic Pacific.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, has taken a
controlling 67 per cent interest in a new company created from the
power-engineering division of Prvni brnenska strojirna (PBS) of Brno in the
Czech republic.
Terms were not revealed but Mr Eberhard von Koerber, executive
vice-president of ABB, said it was the largest of the 26 ventures so far
established by the group in eastern Europe.
The business being acquired has 4,000 employees and an annual turnover of
Dollars 120m (Pounds 78.9m), as well as making a Dollars 13.2m net profit
last year. It produces boilers and steam turbines, mainly for small
industrial power plants with capacity up to 60MW.
Mr Koerber said the level of engineering at PBS was fairly high and so the
new company, ABB-Prvni brnenska strojirna BRNO, should quickly become 'a
major pillar for low-cost manufacturing' within ABB's global network of
power engineering plants.
He saw it adding substantially to ABB's existing Dollars 600m-worth of
annual business in the industrial plant sector, and expected it to grow
quickly enough to avoid the need for redundancies either there or at other
ABB plants.
Mr Koerber said the purchase price to ABB, as in its other eastern European
acquisitions, would consist of payments in cash and kind, and management and
technology transfers.
The remaining 33 per cent of ABB-PBS is being retained by PBS Holding, a
recently-privatised group in which the Czech state still holds 51 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE Labor government of Western Australia yesterday called an election on
February 6, clearing the way for a possible federal election in late
February or March.
Mrs Carmen Lawrence, the Western Australian premier, said there had been 'no
pressure' for a February election from the federal Labor government in
Canberra.
However, the announcement removes a major obstacle in the way of an early
federal poll if Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, decides not to wait
until the government's three-year mandate expires in June.
Federal Labor officials had feared that the unpopularity of the Western
Australian government would hurt the federal government if the state
election was delayed until mid-year.
Government strategists hope the early state election will allow
disillusioned Labor voters to register a protest against Labor before
returning to the party in the federal election.
Western Australia is likely to be crucial for the federal government, which
will need to retain four highly marginal seats in the state to win the
federal election.
Labor has ruled Western Australia since 1983, but has lost support in the
wake of revelations of close relationships between state government
officials and Perth businessmen such as Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt former
entrepreneur.
The so-called 'WA Inc' revelations led to the resignation in 1990 of Mr
Peter Dowding, the then premier, and the sacking of Mr Brian Burke, a former
Western Australian premier, as Australian ambassador to Ireland.
Mr Burke, who led the state party to power in 1983, is expected to appear in
court in Perth two days after the election to answer criminal charges
relating to the WA Inc revelations.
Labor has recovered some support since Mrs Lawrence replaced Mr Dowding but
is widely expected to be defeated by the conservative Liberal/National party
coalition.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DANISH retailers have launched an offensive to try to stop their customers
exploiting the European single market to buy goods more cheaply south of the
border in Germany.
Service-Ringen, a Copenhagen-based stores chain specialising in electrical
goods, is leading the campaign to circumvent a 10 point difference in German
and Danish rates of value added tax.
The group is inviting customers to choose goods at one of its Danish stores.
Delivery is then made from one of its outlets in Germany, where VAT is only
15 per cent, against 25 per cent in Denmark.
The purchases carry normal Danish guarantees and service contracts. Mr Ken
Zillmer, the group's managing director, said customers making typical
purchases were saving between DKr300 (Pounds 32) and DKr600 in VAT.
Sales are 'excellent', he said. 'We know that our customers will run hard
just to save DKr100. Now that they can save DKr300-500, they are running
even harder.'
The customer has to pay for transport. Under EC rules, laid down to prevent
mail order houses exploiting VAT differences, German stores are not allowed
to provide transport to a Danish address.
However, transport companies are displaying advertisements in Service-Ringen
stores offering to bring back purchases from Germany to Denmark for DKr170,
including VAT at the German rate.
Other leading Danish stores selling furniture, carpets and electrical goods
are watching Service-Ringen's venture with a view to starting up their own
German supply systems.
The Fleggaard group, which operates stores just south of the border with
Germany, will accept orders for electrical goods by telephone. It is also
offering to sell yacht sails made by one of Denmark's top-flight
sail-makers, allowing thousands of kroner in VAT savings.
Fleggaard plans to offer Danes savings on goods purchased at any store in
Denmark, provided they spend at least DKr20,000.
A Fleggaard company in Denmark will buy the goods from the Danish store,
re-sell it to its German store, and invoice the customer from Germany. The
legality of this system is still being discussed.
Danish retailers' aim is to persuade the Danish government to lower the VAT
rate. However, Mr Peter Brixtofte, minister for taxation, said, 'We are
keeping an eye on the situation, but we have no plans to change the VAT
rate.'

12.9% to Dollars 6.3bn
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AHOLD, the Dutch-based supermarket group which owns four big US grocery
store chains, said 1992 turnover rose by 7.3 per cent to Fl 22.3bn (Dollars
12.3bn), with US turnover growth outstripping the gain posted in the
Netherlands.
The US, which generally accounts for roughly half of group sales, saw a 12.9
per cent turnover rise to Dollars 6.3bn. Of this increase, 7.2 per cent was
due to the fact that New York-based Tops Markets had been consolidated for
only 39 weeks in 1991 compared with a full 53 weeks in 1992.
Dutch turnover was up 9.1 per cent at Fl 11.2bn.
Ahold, which is due to publish 1992 profits on March 18, said overall
turnover would have been 3.7 percentage points higher if it had not been for
the dollar's decline. Partly compensating for this was the 53-week financial
year, which flattered sales figures by around 2 percentage points.

RENAULT, the French state-owned carmaker and Volvo, its Swedish partner,
yesterday confirmed they were seeking to deepen their alliance of nearly
three years.
The companies refused to comment on reports that the French government was
considering plans for Renault to take majority control of Volvo Car.
However, officials at Renault and the French industry ministry said they
were looking at ways in which Renault and Volvo might move closer within the
French carmaker's existing statutes, although no immediate steps were
planned.
Volvo owns 20 per cent of Renault and has the right to build up to 25 per
cent. Nothing in Renault's statutes stops it from taking majority control of
Volvo's car division, said an official. However, such a move could raise
political problems in Sweden, unless Volvo received substantial
compensation.
'It is no secret that Renault and Volvo are seeking a deeper and stronger
alliance than today,' said Volvo.
Speculation that Renault and Volvo might merge or exchange their car and
truck businesses has been rife ever since the pair swapped minority share
stakes in 1990 to help each other face growing competition.
To date, the partners have pooled much of their component purchasing
activities in both trucks and cars, agreed to exchange car engines and are
planning a range of luxury cars based on a common platform for sale in
Europe.

FT  08 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: TSB rises on talk of takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB outshone a generally weak banking sector as the market ignored
continuing worries about bad debts and today's one-day strike by the staff
in protest against job losses, and concentrated on another burst of takeover
speculation and rumours of asset disposals.
Shares in TSB have been restrained in recent sessions as strike worries
built up. But yesterday saw a bout of heavy buying in the stock which took
it to 161 1/2 p at one point, with marketmakers reporting speculation that
the bank could be about to announce the sale of its Hill Samuel merchant
bank - possibly to a European buyer - for around Pounds 200m. TSB launched a
bid for Hill Samuel just before the great crash in October 1987 and
eventually paid more than Pounds 770m for the merchant bank. It subsequently
suffered heavy losses. At the close TSB was 6 higher at 158p after turnover
of 11m shares.
The takeover stories, which have surrounded TSB for a couple of years,
erupted again yesterday, with Lloyds Bank, unsuccessful in its attempt at
gaining control of Midland Bank last year, again put forward as a potential
predator. Abbey National was also mentioned as a possible suitor.
Banking analysts, however, said it was more likely that marketmakers had
been caught short of TSB stock after some string buying by income funds
anxious to lock in the TSB dividend ahead of the preliminary results,
expected on January 14.
Lloyds Bank lost 8 to 534p, albeit in relatively thin trading, while Abbey
National, still said to be feeling the effects of a recent profits
downgrade, fell 7 to 371p on 5.2m traded.
Unigate active
Takeover talk swirled around Unigate, one of the stock market's favourite
bid rumour targets, with French dairy products group BSN once again said to
be considering a courtship.
Most analysts were dismissive, however, arguing that while BSN wants to
concentrate on developing specific product lines - which Unigate's St Ivel
subsidiary would provide - it is unlikely to tackle such a large dairy
combine. The French group, which issued a denial yesterday, has a history of
non-hostile acquisitions.
However, according to analysts, the main source of the rumour appears to
have come from a meeting of the St Ivel board, which was called unexpectedly
to discuss restructuring, rather than a BSN bid. This did not stop
speculators clambering aboard in early hectic trading and the Unigate shares
closed at 329p, up 19.
Burton steadies
Tougher than expected rationalisation moves at Burton inspired more positive
comments on the group's recovery potential and saw analysts move quickly to
upgrade profits forecasts.
Burton believes its sweeping redundancy package will be repaid within a year
and that the full cost savings of Pounds 20m will be felt in the 1993-94
accounting year. Most analysts left 1992-93 predictions untouched, but for
the following year, new forecasts ranged from Pounds 50m to Pounds 75m as
the full extent of the savings were counted in.
Mr Steve Oldfield at Smith New Court said Burton was becoming 'one of the
market's most interesting recovery stories' and that short-term investors
were likely to be rewarded in the near term. However, the large volumes
traded in recent days against a relatively slow upward price move
demonstrated that some investors are continuing to bale out. Yesterday, the
shares added 1 1/2 at 80p on turnover of 23m.
Standard Chartered, one of the market's best performers in recent months,
came under renewed selling pressure, closing 13 cheaper at 586p, as a number
of institutions took profits in the stock, which rejoined the FT-SE 100 at
the start of this year.
There was big turnover - 4.5m - in Bank of Scotland amid talk of a hefty
profits downgrade, with the shares settling 1 1/2 easier at 122p.
Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, held steady at 52p after Newton
Investment Management said it had bought another large chunk of the
company's shares, increasing its stake by more than 1 percentage point to
16.64 per cent. The investment company said no one individual client held a
stake of more than 3 per cent.
Royal Insurance continued to lead the composite sector higher, the shares
closing 7 dearer at 291p after turnover of 2.8m.
Burmah Castrol was a notable casualty in an otherwise sedate oil sector,
with the shares sliding amid wild and subsequently denied rumours that the
group was about to launch a rights issue and embark on a counter-bid for
Evode, the chemicals group currently facing interest from Wassall and
Laporte.
Burmah's denials to brokers triggered a mild recovery for the shares but
they still ended a volatile session sharply lower on balance. The stock
closed a net 22 off at 710p, having been as low as 705p at one point.
Turnover came to 1.4m shares.
Highly geared Rank Organisation softened 2 to 704p as the old rumours of
rights issues returned, although they found little credence with analysts.
More likely, it is suggested, is Stakis, whose results at the end of the
month are expected to be another positive step on the group's road to
recovery. With high debts the hotel group is expected to announce either a
cash call, or the disposal of its casinos or nursing homes, or both. The
shares put on 3 at 44p.
Embattled Owners Abroad gained 2 at 122p after widespread suggestions that
it will need a higher bid from rival Airtours to win the day. Shares in the
latter weakened 11 to 291p.
Food distributor Booker jumped 26 to 434p as the company hosted a series of
meetings with institutions. Investors were said to have been reassured over
prospects for the dividend, which was thought to be under pressure, and
other aspects of the group's business. Kleinwort Benson was also reported to
have been positive on the stock.
Kwik Save's announcement at the agm of its sales increase was already in the
price and the shares slipped 3 to 800p.
Shares in Mirror Group Newspapers remained strong, helped by a buy note from
Kleinwort Benson. There was also talk of stake-building by Mr George Soros,
the private investor, whose Quantum Fund vehicle is said to have taken a
2.75 per cent holding. The shares rose 4 to 97p.
Renewed strong support for Cray Electronics was triggered by news of a
Pounds 4.5m contract to supply turnkeys for satellite image processing, and
suggestions that a number of leading brokers are about to lift their current
year profits forecasts from around Pounds 15m to Pounds 17m, and those for
next year from some Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 25m. The shares, already at their
highest level for around 2 1/2 years, advanced 10 1/2 to 126 1/2 p on
turnover of 5.5m.
Delta surged 13 to 431p, with analysts taking the view that the company
offers all the strengths of BICC but without the drawbacks of property/
construction exposure.
Dealers drew encouragement from the latest figures for new car sales and
marked motor distributor shares sharply higher. Appleyard Group moved
forward 10 to 95p, Evans Halshaw 5 to 243p, Lookers 7 to 115p and Henlys 9
to 96p. Reg Vardy, however, lost 8 to 125p after the 9 per cent fall in
profits.
A Williams de Broe recommendation to switch out of Johnson Matthey and into
Charter Consolidated, coupled with vague takeover stories, drove Charter
shares sharply higher. They closed a net 37 up at 655p.

FT  08 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT weakness in the premium on the Footsie index future met further
testing yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
An attempt to move the March contract higher in early trading soon failed,
and for the rest of the session the stock index future played its part in
restraining the underlying cash market.
The March contract soon faded to around 15 points above cash value,
effectively showing no premium against fair value, which is the calculation
allowing for dividend and financing flows. At this point, the locals backed
away and the big securities houses began to arbitrage between futures and
stocks, selling the blue chip stocks and buying the stock index contract.
Their operations helped a stock market already rallying. By the close of
trading, the March contract had established a fair value premium of around 5
points, still weak by comparison with the 15 or so points expected at this
stage of the contract's life. Traders reported significant rolling-over of
March into the June contract, although with the fair value spread on the two
now at about 11 points, this was an expensive move.
In traded options, volume increased from Wednesday's 29,089 contracts to
37,711 yesterday. The FT-SE contract was very active with 19,226 lots
transacted. BP again led the stock options at 3,145, followed by TSB at
2,699 spurred by takeover talk.

FT  08 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses halved before the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank kept the London stock market guessing yesterday, failing to
cut its key lending rates but then reducing money market repurchase rates.
UK blue chip stocks, down by 20 points on the FT-SE 100 scale just before
noon, halved their losses before the end of the session.
Second tier stocks continued to move steadily higher as investors bought the
smaller capital goods and consumer issues, which are expected to show the
first benefits from recovery in the domestic economy. Retail trading volume,
which shows the degree of investor activity in equities, remained high,
recording a money value of Pounds 1.33bn on Wednesday; daily retail totals
have begun to move above the levels recorded in the final quarter of 1992,
themselves significantly better than earlier in the year.
At the final reading the FT-SE Index was down 9.5 at 2,816.5, having touched
2,805.5 earlier in the day. The initial selling bout was strengthened by
technical selling of Footsie stocks by securities houses arbitraging against
the March contract on the FT-SE Index. At least three sizeable trad-ing
programmes went through the stock market as arbitrage positions were
unwound.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, however, never looked back after a firm opening and
ended the session 21 points ahead at a new all-time high of 2,940.3. The
wits remarked that the Mid 250 Index was benefiting at present from the
absence of a futures contract - Smith New Court, the UK marketmaker, intends
to plug this gap but its new Mid 250 future made a very quiet debut
yesterday.
UK traders refused to be upset by international developments, largely
ignoring increasing tensions over Iraq. The cut in German repo rates was
seen as a move in the right direction and lower rates in the Netherlands and
Switzerland also encouraged London expectations that interest rates are
headed downwards. The doubling of overnight lending rates in Ireland came
well after the close of the UK stock market.
Seaq volume increased to 755.7m shares from the 701m of the previous
session, reflecting both the arbitrage trading programmes in Footsie stocks
and the continued demand for the second tier issues.
The absence so far of the much-rumoured rights issues helped sentiment, and
underlying buoyancy was also reflected in renewed bid speculation, albeit
among some well-known takeover favourites. In banks, TSB resumed its place
as target for a range of rumoured bid predators.
Optimism for recovery in the economy was encouraged by a trading report from
Kwik Save, a leading retail discount group, and by reports of good Christmas
trading by leading stores in the US. Many analysts believe that the shakeout
in UK equities is little more than an expected bout of profit-taking in a
stock market set on a bullish course.
At Nomura Research Institute, Mr Nicholas Knight, one of the most bullish
strategists, rejected suggestions that the market was over-bought. He sees
sterling's strength and developments in German rates as raising the
probability of a further decline in UK base rates. A firm pound will also
reduce fears that overseas investors will back away from the expected flood
of UK government funding and equity rights issues.

FT  08 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sharp setback despite good
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
IN SPITE OF some good news on the economy, a steep decline in bond prices,
uncertainty about the near-term outlook for equities, and heavy program
selling left US share prices sharply lower after heavy trading, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 36.47 down at 3,268.69 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 retreated 3.79 to 430.73, while the Nasdaq composite
slipped back 3.64 to 678.21. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange
was again extremely heavy, reaching 304.8m shares.
The morning's economic figures should have boosted sentiment. The 40,000
drop in weekly jobless claims had positive implications for labour market
conditions and suggested that today's key employment report for December
should show that the jobs picture is improving. News of stronger chain store
sales and another big rise in consumer confidence was also part of the
bright economic package.
But investors remain uncertain about the short-term future for stocks. Fears
of a downward correction have been holding back buyers all week, and good
economic numbers were not enough to revive demand. Tension in the Middle
East, computer program selling and a drop in the benchmark 30-year bond
contributed to the market's poor performance.
Among leading stocks, IBM shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 47, Alcoa fell Dollars 2
to Dollars 70 5/8 , Goodyear tumbled Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 68 3/8 and
International Paper lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 64 1/2 . Some stocks
bucked the trend, notably Philip Morris, which rallied Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 72 5/8 in volume of 5.7m shares after the company reassured
investors about the market position of its leading brand, Marlboro, and
maintained its attacks on recent government claims about the dangers of
'passive' smoking.
Charles Schwab rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 28 5/8 after the discount broker
said its fourth-quarter profits will be about 53 per cent higher than a year
ago, welcome news to investors after a disappointing third quarter.
UAL jumped Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 128 as investors reacted to news of a
major cost-cutting programme. Other airline issues also firmed, Delta adding
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 51 7/8 and AMR Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 68 3/4 .
Home Shopping Network declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 7 3/8 on news that
the Justice Department has asked for more information on the pending sale of
RMS's controlling interest in Home Shopping to Liberty Media.
On the Nasdaq market, Intel maintained its sparkling recent performance,
rising Dollars 1 to Dollars 99 5/8 as investors bought in anticipation of
strong sales for its new Pentium computer chip.
Canada
TORONTO stocks followed Wall Street sharply lower, due to weakness in US and
Canadian bond prices and lack of fresh news ahead of fourth-quarter
earnings. The TSE 300 index fell 34.1 to 3,318.9 and volume was 58.1m
shares.

FT  08 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Jakarta stocks dampened by Astra
ownership crisis - Opinion is divided for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On December 29, a dealer entered the Jakarta Stock Exchange, registered a
crossing of 10m shares of Astra International in a Rp100bn (Dollars 49m)
transaction, and walked out. The incident was an exception. Many brokers had
no work at all during the Christmas period.
The Jakarta market has been subdued in recent months. After rising 27 per
cent in the first six months of 1992 to above 330 points, the composite
index declined to end the year at 274, a 14 per cent gain but less than a
Jakarta bank would pay for money on deposit.
Trading volume, although slightly higher than 1991, averaged Dollars 13.2m a
day last year while market capitalisation stood at Dollars 19.3bn.
Falling interest rates have brought some cheer, but this is expected to have
a mixed effect on corporate performance, since some companies rely on
interest earnings for a substantial portion of their profits. Also, over the
past two years, companies with higher gearing have increased their offshore
borrowing, the costs of which are rising as foreign bankers express concern
at Indonesia's Dollars 78bn international debt.
An ownership crisis at Astra International, Indonesia's second largest group
which accounts for about 10 per cent of the market's capitalisation, has
also dampened investor enthusiasm.
'We have had strong sell orders. The only difficulty has been finding
buyers,' notes one foreign broker.
Brokers believe the crisis at Astra is close to being resolved but the
company's share price, currently hovering at the Rp9,000 mark, would have to
struggle to return to its mid-1992 support level of Rp13,000.
Nevertheless, the stockbroking community has its optimists. 'We all thought
about going home in November 1991 (repeat 1991) and then the market
rallied,' says Mr Peter Arkell, head of research at Niaga Securities. He
expects the index to reach 350 by the end of 1993.
'We are anticipating a cyclical bounce in the performance of the larger
companies,' he explains, forecasting an 18.6 per cent increase in the
market's earnings in 1993 following a small decline last year.
The market also has its pessimists. Baring Securities forecasts earnings
growth of just 3.2 per cent this year and advises only selective buying.
Most brokers have adopted a downbeat view of the economy. Although inflation
has been cut by one-third to about 6 per cent in the past 12 months and
non-oil exports continue to grow at 20 per cent a year, investment is
falling sharply.
Economists are also concerned about the banking sector, the woes of which
were highlighted last month when the central bank ordered the liquidation of
Bank Summa, which had outstanding obligations of Rp1,600bn.
Brokers across the board are voicing their frustration at the management of
the Jakarta Stock Exchange and Bapepam, the government's regulatory body.
Last month Bapepam demanded that brokers acting as underwriters must get a
bank guarantee to cover their potential obligations.
'It is the only market in the world where such a condition is imposed.
Bapepam does not appear to understand markets or to take advice,' complains
one local broker.
While such rules frustrate brokers, they also complain of poor supervision
of companies and inadequate disclosure. Last year saw a spate of internal
acquisitions, whereby public companies bought private assets from their
majority shareholders. 'Public shareholders are getting a raw deal and are
receiving inadequate protection from the supervisory authorities,' says a
senior analyst at one broking house. He believes that some internal
acquisitions were conducted at inflated prices.
It is only when looking farther into the future that brokers perk up. With a
185m population and economic growth of nearly 6 per cent a year, Indonesia
is a large and potentially dynamic market.
And while gloomy about the market's short-term outlook, even the pessimistic
brokers consider some stocks as bargains. The foreign director of one
broking house describes a particular mining stock as 'unbelievably good
value. So good, I bought some for my father-in-law'.

YESTERDAY's interest rate changes had a limited effect on bourses yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT closed before the Bundesbank announced a further repo rate cut of
15 basis points. The later-closing DAX and bond futures markets responded
with a slight fall.
Turnover rose from DM3.4bn to DM3.9bn. The DAX index fell 13.88 to 1,542.50.
A swingeing 1993 earnings downgrade for Daimler-Benz by James Capel caused
the motor and aerospace group to drop DM8 to DM536.50.
Some analysts said that this downgrade, and the prospect of more to come,
had made investors nervous. Furthermore, the market was trading on a 1993
p/e of 17-18, representing a premium to bonds and to foreign equity markets
when German corporate prospects indicated a discount.
Siemens fell DM8.80 to DM585.20 and, like Daimler, fell further in London in
the afternoon. Siemens is due to hold a news conference next Thursday.
PARIS fell as the Bundesbank's decision not to lower its leading interest
rates prompted dealers to close their long positions. The CAC-40 index fell
15.16 to 1,844.47 in turnover of FFr2.5bn.
Eurotunnel went against the trend, adding FFr1.65 or 5.7 per cent to
FFr30.55 in the day's heaviest volume of 1.7m shares. Dealers said that
Eurotunnel's relatively high yield and its recent fall below FFr30 had
attracted attention. There were also hopes that the stock could benefit from
some good news this year, when the tunnel should open and an agreement with
TML could be announced.
AMSTERDAM gained support in late trading from the Dutch central bank's cut
in three key interest rates from today. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.2
higher at 97.6.
DSM, seeking up to 1,000 redundancies, shed 50 cents to Fl 75.60 while Akzo
slipped 70 cents to Fl 138.70 on the prospect of lower 1993 first-half
earnings.
CSM, the food manufacturer, was up Fl 1.80 or 1.7 per cent at Fl 106.40 on a
rise in the 1992 dividend to Fl 2.45 from Fl 2.25 and a two-for-one share
split.
MILAN was initially driven higher by Fiat, which jumped on the publication
of a favourable press report; it lost momentum in midsession, and was pushed
up at the end by Generali. The Comit index rose 1.73 to 455.45 in turnover
estimated at L230bn after Tuesday's L199bn. The market was closed on
Wednesday.
Fiat added L200 or 4.8 per cent to L4,330 on a report in the financial
daily, Il Sole 24 Ore, that both Fiat's car division and its overall
industrial activities showed an operating profit in 1992. The report came as
a surprise to some analysts. Ifi rose L491 or 5.8 per cent to L8,990.
Generali gave the market a late boost by shooting up to L30,100 in late
trading, after having been fixed L315 higher at L29,720.
SME gained L95 to L5,845 as Iri shareholders approved plans for splitting up
the food group and selling off parts.
ZURICH dropped by more than 2 per cent, the SMI index closing 45.1 lower at
2,079.4 on what London dealers described as 'long overdue' profit-taking.
Pharmaceuticals fell first after falls in their US counterparts overnight,
Ciba-Geigy losing SFr19 to SFr650.
The financial sector, already destabilised by the CS Holding bid for Swiss
Volksbank, followed on disappointment with the Bundesbank's interest rate
decision, and on the realisation that a half-point discount rate cut by the
Swiss National Bank merely brought long term rates into line with shorts. CS
Holding and SBC dropped by SFr45 to SFr1,935 and by SFr8 to SFr318
respectively, while Zurich Insurance ended SFr80 lower at SFr2,010.
MADRID saw Cubiertas fall Pta340 or 8.4 per cent to Pta3,695 after the UK
construction group, Lilley, in which it has a 21 per cent stake, was put
into receivership. The general index lost 0.41 to 220.12.
STOCKHOLM turned lower after the steady gains earlier in the week. The
Affarsvarlden general index fell 7.5 to 944.0 in heavy turnover of SKr1.01bn
after SKr494m on Tuesday.
Trading was dominated by Astra and Ericsson. Astra A fell SKr18 to SKr747
and Ericsson B by SKr10 to SKr186. Volvo bucked the trend, rising SKr2 to
SKr375 on renewed speculation that its French partner, Renault, plans to
take over the Swedish group.
HELSINKI climbed for the third day on the abolition of restrictions on
foreign ownership of Finnish shares and reformed capital income taxation.
The Hex index rose 34.3, or 3.9 per cent to 921.9, up 11.2 per cent on the
week so far.
OSLO dipped on profit-taking after Wednesday's cut in key interest rates,
the all-share index losing 2.90 to 392.03.

FT  08 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Royal engagement
improves mood in Tokyo

<TEXT>
THE announcement of the engagement of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito improved
the mood of the market after several dull days, but could not prevent the
Nikkei average from slipping towards the close, writes Bethan Hutton in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished down 1.90 at 16,780.98. It reached a high of 17,058.19,
but a rush of selling in the last half-hour wiped out earlier gains to leave
the Nikkei not far above the day's low of 16,724.19.
Gaining stocks outnumbered losers for the first time this week, with 619
advancing against 316 declining, and 166 issues unchanged. Volume rose to an
estimated 200m shares from 178.6m. The Topix index of all first section
shares ended 6.38 up at 1,298.25, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost
1.50 to 1,054.84.
News of the royal engagement, to be confirmed later this month, lifted the
paper, printing and ink sectors, amid expectations of a boom in demand to
meet the expanded press coverage of the bridal couple as well as souvenir
issues to commemorate the wedding.
Mitsubishi Paper Mills rose Y23 to Y733, Takasaki Paper Y16 to Y276 and
Kanzaki Paper Y14 to Y619. Oji Paper, the sector leader, initially climbed
to Y879 but fell back to close at Y857, down Y1.
The prospect of commemorative coins boosted metal shares. Sumitomo Metal
Mining firmed Y3 to Y645 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting put on Y10 at Y462.
Mitsukoshi and Takashimaya, two of the most up-market department stores, saw
strong gains on hopes of a rush of wedding gift and souvenir sales.
Mitsukoshi closed Y23 ahead at Y733 and Takashimaya rose Y17 to Y876.
Consumer electronics also gained on the possibility of increased sales of
high-definition televisions and other audio-visual equipment ahead of the
ceremony, which is expected to attract large audiences. The marriage of the
present emperor in 1958 created a boom in sales of the then recently
introduced colour televisions. Victor was the principal gainer, appreciating
Y39 to Y809.
Hotel and restaurant operators rose on speculation that a copy-cat wedding
boom could follow the royal engagement. More general hopes of an increase in
consumer confidence as a result of the wedding announcement led to early
gains in most sectors, but some of these were lost in later profit-taking.
In Osaka the OSE average finished 111.96 up at 18,505.94 in volume of 74.2m
shares.
Roundup
WEDDING bells in Tokyo failed to lift other markets in the Pacific Rim.
TAIWAN closed 1.7 per cent lower, extending Wednesday's 4.6 per cent drop on
continued selling sparked by political tensions ahead of a cabinet
reshuffle. The weighted index fell 52.88 to a 26-month low of 3,135.56.
Turnover was a moderate TDollars 9.5bn, against TDollars 10.8bn.
The construction sector lost the most, with Pacific Construction falling
TDollars 1 to TDollars 20.70.
HONG KONG remained weak, sapped by unconfirmed reports of a major placement
by Beijing-controlled Citic Pacific. The Hang Seng index slipped 39.35 to
5,547.32, as turnover contracted to HKDollars 1.69bn from HKDollars 2.27bn.
HSBC Holdings topped the actives list and retreated 50 cents to HKDollars
56.50, followed by HK Telecom, which dipped 10 cents to HKDollars 9.60.
SEOUL rebounded in active trading as investors, encouraged by expectations
of lower interest rates, hunted for bargains. The composite index closed
8.55 higher at 696.95 in turnover of Won822.19bn, compared with Won677.34bn.
SINGAPORE blue chips receded on profit-taking and the Straits Times
Industrial index finished 2.51 down at 1,555.71, after a day's high of
1,562.48. Volume fell to 103.9m shares from 135.5m.
MANILA closed higher for the fourth day as interest in oil issues continued.
The composite index rose 14.79 to 1,292.21 in turnover of 242m pesos.
AUSTRALIA recovered in late trading as the local currency strengthened
against the US dollar. The All Ordinaries index ended 11.2 off at 1,530.9 in
turnover of ADollars 309.4m.
News Corp remained under pressure following a negative report by a US
broker, losing 88 cents to ADollars 27.72. BHP shed 18 cents to ADollars
13.14.
BANGKOK was lifted by a strong banking sector. The SET index closed 10.21
higher at 914.32 in Bt10.4bn turnover.
Bangkok Bank climbed Bt3.50 to Bt101, Thai Farmers Bank rose Bt16 to Bt748
and Siam Commercial Bank gained Bt72 at Bt1,168.
NEW ZEALAND weakened after a rise in interest rates: the NZSE-40 index ended
3.27 lower at 1,553.80.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Optimism over German move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH franc apprec-iated above the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark
yesterday after the Bundesbank announced a cut in its main money market
dealing rates, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank did not lower any of its officially posted rates yesterday.
But a 15 basis-point cut in the rate at which it offers fixed rate
repurchase agreements, to 8.60 per cent, was hailed by some dealers as an
extremely significant move.
Some argued that it may have ensured that the franc avoids devaluation and
that the European exchange rate mechanism will remain intact this year.
'This marks the passing of the peak of the pressures in the ERM,' said Mr
Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. 'It
is the first clear sign that, when pushed to the limit, the Bundesbank will
act to support the French franc.'
Other market participants were not as enthusiastic. A leading fund manager
in London who had taken a particularly bearish view about the French franc's
prospects, said he now felt 'a little more comfortable' about holding the
currency. But he added: 'If there is no more easing in the repo rate within
two weeks, the pressure on the system will return. Today's move has kept the
pressure off for a week or two but no more.'
The spontaneous reaction of currency dealers to the move was clearly
positive. The franc rallied above the level of FFr3.40 to the D-Mark for the
first time since Christmas, finishing at FFr3.3980.
However, the prospects of the Irish punt avoiding a devaluation appeared to
dealers to be even slimmer, in spite of the determination of Dublin's
political leaders to hold the currency.
At the end of ERM trading, the central bank raised overnight rates from 50
per cent to 100 per cent as the currency traded for the second day running
below its ERM floor against the Belgian franc.
How likely is the Bundesbank to ease policy again by the beginning of March?
Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets believes the Bundesbank will
await the outcome of talks on the German budget and the wage round talks
over the next fortnight. She believes that, if the budget deal is resolved,
an official rate cut could come at either of the council meetings being held
on February 4 and 18.
The strong dollar may bring residual pressure on the Bundesbank not to ease
because of fears of imported inflation.
Some dealers were at a loss to explain why the dollar did not break above
DM1.6395 on a day that the Bundesbank eased and the weekly US jobless figure
showed a drop to 291,000 in the week to December 26 from a total of 331,000
the week before.
Rumours that the Bundesbank has been selling dollars in recent days because
of inflationary concern could not be substantiated.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Muted reaction to cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a muted reaction in European interest rate markets yesterday to
the Bundesbank's decision to lower its money market dealing rate, writes
James Blitz.
Yesterday morning, few dealers were under the impression that the Bundesbank
would ease policy, in spite of continuing pressure inside the European
exchange rate mechanism and signs that Germany is entering a deeper
recession than had been anticipated.
After a council meeting that went on longer than expected, the Bundesbank
left its official interest rates unchanged. But it lowered the fixed rate at
which it offers repurchase agreements in the German money market by 15 basis
points to 8.60 per cent.
The move on money market rates failed to have much impact in futures and
cash markets. Some dealers suggested that if the Bundesbank lowers the repo
rate again to 8.50 per cent, this would ensure that the official discount
rate, which sets the floor for all German rates, would need to be reduced.
However, Euromark futures were already pricing in a near-term cut in German
rates before yesterday's move by the Bundesbank and the 15 basis-point
reduction could therefore have made little difference to expectations. The
March contract opened yesterday morning at 92.17, a level which prices
three-month money at 7.85 per cent in the spring, 80 basis points below the
current level.
There was little more excitement in French franc futures. The March French
franc contract closed 2 basis points lower at 90.44. In the French cash
euro-cash market three-month money was a touch easier at 12 1/2 per cent
from the 12 7/8 per cent rate of the day before.
The main event in the sterling market was the difficulty in removing the
shortage in the discount market, The sterling overnight rate peaked
yesterday at 11 per cent after the Bank of England forecast a deficit of
Pounds 1.45bn.
According to one dealer, the market had been waiting for the Bank to repeat
its offer of a repurchase agreement to March 1, at a rate of 6 29/32 per
cent, because this was slightly cheaper than dealing in the longer-dated
bills.
However, the repo was not forthcoming, and late assistance, at Pounds 595m,
was considerable. Three-month money finished slightly firmer at around 7
3/16 per cent.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Falklands squid fears cloud
Hurd's Argentine visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACRIMONIOUS dispute over fishing around the Falkland Islands loomed
large as Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, made a five-day visit
to Argentina this week, the first by a senior UK politician since the
Falklands war.
Despite defeat in the 1982 conflict, Argentina never surrendered its claim
to the islands. Today, it is continuing the struggle by economic warfare,
rather than by force of arms. Just before Christmas, after fishing talks
with Britain, Argentina said it would start selling fishing licences of its
own, breaking the islands' lucrative fishing monopoly.
The Falklands began issuing licences in 1987, mainly to squid-fishing ships
from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. After knowing only hardship and
austerity, the islanders were soon taking in more than Pounds 20m a year in
licence fees, making them some of the wealthiest people on earth.
The illex squid, prized by gourmets in the Far East, is the South Atlantic's
most lucrative species. Already, Argentina has attracted most of the
Falklands' best customers by offering 45 cut-price, three-year licences,
valid for an extended fishing season.
Mr John Barton, the Falklands' director of fisheries, says that 'the impact
is pretty dramatic'. Last year, he sold between 140 and 150 licences, half
of them to Japanese vessels. Argentina has however sold all its licences to
Japanese ships that used to fish in Falklands waters.
The islanders always knew that Argentina would eventually break their
monopoly. The only surprise was the time it took. For years after the war,
Argentina would not even negotiate with Britain. As it was, nationalistic
laws banned foreigners from fishing in its waters, even though the small
local industry showed little interest in the South Atlantic.
All this changed with the resumption of diplomatic relations in 1990.
Argentina recognised the Falklands' fishery conservation zones and the two
sides started swapping data and controlling illegal fishing. Last October,
Argentina changed its laws to allow foreign ships into its waters, as
required under a USDollars 1bn five-year fishing agreement with the European
Community.
From there, it was only a short step to selling squid licences, which had
the attraction of depriving the islands of revenue while increasing
Argentina's. Mr Guido di Tella, Argentina's Foreign Minister, says: 'The
bonanza is over. The islanders can look back to the past wistfully, but the
future will be different'.
He says Argentina will press its rights to the full in future negotiations
about a medium and long term fishery arrangement. If the talks become
deadlocked, he will appeal to international arbitration, which he says will
favour Argentina.
Mr Barton fears Argentina could allow over-fishing in its waters to cut the
islands' income instead of co-operating to conserve the illex. 'I am not
terribly optimistic,' he says.
'If everyone was working on a conservation basis, it would be relatively
straightforward to ensure long-term sustainability.' He says that
Argentina's political stance makes 'it very difficult to see eye to eye on
very simple things'.
Mr Hurd underlined the Falklanders fears this week and warned Argentina
against using the illex as a 'political toy'.
British officials doubt, moreover, that Argentina can police its waters or
monitor fish stocks adequately. The illex has a one-year life cycle, so
overfishing could wipe it out forever.
Mr Barton says the Falklands have an outstanding record on conservation. He
has restricted licence sales to prevent overfishing - and to avoid glutting
the squid market, which would eventually lower the Falklands' licence
revenues. He even hints that a 'squid war' could be in the offing. 'We will
have to look at how to make things more attractive for ships to fish in the
Falklands,' he says. 'But we see no long term winners. If we take the moral
high ground, Argentina could devastate the resource and we would not even
see any revenue.'
Argentine diplomats dismiss the Falklands' conservation policies. One
official accused them of 'depredation' and presenting 'data that is just not
serious'. He said Argentina was only taking its fair share of a common
resource.
The claims and counter-claims are part of the cut and thrust of negotiations
and the Argentines are bound to use the squid dispute to press for
compromises on issues such as oil exploration. Argentina's ultimate
objective is to negotiate the islands' sovereignty - which London refuses
even to discuss.
Argentina says it wants to 'recover' the Falklands by winning over the
islanders' hearts and minds. Distrust of the Argentines runs deep, and
Argentina's squid strategy will do nothing to persuade the islanders of its
good intentions.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'US faces Dollars 6.5bn farm
loan losses'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO US agricultural loan guarantee programmes are facing losses amounting to
billions of dollars having made an increasing number of high-risk loans,
often for foreign policy purposes, according to a new US government report.
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, says
Dollars 40.9bn in guarantees have been issued since the short- and
medium-term credit programmes were launched in 1981 to expand US farm
exports. However, there is no clear evidence that the financing actually
increased sales of US commodities, the investigators say.
Although the US government has so far only had to pay out Dollars 3.6bn to
banks that made loans to customers, the GAO calculates the cumulative costs
of the programme at about Dollars 6.5bn. It estimates that the programmes'
costs will increase by about Dollars 74m a year.
The critical report puts the US loan programmes in some jeopardy. The new
Clinton administration will be looking hard for budget cuts.
Agriculture subsidies are often cited as a possibility. A costly programme
which cannot prove to be productive offers a perfect target.
The GAO makes clear that the loan programme has been given virtually
impossible objectives by Congress and used by the Reagan and Bush
administrations for foreign policy purposes.
In the 1985 Farm Bill the US Department of Agriculture was ordered to
authorise 'not less than Dollars 5bn' for short-term credit guarantees'. It
set Dollars 500m as the floor for the medium-term scheme. Another Dollars
1bn was allocated for 'emerging democracies'.
'Principal recipients of guarantees have often been countries in which the
US has had significant foreign in policy interests, such as Mexico, South
Korea, Iraq, and the former Soviet Union and Russia,' the GAO said.

This week's slide in ALUMINIUM prices on the London Metal Exchange continued
yesterday, with the three months delivery contract falling another Dollars
14.50 to Dollars 1,217.50 a tonne. Dealers said US selling had prompted a
renewed test of support at Dollars 1,215 a tonne. NICKEL prices also added
to Wednesday's decline as profit-taking following recent strength continued
to undermine the market. The three months price closed at Dollars 6,247.50 a
tonne, down Dollars 50 on the day, but steadied a little in after hours
trading. COPPER prices reached three-month dollar highs early in the day but
ended only marginally higher following hedge selling and profit-taking in
the afternoon. The three months price reached Dollars 2,392 a tonne before
ending at Dollars 2,355 a tonne, up Dollars 5. Dealers said expectations of
further declines in LME warehouse stocks and continued Chinese buying helped
to hold the market above Dollars 2,500. COFFEE prices rallied following
their recent slump, aided by profit-taking on short positions. The London
robusta March futures prices closed Dollars 14 higher at Dollars 945 a
tonne.

budget

CODELCO, THE Chilean state copper company, is scaling down its investment
programme for 1993 after receiving a much smaller budget from the treasury
than it had hoped for.
The world's biggest copper producer had asked for Dollars 610m this year to
develop new mines, expand production at its existing divisions and clean up
the environmental mess caused by its old-fashioned smelters. But the
treasury has assigned Codelco an investment budget of only Dollars 450m.
Mr Alejandro Hales, the Chilean Mining Minister, said the budget was
insufficient. He warned that the pace of certain projects might have to be
slowed down. 'It is our hope that the Treasury will release additional funds
later this year,' he said.
Codelco's slim budget places a question mark over its key development
project: the Radomiro Tomic copper deposit close to the Chuquicamata
open-pit mine in the Atacama desert.
Codelco executives say they need Dollars 450m to put Tomic into production.
It is expected to be a medium-sized operation with an annual output of
150,000 tonnes of refined copper.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal producers braced for
another tough year - Most analysts believe there will be no substantial
rebound in prices in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METALS PRODUCERS are bracing themselves for another punishing year. Among
the metals traded on the London Metal Exchange only copper is priced at a
level that gives efficient producers a reasonable return. For the rest,
prices are not high enough for producers to survive in the long term. They
are cutting investment, stopping exploration and postponing projects in a
way that is storing up trouble for the future.
But, as the table alongside proclaims, most analysts believe there will be
no substantial rebound in 1993. 'Prices will remain soggy unless there is a
significant upturn in the world economy,' suggests Mr Phillip Crowson, chief
economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining company. He does not believe
base metal prices will fall much further but 'they won't improve until well
into 1993'.
He adds: 'In important areas such as construction and automobile production
and many capital goods sectors, activity will remain below the peaks of the
late 1980s even as we go into 1994'.
More production cuts by aluminium, nickel, lead and zinc producers are
needed if prices are to show a short-term recovery, he says.
Mr Crowson is not alone in this belief. LME prices have been on a rising
trend in the last weeks of 1992 and the first days of the new year but this
is not good news for the industry, according to Mr Neil Buxton at the Metal
Bulletin Research consultancy organisation. 'It means the industry will
delay the production cuts needed to reduce stocks and raise prices,' he
points out.
Stocks of aluminium, lead, nickel and zinc in LME warehouses are at record
levels and those of copper and tin are uncomfortably high. Demand for metals
will not increase enough to cut stocks appreciably, Mr Buxton suggests, and
it is also unlikely that the flood of metal from the Commonwealth of
Independent States which is creating havoc in western metals markets, will
ease in 1993.
These comments are echoed by Mr Thomas Baack, chief economist for Germany's
Metallgesellschaft mining and metals group. 'The underlying situation of the
non-ferrous metals markets hardly changed at all in the course of 1992 and
in all probability will not do so in 1993 either,' he suggests.
'Production and consumption in the western world are stagnating or growing
at an equal rate. However, the imbalance caused by east-west trade persists
and at this moment there are no prospects of improvement in this respect.'
Most metals market forecasters subscribe to the view held by the 24-nation
Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, which is forecasting
only a very weak recovery in 1993. The OECD's central projection is that
economic growth in 1993 will be about 1.9 per cent, a substantially lower
figure than the 3 per cent it was forecasting six months ago. Growth last
year is estimated to have been a lowly 1.5 per cent.
When growth is as low as this in the OECD countries, there is a strong
chance that growth in manufacturing output will be lower still. As the
Economist Intelligence Unit comments in its latest World Commodity
Forecasts: 'Even allowing for a higher rate of growth among the less
developed countries, world manufacturing output may well rise slowly enough
to make any increase in world consumption of metals very doubtful'.
The only good news in the OECD forecast is that the US economy - the most
important in the world for metals consumption - is picking up at a slightly
more rapid pace than previously expected.
But this is being offset by the bigger-than-forecast fall in Germany and the
slowing of growth in Japan. 'Together these are even more important metal
consumers than the US,' Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG
Warburg, points out. Using World Bureau of Metal Statistics figures, he
calculates, for example, that in 1991 the US accounted for 27.7 per cent of
western world aluminium consumption compared with 25.4 per cent for Germany
and Japan combined; 22,9 per cent of copper consumption against 29.1 per
cent; 28.8 per cent of lead consumption against 19.2 per cent; 18.7 per cent
of nickel consumption against 38 per cent; 20.5 per cent of tin consumption
against 29.9 per cent; and 17.1 per cent of zinc consumption against 25.4
per cent.
Most metal prices forecasters assume there will be no easing of the
pressures arising from the sudden swing in east-west metals trade seen since
1990. Import demand for lead, tin and zinc in the former eastern bloc
countries dried up while the region's exports of aluminium, copper and
nickel to the west grew at a frightening rate. Much of the extra exported
metal ended up in highly-visible LME stocks and were the main factor in the
collapse of base metals prices since 1991.
Metal consumption in the former eastern bloc is unlikely to pick up
substantially this year but there is still the possibility that in some of
the CIS countries chaotic conditions, lack of raw materials and/or energy
and transport disruptions - as well as a deeply-entrenched bureaucracy -
will severely curtail metal exports.
There are still some analysts who believe the gloom is being overdone. Mr
Nick Moore at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, says, for
example: 'Sure, the average metal prices for 1993 will be little different
than those for 1992. But prices will start from a low base and rise steadily
to close this year significantly higher. I expect that, against a backdrop
of a steadily improving economic environment, prices will improve in each
successive quarter.'
RTZ's Mr Crowson also points out that LME prices might also confound the
fundamentally poor outlook by rising because of special factors such as
'heavy Chinese buying, investment funds returning to the LME if the US
economy shows a stronger-than-expected recovery, or simple aggressive price
speculation'.
Zinc and tin were the only LME-traded metals to end last year with a higher
average prices than for 1991, the former mainly because it was buoyed up by
an options-related squeeze for much of 1992. Also last year some heavyweight
financial institutions started to invest in commodities for the first time
for ten to 15 years to diversify their portfolios and, as Mr Crowson points
out 'given the (relatively small) size of the metals markets, only a small
shift in fund investment pushes prices substantially'.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil traders ignore tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD OIL prices were barely changed yesterday in spite of renewed tension
in the Middle East, which would usually make traders nervous and push the
market up.
North Sea Brent crude oil for February delivery edged up tentatively to
close 10 cents higher at Dollars 18.85 a barrel after Iraq rejected an
ultimatum by the US to remove missiles from a 'no-fly' zone in the south of
the country. Kuwait had also reported a clash on the Kuwait-Iraq border on
Tuesday.
The oil market traditionally reacts immediately and very positively to any
reports of clashes in the Middle East, but traders do not at the moment
perceive any serious threat to supply.
The market is still working off huge stocks of oil products which were built
up in October and November. In spite of cold weather in Europe, demand has
remained depressed as economic activity has failed to pick up.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank decision to ease repo rate
provides limited relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK's decision to ease its repo rate, a key money market interest
rate, while leaving Germany's official discount rate and Lombard rate
unchanged, provided some relief for Europe's government bond markets
yesterday and prompted interest rate cuts in the Netherlands and Belgium.
However, while bond market analysts said the 15 basis point cut in the repo
rate to 8.6 per cent could help to reduce some of the tensions within the
European exchange rate mechanism, some market participants were disappointed
at the small size of the Bundesbank easing and at the decision to leave the
official discount rate and Lombard rate unchanged at 8.25 per cent and 9.5
per cent respectively.
The bond market reaction to the Bundesbank's easing was rather muted: after
an initial rise in prices on the news, longer-dated German and French
government bond prices ended the day slightly lower.
Strong buying of German government bonds earlier this week on expectations
of lower interest rates had helped to push up bund prices, and dealers said
many investors decided to take profits yesterday. Continued good demand for
two and three-year paper led to a further flattening of the German yield
curve, dealers said.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, was quoted yesterday saying
that the reduction in the central bank's 14-day securities repurchase tender
rate from 8.75 per cent to 8.60 per cent was not a signal, but was a
cont-inuation of the central bank's easing in monetary policy.
News of further supply may have helped to depress the long end of the
market, as the Finance Ministry said it would increase the size of the 8 per
cent Unity Fund bond by DM2bn to give a total issue size of DM19bn.
THE Bundesbank's easing helped to improve sentiment in the French government
bond market, relieving some of the strain on the French franc, which closed
stronger against the D-Mark.
The yield on the 8.5 per cent bond due 2003 rose from 8.05 per cent to 8.09
per cent, while the futures contract on the Matif exchange in Paris closed
at 112.64, down 0.16 from late Wednesday.
The French government raised FFr16.457bn at its regular auction yesterday,
including FFr10.71bn of the 8.50 per cent bond due 2003 at an average yield
of 8.09 per cent.
LONG-DATED UK government bonds fell back about a quarter point after the
Bundesbank announced that it would lower its repo rate while leaving key
German interest rates unchanged. Short-dated gilt prices held steady, helped
by sterling's relative strength in the foreign exchange markets as the pound
traded at around DM2.51 yesterday afternoon.
Dealers said longer-dated gilts drifted lower on fears of new supply, with
the market expecting the Bank of England to announce a new gilt auction
shortly.
However, estimates of how much funding the government needs to do in the
remainder of this financial year vary. Mr Ifty Islam, economist with BZW,
predicts that the Bank of England needs to issue about Pounds 2.25bn in new
gilts, while Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, estimates
that some Pounds 4.5bn of new gilt issuance remains to be achieved.
JAPANESE government bonds closed higher, touching four-year highs in the
cash and futures markets.
Dealers noted strong investor buying across the yield curve, with the yield
on the benchmark No 145 issue moving from its opening level of 4.48 per cent
to as low as 4.45 per cent before closing at 4.455 per cent.
The March futures contract climbed from 108.47 to a high of 108.62, before
ending at 108.59.
The Ministry of Finance offered Y800bn of 10-year government bonds with a
coupon of 4.8 per cent at auction, as expected. The coupon is the same as
for the last 10-year auction stock - the No 153 - and the issues are
expected to be merged to form a new 10-year benchmark eventually, dealers
said.
The auction had a relatively high bid-to-cover ratio of 6.56 per cent. The
average bid price was 100.90 and the lowest accepted bid price was 100.85.
A LARGER-than-expected fall in weekly jobless claims, continued worries
about the impact on the market of fresh supply, and various technical
factors, sent longer-dated US Treasuries reeling yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 3/16 at
102 1/16 , yielding 7.445 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
declines were less marked, with the two-year note down  3/16 at 100, to
yield 4.608 per cent.
Record amounts of new corporate bond issues, plus the upcoming sale of new
government securities, have depressed Treasury prices in recent days.
The downward trend, however, was exacerbated by a string of good economic
news, primarily the announcement that claims for state unemployment
insurance fell 40,000 in the week ending December 26.
Although analysts said that the holiday-shortened week was partly behind the
big drop in claims, it did not explain all of the decline. Consequently, the
data was taken as another indication that labour market conditions have been
improving, and analysts said that the figures increased the likelihood that
today's December employment report will show a significant increase in
non-farm payrolls.
The market was also unsettled by news of robust chain store sales, and by
the latest ABC/Money Magazine consumer comfort index, which rose to the
highest level since May 1991. Illiquid conditions, heavy selling the futures
markets, and talk of big sellers of five-year notes and 30-year bonds, were
also behind the afternoon declines.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Moody's reviews Credit Suisse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MOODY's Investors Service, yesterday remained the only leading credit rating
agency to put Credit Suisse under review following the announcement earlier
in the week of its agreed bid for Swiss Volksbank. Standard &amp; Poor's is
expected to decide today whether to follow suit.
Moody's rating of the giant Swiss bank is already out of line with other
agencies. It downgraded Credit Suisse to AA1 last year, while S&amp;P and IBCA,
the European agency, both continue to accord the bank their top AAA ratings.
Any further downgrade by Moody's would put the bank in the even more unusual
position of having split ratings which were two notches apart on the ratings
scale.
Moody's said its review, which affects Dollars 2.3bn of debt, was prompted
by concerns over the effect the takeover of Volksbank would have on Credit
Suisse's asset quality, core profitability and market position in
Switzerland. At the same time, Volksbank's short-term P2 rating has been put
under review for a possible upgrade.
Credit Suisse reacted coolly to the news yesterday. 'That we have been put
on the watch list is regrettable. But we cannot set our long-term strategies
according to the short-term views of the rating agencies,' said Mr Josef
Ackermann, chief executive designate of Credit Suisse.
S&amp;P said that its Europe and US-based analysts were likely to take a view
today on whether to put the bank on the watchlist.
European Options Exchange, the Dutch options market, expects a 1992 net
profit of at least Fl 16m, compared with Fl 19.8m profit in 1991, Reuter
reports from Amsterdam.
Mr Tjerk Westerterp, president, said 1992 volume rose by almost 2 per cent
to 11.3m traded contracts, which was better than originally forecast.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Norway issues CDollars 750m Eurobond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Norway launched its 1993 international borrowing programme
yesterday with a CDollars 750m 10-year issue through Goldman Sachs
International, one of the largest Canadian dollar Eurobond issues to date.
Norway, like Finland and Sweden, needs to borrow to replenish foreign
currency reserves after last year's currency crises, although its
requirements are lower due to current account surpluses generated by oil and
gas exports.
Foreign currency reserves stand at around Dollars 10bn today, compared with
Dollars 12bn-Dollars 13bn a year ago, and it can afford to borrow at an
almost leisurely pace, says Mr Sigurd Klakeg, deputy director general at the
Norwegian ministry of finance.
Norway will borrow up to Dollars 6bn internationally this year, compared
with Dollars 5bn in 1992. The kingdom is understood to have a funding target
of 20-30 basis points below Libor, and is thought to have swapped the
proceeds of the issue into floating-rate US dollar notes. The bonds were
priced at 45 basis points over the benchmark government bond.
The large volume of Canadian dollar bonds this week has prompted fears of
over-supply. Goldman Sachs said half of yesterday's issue had been sold by
the end of the day, with interest good in the Far East but not as strong as
expected on the Continent.
The European Investment Bank continued its active start to the year with two
further issues, in part reflecting its need to borrow an extra Ecu5bn to
meet the spending commitments agreed at last December's Edinburgh summit.
Its Pounds 400m of 10 1/2 -year bonds through Samuel Montagu followed a
Dollars 250m 10-year collared floater arranged by Kidder Peabody earlier
this week and were launched almost simultaneously with a L200bn seven-year
issue.
The sterling issue was described by a number of bankers as very expensive,
but benefited, they said, from strong international demand for Eurosterling
assets.
Samuel Montagu said it had detected strong demand for a liquid sovereign or
supranational 10-year benchmark that could be traded at or below par. The
EIB is still in the process of finalising its 1993 borrowing strategy, but
before the Edinburgh summit was expected to borrow 10-12 per cent more than
last year's Ecu13bn.
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs said the response in Europe to the World Bank's
Dollars 1.25bn 30-year global, priced at 28 basis points over comparable US
Treasuries, far exceeded expectations and that the spread tightened to 26.
The Republic of Finland increased its seven-year issue to DM3bn, making it
one of largest D-Mark issues yet seen. The terms of the increase continue
the tightening of spreads enjoyed by Finland. Lead manager Dresdner Bank
said the increase was launched at a spread of 50 basis points over German
government bonds, three basis points lower than the spread on the original
DM2bn of bonds, and was holding that spread in trading.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Zuckerman seals NY Daily News
takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mortimer Zuckerman, the real estate investor and magazine publisher,
yesterday completed his acquisition of The Daily News, the New York tabloid
newspaper once owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
The Canadian-born Mr Zuckerman, who already owns the weekly US News &amp; World
Report and The Atlantic, an upmarket monthly literary and political
magazine, is expected to assume ownership of the newspaper today. . become
chairman and co-publisher of The Daily News, while Mr Fred Drasner, a close
associate, will be chief executive and co-publisher.
Mr Drasner, who shares management responsibility with Mr Zuckerman at US
News &amp; World Report, has played a leading role in reaching agreements with
nine of the 10 trade unions at The Daily News, which has a daily circulation
of nearly 800,000.
Although the actual purchase price has not been disclosed, it is believed to
be in the region of Dollars 36m. Mr Zuckerman, who is also editor-in-chief
of US News &amp; World Report, has overcome financial, trade union and legal
obstacles in his quest for the New York paper in recent months.
While The Daily News has been making losses, Mr Zuckerman has said he is
confident he will return the paper to the black, in part by luring back lost
advertising with improved political, business and investigative coverage.
Last autumn, Mr Zuckerman succeeded in striking accords with union
representatives who preferred his offer to that of Mr Conrad Black, the
Canadian who owns The Daily Telegraph in London. More recently, he has won a
court battle with the typographers' union, which previously held life-time
employment contracts.
The one union that has been least willing to yield to Mr Zuckerman's request
for freedom to hire and fire editorial staff has been the Newspaper Guild.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris expects 20% gain
for 1992
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PHILIP Morris, the US tobacco and food company, yesterday told analysts that
it expected to report a 20 per cent increase in earnings per share for 1992,
when its unveils year-end results.
Mr Hans Storr, the chief financial officer, said the earnings figure would
stand at about Dollars 5.45 a share. He added that recent retail sales
trends for Marlboro had been encouraging, and noted the recent narrowing of
price differences between discount and premium brands.
When Philip Morris reported third-quarter figures, it disclosed the domestic
cigarette shipments had fallen slightly in the three-month period, and
predicted a larger dip in the final quarter.
This reinforced worries on Wall Street that the growing discount cigarette
sector was proving a threat to premium brands, which include Morris's
profitable Marlboro.
This week's furore over a report from the US Environmental Protection Agency
on the dangers of passive smoking, has hit Philip Morris shares, but
yesterday's profit forecast seemed to reassure the stock market. The tobacco
company's stock added Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 73 1/4 , in early trading.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Another trial for Bank Bumiputra
 -A look at the Malaysian bank's attempts to still old ghosts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has earned many plaudits for
his government's privatisation programme.
Lumbering state behemoths, like the telecommunications and electricity
utilities, have been transformed into efficient, market-orientated
enterprises, and the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange has grown into the biggest
in south-east Asia by market capitalisation.
But an exception to this privatisation success story is Bank Bumiputra,
Malaysia's second-biggest financial institution, with assets of MDollars
35bn (USDollars 14bn). One of the country's largest state enterprises, it is
also one of the most troubled.
The bank recently announced a 73 per cent fall in net profits to MDollars
22.7m for the year to March 31 1992. Twice in the past 10 years the state
has had to rescue it. Although Bank Bumiputra insists its finances are
sound, another government bail-out has not been ruled out.
A new management team has been appointed, while talk two years ago of a
listing has been quietly forgotten.
The recent appearance in a Hong Kong court of a rather frail, tired-looking
61-year-old man has re-focused attention on the bank's affairs.
Mr Lorrain Osman, a Malaysian citizen and former chairman of Bumiputra
Malaysia Finance (BMF), a subsidiary of Bank Bumiputra, is facing 39 fraud
and corruption charges relating to USDollars 800m in loans made by BMF to
the Hong Kong-based Carrian Group in the 1970s and early 1980s.
The BMF/Carrian affair shook the financial fabric of Hong Kong and ranks as
Malaysia's biggest banking disaster. Bank Bumiputra continues to be haunted
by the events of 10 years ago.
The Osman trial, when it finally occurs, will be watched with interest in
Malaysia. He was arrested in London in 1985 but extradited to Hong Kong only
late last year. He has insisted he was the victim of a cover-up at the
highest levels of the Malaysian government.
Opposition politicians in Malaysia say Bank Bumiputra, now owned by the
Ministry of Finance, is still used as a cash cow by leading government
figures, particularly those associated with Dr Mahathir's United Malays
National Organisation (Umno), the dominant political party.
Bumiputra, a Malay word meaning 'son of the soil', refers to the country's
majority Malay population. Wary of the economic power of the country's
minority Chinese community, the Malay-dominated government set up Bank
Bumiputra in 1965 'to remedy the lack of capital among the Bumiputras . . .
to encourage them to undertake new enterprises to accelerate development and
increase the wealth of the country'.
The main question in the BMF/Carrian affair is how a bank set up to aid the
Malay community came to lend so much, so fast, to Hong Kong-based Chinese
speculators.
Carrian Holdings, a previously unknown group, shot to prominence with a
series of multi-million dollar deals during a Hong Kong property boom of the
early 1980s. Mr George Tan, Carrian's enigmatic chairman, seemed to have
money to burn.
BMF was one of Carrian's main backers. When the Hong Kong property bubble
burst in 1982, Carrian could not pay debts of more than USDollars 1bn. Many
banks were burned. So were thousands of investors. In 1983, Mr Tan was
arrested on corruption charges.
In 1985, a Malaysian government report said BMF executives had entered into
an intricate series of deals with Mr Tan.
The report hinted at high-level Malaysian official backing for some of the
loans to Carrian. Warnings by the Malaysian central bank about BMF's lending
policies were apparently ignored. 'There might not have been Carrian without
Bumiputra Malaysia Finance,' said the report.
At least one murder has been linked to the affair. In 1983, an auditor sent
from Kuala Lumpur to investigate BMF was found strangled in Hong Kong. The
next year, a lawyer who had dealt with various Carrian companies was found
in a Hong Kong swimming pool with a concrete manhole cover tied round his
neck.
When Carrian collapsed, BMF had accumulated loan losses of MDollars 2.25bn.
These losses were passed on to Bank Bumiputra. In 1984, Petronas, the
Malaysian state oil company, was pressured into rescuing the bank by taking
a 90 per cent stake for MDollars 2.5bn. In 1989, Petronas had to make
another MDollars 982m cash injection after loan losses on the Malaysian
property market.
In early 1991, Petronas sold Bank Bumiputra to the Finance Ministry for an
undisclosed sum. Bankers in Malaysia, including some who had worked with
Bank Bumiputra, say it continues to be dogged by a number of shaky loans,
some made many years ago.
Bankers also feel that a fresh start cannot be made until the events of 10
years ago are explained. Bank Bumiputra still faces a court case in the US
in which it accused of conspiring to defraud Carrian creditors and minority
shareholders - a charge it denies.
In this case Mr Osman, who at one stage served as an economic adviser to the
Malaysian prime minister, should supply some answers to the tangled affairs
of Bank Bumiputra and spark some interesting political recriminations.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner issues Dollars 1bn
debenture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment company, yesterday
launched a Dollars 1bn debenture offer designed to reduce the burden of the
group's outstanding Dollars 6.5bn of preferred stock.
The Dollars 1bn offer is part of Time Warner's effort to work through its
heavy debt load, a result of the company's formation following the merger
agreement in 1989 between Time and Warner.
The company, which last year made strides toward rescheduling its bank debt,
recently indicated it may sell up to Dollars 3bn of assets over the next two
or three years as part of the move to strengthen its balance sheet.
Net proceeds of the debenture issue, which mature in 2013 and carry a coupon
of 9.125 per cent, would be used to repurchase or redeem preferred stock.
The preferred stock, which in 1991 cost Time Warner Dollars 579m in dividend
payments, was issued as a result of the merger agreement between Time and
Warner. The dividends have plunged Time Warner into a bottom-line loss in
spite of strong operating earnings from its music, film, publishing and
cable television divisions.
In the first nine months of 1992 it made Dollars 926m of operating income,
but its debt servicing reduced net profits to just Dollars 18m and its loss
after payment dividends on preferred stock was Dollars 449m.
The offer, scheduled to close on January 19, is being underwritten by
Merrill Lynch, BT Securities Corporation and JP Morgan Securities.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Akzo, Allied-Signal in European
carpet venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, is to transfer a majority stake in its
lossmaking nylon carpet fibre business to a joint venture which it will form
with Allied-Signal of the US. This will give the US company its first
production facility in Europe.
The companies gave no financial details but said the joint venture would
make investments to modernise Akzo's carpet fibre factory in the Dutch town
of Emmen, which will form the heart of the venture. The two partners signed
a letter of intent on the deal yesterday and expect to complete it by
mid-1993.
Allied-Signal, which is building a polyester carpet fibre factory in
northern France, exports Dollars 25m in carpet fibres per year to Europe.
Akzo's carpet fibre business, which now employs 350 after a bout of
job-cutting, is estimated to have annual sales of Dollars 75m.
The focus of Akzo's carpet fibre business is commercial - applications in
carpets for hospitals, airports and office buildings. Allied-Signal's
strength is the residential market.
Allied-Signal said because of overcapacity in nylon carpets, it made sense
for it to invest in existing capacity rather than adding new capacity.
Separately, Mr Aarnout Loudon, Akzo's chairman, said in a new year address
to staff that Akzo had met its forecast that 1992 net profit before
extraordinary items would show a rise over 1991. But in the first six months
of 1993, it would 'be difficult to hold earnings at the 1992 level'.

FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Hagen leaves Nedlloyd board and
cuts stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEDLLOYD, the Dutch trans-port group, said yesterday that Mr Torstein Hagen,
the Norwegian investor, had resigned his seat on the company's supervisory
board and withdrawn his request for an extraordinary shareholders' meeting
to discuss radical changes to the way the board is elected.
Mr Hagen, who was admitted to the board in October after a long battle, also
announced that he had sold a 5 per cent stake in Nedlloyd, reducing his
holding to less than 10 per cent. He had promised that he would resign his
seat as soon as the shareholding fell below 15 per cent, he said.
Mr Hagen angered his fellow board members in December when he called for the
board to be elected by shareholders.
Supervisory boards in the Netherlands are self-perpetuating and nominate
their own members, providing an in-built form of protection from unwanted
takeovers.
However, in a partial recognition of Mr Hagen's self-styled crusade for
shareholder rights, Nedlloyd said that 'when filling the vacancy that has
arisen, special attention will be paid to candidates brought forward by
shareholders.' It added that 'both parties have expressed the wish for a
positive relationship'.
Mr Hagen is facing more difficult financial conditions. This was underscored
yesterday by a statement from Oslobanken, a small Oslo-based bank, that DNO,
a company controlled by Mr Hagen, had pledged 53.8 per cent of its shares as
security for a loan which the bank provided for Marine Investment, one of
his main investment vehicles.
Last month, Mr Hagen was forced to dispose of his DNO subsidiary, DNO Olje,
for NKr235m (Dollars 33.7m), far below his original asking price. The assets
were acquired by Saga Petroleum.

DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, is to seek an additional 800 to 1,000 job
cuts in 1993 as part of its continuing cost-cutting and reorganisation
drive, writes Ronald van de Krol.
The company, which has reduced its workforce by nearly 2,000 to around
23,000 in recent months, said that some of the fresh job losses might
involve compulsory redundancies unless the unions agreed to proposals on
early retirement and outplacement schemes.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: The doctor's painful loss of a sick patient
 -A look at the failure of another quoted company north of the border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS always painful for a company doctor to lose a patient, but the
collapse of Lilley is a particularly bitter blow to Sir Lewis Roberston, who
has chaired the group since 1986.
The dismal significance of the failure of yet another of Scotland's
diminishing number of large quoted companies is not lost on the 70-year-old
Scot, who since retiring as the first chief executive of the Scottish
Development Agency in 1981 has been a leading figure in the commercial
establishment north and south of the border.
In spite of Lilley's alarming level of debt and heavy provisions for
property writedowns, Sir Lewis insists that a restructuring package
finalised before Christmas was feasible.
The plan provided for the subscription of new equity, the elimination of the
group's exposure to property developments and property joint ventures,
planned sales of the group's principal housebuilding and plant-hire
businesses and trading operations in the US, and a partial debt to equity
conversion by the banks.
The restructuring was supported by the three main institutional investors -
Scottish Amicable, M&amp;G and BZW - who spoke for nearly 30 per cent of the
equity, and the group's Spanish partners, Entrecanales and Cuibertas, who
own 21.5 per cent.
Four of the six banks in the group's Pounds 45m loan syndicate agreed - the
Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Banque Indosuez - but
the refusal of Clydesdale Bank and Hill Samuel to inject any new money made
receivership inevitable.
Hill Samuel said: 'We agreed the rescue package, but were not willing to
commit additional funds. We didn't want to increase our exposure, given the
sudden deterioration in their property books.'
No comment could be obtained from Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based bank
taken over by the National Australia Bank in 1987.
Sir Lewis, who declined to give details of the bank negotiations, said: 'I
want to avoid hurling bricks amongst the banks, but what bothers me is the
need for unanimity.'
Under the so-called London Rules, most lending agreements contain covenants
requiring a unanimous agreement of the banks to make any substantial changes
in the loan terms.
Sale Tilney, the mini-conglomerate which went into receivership last week,
did so after just one small foreign bank declined to agree to a financial
restructuring, although the Bank of England is understood to have
intervened.
Sir Lewis pointed out that Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of
England, recently urged banks to adopt new procedures when writing loan
covenants. Mr Kent said the requirement of a unanimous vote for a
reconstruction to go ahead should be replaced with a qualified majority.
Sir Lewis's disappointment at Lilley's receivership will not be lessened by
the knowledge that he saved the group from a serious financial crisis in
1986 resulting from its US and other overseas operations. Mr Robertson (as
he then was), a veteran of a number of corporate rescues, became chairman,
bringing in Mr Joe Barber as chief executive who drastically pruned Lilley's
overseas activities.
In 1988 Mr Barber was replaced as chief executive by Mr Bob Rankin, a former
chief executive of the construction group Balfour Beatty, in a management
buy-in which brought in Pounds 27.4m in new equity.
The idea behind the buy-in was to expand Lilley through joint ventures with
property developers including London and Edinburgh Trust, which is
subscribed to the share placing.
Sir Lewis said yesterday that, with hindsight, this deal had caused Lilley
to move towards property development and housebuilding at the wrong time in
the cycle. In 1989 Lilley launched an abortive bid for Tilbury, leaving the
Scottish company with a 29 per cent stake in the construction group, which
it later sold at a loss.
Last year Lilley unwound its involvement with London &amp; Edinburgh Trust and
Mr Rankin resigned in October. Mr James Hann joined the group as deputy
chairman and helped put together the rescue package which went to the banks.
Sir Lewis said the previous policies were pursued too long against a
changing economic background, but accepts that as chairman he shares the
responsibility: 'It was a board decision. It was necessary to give Mr Rankin
a run on the basis which he was appointed, which brought in Pounds 28m, a
substantial amount of money.'
Since most of Lilley's problems concern its remaining property portfolio and
balance sheet, there is a good chance of finding buyers for the group's core
contracting and construction activities, which have work in hand worth
Pounds 100m.

ABBEY, the Dublin-based housebuilder and plant hirer, maintained its
improvement with a pre-tax profit of IPounds 501,000 (Pounds 522,000) for
the six months to October 31, against IPounds 367,000 last time.
The result was struck after a IPounds 1m provision, mainly reflecting a
revaluation of a recently let investment property. At the trading level,
there was a turnround from losses of IPounds 81,000 to IPounds 729,000
profits.
Interest received added IPounds 772,000 (IPounds 448,000). The company said
it still retained a sizeable cash position.
Earnings per share were 0.43p (0.63p). There is no interim dividend, but the
company hopes to be able to recommend payment of a final.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Burton aims for more responsive
organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS THAN a year after taking over, Burton's chief executive has grasped the
nettle and announced sweeping structural changes throughout the group's 10
trading divisions.
Mr John Hoerner, the American who took over last February, launched a
rationalisation programme involving the loss of nearly 2,000 full-time jobs,
but the creation of up to 3,000 part-time ones.
The programme - the result of a six-month review carried out in conjunction
with PA Consulting Group - is likely to cost between Pounds 10m and Pounds
15m, but achieve savings of a similar size this year.
Analysts welcomed the changes. Mr Nick Hawkins, of Kleinwort Benson, said
they were long overdue. 'The new management is taking an organisation which
is heavily bureaucratic and making it more responsive to the market place.
'The important thing is that after dealing with operational issues last year
they are now tackling the structural issues.'
The group stressed that the programme was not just about redundancies, but
included other organisational changes necessary to cut staff and management
costs. These were higher as a percentage of turnover than in comparable
retail companies.
Staff employed in head office functions are to be reduced by 933 - roughly
one in four.
The shake-up includes the resignation of two board members. Mr Geoff Powell
is replaced as operations director by Mr Graham White, and Mr John Davies is
replaced as company secretary by Mr Ian Jackman. Burton said this reflected
the 'top-to-bottom' nature of the changes.
Mr Hoerner said buying and merchandising operations would be split into two
separate functions. Reports that were previously prepared on an ad hoc basis
would be computerised and standardised.
Savings would also be achieved in the finance sector through computerisation
and centralising accounting functions into centres in Leeds and Taunton.
In the shops, about 1,000 full-time jobs will be lost. But up to 3,000
part-time jobs will be created.
Mr Hoerner said most savings would be achieved by scheduling employees to
work at the busiest shopping times, achieving better service at a lower
percentage cost.
Workers reducing their hours from, say, 36 to 28 a week, would receive a
higher hourly rate that would go some way towards compensating them for the
lost time.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: EIO faces opposition to St Andrew Trust bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECCLESIASTICAL Insurance Office is facing institutional opposition to its
bid for St Andrew Trust, an investment trust specialising in smaller
companies. The first closing date for the offer is today.
The bid is a technical one designed to give EIO more than 50, and less than
75 per cent of the trust. EIO needs a majority stake to comply with new
European Community guidelines on capital ade quacy.
But some institutions are unhappy that EIO is not paying a premium for
control.
The bid is for 93 per cent of formula asset value (in essence, the net asset
value minus expenses). If EIO gains majority control of the trust, it will
be able to equity account the assets and thus, in theory, will not mind if
the trust falls to a discount.
Minority shareholders will have no power to alter the situation.
'If EIO wins control, it won't have the same interest as the rest of the
shareholders,' said Mr Jonathan Woolf, deputy chairman of British American
Film Holdings. BAFH owns 2 per cent of the trust and will not be accepting
the offer. 'I would be surprised if anyone did,' said Mr Woolf.
Another major institutional holder has already rejected the bid.
The independent directors of St Andrew have already said that they are not
recommending the offer, although shareholders should give it 'careful
consideration.'

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Contrasting debt figure for Evode
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW information on Evode passed to Wassall, which is bidding Pounds 113.2m
for the chemicals and plastics company, shows that Evode's net borrowings
will average more than Pounds 40m during the four quarters of this year.
This contrasts with the latest available information released by Evode
earlier this month when it published its balance sheet for the financial
year ended October 3 1992.
Divestments and a 17 per cent reduction in working capital reduced Evode's
net borrowings from Pounds 46.1m to Pounds 28.5m, giving gearing of 50 per
cent. The group also generated cash of Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 16.4m).
Wassall, the mini-conglomerate, received the details on Evode's borrowings
because under the rules of the Takeover Code it is entitled to ask for any
new information given to other potential bidders.
Laporte, the UK's second biggest quoted chemicals group, is at an advanced
stage of discussions with Evode about making a recommended bid and had
already received the new information on Evode's debt.
Mr David Winterbottom, Evode's chief executive, dismissed the new
information about his company's borrowings.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Woolcombers and Illingworth fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOLCOMBERS GROUP, the wool processing company which abandoned plans for a
stock market flotation in September, yesterday reported interim pre-tax
profits 26 per cent lower at Pounds 1.16m.
Turnover for the six months to end-September slipped to Pounds 11.9m (Pounds
12.12m), although this was more than accounted for by the discontinuation of
businesses with a turnover of Pounds 834,000.
The results show Pounds 229,000 of extraordinary costs associated with both
the postponed flotation and a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into
the wool scouring (cleaning) market. Earnings per share fell from 3.46p to
2.55p.
The company said its proposed flotation was abandoned 'due to volatile
currency and equity market conditions'. Mr Alan Lewis, the chairman, said he
hoped to try again to float in the early autumn of this year.
Woolcombers is part of the Illingworth Morris Group, quoted on the stock
exchange until 1989 when it was taken private by Mr Lewis.
Illingworth Morris, owner of the Crombie brand name, also published its
interim results yesterday.
A doubling of the interest charge contributed to a fall in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 905,000 for the six months to September 30.
Turnover rose slightly to Pounds 25.75m (Pounds 24.2m). There were
extraordinary charges of Pounds 434,000 associated with the postponed
flotation and MMC inquiry.
Both companies said 'general economic conditions have continued to be
difficult' and that 'the second half of the year is expected to show
improved profitability'.
Cloth sales of Illingworth held up 'notwithstanding the competitive pressure
on pricing' and market share improved. At Woolcombers, sales of
lanolin-based products increased by 10 per cent, but sales of synthetic
fibres fell 31 per cent.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lower margins leave Reg Vardy at Pounds
1.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WINTER's revival in car sales came too late to help interim results at
Reg Vardy. The Sunderland-based motor group reported an 8 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 1.86m in the half-year to
October 31, writes Matthew Curtin.
The shares fell 8p to close at 125p.
Turnover improved from Pounds 95.6m to Pounds 108m, but shrinking margins
led to a fall in operating profits from Pounds 2.74m to Pounds 2.3m.
Earnings per share were 3.01p, against 4.22p, on a larger number of shares
in issue. The interim dividend is held at 1.3p.
Mr Peter Vardy, chairman, said attempts by some manufacturers to stimulate
demand by dropping prices had not been entirely successful.
However, he added lower interest rates and the removal of the special car
tax, which came too late to revive sales in 1992, would stimulate demand
this year.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ralston Trust board proposes liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Ralston Investment Trust is proposing a voluntary liquidation
of the company.
The net asset value of the trust, which is 75 per cent-owned by Caledonia
Investments, itself controlled by the Cayzer family, declined by 30.4 per
cent between its inception in October 1988 and November 30 1992.
Mr Peter Buckley, Caledonia's chief executive, said: 'It's been a bit
disappointing. But the formation of Ralston coincided with the start of a
period during which the securities of smaller UK companies have
underperformed the market.'
In contrast with other investment trust restructurings shareholders, other
than Caledonia Investments, will receive cash distributions equal to their
proportional entitlements to the net assets of the company.
A second interim dividend of 1.1p per share will be paid on January 29.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the proposals at an extraordinary
general meeting on February 1.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Xenova raises Pounds 19.7m via US share
placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
XENOVA, a British bio-technology group, has raised Dollars 30.3m (Pounds
19.7m) through a private placing of shares in the US at Dollars 5 a share.
It is thought to be the largest financing arranged by a European
biotechnology group in the US.
Mr Louis Nisbet, chief executive officer of Xenova, said the main reason for
going to the US for funds was that the US market had a good history of
financing young hi-tec businesses in the health care field.
The financing, arranged by Paine Webber, brings to a total of Dollars 56.4m
the equity Xenova has raised since its foundation in 1987. Existing
investors, who include venture capital groups, institutional investors and
Genentech, the Californian biotechnology company, took 15 per cent of the
new shares being sold. Genentech's total investment in Xenova so far is
Dollars 10.3m.
Mr Nisbet said the group was looking to a public listing in the next one to
two years. This could be in the US or possibly jointly in the US and UK.
Xenova's specialisation is developing small molecule drugs derived from
natural products such as fungi and plants, found anywhere between 'Amazonia
and our backyard' Mr Nisbet said.
At present it has drugs in pre-clinical trials and hopes to start human
trials in the next 18 to 24 months. The drugs are aimed at three categories
of disease: cancer, immune-inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis, and cardiovascular disease.
It is collaborating with a number of large drug companies, but has retained
substantial marketing rights, particularly in Europe.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Capel survey suggests shares may be
underrated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORECAST of 6 per cent per annum dividend growth in the medium term
suggests that UK equities are currently under-rated, says James Capel.
However, in its report, entitled Dividend Growth - the Key to
Outperformance, the stockbroker goes on to say that if dividends rise by
less than 5.5 per cent on average, the stock market could fall.
The report, based on a survey of 200 leading companies and institutional
investors, produced a consensus that UK dividends would grow by 6 per cent a
year in the 1990s.
The survey also suggested that investors were more concerned about
companies' available cash when they set dividends, while companies were more
concerned with prospective earnings growth.
Dividend growth, the broker says, is the basis for long-term returns from
equities, with equity market returns tracking the rise in dividends over the
last 70 years. However, in the 1980s dividend growth in real terms ran ahead
of economic growth, a trend reversed by the onset of recession.
Although a number of dividend cuts have been made, the level of earnings
cover for dividends has dropped.
For the level of cover to return to the longer-term average of 2.3, and
dividends to rise by 6 per cent, earnings would have to grow by 9.5 per cent
a year to 1999.
James Capel forecasts dividend cuts from 19 companies, but says 24 should
see growth above 12 per cent and 87, including 27 utilities, should achieve
between 6 and 12 per cent growth.

<TEXT>
Druck Holdings, the Leicester-based manufacturer of electronic pressure
measuring devices, yesterday reported lower first-half sales and profits but
said orders were up, writes Paul Taylor.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 fell by 27 per cent from
Pounds 2.41m to Pounds 1.75m on turnover which slipped by 6 per cent to
Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 13.5m). Earnings per share fell to 18p (23.3p), however
the interim dividend is being maintained at 3.4p.
Mr John Salmon, chairman, said: 'Due to a number of factors the first half
results are down on the same period last year, but I am confident that this
deficit will be partially, if not wholly, reversed by the end of the full
year.'
He said orders were 6 per cent ahead for the first six months and had moved
further ahead since September. Orders from Germany, which had lagged other
markets, had increased considerably, as had export orders.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lilley debts total more than Pounds 80m -
Receivers hope to save jobs by selling most of collapsed group's businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS hope to preserve jobs by selling most of the businesses in Lilley,
the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group which has collapsed
with debts of more than Pounds 80m, of which Pounds 20m are off-balance
sheet.
Price Waterhouse, who were appointed as receivers yesterday, said management
forecasts suggested that losses caused mainly by property writedowns and
losses on disposals would have reduced the group's net assets from Pounds
47m at the end of 1991 to net liabilities of Pounds 13m by the end of 1992.
At yesterday's share suspension price of 7 3/4 p, Lilley had a market
capitalisation of only Pounds 16m.
There was also an urgent need for cash, which management had concluded might
amount to as much as Pounds 16m. It was this requirement for new funds which
proved too much for two of Lilley's six banks - Clydesdale Bank, the
Glasgow-based subsidiary of National Australia Bank, and Hill Samuel, the
merchant bank subsidiary of TSB.
Mr Iain Bennet, of Price Waterhouse, said Lilley's financial difficulties
stemmed from a very substantial loss of value on a number of major property
developments which were acquired at the height of the property boom.
He added: 'The group's divisions comprise many well-known and respected
construction businesses. We very much hope that these can be saved through
successful receivership sales. With this in mind we have already contacted a
number of potential purchasers.'
Lilley employs a total of 2,800 people, more than half of them in Scotland.
There are 1,200 on staff, with the rest working on sites throughout the UK.
Robison and Davidson, a building and construction subsidiary in Dumfries,
which employs 750 of the group's total, is not in receivership. The
receivers appointed to its parent are hopeful of selling the shares of the
company within the next few weeks.
Lilley also owns Harrison Western Corporation, based in Denver, Colorado,
which owns and leases five tunnel-boring machines. This company is not in
receivership or subject to any other insolvency procedure.
Lilley (Construction) Services Ltd. of Long Stratton, Norfolk, has no
connection with the Lilley group and is unaffected by the receivership.

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Savills returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVILLS returned to profitability in the half year to October 31 as the
property group drove down costs and expanded its lucrative commercial
property consultancy and valuation services.
The pre-tax profit emerged at Pounds 163,000 compared with losses of Pounds
762,000, on a small increase in turnover from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 11.9m.
Mr George Inge, chairman, said a Pounds 826,000 reduction in costs was
chiefly responsible for the improved results. Staff numbers were cut again
to about 530 - down by nearly 30 per cent from 740 in 1989.
Commercial turnover rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 5.1m, of which nearly two
thirds came from consultancy and valuation work.
Savills was advising the administrators of Canary Wharf, but its City agency
had performed well throughout central London with good demand for quality
accommodation.
The residential sector was 'dull', although there were signs that the London
market had picked up in November and December, with interest from overseas
buyers spurred by the sterling devaluation in September.
Cash reserves stood at Pounds 2.5m at the end of October, against Pounds
1.9m six months earlier. The group was benefiting from the absorption of a
Pounds 1.6m property write-off last year and the continued depreciation of
office equipment bought after its listing in 1988.
'I am quietly confident the improvement in our results is sustainable in the
current six months, but we have seen false dawns before,' Mr Inge said.
Earnings per share were 0.03p (1.7p losses).

FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rights cash boost for Independent Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT INSURANCE Group, the medium-sized general insurer which is
planning a stock market flotation in the spring, has completed a Pounds 10m
rights issue.
Mr Robert McCracken, director and general manager, said the new money gave
the group 'a stronger capital base to go forward in 1993,' taking advantage
of recent rises in premium rates in the UK market.
Independent, the former UK operations of Allstate of the US, has grown
rapidly since it was bought in 1987 by the New Scotland Group. New Scotland
was formed for the deal by Scottish businessmen and backed by institutional
investors including 3i, Foreign &amp; Colonial and County NatWest.
Mr McCracken said the company was strong in the provincial commercial
property and the London insurance market, which together provide 64 per cent
of its premium income. It had diversified away from its original focus on
personal lines insurance.
But following recent growth in annual premium income to more than Pounds
100m, solvency - which measures net assets as a percentage of premium income
 -had fallen to about 40 per cent, and fresh capital was needed to support
further expansion.
Investors have been encouraged by the group's strong profitability, bucking
the industry trend.
Independent made profits of Pounds 8.5m in 1990 and Pounds 2.1m in 1991,
when the UK general insurance industry lost more than Pounds 2bn.
During the first nine months of 1992 Independent's pre-tax profits rose from
Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 3.8m, with premiums up from Pounds 70m to Pounds 100m.
Mr McCracken said the company's success was due to the fact that its
underwriting policy was tighter than many of its competitors. It had also
been more selective about the brokers with which it traded on a regular
basis.
Independent's management and some staff own about 8 per cent of the company.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Old reliable deliversa disappointing result: Why with-profit
endowments are paying out less
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE with-profits endowment, the UK's most venerable savings vehicle which is
used to repay most mortgages, has had a bad week.
Actuaries determine the payouts policyholders receive by adding a complex
series of bonuses on to a basic sum assured. These bonuses are reviewed at
the beginning of each year, and the offices which have announced payouts so
far have revealed a sharply downward trend.
Policies taken out 25 years ago - the most common timespan for a mortgage
endowment - are paying out slightly less than similar policies last year,
but returns on shorter-term policies have come down heavily. For a 10-year
policy, Sun Alliance, the composite insurer, is paying out almost 15 per
cent less than it would have done in January last year.
A few months ago, before the markets' post-Black Wednesday rally, this might
not have seemed embarrassing. But the rise in equity and bond markets by the
end of 1992 should have been enough to deliver an 18 per cent return for the
average life fund. Set in this context, cuts in payout are difficult for the
life companies' marketeers to justify.
Investment returns are probably the most important factor behind
with-profits payouts. Unfortunately for the life offices, several other
factors have applied a strong downward pressure.
The root of the problem lies in the arcane with-profits bonus system.
Endowments started as pure life assurance policies, which promised to pay
out a fixed sum assured at the end of a certain fixed term if the
policyholder survived. But over time the policies developed until they were
almost a pure investment vehicle.
Two forms of bonus are added to the sum assured, at the actuary's
discretion, to deliver a final maturity value. Annual or reversionary
bonuses are added each year, and once declared cannot be taken away from the
value of the policy. On maturity, a terminal bonus can also be added.
This terminal bonus now typically makes up as much as 60 per cent of
pay-outs for 25-year policies. This allows greater investment freedom, as
reversionary bonuses need to be backed up by fixed interest securities.
The attraction for investors is that the peaks and troughs of the market can
be 'smoothed'. A bad year need not be reflected in that year's payout, if
actuaries are confident that markets will recover, and past gains locked in.
That smoothing process is, at least temporarily, out of kilter. Payouts
continued to rise after the stock market crash of 1987, as actuaries assumed
that the lower investment returns were only a blip. People whose policies
matured between 1988 and 1991 therefore have reason to be happy, as they
were paid money the policies had not earned.
For 10-year policies, actuaries believe that payouts are exceeding their
policies' share of the fund's assets by 10 per cent or more. This cannot
continue indefinitely, so payouts must continue to fall, barring improved
investment returns. Life companies are expecting lower returns for the rest
of this decade.
Figures for this are controversial, but according to Philip Scott, general
manager (finance) for Norwich Union, his company's payout last year on a
typical 10-year policy exceeded asset share by slightly more than 20 per
cent. This year that figure is closer to 10 per cent, and the aim is to
bring payouts into line with asset share by 1995.
A company's freedom to cushion blows like this is limited by the volume of
business which it has to handle. Several companies did heavy business in
10-year policies during 1983, on the back of schemes linked to mortgage
interest tax relief. Norwich Union expects to pay twice as many maturities
in 1993 than it did in 1992. The 1984 budget removed income tax relief on
life assurance premiums, but the decision did not take effect for some
months. This allowed the companies to make heavy sales as investors rushed
to take advantage of the tax concession while it lasted. That means more
onerous liabilities for 1994.
These heavy commitments lie behind Sun Alliance's steep cut in 10-year
payouts. With maturities of Pounds 175m next year, it could no longer afford
to 'play games' with its bonuses, according to a spokesman, and the company
now says that its payouts are directly in line with asset share.
Life offices also have to contend with the weakening of their financial
position following the heavy distribution costs most of them incurred
acquiring tied agents and direct sales forces in the wake of the Financial
Services Act of 1986. These costs came out of reserves, and free asset
ratios, measuring the percentage excess of assets over liabilities, tumbled,
further limiting their room for manoeuvre.
Insurance companies can strengthen their position by announcing lower
reversionary bonuses - and all the companies to have announced so far this
year have done this. Some, such as Guardian Royal Exchange, have abandoned
the conventional with-profits policy altogether, and offer a 'unitised
with-profits' policy to new investors. In these policies, investors buy
units, and bonuses are added to these units. Strength is less important
because the life company does not need to put aside reserves to meet the sum
assured at the beginning of the policy.
High terminal bonuses have also boxed companies in. These offered greater
flexibility but with such a large proportion of the payout undecided until a
policy matured, final values have become more volatile. This is unattractive
for investors. Guardian Royal Exchange yesterday emphasised this by
announcing that it was not paying any terminal bonus at all on its 10-year
policies - the first time it failed to do so since 1968.
Does this mean the end for the with-profits policy? Certainly, the
reassuring belief that the policies would increase in value indefinitely has
taken a knock. Even so, annualised yields remain comfortably in excess of
inflation - for example, Commercial Union's policies yield 13.2 per cent
over 10 years, and 13.3 per cent for 25 years.
But the fault-lines which these bonus announcements have revealed need to be
addressed. The traditionally discreet UK life industry may need to be more
informative to its investors. Few are likely to understand why payouts have
gone down after the market went up.

FT  08 JAN 93 / TSB plans unit to manage its bad debt portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Group, the bank whose employees are today striking nationally for the
first time since 1968, is planning to establish a separate business unit to
manage its portfolio of bad debts, bankers said yesterday.
The group, which like all big UK banks has been suffering from unprecedented
losses on lending, could give details of the new corporate structure next
week, when it announces its results for the year to October 31.
The reasons for the reorganisation are twofold:
To try to demonstrate to shareholders and depositors that its main banking
businesses are sound and profitable, if they are viewed separately from the
bad lending of the 1980s;
To help recover some of the money outstanding in poor quality loans, which
may total more than Pounds 3bn, by giving this task to a team in the new
business unit.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman, warned earlier this week that the
second half of the financial year had been unexpectedly bad. Losses on the
bank's property loans are thought to have been particularly severe. It has
an exposure to Lilley, the construction group which went into receivership
on Wednesday.
At the end of last April, TSB was carrying provisions in its balance sheet
of Pounds 1bn to cover the risk of loan losses. The charge for loan losses
in the past year, including additions to provisions and write-offs, may have
been as much as Pounds 430m, according to Mr Rod Barrett, of brokers Goldman
Sachs. TSB refused to comment on the forecast. Mr Barrett also estimated
that TSB's pre-tax profits last year were Pounds 80m, compared with a Pounds
47m loss in 1991 and a 1990 profit of Pounds 312m.
TSB also considered spinning off its poor quality loans into a separate 'bad
bank'. Shares in this bad bank would have been issued to TSB shareholders
but such a demerger would have resulted in excessive costs, so is unlikely.
TSB has been hurt by poor loans made by two subsidiaries - Hill Samuel, its
corporate lending bank, and Mortgage Express, which sold mortgages through
brokers rather than through TSB branches.
The share price of TSB surged yesterday from 152p to 158p, as 11m shares
were traded. Brokers speculated that TSB would be the target of a takeover
bid.
Those TSB employees which are members of the banking union Bifu are striking
because of plans to cut staff numbers.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Escada to sell a subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ESCADA, the German fashion house favoured by Norma Major, Virginia Bottomley
and Cilla Black, is struggling to stave off mounting financial difficulties.
Yesterday, it announced that it will sell one of its subsidiaries to prop up
its balance sheet.
It also reported an operating loss for the 12 months to the end of October
1992, and the erosion of a third of shareholders' equity.
The shares fell by 10 per cent yesterday and the day before. They closed at
DM108 last night, a drop of 87 per cent from last year's high of DM855.
Escada said that once it had completed the sale of the unnamed subsidiary,
its balance sheet would be be as strong as at the end of the previous
financial year.
The company was one of Germany's 1980s success stories. Founded in 1976 by
Mrs Margaretha Ley and her husband, it was enthusiastically received when it
came to the stock market in 1986.
Acquisitions helped it double its sales between 1989 and 1991, to DM1.36bn
(Pounds 550m) a year. Mrs Ley fell ill, however, and died in June 1992.
Since then, the company has lost investors' favour.
The company yesterday blamed the recession for its problems, adding that it
had been particularly surprised by the severity of the recession in Germany
last autumn.
Escada's three traditional labels - Escada, Laurel and Crisca - have
attracted affluent women customers, willing to pay Pounds 800 for a suit.
Its success in this market was highlighted last year by the occasion on
which Mrs Norma Major and Mrs Virginia Bottomley, wore identical pink Escada
suits. Other devotees in the UK are Cilla Black and Esther Rantzen.
The company has had difficulty in integrating recent acquisitions,
especially Schneberger and Kemper, bought in 1987 and 1988 respectively.
These purchases took Escada into a lower segment of the market than its core
business.
The company said that in spite of the recession, sales for the year to
October 1992 would probably hold up at the same level as the previous year.
Profits in 1991 fell 23 per cent to DM45.1m.

FT  08 JAN 93 / PM studies scheme for long-term jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHEME to provide temporary work for up to 250,000 of Britain's long-term
unemployed is being studied by the government.
The initiative would offer participants an allowance in addition to existing
benefits. It could be compulsory for those who have been unemployed for a
period not yet specified but probably 18 months or two years.
Options are being studied by the prime minister's Number 10 policy unit with
the assistance of Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary.
Long-term unemployment, which is defined as for one year or more, stands at
a 4 1/2 -year high at just under 1m.
Mr John Major, who is discussing domestic policy this weekend at Chequers,
is concerned that unemployment could emerge as a serious political problem.
In a recent interview, he said fear of unemployment was a brake on recovery.
Mr Major's personal involvement is seen as critical to the success of a
scheme requiring private sector employers to be persuaded to offer large
numbers of temporary work places. He would need to take a lead in urging
bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry, the major employers'
organisation, to become involved.
Any new scheme, which might be announced in the March budget, could involve
about 250,000 people a year, which would be far more than the 30,000-place
Employment Action, a two-year-old voluntary temporary work programme that
has failed to attract a full complement of unemployed. That is why
compulsion is one of the options being studied. It is unlikely the programme
would begin before the end of the year.
Critics may claim that the plan mirrors 'workfare' programmes in some US
states, whereby claimants are required to work in order to receive benefit.
Mr Peter Ashby, of Full Employment UK, an employment consultancy, said the
scheme should be seen as 'a genuine move towards a new long-term safety net
for the long-term unemployed'.
The government wants to bind the long-term unemployed more closely into the
world of work. Other measures to be introduced this year include requiring
those unemployed for more than 12 months to attend week-long workshops to
draw up 'personal action plans'.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Council to contract out finance functions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OXFORDSHIRE has become the first English county council to contract out a
large part of the work of its finance department in what will be seen as a
landmark for the government's competitive tendering policy.
CSL Group, which claims to be the largest provider of managed services to
the public sector, won the Pounds 6m contract against three competitors.
The contract requires it to take on the 50 existing staff, on comparable
conditions, and was approved by almost all the employees concerned.
With local authority compulsory competitive tendering moving from
blue-collar to white-collar services, the market for such contracts is
expanding rapidly. Other counties are set to follow Oxfordshire's lead.
The contract represents more than a third of the value of the county's
finance function.
Under competitive tendering, the government will require councils to put at
least 25 per cent of the sector out to tender, with the proportion rising to
90 per cent for construction-related services.
The Oxfordshire contract, covering payroll processing, pensions
administration and revenue collection among other functions, comes into
effect in April.
Oxfordshire anticipates savings of some Pounds 750,000 over the five-year
contract period.
Mr Chris Gray, county treasurer, said: 'Local government reorganisation,
education reform and devolution of county services will mean that central
services generally and financial services in particular will find it
increasingly difficult to operate cost effectively.'
He added: 'This seemed a sensible step to us. The staff were keen not to be
fragmented, and we have been careful to ensure that they are kept together
and based in Oxford.'
Mr Mike Croften, a managing director of CSL, said: 'Local authorities are
becoming enablers; they will increasingly be looking to companies like us to
manage services for them.'
A number of district councils have already contracted out some of the work
of their finance departments.
East Cambridgeshire led the way, contracting to Capita, the managed services
group. South Oxfordshire has gone further than any, contracting out its
annual budget-making function.

FT  08 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK life assurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest round of bonus cuts on with-profits policies was overdue. Big
annual bonuses paid out in the lean years - particularly 1990 - were always
difficult to justify. Even allowing for healthy investment returns last
year, many life company balance sheets were creaking under the strain. That
was bad for new business. A free asset ratio in low single figures - even if
above the legal minimum - is hardly an encouragement to independent
financial advisers to sell a company's products.
A weak balance sheet equally demands a more cautious investment strategy.
That is bad for investment returns. At the time of its much-vaunted switch
from equities to bonds in 1991, Norwich Union had a free asset ratio of 6
per cent. The company has since made a Pounds 100m profit on the trade. It
might legitimately argue that the decision was prompted by virtue as well as
necessity. But policyholders would surely prefer their investment managers
to have a free hand.
Even so, anyone who bought a with-profits policy last year must find it
galling to have their reversionary bonus cut to make up for past mistakes.
There could be more bad news to come. Following the latest chop, a 10-year
with-profits policy from Norwich Union is expected to yield around 13 per
cent after tax. The company expects to earn little more than 12 per cent on
investments over the same period - before both tax and expenses. Unless the
industry is over-compensating for past optimism, one can only conclude
bonuses are on a downward trend.

FT  08 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are so many cross-winds buffeting British Airways at present that it
is difficult to tell where the shares should head. BA's shares have dipped 7
per cent this week. Embarrassing as it is, though, the news about its dirty
tricks campaign against Virgin is unlikely to make matters worse for its
share price.
More important are its poor passenger figures, especially since BAA, the
airport operator, cast further doubt on the outlook yesterday. Unfortunately
for BA, the continuing tightness in the market coincides with a significant
increase in capacity. Either BA leaves seats empty, or the airline chops
prices to sell those seats. Both ways profits suffer. Such pressures,
combined with BA's hectic round of acquisitions and hefty aircraft
replacement programme, must only increase the temptations for a cash call.
BA's long-term attractions remain intact. The airline's rigorous
cost-cutting campaign and high operational gearing make BA a classic
recovery play. Sterling's devaluation will help this year as about 60 per
cent of BA's revenues are earned in foreign currencies while the majority of
costs are in sterling. BA is also well-placed to benefit from the sporadic
liberalisation of international routes. The short-term difficulties are
daunting, though. It may be a while before the market peers through the
ominous tidings.

FT  08 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Burton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To many it will be a shock that Burton can have got this far through the
recession with 930-odd surplus staff at head office. But at least the
management responsible for such excess has gone, and the new chief
executive, Mr John Hoerner, has tackled costs decisively. The head office
cuts should flow through to profits directly, while the store changes will
provide the flexibility to improve service and possibly sales.
Cutting costs is one thing, handling Burton's badly needed strategic change
is another. Until recently group companies vied with each other as much as
their high street competitors, and the group has always been less than the
sum of its parts. Mr Hoerner may be trying to change that, but Burton has 10
shop brands and thousands of disparate outlets. Fostering corporate
co-operation from the high street through distribution to buying and
suppliers is a complex task. Such a cultural revolution is hard enough in a
simple business: at Burton the odds on success must be long indeed.
That may not stop the shares recovering further. With Pounds 1.7bn of sales
and minimal profits, any economic growth and cost reductions will have a
dramatic effect on earnings. At present the market wants to back that view.
But fashion retailing means keeping up with rapidly changing trends, which
costs money the company can ill-afford. Mr Hoerner may wish to capitalise on
market enthusiasm, and buy the elbow room he needs, with a well-timed rights
issue.

<TEXT>
It would have been too much to expect the Bundesbank to cut its official
rates at yesterday's council meeting. Still, its 15 basis point cut in the
money market repurchase rate provides food for thought. Although the
domestic economic background is one of unremitting gloom, the Bundesbank is
not yet particularly alarmed. It would prefer to delay official rate cuts
until money growth, the budget and wages are under better control. One must
assume the main impulse for the move came from the foreign exchange market.
If this is the case, perhaps the market should take it seriously.
The negative interpretation is that this was the least the Bundesbank could
do after France raised short-term money rates by a full 2 points earlier in
the week. The Bundesbank has tried similar tricks before only to disappoint
later. It still has the awkward task of imposing monetary discipline at home
while living up to its ERM responsibilities. Doubtless it would be less
inclined to accommodate if D-Mark weakness against the dollar threatened
more inflation.
Yet even the most hawkish Bundesbanker would have to admit that the economic
situation is likely to require official rate cuts soon, probably indeed
before the French elections in March. By paving the ground now, the central
bank is not only indicating that the fate of the franc really does matter.
It is building anticipation of more cuts to come. On both scores, the wisdom
of speculating against the franc has become more questionable. There are
hurdles to come. Ireland's position is looking increasingly difficult, and
might leave the franc exposed. But assuming the Bundesbank follows through,
the balance of probability has swung in favour of France holding its ERM
parity intact.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Virgin Atlantic victory expected: BA likely to pay
substantial damages to rival airline in libel settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIRGIN ATLANTIC, the independent British airline run by Mr Richard Branson,
is expected to emerge next week as the victor in its 'dirty tricks' libel
battle with British Airways.
High Court action is due to begin on Monday but it is understood that, under
the terms of an agreement between the two airlines, to be announced in
court, BA will pay substantial damages and several million pounds in costs
to Virgin Atlantic and Mr Branson.
The settlement is likely to be among the highest yet agreed in a libel case
in Britain. BA is also expected to apologise for any harm inflicted on the
reputation of Virgin Atlantic and Mr Branson.
Virgin decided to start legal action last March against BA and Lord King,
its chairman, following allegations that BA had run a commercially damaging
campaign against it. It was alleged to involve the poaching of customers and
unfounded rumours about the airline's financial health.
BA dismissed the allegations as totally without foundation and Lord King
accused Mr Branson of seeking publicity for himself and his airline.
Both airlines yesterday refused to comment on the proceedings, beyond saying
they would both be represented in court on Monday before Mr Justice Drake.
BA executives are believed to have negotiated a settlement to avoid a
potentially long, expensive court case and to limit any damage to its
reputation at a time when it is seeking to become a global airline.
The airline is renewing negotiations in an attempt to resurrect its plans to
take a stake in USAir, the American carrier, which collapsed last month.
One BA executive yesterday emphasised that BA management had not been aware
of any unacceptable tactics against Virgin. He added: 'We underestimated Mr
Branson.'
BA is not expected to make any statement on Monday beyond that read out in
court but Mr Branson is planning to elaborate on details of alleged BA
abuses.
He may also seek assurances from BA that similar action is not repeated and
might consider pursuing fresh action against BA to compensate for any
commercial damage arising from BA's alleged activities.
Virgin is also hoping the outcome will help in its negotiations to secure
additional flights to and from Heathrow.
The airline has claimed that the campaign against it was being led by Mr
Brian Basham, a public relations consultant retained by BA, who compiled a
dossier on Virgin's activities.
Yesterday, Mr Basham said he conducted 'a perfectly decent and
straightforward campaign'. He wanted to ensure that any BA apology did not
defame him and he had appealed to the judge to make sure this did not
happen.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Just the job for the future: UK employment is increasingly
part-time, and based in the expanding service sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago, Barbara gave up her full-time teaching job and left London
for the south coast where she now juggles three part-time jobs, one with a
charity and two in further education. Harry lost his job as finance director
of a medium-sized company when it was taken over 18 months ago and now has a
semi-permanent consultancy job and a small business.
Barbara and Harry represent the future of employment: part-time,
service-sector and knowledge-based work. By the year 2000, 1.2m mainly
full-time jobs in UK manufacturing and utilities are expected to go. Over
the same period nearly 2m jobs in services will be created, but more than
half of them will be part-time - a trend underlined by yesterday's
announcement from the Burton Group that 1,000 full-time jobs were being
converted into 3,000 part-time ones.
Barbara and Harry may also represent the coming of age of the 'portfolio'
job - two or three smaller jobs, or projects, which together make up the
hours and pay of one 'normal' job. Until now the portfolio job has been the
preserve of writers and artists at one end of the scale and the fate of
low-income, working mothers at the other.
But as white-collar and executive unemployment rises and companies continue
to contract out all but their essential 'core' jobs, the portfolio is likely
to become unavoidable for many and may even be chosen by a minority.
'The portfolio job is not going to become the norm, but it will become a
growing necessity for people who cannot return to traditional employment and
may even appeal to some people with sought-after skills,' says Professor
Robert Lindley of the Institute for Employment Research. Currently about 1m
people in the UK have more than one job.
Even the majority, who continue in traditional full-time jobs will, if they
are ambitious, have 'multiple careers', spanning an increasing number of
employers.
'Until recently it was deemed essential to have at least three significant
career changes in one's lifetime in order to secure jobs with good pay,
quality training and promotion prospects. Now the threshold has risen to
four, with every likelihood of a further increase in this decade,' says jobs
consultant Professor Amin Rajan of the City University Business School.
Where will the ambitious, and the less ambitious, find jobs in the next few
years? The main source of new part-time jobs will be in the services
required by a growing number of elderly people and the continued growth of
the leisure industry, while most of the new full-time jobs will be in
business services.
The Institute of Employment Research has calculated that during the 1990s
public services, primarily healthcare, will create 676,000 jobs;
miscellaneous services, covering sports, theatres and personal services such
as childcare will create 650,000; business services, including banking, law,
accountancy, software and consultancy, will create 416,000 jobs; and hotels
and catering 243,000.
Some occupations, such as software experts, will grow even in sectors that
are contracting, like manufacturing, and others will contract even in
growing service sectors. According to the latest report of the Institute of
Careers Guidance on jobs in the 1990s, about 65 per cent of the routine
tasks performed in fast-growing professions such as accountancy, law,
medicine, risk assessment and fund management could be automated. So in
those sectors there will be growing demand for information technology
experts, who will be installing and maintaining computer equipment, and
fewer opportunities for secretaries or clerks, who risk being automated out
of existence.
In a breakdown of changes in occupational employment between 1990 and 2000
the institute expects three main groups to shrink and six to grow. The
biggest drop, of 14 per cent, is expected in blue-collar, shop-floor jobs.
The biggest rise, of 21 per cent, is found in professional occupations
including scientists, health and education professionals, finance
specialists, lawyers, tax experts and marketing specialists. But an 11 per
cent rise is also predicted for personal and protective services including
childcare, security, travel and catering.
The overall conclusion is that white-collar, service jobs will continue to
replace blue-collar, manufacturing jobs. But the new white-collar jobs will
be split into two types. On the one hand will be the high value-added jobs
in areas such as finance, law, medicine and technology, taken by 'knowledge
workers' - defined as highly qualified individuals skilled at
problem-solving and able to shoulder varied responsibilities. They are now
one in three of the workforce, according to Prof Rajan, and by 2000 he
expects them to account for two out of every five jobs.
On the other hand are the low value-added, low-skilled jobs in services such
as hotels, personal services and dry-cleaning. Overall, those low-skilled
jobs will represent a declining proportion of an increasingly skilled
workforce. But the growing number of older people will require an increase
in both the high and low-skill service jobs - from surgeons to cleaners.
Other trends, such as environmentalism, will stimulate demand for particular
specialists, for example in waste management. But where jobs are created
also depends on the relative success of different sectors and companies over
the next few years. In the short-term Prof Rajan expects a net loss of
130,000 UK jobs as a result of the cost-cutting prompted by the European
Community's single market, but believes that several industries will buck
that trend: manufacturing - in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electrical plant,
telecommunications equipment and brewing; and services - in air transport,
data processing, banking, insurance, law, accountancy and management
consultancy.
In the very short term many sectors set for employment expansion are likely
to see some recession-induced cuts. The Manpower Survey of Employment
Prospects for the first quarter of 1993 found a net 36 per cent of banking
employers expecting to cut staff, worse than any other sector apart from
local government. In hotel and catering a net 32 per cent expected staff
losses, in community services 20 per cent and in healthcare 9 per cent.
Unemployment, which will soon touch 3m, should start to decline by the
mid-1990s. By then the population of working age in the UK will have stopped
growing but, owing to an increase in female participation from 65 per cent
to 70 per cent, the number of people actually working, or seeking work, will
continue rising slightly.
The workforce of the future, therefore, will not only be more part-time,
service-sector based, knowledge-driven and elderly, but also be more female,
meaning a much faster drop in female unemployment compared with male.
According to the institute, women will take almost all of the jobs created
between now and 2000, although many will suffer 'downward occupational
mobility' when they return to work after child-rearing. Women are also
expected to break into higher-status full-time jobs in much larger numbers
than now, further stimulating demand for childcare and other forms of
personal service. In the legal profession women currently account for 50 per
cent of new entrants and in accountancy the figure is 30 per cent.
Almost all observers predict strong growth in self-employment (now about 15
per cent) and in the number of employees working in small and medium-sized
companies. More dramatically, Sir John Harvey-Jones, former ICI boss and now
company doctor, believes that nearly half of all factories in western Europe
will close by 2000 as a result of competitive rationalisation in the wake of
the EC's single market and freer world trade. If that is true, the model
worker of the late 1990s will be a part-time, female insolvency lawyer.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Targeting Saddam
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT SADDAM Hussein of Iraq has once again staged a confrontation with
the west, by moving anti-aircraft missiles into the no-fly zone imposed by
the US, Britain and France in southern Iraq last August. The western allies
have responded with the firmness he should by now have learnt to expect. Why
does Mr Saddam keep on doing it?
The idea that he is testing the incoming US administration seems
implausible, given that it is not yet in office. More probably he calculates
that any confrontation with the west, even one that ends in yet another
humiliation for him, will rebound to his political advantage. He certainly
knows that other Arab states are unhappy about the west's self-imposed role
as military protector of certain categories of the Iraqi population, sharing
his view that the operation to save the Kurds in 1991, and the no-fly zones
subsequently proclaimed in both north and south, go beyond anything
authorised by UN Security Council resolutions.
So he may well prefer to focus attention on that issue, at a time when food
prices in Baghdad are skyrocketing, when there are rumours of unrest in the
armed forces, and when the Kurds in the north have joined Arab opposition
forces in exile to form an Iraqi National Congress, with offices in London.
The question western leaders should ask themselves is not whether to respond
to Mr Saddam's provocations, for they have little choice. Rather they should
ask whether it is sensible to leave him the initiative. They have justified
their intervention in both north and south by reference to Resolution 688,
which demanded that Iraq put an end to repression, called for a dialogue 'to
ensure that the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens are
respected', and insisted on 'immediate access by international humanitarian
organisations to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq'.
Manifestly those demands have not been met.
Repression in the south continues, with virtually no access for any
international organisations. In the north the Kurds are denied energy and
fuel supplies in an exceptionally harsh winter.
The west should take the initiative. It should turn the southern no-fly zone
into a safe haven - obliging Mr Saddam to remove not only his anti-aircraft
batteries but also his repressive forces, as he has done in the north; and
it should strengthen the safe haven in the north by ordering him to remove
his troops from Faida, where they are blocking the main supply route from
Turkey into Iraqi Kurdistan.
The longer-term objective must be to make the whole country a 'safe haven'
by making it impossible for Mr Saddam to continue his repressive regime. If
President George Bush will go down in history as the liberator of Kuwait, it
is within the grasp of his successor to become the liberator of Iraq.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Labour's future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT BEFORE time, British Labour politicians have begun to argue openly among
themselves. This is good news. We need the possibility of an alternative
government, and unless Labour knocks itself into shape, we will not have
one. The party has lost four general elections in a row. Its research
suggests that it made few converts among wavering Conservatives last year,
in spite of the continuing recession and the disarray into which Mr John
Major and his cabinet fell. Constituency changes will tilt the electoral
odds further against Labour before it has another chance to fight. There is
little reason to believe that it will not lose again in 1996.
Such a defeat could precipitate a gradual dissolution of the party. Finding
a means of avoiding that grim fate is a matter of some urgency. The present
debate is between those who demand root-and-branch change - the modernisers
 -and those who insist on emphasising the party's working-class roots - the
traditionalists. The modernisers, led by Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair,
see merit in learning from President-elect Bill Clinton's victory in the US;
the traditionalists, spoken for by Mr John Prescott, reject this. They seek
to protect what they call the 'heart and soul of the Labour party', whose
nature is defined by its historic links with the trade unions.
The traditionalists' stance has the merit of clarity, but little else. It is
no use going back to an electorate with a socialist, or statist, or
impossibly egalitarian manifesto if that is repeatedly rejected. That is the
central lesson of Mr Clinton's campaign. He sought to convince Reagan
Democrats and aspiring middle-class voters that, while he wished to give the
poor a hand-up, his was not a party for losers alone. American political
methods and ideas cannot easily be transplanted, but that does not mean that
there is nothing to be learnt from November's victory. Traditional Labour
has become identified in the electorate's mind with the worst-off third of
society. Working-class Thatcherites know that. Mr Brown and Mr Blair would
seek to broaden Labour's appeal among the middle third, where elections are
won and lost.
Labour will get nowhere unless it convinces itself, and in consequence the
voters, that it is eagerly responsive to middle-class concerns. All else is
detail. Some new strategies may be proposed by the various committees set up
by the party's leader, Mr John Smith. One is studying links with the trade
unions; another, 'social justice'; a third, electoral reform. The best
answers are clear. Labour needs a divorce from the unions. Welfare benefits
will have to be means-tested if taxation is not to be impossibly high.
Constitutional reform is an attractive policy for Labour. Yet none of this
will be on offer unless Mr Smith leads the party in the modernisers'
direction, and all of it will be insufficient unless he contrives to win the
trust of affluent or would-be affluent voters.

FT  08 JAN 93 / The private sector that is driving China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir ALEC CAIRNCROSS and Dr CYRIL ZHIREN LIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What type of economic regime prevails in China today? Nobody seems to be
quite sure. The language in which the government describes itself,
articulates policy and looks to the past and future is that of a communist
country. Yet it is obviously not the same kind of system as has come to such
a sudden end in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. It is not just
that it has proved more durable and successful, growing at 9 per cent a year
in the 1980s. It has adopted many features of a market economy that used to
be thought inconsistent with communism.
In particular, it is in the process of developing a capital market when many
economists a generation ago would have argued that a defining characteristic
of communism is the absence - indeed the suppression - of a capital market.
In the labour market one finds the same apparent contradictions. A basic
tenet of communism was that no one could sell the product of another man's
labour. Yet Chinese farmers in the countryside and private entrepreneurs in
the cities are now hiring workers, albeit with state controls on the numbers
of labourers an undertaking may hire. As the problem of unemployment emerges
with reform of state-owned enterprises, these controls on private employment
are increasingly being relaxed.
This is in fact part of the single biggest change in the Chinese economy
over the past decade: the rapid growth of small-scale township and village
enterprises (TVEs) producing consumer goods both for the domestic market and
for export. Whatever the ownership arrangement (nominally collective
ownership), their management is almost entirely independent of government.
The scale of change is evident in all directions: a meteoric exports
increase has converted China into a major surplus country in the past
decade, with former state monopolies facing growing market competition and
declining profit margins.
Between 1979 and 1989 the state had become a much smaller factor in the
economy. Its share of total industrial output fell from 77 percent to 55 per
cent. In terms of GDP the state, as distinct from the private and collective
sectors, accounted for some 35 per cent of the output of goods and services
 -just above the government share in several European countries.
Another change is the devolution of control over financial resources from
the centre to the provinces, enterprises and, above all, to households,
whose savings have increased dramatically. Where central government had
formerly to generate forced savings through low wages, price control and
compulsory profit remittances in order to finance new infrastructure and
heavy industry, now it is unable to balance its budget and has to borrow to
cover its deficit.
The state has allowed local governments to retain larger funds without any
assurance that they will take over responsibility for meeting the economy's
rapidly growing capital requirements, which are increasingly met from
household savings that now represent 70 per cent of total savings.
A country that relies on household savings to provide 70 per cent of the
finance of new investment is very different from one in which taxation is
the source of nearly all new capital accumulation. True, the banks are
mostly government-owned and can direct capital in directions officially
determined. But they have obligations to depositors who are free to withdraw
funds. So there may be hesitancy, as there would be in the west, over
converting liquid funds into long-term investments in real assets.
The government has sought to overcome this problem by issuing three to
five-year bonds, but this may not meet the requirements of savers who are
liable to encounter sudden needs to realise their funds and would welcome a
bond market for that purpose. Other savers may be disposed to seek more
risky and remunerative investments in the form of shares. And here, too,
there is evidence of an eagerness of Chinese savers to participate in a
newly developing market.
The increasing use of a market system has been evident in the opening of the
economy to trade. At the end of the 1980s the annual trade surplus was
running at USDollars 8bn and China's foreign exchange reserves had grown by
early 1992 to USDollars 46bn - not far short of its foreign debt of
USDollars 53bn. One of the most autarchic countries in the world changed
into one of the most open, with exports as high as 17 per cent of GDP.
China, with a more limited reform agenda than the Commonwealth of
Independent States and eastern Europe, has alone among any former or current
centrally planned economy successfully transformed a shortage economy into
one of excess aggregate supply. In a number of respects, its economic system
in its structure and use of markets is much more favourable than that of the
CIS and eastern Europe to a successful transition to a full market system -
if and when the political decision is made to do so.

Why are certain staff of TV's Channel 4 referring to its formidable director
of programmes Liz Forgan as 'Birt In A Skirt'?
Although she remains uncharacteristically silent, growing numbers of
colleagues believe that new BBC director-general John Birt will announce
next week that the former Guardian women's page editor is joining him in a
senior role. It could even be, some say, as managing director of
broadcasting.
If so, crusty Baron Wyatt of Weeford will no doubt become even crustier. He
lately told the House of Lords that 'this fearsome lady 'of staunch
left-wing opinions was not fit to be in charge of any programmes anywhere'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However much Britain's industrialists may talk about exercising leadership,
they've scarcely been at the forefront in accepting pay-restraint. But with
public-sector staff limited to rises of 1.5 per cent this year, one high
executive may be about to set a spectacular example.
He is Mike Bett who, although earning around Pounds 250,000 as deputy
chairman of British Telecom, is front-runner to take over the government's
Acas conciliation service where he'd be paid only Pounds 60,000 or so. The
reason is that, after the departure of current Acas chairman Sir Douglas
Smith who's on over Pounds 80,000, the post is to be pegged back to a lower
civil service rank.
Bett, now 57 and one of the UK's most experienced industrial relations
experts, has seen his BT role whittled down by the transfer of duties to
other senior executives.
But if he makes the move, the pay-cut should be somewhat compensated for by
the knighthood traditionally conferred on the Acas chief - especially if he
gets it ahead of BT chairman Iain Vallance.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brussels officials' dreams of monetary and political union won't be any
sweeter for the impending loss of their 'Teddy Bear' - alias Jurgen Trumpf,
Germany's ambassador to the European Community for the past three years.
Having earned the nickname because of his softly-spoken modesty, the
61-year-old is returning home to be state secretary in the Bonn foreign
ministry.
While his replacement in Brussels isn't yet named, Trumpf will certainly be
a hard man to follow. He was much admired by diplomats for his knowledge and
negotiating skills, particularly in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty.
A true believer in European union, he was dismayed by the recent decline in
public support for the enterprise. He also fretted about his own country's
attitude to the community. Perhaps that's why he once said he could imagine
an EC without Germany, but not without France.

How does a small island community of 22,000 people cope with not one but two

Surprisingly well, it seems. Although the supply of hire cars was soon
exhausted, and Radio Shetland had to appeal for spare beds, demand has not
massively exceeded the 1,880 rooms available on the main island. Meanwhile,

Burton shares have been wonderful performers these past three months, but
there must be a danger that in the efforts to purge the ancien regime, the

The latest shake-out leaves the average length of service of the executive
directors - including the chief executive who has been on the board since
1987 - at under three years. Of the two executives resigning, one had been
on the board seven months and the other 18 months.
Contrast this with Marks &amp; Spencer, where the latest annual report puts the

Alfred Kahn, 75-year-old vieillard terrible of the aviation industry, was
hunting for scalps again yesterday.
Best known for initiating US airline deregulation when boss of the Civil
Aeronautics Board under Jimmy Carter, he was speaking at a Brussels bash
organised by British Airways to promote its views on air liberalisation.
Economist Kahn delivered two public punches, denouncing BA's bid for a stake
in USAir which failed just before Christmas as 'anti-competitive'. He then
likened the reasoning of Air France chairman Bernard Attali to that of Fidel
Castro.
Observer gathers that Kahn is also leading the charge to ensure Bill
Clinton's administration stays liberal on the aviation front. A lifetime
Democrat, Kahn is exercised that one Paul Dempsey, professor of law at
Denver University, may be in line for a key assistant secretary's job in the
transportation department.
Dempsey, snarls Kahn, has written much about the need to re-regulate and
would be 'a complete catastrophe. His work is biased and is based on
irresponsible use of statistics. He deserves no professional respect'.
Kahn's preferred candidate for the job is Dan Kaspar, a faculty member at
Harvard who, like Dempsey, has done a period at the CAB. Students of the
battle for Clinton's economic soul should watch this space.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Dollar dangers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US ECONOMY which President-elect Bill Clinton is about to inherit looks
radically better than the one Mr George Bush was required to defend last
autumn. Mr Clinton can afford a sigh of relief. But only a small sigh.
Economic recovery does not mean that America's medium-term economic problems
will go away. They mean, instead, that the medium-term will arrive faster
than expected.
The US recovery solves one dilemma for Mr Clinton. Proponents of an
expansionary fiscal package now look dangerously out of date. Confidence has
revived since November's election, economic growth has returned and memories
of September's sickly dollar have been erased by its recent strong
appreciation in European markets. Even a modest fiscal boost now looks
risky, especially as the administration has at last admitted that the
federal budget deficit will be much larger than previously thought.
Yet a robust US recovery will quickly lead to deficit problems of a
different sort. The revival in US consumer spending, alongside the deepening
depressions in Europe and Japan, have already led to a deterioration in the
US trade deficit. The short-term outlook does not suggest anything other
than more of the same. There is little prospect of a revival in European
consumer demand in the next six months while lower European interest rates,
when they finally arrive, will push the dollar still higher against
America's European competitors.
The likely rise in the US bilateral trade deficit with Japan could turn out
to be politically explosive for Mr Clinton. Japanese consumer demand for US
imports is likely to remain subdued this year. While the US dollar has
barely appreciated from its September low against the yen  - the soaring
dollar is, in fact, a collapsing D-Mark - the economic fundamentals of
competitiveness and trade performance have required a much larger yen
appreciation against the dollar than has occurred in recent years.
If Mr Clinton had appointed macroeconomists to senior posts in his
administration, they would be explaining to him that America's unbalanced
fiscal and monetary policies are largely to blame for the US's unbalanced
trade performance. The danger is that his current economic advisers might
substitute Japan-bashing protectionism for intellectual rigour.
Yet what the US needs is co-operation with Japan, not confrontation. The
best way to achieve a depreciation of the dollar against the yen is through
complementary fiscal measures in Washington and Tokyo. A return to US
budgetary health, combined with an offsetting reduction in Japan's budget
surplus, should help to reduce US long-term interest rates and push up the
value of the yen. Only then can Mr Clinton hope to sustain a healthy
recovery, suppress his party's protectionist instincts and mollify the fifth
of the US electorate who were persuaded by Mr Ross Perot's demands for
austerity.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Report of its death an exaggeration: The conservative
revolution could still have further to turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looking back, global changes in political mood seem too obvious to miss. At
least two shifts stand out since 1945. The first, in the early 1960s, marked
the end of the grey, cautious postwar years and the coming of age of a
confident, socially progressive generation. But the high spirits soon
fizzled out amid the economic troubles of the 1970s, creating space for the
conservative revolution of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.
It is tempting to argue that a third shift is now under way. In the US, the
election of Mr Bill Clinton has drawn a line under 12 years of conservative
presidential rule. Against the odds, Mr John Major has clung on to power in
Britain, but his government seems in almost as much disarray as the defeated
US Republicans. It seems an age since the late 1980s when a triumphant Mrs
Thatcher, promising to go 'on and on and on', launched a blitzkrieg of
market-oriented reforms, affecting just about all parts of society, from
healthcare and education to law.
The 'economic miracles' of the 1980s seem equally distant. In much of the
industrialised world, the most obvious legacies of free-market economics are
deflating asset prices and excessive levels of debt. In the UK, a government
that once proclaimed the importance of fiscal probity finds itself running
some of the biggest deficits in British history.
In the US, the changes are just as striking. The Reagan/ Bush 'supply-side'
theory that tax cuts would revitalise the economy without creating deficits
is discredited. Mr Clinton's 'people first' economics, involving large
public investments in areas such as education and training, healthcare and
infrastructure, is rapidly becoming the new orthodoxy. The affluent are
bracing themselves for higher taxes.
It would be too hasty, however, to conclude that the conservative revolution
is over. The 1980s appear to have changed attitudes, perhaps for good, in
many countries. Asked to cite a viable alternative to free-market
capitalism, democratic socialists used to shout 'Sweden', which for decades
had grown rapidly despite the claims on resources of a large and intrusive
state.
But Sweden is now trying to move into the European main stream by curbing
welfare spending, cutting tax rates and subjecting the government sector to
market disciplines. And if you look beyond the industrialised world, there
seems no question that free-market doctrines are gaining ground.
There is a fierce debate about how best to reform the economies of eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union. But the goals are less often questioned:
few doubt the importance of establishing a functioning market system in
which industry responds to the demands of consumers rather than vice versa.
The collapse of state communism, moreover, has helped undermine confidence
in large bureaucracies everywhere.
A less celebrated, but nearly as startling, transformation is under way in
the third world, where many countries, disillusioned with the
socialist-style economic planning introduced after the second world war, are
relying more heavily on market-oriented policies. If the economic reforms
gathering momentum in China are taken into account, there seems no question
that the world as a whole is moving in a free-market direction.
It seems doubtful, moreover, whether the ideological backsliding in rich
countries will be maintained. Led by Mr Clinton, the US is likely to fill
holes in its social safety net. But the US will be merely catching up with
reforms introduced decades ago elsewhere, not blazing a new trail.
Meanwhile, at least two kinds of economic and social change may increase the
role of the market:
Fears in the 1950s and 1960s that giant monopolistic companies would
gradually dominate all areas of economic life seem unfounded. In many
sectors - personal computers, for example - rapid technological change
appears to favour smaller, more flexible companies. Efficient production,
moreover, may no longer require the physical presence of huge numbers of
workers. In knowledge-intensive industries, 'telecommuting' from home is
becoming practicable for increasing numbers of employees.
Putting these trends together, it seems at least possible that the era of
corporate giants offering lifetime employment is drawing to a close. Yet if
more people work in small companies or as independent contractors, the
proportion of economic activity governed by market transactions, rather than
bureaucratic interaction within large organisations, is likely to rise.
Steady growth in per capita incomes may result in higher demand for private
social services as people grow increasingly frustrated with the standardised
services offered by the state. Indeed there may be a natural 'life cycle'
for the public sector. Following industrialisation, the state grows rapidly
to provide poor and middle-class families with services - such as education,
healthcare and pensions - that they cannot afford to buy privately and which
were previously the preserve of a rich elite.
But as a rising proportion of the population achieves the prosperity once
enjoyed by the few, more families become capable of meeting their needs
privately. Demand for private education, for example, is likely to continue
growing. But a withering of the state as the bulk of the population becomes
affluent (by past standards) is not inevitable. It may maintain market share
by improving the quality and diversity of its services; and, to the extent
that deprivation reflects differences in the relative, rather than absolute,
incomes of rich and poor, it will retain a role in reducing inequality.
The sheer youth of the conservative revolution is a further reason for
doubting its early demise. The socialist reaction against market capitalism
became a powerful political force toward the end of the 19th century. But
socialism was not a one or two-decade wonder. The arguments for greater
social and economic equality and more extensive government regulation of
(and substitution for) free enterprise dominated political debate throughout
the world for the next 70 odd years.
Policies, however, adjusted fairly slowly - and with some setbacks. In
Britain, the more radical ideas advocated by Fabian socialists at the turn
of the century - such as the need for sweeping nationalisation of industry
and very high marginal tax rates - were not implemented until after the
second world war. But for many decades the direction of social change did
not seem in doubt; after 1945 even bastions of free enterprise, such as the
US, imposed top income tax rates of about 90 per cent.
The conservative revolution of the late 1970s could be merely an
interruption of this longer-term 'socialist' trend. But it seems more likely
that a natural limiting point was reached - in western democracies as well
as former communist countries. By the late 1970s, a case could be made in
most countries that big government and high taxes were beginning to exact a
price in terms of diminished personal incentives and reduced industrial
efficiency.
The world is thus probably now tacking back erratically to a revised (and
socially more responsible) version of the laisser-faire doctrines of the
19th century. Mr Clinton's victory and the Major government's descent into
fuzzy pragmatism are not inconsistent with these deeper forces. Both leaders
are less ideological than their predecessors, but neither is seeking a
return to the 1970s; the market-oriented reforms of the 1980s will mostly
stand.
The best analogy is perhaps with the 1950s when right- wingers such as
Dwight Eisenhower and Winston Churchill had to accommodate themselves to
their times; neither tried to reverse social reforms of the 1930s and 1940s.
We are thus still in a conservative era. But the 1990s are a decade of
consolidation; people are catching breath after the ideological tumult of
the 1980s. Yet if the pace of change in the past century is any guide, the
conservative revolution is still in its infancy. Do not be surprised if
ideas that seemed to die with the passing of the Reagan/Thatcher era
reappear in new - and more outrageous - guises within a few years. We have
not, by any means, heard the last from libertarians seeking to 'empower'
individuals by abolishing higher rates of tax, rolling back the welfare
state and purging the economy of wasteful subsidies.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Letter: Education for mature students too, not just an elite
of teenagers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALASTAIR THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While agreeing with much of your editorial on higher education policy
('University challenge', January 5), some comments seem not to appreciate
changes in the student population over the past decade.
The view that higher education is 'giving teenagers a first chance to live
away from home' ignores the fact that the majority of those enrolling on
courses are now classified by the Department of Education as mature
students, over the age of 21, most of whom will have contributed as
taxpayers towards the cost of their maintenance.
In addition, the decision to concentrate extra funding on 'further education
for 16-19-year-olds' fails to note that although most full-time students in
further education may be school-leavers, the majority of enrolments in most
colleges are from adults following part-time opportunities.
The establishment of a broader system of lifelong learning is envisaged in
the National Education and Training Targets, devised by the Confederation of
British Industry and endorsed by the TUC and government. Whether or not the
FT subscribes to this solution, your readers are not well-served by an
assessment of the problems facing further and higher education which sees
post-compulsory education as a finishing school for an elite cohort of
teenagers. Determining the relative contributions which individuals,
employers and the state should make towards meeting the costs of learning is
complex enough without concern about a 'right to study away from home',
which is increasingly irrelevant to adult learners.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Ukraine puts brakes on Start: Kiev might obstruct nuclear
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Bush put the finishing touches to his foreign policy legacy in Moscow
last weekend when he signed the Start 2 agreement with Boris Yeltsin. But
President-elect Bill Clinton may well wish his predecessor had taken the
time to visit Kiev.
For the unprecedented cuts in the world's nuclear arsenal agreed in Moscow
hinge on the decisions of a country which was overlooked by the summit -
Ukraine.
In addition to Russia, three republics - Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine -
still have nuclear weapons stationed on their territories. Kazakhstan has
already followed Russia's lead in ratifying the 1990 Start 1 treaty agreed
between the Soviet Union and the US, which promised cuts in both countries'
long-range nuclear missiles. Belarus can be expected to follow suit if
Ukraine complies. But the Ukrainian parliament is resisting ratification of
Start 1. And under the accord reached in Moscow, Start 2 cannot go into
effect until the previous treaty is ratified.
Moreover, in the view of western military specialists, Ukraine is the only
non-Russian republic with the capacity to become a nuclear power. It is home
to many of the factories used to develop the Soviet nuclear arms industry,
and the government in Kiev has won over the loyalty of most of the former
Soviet soldiers serving within Ukraine's borders. As a result, many of the
personnel guarding the 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles stationed on
its territory take orders from Kiev.
Thanks to the combination of military potential and political resistance,
Ukraine has suddenly emerged as the critical piece in the international
disarmament puzzle.
Resolving the issue of Ukraine's nuclear arms is complicated by the
divisions among the country's leaders. A vocal minority comprising Ukrainian
nationalists and ex-communist hardliners contends that nuclear weapons are
Ukraine's only guarantee against aggression from Russia.
It believes such safeguards are increasingly important, as relations between
the two countries have deteriorated following disputes over the division of
the Black Sea naval fleet and Ukraine's eastern border with Russia.
The Ukrainian ministries of defence and foreign affairs, by contrast,
continue to support removal of nuclear weapons. Marshal General Konstantin
Morozov, the liberal minister of defence, has repeatedly warned the
Ukrainian parliament that retaining the country's nuclear weapons would be
prohibitively expensive and technically complicated, and that they should be
removed in line with the Start 1 treaty. His views are supported by
President Leonid Kravchuk and Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma.
But removal of nuclear weapons requires the agreement of parliament, and
that will not be easy to win. Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, the influential chairman
of the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs, has said that the
legislature will not consider Start 1 until the country's economic reform
programme has been approved by parliament. Even then, ratification of the
treaty will face a long and difficult passage.
One reason is that Ukraine's fragmented legislature has begun to vote with
increasing autonomy and is less amenable to control from President Kravchuk.
But there is a second explanation. Having understood the strength of its
bargaining position, Ukraine is determined to get something in exchange for
surrendering its nuclear weapons. Its two principal desires are economic aid
and security guarantees.
The issue of economic aid is fairly straightforward. Ukraine is seeking
Dollars 1.5bn in aid from the west to offset the cost of dismantling the
missiles, and has hinted that a Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn fund to support the
Ukrainian currency would speed ratification. After November's announcement
of an economic reform programme by Mr Kuchma, western governments may be
more willing to supply such finance.
Security guarantees, however, are more contentious. Ideally, Ukraine would
like public pledges of western assistance in the event of Russian
aggression. Aware that they are unlikely to receive such pledges, Ukrainian
diplomats are proposing a compromise: that all nuclear powers, or at least
Russia and the US, guarantee that they will not attack Ukraine with nuclear
or conventional weapons.
To date, western governments have been dismissive of Ukraine's efforts to
create a special security arrangement, and have instead exerted pressure on
Kiev to ratify Start 1. Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of state, has
warned of a serious deterioration in bilateral relations if the treaty is
not ratified.
A year ago, when Ukraine was a fledgling state on the brink of independence,
a complete renunciation of nuclear weapons might have been won in exchange
for an earlier and more enthusiastic acceptance of Ukraine into the
international community.
Now, after receiving only grudging international recognition and no
substantial financial aid, Ukraine has adopted a tougher stance in
diplomatic negotiations. Pressure from the US to eliminate its nuclear
weapons has antagonised many Ukrainian politicians.
As a result, Mr Clinton, who will be responsible for the next round of
disarmament talks, may find the going much harder in Kiev than his
predecessor did in Moscow.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Letter: Clinton volunteer youth corps plan an example for
the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELISABETH HOODLESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report of President-elect Clinton's plan for a nationwide
circulation volunteer corps ('Citizens corps to the rescue', January 4)
raises the question: why not here too?
Never before has Britain more needed youthful energy to tackle community
care of the mentally ill and frail elderly; to assist health and social
workers, crime prevention officers and youth leaders.
At the same time we are wasting the energy and talents of more than 1m
under-25s through mass unemployment, and building an alienated underclass.
Also, student debt is so high that many talented teenagers are dropping out
or eschewing higher education.
An initiative which tackles four intractable problems at once deserves
urgent consideration. However, our fear is that the compartmentalised shape
of government cannot implement a solution to four different departments'
problems: community care (Department of Health); youth unemployment
(Department of Employment); crime (Home Office); and student debt
(Department of Education). Perhaps the First Lord of the Treasury should
act?

FT  08 JAN 93 / Letter: Separation of private and public medicine may be
answer in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Draper's views on the Tomlinson report ('Look to consultants for
NHS efficiency', January 5) are shared by most of those who have considered
its analysis and recommendations in any detail.
The crucial point is that primary care facilities in the capital are
desperately in need of upgrading, but this should be done on its own merits
and not be dependent on running down the hospital sector.
The views of general practitioners are particularly relevant here as they,
with patients, are supposed to be the main beneficiaries of Tomlinson. Their
response indicates that they reject the assumption that London is currently
overprovided with hospital beds, see the necessary improvement in general
practice as needing time as well as a lot of money, and think that by
revealing unmet need those improvements may increase rather than reduce the
requirement for hospital beds.
The latter part of Dr Draper's article gets on to less familiar ground with
his argument that consultants are the key factor in efficiency of hospital
bed usage, particularly the amount of time they actually spend on their NHS
commitments. Although this point has not hitherto received a great deal of
publicity in the non-medical press, there is no doubt that consultant
absence can lead to delay in discharge from both in-patient bed and
out-patient clinic.
The Kings Fund report that Greater London consultants earn more from private
work than from the NHS is even more startling when it is realised that about
half of all consultants are on whole-time contracts and are officially
limited to earning not more than 10 per cent of their NHS salary from
private medicine. There has been considerable movement in recent years
towards blurring the edges between private and NHS.
Perhaps Tomlinson (and Draper) have provided the stimulus to rethink this
and consider whether separation, at least in the capital, might not be more
appropriate and cost-effective.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Letter: BBC should give customers what they want with Radio
4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From P H BALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have heard that the BBC intends to stop broadcasting Radio 4 on long
wave.
There must be thousands of British expatriates like myself for whom Radio 4
is the main cultural link with Britain. To me Radio 4 is simply one of the
pleasures of life, and the idea of it being replaced by a continuous news
programme seems quite absurd.
We have quite enough of these already, including the BBC's own '648', Radio
Europe, and I cannot see anyone wanting to listen to the same items of news
being repeated endlessly (except in times of emergency like the Gulf war,
but then schedules can be rearranged anyway).
The BBC is supposed to be a public service which should give its customers
what they want. I, and by all accounts more than 90 per cent of listeners,
want Radio 4.
I should be grateful if you would use your influence to see that the BBC
abandons its plans for an unwanted new service and keeps Radio 4 on long
wave.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Arts: Korea squashed into a corridor - Susan Moore visits
the Samsung Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The V&amp;A's new Korean art gallery is little short of a slap in the face for
the culture it seeks to celebrate. First, the 'gallery' - a glorious
misnomer for what is, a section of corridor previously occupied by part of
the sculpture collection. This is the nub of the problem. The gallery is
heralded as 'the first permanent, comprehensive display in Korean art in
Britain', reflecting some 1500 years of Korean art and craft.
What we find are some 200 objects of wildly fluctuating quality presented in
a hotch-potch display. Is this crowd of exhibits, squeezed into a corridor
as if an embarrassing postscript to the Far Eastern collection, a fair
representation of the achievement and culture of the Korean people? I think
not.
A new Korean gallery was not at the top of the list of the museum's
priorities. It has an important but smallish collection of some 600 items,
notably ceramics, built up ad hoc after 1878. During the state visit to
Britain of the Korean President and his wife in 1989, the First Lady Kim
Ok-sook was disappointed by the low profile of Korean art in Britain and
asked whether the V&amp;A would be interested in a Korean gallery. Soon after,
the Korean conglomerate Samsung came forward to offer the museum Pounds
430,000 for the project. Looking around the Samsung Gallery of Korean Art,
it is difficult to see how the sponsor's money was spent.
Rather than allowing the strengths - and weaknesses - of the museum's
holdings to determine the nature of the display, the curators opted instead
for the bold historical sweep regardless of the lack of appropriate material
with which to flesh it out. Take the ceramics, which line the right wall of
the corridor. The first case, which claims to display Korean pottery 300-900
AD, fails to do justice to the abundance, diversity of shapes and skill of
the Silla potters and makes for an unpromising introduction. While the
collection does have some fine examples of 18th century white porcelain with
underglaze red decoration, these are outnumbered by a clumsy arrangement of
large blue and white porcelain, grey and deformed.
Equally misleading are the displays of furniture, textiles and metalwork on
the left flank of the corridor. The collection has been arbitrarily ordered
into themes in the spirit of the TT Tsui Chinese Gallery, where works of art
are presented as documents of social history. In the shallow space of 'The
Man's Room', for example, we find a carved slate funerary epitaph to a 17th
century official which would probably have been made for display in an
ancestral shrine. Similarly, alongside objects made for the scholar's desk
such as elegant porcelain and inlaid metal brush pots, we find a small
bronze incense burner that, far from being an object of everyday life, was
used in Korea for ceremonies, either in a Buddhist monastery or for ancestor
worship. A kind of eternal Korea is presented: there is no sense of
chronology or evolution. Some objects are contemporary, others may be 16th
century.
The cases are sprinkled with objects that strike even the untutored eye as
third-rate - a Choson lacquer table inlaid with mother-of-pearl; hunting and
flower screens; and a garish contemporary flower painting made by a Buddhist
monk. A glance at their inventory numbers reveals them to be the fruits of
last-minute shopping expeditions to stop the gaps. The inexplicable absence
of any Korean art specialist from the gallery advisory committee is only too
apparent.
It would be wrong to suggest that the gallery did not contain rare and
exceptional works of art. There is the arresting Choson jar bearing a boldly
gestural lotus flower in underglazed red. Another of the collection's
treasures is a Koryo dynasty bronze vase of 1100-1300 AD, subtly inlaid in
silver wire with delicate willows and waterfowl. The inlaid Koryo celadons
are peculiar to Korea, as are the brightly painted ox-horn caskets from the
late Choson period.
By not being sufficiently selective the Far Eastern department does a grave
disservice to its public. It is worth contrasting the V&amp;A experience -
complete with unhelpful silent videos and an object we are invited to touch,
a completely smooth blue and white dragon jar - with the spectacular new
Hotung Gallery of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum, and the
Fitzwilliam's installation of the outstanding Gompertz collection of Korean
ceramics. (The spacious Fitzwilliam gallery was created in 1990 for less
than Pounds 60,000.)
Both galleries reveal a respect and a feeling for works of art which are
lacking in these cluttered shop-window displays. Here, individual objects do
not have the breathing space to be properly viewed or to speak for
themselves. The quiet, understated quality of so much Korean art does not
profit from busy neighbours. Thanks to the peculiar serenity of the Gompertz
Koryo celadons - combinations of simplicity of shape, sparse decoration and
perfect, luminous glazes - the effect of the Fitzwilliam gallery is
overwhelming. The visitor goes away determined to find out more. Faced with
the Samsung Gallery, the visitor could be forgiven for walking away unmoved
and little the wiser.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Arts: The Curse of the Pharaohs - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a fine play to start the New Year at the Lyric Studio in
Hammersmith. The Curse of the Pharaohs has wit, pathos, spine-tingling
suspense and some political and social overtones. Above all, it is a
wonderfully good story and the acting by the Empty Stage Theatre Company is
to the highest standards.
The story is of Howard Carter, his patron, Lord Carnarvon, and the discovery
of the tomb of Tutankhamon in the Valley of the Kings in 1922. An additional
pleasure is that it might be equally about the British and Suez Canal:
several lines suggest that the analogy is deliberate. The play captures that
patronising, but sometimes mutually admiring, relationship between the
British and the Egyptians to a tee.
The Curse is, of course, a thriller as well. The Empty Stage Company works
almost entirely without props: a chair here and there, the odd torch to
illuminate the tomb and a stick both to support the ailing Lord Carnarvon
and to beat to death the insidious, unseen cobra. Occasionally the gold and
green figure of Tutankhamon appears in the background, most ominously at the
end when it looks as though he is laying a final curse on Carter.
There are only four parts in Robin Brooks's text: Carter, Carnarvon, his
daughter, Lady Evelyn, and an Egyptian who switches between guide, doctor,
prime minister and political detainee. Only at the close, when the British
have deposed him, do you realise how crucial the Egyptian is to the
structure of the play.
About halfway through I would have given the acting laurels to Nick Rawling
as Carter, the Norfolk draughtsman who took to Egypt as if it were a vastly
more interesting version of East Anglia. Another prize would have gone to
Sophie McConnell for the relatively small part of Lady Evelyn. Ms McConnell,
without the slightest affectation, is both loving daughter to her father and
doting admirer of Carter.
Then, in the second act, Carnarvon dies. I thought this scene, played by
Peter Glancy as Carnarvon, was extremely moving. Again, nothing is overdone.
The old theatrical standbys of death on the stage and a final deathbed
conversation, man-to-man, come off gloriously.
Even Glancy, however, is finally overtaken by Nick Rawling as the Egyptian.
As prime minister, Rawling throws out the patronising British only to be
himself thrown out as the British fight back. He takes the rebuff with
immense calm and charm, confident no doubt that one day the Egyptians will
be back. Other pleasures abound: the Egyptian music composed by Richard
Heacock, the lighting by Ron Hollis which is essential to the plot. There
are some very funny, very English lines along the way. Brooks has been
writing for Empty Stage since 1989. His previous works include an adaptation
of Pilgrim's Progress and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The
Curse of the Pharaohs is not just a play for a studio stage, it should go
down well anywhere.
The production is impeccably directed by Andrew Holmes, the founder of Empty
Space. If he turned off the illuminated exit sign at the back of the
theatre, one of the key scenes would be even creepier.
Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, until January 23. (081) 741 8701

FT  08 JAN 93 / Arts: Dizzy Gillespie - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flamboyant, often exotic in appearance, the curious up-bent horn propelled
by extraordinary ballooning cheeks, Dizzy Gillespie, who died on Wednesday,
has long been one of the most instantly recognisable figures in modern jazz.
As the inventor of a whole new style of trumpet playing and, in partnership
with alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, the creator of a new and difficult
language in jazz, he is one of the music's most important and influential
figures.
Born John Birks Gillespie in Cheraw, South Carolina, on October 21 1917, he
first picked up the trombone at age of 12 and moved to the trumpet a year
later. His musician father had died when he was 10 and the young Gillespie
followed precocious self-tuition with study at the Laurinburg Institute in
North Carolina.
A keen follower of big band trumpeter Roy Eldridge, he took his hero's place
in Teddy Hill's band in 1937, visiting Europe and recording for the first
time. In 1939 he joined the Cab Calloway Orchestra as a featured soloist and
what started as a clash of personalities with the leader ended as a fight
and the prankster Gillespie being sacked from the band.
During his time as an arranger for the big bands of Woody Herman and Jimmy
Dorsey that followed, Gillespie began to hang out in New York's 52nd Street
clubs, and Minton's in particular. Here he met Charlie Parker, a more
chaotic but equally incandescent talent, and the seeds for the vital new
music were sown. Parker and Gillespie became friends and between them,
leading sextets and quintets, they introduced the new, seething sound that
was bebop to astonished audiences across the US.
Where Parker was the unpredictable cauldron of ideas, rarely off the boil,
Gillespie's perfect phrasing and clowning approach lent modern jazz
accessibility and acceptability. Where Parker was the shooting star, burning
bright in small groups and leaving imitators to hang on his tail, Gillespie
sought to shed light on the possibilities in the new music for both peers
and rivals. A match for Parker's boundless creativity and technical skill in
improvisation, Gillespie's soloing was marked by flawless phrasing at
impossibly high speed and register. He could hit the ear hard where it was
least expected, and yet maintain an insidious swing.
Gillespie's development as a musician was complete by the end of the Forties
and compositions such as 'Night in Tunisia', 'Salt Peanuts' and 'Blue 'n'
Boogie' established as swinging anthems of bebop. By the mid-Fifties, when
Parker had all but burnt out, Gillespie had become a sort of cultural
diplomat and even carried out world tours for the US State Department.
Throughout the 1960s and '70s as the jazz (and bop) idiom underwent further
change, Gillespie's international stature grew. The essence of his playing
remained undiluted by his (pioneering) exploration of Latin rhythms and
latterly of fusion, his comic approach sometimes drawing criticism, often
attracting new interest in jazz music. A tireless tourist, Gillespie began
to reach yet wider audiences in the 1980s as the international festival
circuit grew: the virtuoso entertainer with a self-deprecating but impish
persona had finally picked up where Louis Armstrong left off - as genial
ambassador for an often unapproachable and factionalised branch of
contemporary music.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Arts: High points from old hands - Jazz in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nineteen ninety two started and finished well enough. On New Year's Day 1992
over 20 of the UK's fiercest free improvisers crammed into the sub-tropical
basement of the 100 Club to celebrate South Africa's Blue Notes in
gloriously discordant style. The year's end, with Norwegian saxophonist Jan
Garbarek freeze-drying the Barbican as his contribution to the Tender is the
North smorgasbord of Nordic art, was a breathtaking contrast.
The intervening months - with some notable exceptions - were less inspiring
and more temperate. Perhaps it was the relentless drizzle, perhaps it was
the recession, maybe it was the carping over Jazz FM. Heaven knows, I have
tried to like 'London's 102.2'. I do not smile knowingly when jock Helen
Mayhew stumbles over the pronunciation of Bix Beiderbecke. I do not clamour
for rare Charlie Parker accompanied by the sound of eggs frying from dawn to
dusk. But I do turn the wireless off in the daytime when the Jazz FM
computer selects Sade/Robert Cray/Simply Red for the umpteenth time that
day.
If, as appears to be the case, the new middle of the road formula has paid
commercial dividends this year, can the formula be made a bit bigger next
year? Now that owner David Maker has succeeded in moving the station into
profit thereby securing it, he can surely afford to programme more discs
into the machine which runs the station during daylight hours?
It was not a good year for television either. Having won precious airtime
the right side of the witching hour for its live recordings of the Brecon
Jazz Festival, BBC Cymru blew it the way television always blows it by not
getting the sound right. Are TV engineers stone deaf? Pat Metheny does not
spend thousands of dollars on a synclavier in order to reproduce the sound
of a badly tuned ukelele.
For the real stuff, neat, the year was better spent out of the armchair and
on the South Bank, ears pitted against the chattering classes at Ronnie
Scott's or in the Jazz Cafe (which finally found a new owner in September).
If not all of it was notable there was a tremendous amount of jazz music to
be had in London in 1992 and, perhaps surprisingly, the highpoints were
provided by the old hands.
Brummie septuagenarian tenorist Andy Hamilton finally took the South having
just released his debut album; Pharoah Sanders boggled the Jazz Cafe with
undiminished impro; Ornette Coleman dazzled the Festival Hall with his
shimmering son et lumiere show; and Tony Williams led Wayne Shorter, Dave
Holland, Wallace Roney and Herbie Hancock through old paces, tenderly
revitalised, at the Royal Albert Hall.
But for embarrassment and riches combined, one performance stands out above
the others - that of Keith Jarrett, the John McEnroe of the concert grand.
It is increasingly the fashion nowadays for jazzmen to barely acknowledge
their audience, pausing between numbers to receive applause before sternly
serving up the next piece. Not so Jarrett, who began his Standards Trio set
in fine form by lambasting New Music ('like being hit over the head by a
nerf ball'), Alternative Musicians ('the neo-pseudo beboppist club') and
World Music ('like bringing home an exotic flower and watching it wither').
And all this pleasurable railing delivered before a note had been played.
After the first set - of inspired improvisation, Jarrett squealing
involuntarily like a seal as is his custom - he returned, hands high on
hips, to curse electronic music ('fit only for Disneyland') and jab again
for good measure at new music fans. Then, joy, he mistook the mixing desk
for someone he thought was bootlegging his gig. 'Whoever you are, whatever
you are,' he intoned menacingly, 'you have got a problem . . .' Pity more of
our visitors could not have provided so electric a setting for their
performances this past year.

Tonight, and for the next two nights, Arena's The Graham Greene Trilogy (BBC
2, 9.30) offers the unmissable opportunity to become immersed in the
conscience-ridden torments of Greene-land. Greene, who died in 1991, called
writing his disease. The first instalment narrates his career as far as
Mexico and The Power and the Glory.
I suspect that the main effect of 'how to' gardening programmes on TV is to
sow disillusionment. Novice gardeners wonder gloomily why the muddy,
bug-eaten reality never corresponds to what they saw being effortlessly
accomplished on the box. BBC 2's Front Gardens (8.30) invites garden
designers to transform tiny off-street patches according to their owners'
hearts' desires. On C4 at 9.00 there is the other kind of gardening
programme. In A Count of Flowers, ace garden-presenter Roy Lancaster begins
the first of a two-part exploration of the fabulously lovely gardens of La
Mortola in Italy. Joanna Kanska, so memorable as the Polish heroine of 'Very
Peculiar Practice', returns to the screen as a sexy Russian in Love Hurts
(BBC1, 9.30)

Mention of new EC directives is likely to produce a yawn among those
affected. This year, companies have to comply with new directives covering
health and safety management, equipment safety, handling of loads, working
conditions, protective equipment and display screens.
To help businesses comply with these environmental, health and safety rules,
Digital Equipment Corporation has brought out a computer-based training
course to make staff aware of the requirements.
Users of the training package, distributed by Compliance Training, can
select topics related to their jobs or workplaces. Paul Watmough, head of
Compliance Training, says the package 'gives companies a truly
cost-effective way of delivering timely and useful training in the new EC
regulations'. The basic price is Pounds 380. Compliance Training: UK, 071

Of 33 US companies which took precautions to protect mini and mainframe
systems in the event of disaster, but not personal computer networks, only
three were in business a year later. The example is quoted by Norman
Trister, head of Profile Computers, which has launched a service to enable
companies to recover their PC networks.
NetCall covers nearly every type of disaster than can affect a network. It

When accidents occur, the first reaction is often panic. To help deal with
emergencies in industries processing hazardous materials, Pacer Systems of
the US has developed what it calls the first expert computer system for
those responding on the spot.
Plantsafe provides automated advice for emergency co-ordinators, safety
managers and on-site team leaders who have to react quickly to fires, leaks,
spills and other hazardous situations. Its main uses are in the oil,
petrochemical, chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
Says David Whitby, UK-based marketing manager for Plantsafe in Europe:
'Previous systems have been able to provide information only on vapour or
gas releases. Plantsafe provides the full range of information for emergency
team needs.' Plantsafe: UK, 0483 730905. Pacer: US, 508 667 8800.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Portable DCC out this summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronics makers Philips and Matsushita, co-developers of the Digital
Compact Cassette, yesterday announced the development of a portable version
of the next-generation audio system, writes Emiko Terazono.
The companies will start marketing the walkman version of the DCC this
summer, starting in Japan at the price of Y60,000 (Pounds 320). With the
launch of the portable DCC, consumers may finally see the expected marketing
battle with Sony's digital audio system, the Mini Disc, launched last year.
While the main difference between the two systems is that DCC is a tape
format and Mini Disc is a disc format, Matsushita argues that its portable
system is smaller, lighter and its batteries last 1.6 times longer than the
Mini Disc.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Technology: Steering clear of chaos - How British Rail
compiles its timetable and how private franchisees will compete for space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's controversial determination, reaffirmed this week, to press
ahead with the privatisation of Britain's rail services opens up exciting
opportunities for new train operators, but is also bound to cause practical
headaches.
One area fraught with potential problems is the timing of train arrivals and
departures. Twice a year, British Rail turns to its train service database
to produce its national passenger timetable, filling a hefty 1,500 pages.
Future franchisees will have to become closely involved in this logistical
exercise, likely to become even more complex when they enter the rail scene.
Although committed to franchising out passenger services, the government
will not abandon the national timetable. Thus operators will have little
scope to make their services more attractive than BR's existing trains by
obtaining more favourable timetable slots. The main advantages of
privatising routes will, as the government sees it, be in improved service
and marketing.
However, new operators will be involved in the timetable planning process,
though timings will be allocated centrally by a new regulatory body. BR
employs about 100 planners in six regional groups to draw up its timetable.
Their job is to turn a list of competing bids to run services from BR
business managers (and, in future, franchisees) into a safe, coherent,
integrated service.
The timing of every train in the country - there are 16,000 services a day -
is worked out individually and interleaved with slower or faster trains that
want to use or cross the same track, taking account of engineering works and
speed restrictions.
One of the busiest regions is handled at Rail House in Crewe, Cheshire. This
is the West Coast Mainline, including Intercity services between London and
Birmingham, Manchester, Holyhead, Carlisle, Liverpool and Manchester, as
well as Intercity Cross country services, local services and freight.
In the West Midlands alone, this means juggling the needs of Intercity
trains to and from London with the competing demands of Midlands Cross
Country Railway, Regional Railways Central, Birmingham's Centro and
Railfreight, with the slowest train on the line governing its capacity.
The team's main tool is Protim, a system developed by BR computer staff in
York. Protim encapsulates BR's train planning rules and is based on personal
computers linked in a local area network and connected to the central Train
Services Database (TSDB) on a mainframe computer, also at Crewe.
The planners also have access to a computer system in Derby which holds data
on track geography and speed restrictions and the capabilities of each class
of BR locomotive, allowing planners to time any train between two points.
The timetable process begins with a bid from Chris Dwyer, West Coast
Intercity business manager, and his colleagues for slots, or train paths, to
run a set of services. John Whitmore, chief timetable planner at Crewe,
needs to know the number of trains for each service, where they will go from
and to, and where they will stop.
Faced with a barrage of conflicting bids for train paths (the West Coast
Mainline consists of a fast up-and-down track and a slow up-and-down track,
with few opportunities for overtaking), the timetable planners invariably
offer a compromise between the aims of the business manager and the line's
capabilities.
'Our aim is to come up with a performance schedule based on a set of rules
called Rules of the Plan which are agreed between the operator, train
planner and the performance manager who monitors BR's efficiency,' says
Whitmore.
The Rules of the Plan include such constraints as:
Station dwell time - the standard period (now one minute) that trains stop
at intermediate stations.
Connection allowance - the maximum time needed to get to a connecting train
at main interchanges. The approach here is to take the case of, say, an
elderly person with bags who cannot use stairs and has to go across a big
station.
Changing locomotives - some trains will need to change locomotives from
electric to diesel; the rules allow 11 minutes.
Turnround time - every Intercity train needs a long stop at the terminus
while it is cleaned and has reservation tickets attached; 40 minutes is
allowed.
Engineering recovery time - this is distinct from engineering works and
involves a speed restriction applied while new ballast consolidates.
In the current timetable, there is an extra allowance of 12 minutes in the
London-Glasgow timings for such reduced speeds.
BR has a real-time computer system which tells it where each train is and
how it is performing against its timetable, providing feedback for timetable
planners of any changes needed.
Once the planners have a list of the trains BR wants to run and how long
each will take on its journey and between all intermediate stages, they
still have to fit each service into a timetable, ensuring that timings do
not conflict.
The main charge levelled by opponents of the franchising plans is that they
fail to take account of the complexity of BR's operations. Changes in the
timings of trains between London and Manchester can affect services as far
away as York and Newcastle.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<TEXT>
New technologies can both excite and frighten companies without the
resources or knowledge to exploit them properly, however much they may stand
to benefit.
'For this reason,' says Fraunhofer, a German applied research organisation,
'many small and medium-sized ventures prefer to play safe and manage without
the latest forward-looking equipment.'
To try to help such timid or inexperienced businesses, Fraunhofer's
Production Technology Institute in Aachen has got together with the
Institute of Technology Management at St Gallen University, Switzerland, to
produce a technology 'calendar'.
The idea is to offer information not only on technologies relevant to
particular products, but also about the economic and human resources needed
to implement them.
For example, some complex processes may well be technically and financially
suitable for certain companies. But lack of qualified people could make it
hard to introduce advanced production methods.
The technology calendar comprises a special database (called dabit) on
innovative technologies and guidelines telling companies which materials
(such as plastics, ceramics, and special steels) can be subjected to which
processes (such as cutting or coating by laser, water jet cutting, or
injection moulding) and at which manufacturing stage.
Those using the calendar - though developed in Germany and Switzerland, it
is aimed at companies around the world - can either just tap into dabit to
keep up to date with particular technologies or make use of guidelines
developed for particular technological, financial and employment
circumstances.
However, companies in some countries will obviously be in less need of such
assistance than in other parts of the world. As experts at Aachen and St
Gallen point out, the success of many Japanese companies stems from the fact
that they invest more than twice as much in developing and applying advanced
production technologies than comparable US concerns.

FT  08 JAN 93 / People: Gardner goes back to GEC-Marconi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roy Gardner has been made managing director of GEC-Marconi, the General
Electric Company's Pounds 3bn-a-year defence arm. He replaces David
Fletcher, who held the job for only 18 months.
The change was made discreetly last month, in accordance with the
publicity-shy traditions of the GEC group.
Gardner, who is 47, was brought back into GEC-Marconi as Fletcher's deputy
in September. He was finance director at the company before being headhunted
in 1986 to fill the same post at STC, where he became right-hand man to
chairman Arthur Walsh and gained a name as a cost-cutter.
After STC's takeover by Northern Telecom in late 1990, he became chief
operating officer of Northern Telecom Europe.
His first move in his new job, announced yesterday, has been to merge four
subsidiary companies into a new grouping, GEC-Marconi Avionics, encompassing
activities from airborne radar to flight controls and power systems. The new
company, with annual sales of about Pounds 850m and 13,000 employees, can
lay claim to being the biggest in Europe in the avionics sector.
Gardner's background in finance contrasts with that of Fletcher, an engineer
who has spent his whole career at GEC-Marconi. In the managing director's
post, Fletcher made his mark with a confident and innovative approach to new
business and new inter-company links.
Although losing his executive responsibilities, Fletcher has been appointed
a deputy chairman of GEC-Marconi, increasing the number of chairmen and
deputy chairmen to five. His remit is to help develop new business and joint
venture opportunities, including collaboration with foreign companies.
GEC chose to restrict its public announcement of the management change to
the trade press. As Fletcher commented with some regret while still in the
driving-seat last year: 'It is in the nature of GEC to keep a low profile.'

Timothy Plaut, the number one Extel-rated analyst for German equities, has
left SG Warburg after six years. Plaut, along with the rest of the team,
Nick Jones and Stefan Sanne, will be joining Goldman Sachs at the start of
February.
Goldman, which two years ago had no physical presence in Germany, has
expanded rapidly with around 75 staff now based in Frankfurt. The US
investment bank says the Warburg hiring reflects the need to expand its
German equity coverage.
However, Plaut and his team will be based in London, along with all the rest
of the European research team - save one or two economists.
In an unusual move, the previous head of equity research, Mark Edmiston, is
transferring to New York as a senior European equity salesman.

He is no stranger to professional bodies, having been a member and then
chairman of the Auditing Practices Committee from 1986-90.
He brings membership of the ASB back to nine voting members at a time when
it is entering the most testing phase since its creation in August 1990. The
others are David Tweedie, Alan Cook, Robert Bradfield, Sir Bryan Carsberg,
Michael Garner, Donald Main, Roger Munson and Graham Stacy.
Until his new appointment, Brindle was also a member of the ASB's urgent

FT  08 JAN 93 / People: Charles Good
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Good, formerly managing director of J S Gadd, is moving to Glasgow
as managing director of the Scottish operations of Shoprite, the fastest
growing part of the discount food shops empire. The position is a new one,
the result of realising that it had become inappropriate to run the Isle of
Man-based company entirely from the island.
Shoprite, the property-to-discount food stores group, has established 35
stores in Scotland in the past two years and plans to open at least 24 more
in the next 12 months.
Good, 46, has been advising Shoprite for the past seven years and been on
the board in a non-executive capacity for the past three.
A chartered accountant who picked up corporate finance skills at S G Warburg
before setting up his own company, C A Good, at the beginning of the 1980s,
he sold out to J S Gadd in 1987 for Pounds 500,000. The UK corporate finance
businesses of the latter, in turn, were sold to English Trust in December.
He explains the move as motivated 'not by a negative feeling about corporate
finance and certainly not about English Trust. But I have been in this game
for 20 years'.
He adds that he is a great believer in the Shoprite formula and that he is
also 'sympathetic to the industry' - having personally owned three
supermarkets in Reading between 1979 and 1982.

FT  08 JAN 93 / People: English Trust makes Gadd moves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the purchase of the UK corporate finance activities of boutique
merchant bank JS Gadd last month, English Trust has put former Gadd managing
director Charles Good on to the board of the group's holding company and
Stephen Goschalk on to the board of the principal operating subsidiary
English Trust Company Ltd.
JS Gadd's parent, SG Investments, which was founded by Staffan Gadd in 1987,
three years after he quit his position as chairman and chief executive of
Samuel Montagu, has been engaged in a series of disposals because of
pressure from its original Swedish shareholders, many of which have gone
into receivership, to realise the cash.
Goschalk, 40, trained as a chartered accountant with Touche Ross; after
spells at London Trust and Chartfield, the venture capital group, he joined
JS Gadd on the corporate finance side. Good, meanwhile, goes on to the group
board in a non-executive capacity (see below).
At the same time, English Trust, which effected a management buy-out from
Nordbanken in 1991, promoted Alexandra Gillham, 29, on to the board of
English Trust Company. She has been closely involved in advising Trio
Investment Trust in the prolonged deal last year involving the purchase of
money broker Martin Bierbaum.
Notwithstanding the depressed state of the UK corporate finance market and
the number of second-tier merchant banks who have curtailed their
involvement in it, Goschalk, who claims to have a number of deals in the
pipeline, says he genuinely believes a modest outfit like English Trust can
offer small and
medium-sized companies a better service - in contrast to the 'very mixed'
treatment they get from the leading houses.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Property: Markets for the brave - Global opportunities for
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where in the world should investors buy property? Even if there is an
improvement this year on the past 12 months, the search for new
opportunities is strictly for the brave.
There is no guarantee that the first into the property recession will be the
first out. The severity of the property downturns in the US and UK - which
entered the downturn well before Japan and continental Europe - is so bad
that recovery is likely to be slow and halting.
Less mature markets also promise a rocky ride. The emerging markets of
central and eastern Europe are riven by political and legislative
difficulties and even the fast-growing markets of south-east Asia are
suffering from oversupply.
While the weaknesses of the large industrialised economies are the main
factors contributing to this malaise, there are other reasons why most
markets are suffering together.
The increasingly global flow of funds in the 1980s allowed banks and
investors to export property booms from one market to another. At the same
time, the rapid expansion of the financial services industry set off periods
of heady construction in New York, Tokyo and London.
The result is that the world's biggest cities are full of empty offices.
More than a fifth of all office blocks in the City of London, Sydney,
Melbourne and Perth and the US are empty. Paris is heading towards a vacancy
rate of 10 per cent. In Germany, and even Japan, which have had the lowest
vacancy rates in the world, rates are creeping up significantly.
Rising interest rates towards the end of 1989 dried up liquidity and burst
the bubble, leaving an oversupply of buildings, rapidly falling prices, a
shortage of capital and credit and a near-crisis in the banking industry,
which had lent heavily to the sector.
The severity of these problems defies any easy solution. Falling interest
rates in Japan and the US have not stopped the rot. Much of Europe does not
even have the panacea of cheap money: tight monetary policy in Germany, the
result of the huge cost of reconstructing east Germany, has kept interest
rates high across most of the European Community. Indeed, with continental
markets in decline after the good times of the past decade, Europe has now
fallen out of favour with prospective investors.
Between 1985 and 1990, rents in good quality property in leading European
cities rose by an average of 14.4 per cent annually and capital values by
17.8 per cent a year, according to Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyor.
The growth prospects proffered by the single European market - which came
into effect at the start of this month - and the gradual lifting of
investment restrictions in recent years across the continent, has encouraged
companies and investors to snap up offices across Europe.
Average capital values across continental Europe have already fallen by 23
per cent from their peak in 1991, says Jones Lang Wootton, and there is
every sign that the decline will continue. Only Hamburg posted any rise in
rents in 1992.
Spain is enduring the steepest fall in values in the EC, apart from the UK.
Capital values of prime offices have fallen by about 30 per cent in the past
year in Barcelona and by 28 per cent in Madrid over the same period.
In Milan, office values have fallen by a fifth. However relatively modest
gearing has given the Milan market some resilience.
France probably provides the greatest cause for concern. Banks and insurance
companies are closing ranks in an attempt to reduce the damage from the up
to FFr80bn (Pounds 9.6bn) of estimated doubtful debts in their property loan
portfolios.
The French government has proposed measures such as granting tax advantages
and deferment of stamp duty to help the industry. However, the government is
reluctant to be seen to be bailing out speculators and its half-hearted
measures are unlikely to stabilise the market given the large supply of new
office space that is due to come onto the market this year.
Recession and high interest rates have sent much of the German market into
reverse. The reconstruction of eastern Germany, like other markets in
central and eastern Europe, is being held back by problems of land
restitution. Economic hardship and the difficulties in imposing a market
structure after decades of communist rule are additional difficulties in
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Opinions differ about the UK, the worst-hit market in Europe. In spite of
severe structural problems of oversupply and weak demand, a small but
growing number of investors believe that the decline of the past three years
has run its course. 'This is a good time to buy,' says Mr Gerald Blundell of
Jones Lang Wootton. 'This year will be the turning point.'
Similar arguments are promoted by optimists in Australia and the US.
Australian real estate represents 'an excellent countercyclical play,'
according to Baillieu Knight Frank Research, property advisers.
Some property specialists also believe that US markets, where office values
have fallen by more than 50 per cent in the past four years, are through the
worst. 'Although there is no sign of improvement yet there are growing signs
that we are at the bottom,' says Mr Sol Rabin, a partner of TCW Realty
Advisers.
The bull case for US property is that new construction has ground to a halt
and recovery is gathering pace. For all that, it usually takes several years
of growth before companies take new premises. And the construction peak of
the 1980s will take years to work through: some 40 per cent of buildings in
the US were built in the past 10 years. Moreover, lower interest rates have
not yet encouraged a resurgence of investment, which has fallen from Dollars
21bn in 1988 to about Dollars 3bn in 1992, says Mr Rabin.
An aspiring investor would do well to examine the property markets of Asia,
which in spite of oversupply problems are generally supported by robust
economic growth, with the notable exception of Japan. 'Asia still continues
to be one of the brightest areas in the world,' says Mr Alan Hill of Jones
Lang Wootton.
Malaysia has attracted much attention from investors. Factors such as
political stability, a shortage of office space, and its bid to hold the
1998 Commonwealth Games have led to rising values and the launch of big
developments.
But there are also many risks in Asia. Thailand and Hong Kong are dogged by
political uncertainty; Singapore has a large oversupply of office space,
which has resulted in a fall in excess of 20 per cent in rents since the end
of 1991.
Another concern is that Japanese banks and investors, which have supplied
much of the capital for investments in the region, have withdrawn, forced in
large part by severe problems in their domestic property market. Values have
fallen by 30-40 per cent in Tokyo; non-performing loans are estimated to be
in the order of Y30-Y50 trillion.
The property losses suffered by many big banks are perhaps the most worrying
consideration for would-be investors. This is because property prices are
heavily influenced by the availability of credit. Although investors may be
encouraged by the possibility of buying near the bottom of the cycle,
caution is likely to remain the watchword in 1993.

Jones, appeared to shake rigid some of the UK motor component industry's
senior executives assembled in London in November.
A benchmarking study* comparing Japanese and UK suppliers provided a
chilling insight into just how far most of the UK industry has to go to
match the 'world class' productivity and quality standards set by the best
Japanese companies.
Average productivity levels inside the benchmarked UK companies were found
to be less than half those of their Japanese counterparts. And quality
standards - measured by rejection rates - were 100 times inferior.
Jones, professor of motor industry management at Cardiff Business School,
warns that because the UK component makers studied were likely to be typical
of UK manufacturers, 'a gap here almost certainly means that much of UK
manufacturing falls short of world-class performance by a similar two-to-one
margin.'
But continental European component makers would be ill-advised to sneer.
'Our experience tells us that a similar set of mainland European firms would
probably do no better,' says Jones, co-author of The Machine That Changed
The World, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology study into efficiency
levels in the world motor industry.
It was this study that first coined the term 'lean production' to
distinguish production systems (pioneered mainly by Toyota) which use
radically fewer resources - in people, materials, time and space - than
traditional 'mass production' techniques.
The Lean Enterprise Benchmarking Project was undertaken by Cardiff Business
School, Cambridge University and the Andersen Consulting group.
The project made a head-to-head comparison of UK component makers with their
Japanese counterparts, using a wide range of measures to evaluate
performance and profile management practices.
These included examinations of factory lay-out, work organisation, human
resources management, organisational structures and control systems, as well
as the nature of relationships with suppliers, distributors and customers.
Jones describes the benchmarking process as the most powerful tool available
for assessing industrial competitiveness and instigating change.
'After benchmarking one can no longer hide behind excuses or put the clock
back. One has to face the facts, however unpleasant, and do something about
them,' he says.
The project followed a report last year from the National Economic
Development Council into Nissan's UK manufacturing experience which
concluded that the British components industry was only on a par with the
Japanese industry of the mid- to late-1970s when measured by rejection
rates.
The Nedo report also concluded that continental European suppliers were
little better than British ones.
The latest study monitored 18 companies - nine in Japan and nine in the UK.
They produce a wide variety of components, including wiring harnesses,
brakes, seats and exhausts.
One-third showed outstanding performance in both quality and productivity.
All were Japanese. However, even the Japanese companies were far from
uniformly capable. Some lagged well behind the leading 'world-class' group.
But the five worst performers were British. UK plants had an average of 2.5
defects per 100 components, compared with 2.5 per 10,000 for the best
Japanese plants.
The UK plants were also found typically to need twice as many employees to
produce the same number of parts.
None of the 'world class' plants was found to use hourly pay based on job
classifications and their employment practices were 'noticeably more
progressive than those of the non-world class plants'.
Not least, they were performing at their high level while also making a more
complex and rapidly changing mix of products than their rivals - albeit with
a slightly higher level of automation.
Change is under way as UK-based suppliers absorb the methods and culture of
lean production from Japanese 'transplants'. But even though team working,
quality circles and other manifestations of Japanese 'best practice' were
apparent in most of the UK companies, the benefits showed up in the form of
either much improved quality or productivity - but not both together.
The world-class plants also involved more of their employees more intensely
in problem-solving. In such plants team leaders were pivotal, developing the
skills of team members as well as taking responsibility for quality and
management issues.
Also missing from many indigenous UK companies - but to which Honda, Toyota
and Nissan in their UK plants are committed - are identical conditions of
employment and performance appraisal for all employees, including
management.
Jones says another key ingredient for attaining 'world class' status is the
organisation of the production process. 'It starts with integrating every
production step into an uninterrupted flow - so parts travel the minimum
distance and hardly wait for the next operation.'
In turn, 'the discipline governing the flow comes from short set-up times
and small lots produced just-in-time, thus eliminating waste and
work-in-progress. Full utilisation of the whole integrated production system
comes from eliminating random interruptions and variability, whether from a
defective part, a machine breakdown, supplier hiccup or even chaotic build
schedule.'
The best benchmarked companies were also shown to have achieved faster
throughput, much higher first-time quality, reduced rework, minimal stocks
and they worked to stable schedules.
But the full benefit of such processes, Jones argues, will not be achieved
without a complete supply chain organised along similar 'lean' principles.
The benchmarkers found that the world-class chain was tightly integrated
between vehicle assembler and even the most preliminary stages of the parts
supply chain - an integration marked by minimal stock, frequent deliveries
of small volumes of parts, lack of disruption and stable supply volumes. The
discipline of the system came from the compressed order-to-delivery lead
times and building to customer orders rather than stock.
The benchmarking team concluded that such a chain can work only if a
'partnership' relationship existed all along the chain - already a
recognised feature of ties between Japan's UK transplants and their
'first-tier' UK suppliers of key components, but a novelty for big suppliers
in their own relationships with smaller parts makers.
Implicit in this 'shared destiny' is a clear mutual understanding of the
need for a fair reward for each party as well as shared learning.
Despite the gulf, Jones insists that the UK industry nevertheless has a
'unique window of opportunity' to lead the development of 'lean' companies
and supply chains in Europe - thanks to transplants and the UK's own dismal
past industrial performance making it willing to learn from Japan.
It is the reason, he suggests, why German, French and Italian component
groups like Robert Bosch, Valeo and Magneti Marelli are investing in the UK.
'They not only want a slice of the new business created by the Japanese but
also want to share in the learning so that they can transfer the lessons
learned here to their home plants.'

FT  08 JAN 93 / Clarke seeks radical rejig of police control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR a radical reorganisation of the police, amounting to the virtual
nationalisation of police authorities in England and Wales, are to be
considered next week by a special cabinet committee chaired by Mr John
Major.
The proposals, produced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, have aroused
strong dissent within the government and are vigorously opposed by local
authorities and most chief constables.
Mr Clarke's scheme would in effect abolish the current arrangements for
police management, which balance local and national control.
Government appointees and not local councillors would form the majority on
police committees. Funding would be transferred wholesale to Whitehall in
place of the current half-and-half arrangement.
The number of police authorities in England and Wales would be reduced from
the current 43, possibly to as few as 25.
The Association of Chief Police Offices will this weekend hold an emergency
conference to consider the proposals. It is almost certain to express
reservations to the Home Office, with some members concerned at the
constitutional implications of increasing the home secretary's powers to
direct the police.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is believed to oppose the plans,
considering it undesirable to weaken local authorities further. A cabinet
committee could not agree on the issue before Christmas, necessitating the
prime minister's intervention.
The associations representing the local authorities affected, both Labour
and Tory-controlled, have written to the prime minister urging him to reject
the proposed changes.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-dominated Association of
Metrpolitan Authorities, said: 'These proposals would virtually create a
nationalised police force, run by unelected and unaccountable placemen, with
budgets totally controlled by the government. This would be dreadful for the
policing of our communities and for our democracy.'
Under the existing so-called 'tripartite system', elected councillors fill
two thirds of the places on police authorities with the other third going to
magistrates. Of police funding, 51 per cent comes from central government
and 49 per cent from local government.
The government is calling on businesses to fund schemes aimed at cutting
crime. Business and industrial leaders will be recruited to a new National
Board for Crime Prevention, which will welcome ideas and funding from the
private sector in what is hoped will be a fresh approach to tackling urban
crime.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Shop staff 'back Sunday opening'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST shopworkers who work on Sunday do not object to doing so, according to
a survey published yesterday. But while 54 per cent have no objections, 46
per cent of the 5,000 workers questioned by the University of Stirling's
Institute for Retail Studies said there were disadvantages.
The findings were published as Kwik Save, the grocery discount chain,
announced that while it had opened on the last two Sundays before Christmas
it had no plans to open on future Sundays.
It remained opposed to unrestricted Sunday trading because that would lead
to increased costs for the industry and 'ultimately to the demise of the
unique high street shopping environment we enjoy in this country'.
The survey of shopworkers who work on Sunday for nine multiple grocery and
DIY retailers - the largest of its kind so far undertaken - was commissioned
by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which campaigns for limited
deregulation of Sunday opening.
The most popular motive for Sunday working was financial. Seventy per cent
of workers received at least time-and-a-half pay for Sunday working. Only 2
per cent said the principal reason for working was because they were forced
to by management.
The Keep Sunday Special campaign, which supports only limited Sunday
opening, attacked the survey as a 'sham' because it relied on interviews
with people who already work on Sundays.
A survey commissioned by KSS from Cambridge University in November found
that 93 per cent of unionised employees not currently working on Sunday did
not want to do so, and a third of employees had been asked to work on a
Sunday but had refused.
Usdaw, the shopworkers union, said the survey confirmed its experience that
full-time permanent shop staff and managers were reluctant to work on
Sundays.
Mr Roger Boaden, director of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, said the
survey showed fears about Sunday working were groundless.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Ofgas attacks British Gas on service charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS became embroiled in another row with its regulator yesterday
when Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, accused the company of
making big increases in service charges.
Sir James said British Gas was trying to claw back the profits it had lost
from reduced gas prices by raising service charges by more than the rate of
inflation. British Gas has been forced by the regulator to reduce domestic
gas prices through a tough new formula.
Sir James said: 'A lot of people are getting a Pounds 20 benefit from lower
gas prices, but those on British Gas's 3-star service are losing Pounds 10
of that from higher prices.'
Mr Simon Kirk, British Gas director of marketing, said there were some
'astonishing' allegations in Ofgas's announcement. He said in an interview
on BBC radio that Sir James's allegations were 'scurrilous and
irresponsible'.
But British Gas said average price rises for servicing across the country
had been 7.9 per cent in April last year and admitted that in some regions
prices had increased by as much as 11 per cent. 'We're adding value to those
service packages at a price we think customers can afford,' a company
official said. He added that British Gas's service business has been rising
by about 20 per cent a year for the past five years. At the same time,
British Gas has only about 25 per cent of that service market.
Mr Ian Powe, head of the Gas Consumers' Council, the body which represents
customers, said that 18 months ago competitors in the service market were
complaining that British Gas was undercutting their prices and that they
could not compete. 'Now it is a totally different scene, prices are up and
consumers are not doing too well,' he said.
Mr Powe said he was completing a review of service and installation charges
that will be ready by the end of January. But the Gas Consumers' Council and
Ofgas have no powers to act in the service market.
Large contracts for the supply of water, gas, electricity, transport and
telecommunications services to public networks will have to be advertised in
the EC Official Journal under new regulations which come into force on
January 13.

FT  08 JAN 93 / More BR sell-off details expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE DETAILS of the government's plans to privatise British Rail are
expected to emerge in the next few weeks. The aim is to restore the momentum
of moves towards sell-off, which critics have described as unworkable and
stalled.
The series of announcements planned includes publication of the rail bill on
January 20. Ministers will launch a publicity offensive to win support for
their privatisation plans, which have run into opposition from senior
Conservatives, as well as Labour and the rail lobby.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, will soon name the new regulator
who is to oversee rail privatisa-tion.
Details of the rules for charging train operators for using the track are
also due to be published. The first half-dozen or so of the expected 30 to
40 passenger-service franchises will also be announced.
Mr MacGregor will use the Department of Transport's question slot in the
Commons on Monday to reply to his critics.
Later that day he will be appearing before the transport committee. Although
he is due to give evidence on the transport implications of the Autumn
Statement, he is likely to be questioned on the implications of BR's tighter
funding over the next three years on the privatisation plans.
He will also defend the government's plans in the Commons on Tuesday in a
debate on BR privatisation launched by Labour.
The first franchises will be based on five to eight new profit centres,
formed from BR's 19 existing operating divisions. These will operate as
'ghost' franchises under BR management until the first round of franchising
next year, offering the private sector an idea of what sort of business
opportunities are likely to be available.
Likely candidates include the London, Tilbury and Southend Line and Chiltern
Line services from London Marylebone.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Number of Names may fall to 20,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of Names at Lloyd's, the insurance market, is set to fall to
around 20,000 - the lowest level since 1982 - following losses of Pounds
2.06bn in the 1989 underwriting year which were announced last year, Richard
Lapper writes.
A total of 75 new Names - individuals whose assets support the market - are
to join this year, but the number who have resigned or have been unable to
meet solvency requirements could be as high as 2,000, according to Mr Bob
Hewes, director of regulatory services at Lloyd's. A total of 250 Names died
last year.
Mr Hewes will be one of 16 members of the insurance market's new regulatory
council, which begins work this year. The council is to be chaired by Mr
Brian Garroway, a former deputy chairman of BAT Industries. Also on the new
council are Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, and Mr Andrew Large,
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Sellafield discharge figures revised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE public consultation period for British Nuclear Fuels' new Thorp plant at
Sellafield, Cumbria, due to end on Monday, was yesterday extended by two
weeks after BNF issued new figures showing that some past radioactive
discharges had been slightly higher than it had previously indicated.
BNF said in a letter to the pollution inspectorate that the 'minor errors'
were due to a change in sampling techniques and to confusion between
gigabecquerels (a billion units of radioactivity) and megabecquerels (a
million units).
Dr Patrick Green of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group which yesterday
published its own 160-page submission to the inspectorate, said: 'This
raises even more uncertainty about what has been put out in the past, so how
are we to be sure of what they are putting out in the future?'
The revised figures show that the average discharges to the air of alpha
radiation from the site's main stacks between 1988 and 1991 had been 0.9 GBq
instead of the previously reported 0.7 GBq. However average beta radiation
emitted had been 10 GBq instead of the previously reported 11 GBq.
BNF said: 'The overall impact of this re-estimation is so small that in
BNF's view the proposed discharge limits will not be affected.' The site
selected by UK Nirex for its proposed Pounds 2.5bn underground nuclear-waste
repository at Sellafield is a poor one, according to a report by
Environmental Resources, an independent consultancy.
The report is the latest and most critical in a series commissioned by
Cumbria County Council. It suggests that groundwater from the repository
could reach the surface in about 300 years.

FT  08 JAN 93 / 2.75% deal opens pay round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE first deal of the 1993 pay round a 2.75 per cent pay rise has been
agreed for most of the 20,000 workers in the knitwear industry.
The government will be relieved that the first agreement in a busy month for
collective bargaining is not far off its limit for the public sector of 1.5
per cent, and below the current 3 per cent inflation rate.
However, the knitwear industry is particularly weak and several other
sectors' deals, agreed before January but only now coming into effect, have
been more generous. They include 5.9 per cent in the thermal insulation
industry, 5 per cent at Highland Fabricators, 4 per cent at Nissan and 3.95
per cent plus a lump sum at National Power.
Next Wednesday the leaders of 160,000 white-collar workers in the NHS will
challenge the 1.5 per cent limit with a claim for a 'substantial' rise.
Harrow council in London, which has opted out of central bargaining, faces a
4.5 per cent pay claim from public service unions Nalgo and Nupe, which are
testing the council's commitment to local discretion.
Meanwhile several other councils are likely to follow Barrow-in-Furness's
planned pay freeze for its 400 salaried staff from April.
The Timex plant in Dundee was yesterday occupied by its 400 workers in
protest against a move to lay off 200 of them.

FT  08 JAN 93 / BCCI creditors may face compensation delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAYMENTS TO creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce International from an
agreed compensation plan may be delayed by up to a year because of an appeal
filed in Luxembourg by some creditors against the court-approved package.
It also emerged yesterday that creditors are not receiving interest of
Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a week that would have been earned since the
start of December had the agreement with the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders
adhered to the original timetable.
Originally Touche Ross, liquidator of BCCI, thought it would be possible to
have the agreement secured in time for Abu Dhabi to place Dollars 800m,
covering the first two instalments of its Dollars 1.7bn contribution, on
deposit with the pooling fund and earning interest for the benefit of
creditors from December 1. The initial timetable had to be scrapped because
of delays resulting from a court appeal in the UK, and insistence by the
Luxembourg district court that the liquidator take soundings from creditors
on the agreement.
Touche Ross believed it had overcome that hurdle when 94 per cent of
creditors who responded to a circular agreed to accept the package.
A hard core of creditors is continuing to resist the package, however,
leading to the appeal lodged with the Luxembourg court on December 24. The
appeal has been filed on behalf of three creditors, Mr Adil Elias, Mr
Assilaos Artiki and Mr Hal Skolnik. Mr Elias, a US-based engineering
consultant, is a member of both the UK and Luxembourg BCCI creditors'
committees and heads the BCCI depositors' protection association. Mr
Skolnik, a company director, has a permanent proxy on the UK committee to
represent Sheerbonnet, a UK creditor. Mr Artiki is a Greek insurance broker.
Mr Georges Ravarani, a Luxembourg lawyer and one of the liquidators of BCCI
Holdings, the holding company for BCCI SA, said a decision on the appeal
could be lengthy because all procedures and statements had to be in written
form. He said: 'The delay could be as little as six months but I think that
is unrealistic. I think a year is more reasonable.'
Touche Ross fears court delays could cause further problems for the
liquidation, although Abu Dhabi has made clear that it remains committed to
the agreement and maintains that new timetabling for payments should not
cause serious difficulties for the majority shareholders.
The liquidator believes it may have to revise its earlier estimates of how
much creditors might expect to receive. The projection is between 30p and
40p in the pound.
Mr Brian Smouha, the chief liquidator of BCCI, said yesterday: 'It is
unfortunate that this is being held up and it does not look as if it is in
the interests of creditors. I want to concentrate on getting the assets in
and the money out to the creditors.'

FT  08 JAN 93 / Oil disaster reopens US debate on safety: The lessons learnt
after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE BRAER disaster
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
which could ultimately prove to be more than twice the size of the 1989
Exxon Valdez spill in Alaskan coastal waters  - has triggered fresh
discussion in the US about the kinds of counter-measures that are most
effective in containing such accidents.
The debate, once again pitting environmentalists against shippers and the
oil industry, is focused on the tough new regulations on tanker safety being
implemented as part of the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, a law that some
in the US say could serve as a model for UK or even Europe-wide legislation.
The Valdez disaster spilled 11m gallons of oil, compared with a total of
about 26m gallons aboard the Braer.
Exxon, while harshly criticised in the US, eventually committed more than
Dollars 1bn over 10 years to settle federal and state legal actions.
Mr Daniel J. Weiss, an environmental expert at the Sierra Club in
Washington, claims this amount is a pittance compared to the estimated
Dollars 15bn of damage caused by the Valdez spill.
But the heart of the US debate concerns the two most stringent provisions of
the US oil pollution legislation - the requirement that all ships navigating
in US waters and built after 1990 be double-hulled, and the fact that the
liability of shipowners under federal law is unlimited in cases of gross
negligence and may also be unlimited at the state level in a variety of
circumstances.
In its effort to weaken the double-hull requirement, the American Petroleum
Institute (API) claimed that the cost of refitting double bottoms could be
Dollars 4.6bn for the fleet of 153 US tankers, or Dollars 30m per vessel.
Few in the US oil industry have liked the double-hull requirement.
Mr Steve Hillyard, a spokesman for Chevron Shipping, believes 'double hulls
are not the panacea for oil spill prevention' because they can only prevent
the leakage of oil from a damaged tanker in certain circumstances, not in
all cases.
Mr Charles Di Bona, president of the API, the oil industry's main Washington
lobbying association, notes the double-hull requirement 'is the law and we
will comply with it'. But he too insists it is not at all clear that double
hulling is the best technology: 'In the Shetland case, double hulling might
have even hurt things. The space between the hulls could have taken in water
and sunk the tanker."
Mr Di Bona says there are alternative technologies such as a Swedish system
for sealing the oil tanks that may prove equally effective.
Environmental critics, such as Mr Weiss, say the lesson of the Valdez
disaster for the UK is that 'the oil industry has no credibility when it
comes to concern about oil spills.'
He argues that after the Valdez affair the oil industry and the Bush
administration weakened the OPA dramatically by extending the period before
double hulling is required for all tankers to the year 2015, and by
exempting barges.
'The reality,' says Mr Weiss, 'is that the cost of double hulling is far
cheaper than the cost of oil spills."
As far as liability is concerned, Mr Weiss claims unlimited liability 'is
the only way we can ensure the companies have a stake in making sure they
don't have accidents and behave more responsibly'. But Mr Di Bona complains
that the OPA contains a set of conditions that in some cases are too harsh
on liability and other issues. The heavy liability requirements, for
example, have made insurance more expensive and forced some companies to
self-insure.
After the Braer disaster, the API issued a statement saying that while the
Shetlands spill was regrettable, it should not overshadow the genuine
progress being made in preventing and responding to oil spills in American
waters.
Chief among the developments in the US was the oil industry's agreement in
1990 to form the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC), a non-profit
company that will be the largest in the world when it becomes fully
operational next summer.
The MSRC - funded by 47 large US oil companies, shippers, utilities and
pipeline operators - has a Dollars 400m budget for capital equipment and a
Dollars 500m budget for operating expenses in its first five years. It has
400 full-time employees located at its Washington headquarters and at
regional locations in New York, Miami, Lake Charles, Louisiana, Los Angeles
and Seattle.
The MSRC has 16 large offshore response vessels, each 210 ft long and with
accommodation for 40 people, and with a recovery capacity of 10,000 barrels
a day.
The US debate also concerns whether detergent dispersants or mechanical
removal devices such as skimmers are more effective.
Mr John Costello, a retired Coast Guard Vice-Admiral, who is president of
the MSRC, says he understands that chemical dispersants are used far more
than skimmers in the UK. He believes more flexibility in UK response
techniques would also be useful.
Mr Costello says, however, that many states which oppose detergents on
environmental grounds should reconsider.
There is a broad consensus in the US that since the Valdez disaster there
has been a steady improvement in developing oil spill responses be they the
formation of the MSRC, the institution of broader sea lanes or improved
training for tanker crew members. In 1991 there were only 1,000 barrels
spilled in US waters, the lowest in 14 years.

THE average council tax bill in England will turn out lower than the current
poll tax per household, according to a survey by Local Government Chronicle.
The study of more than half of all councils in England suggests the average
council tax bill from April will be Pounds 505. Allowing for inflation, that
is a reduction from the average household poll tax of Pounds 500.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Recovery slow for truck sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK market for commercial vehicles is thought likely to experience a
slowly developing recovery rather than repeat last month's surge in sales of
cars, John Griffiths writes.
Sales of new commercial vehicles rose 7.7 per cent last month, but that was
too little to prevent sales for the year as a whole falling below 1991
levels.
Sales totalled 201,186 in 1992, a drop of 3.75 per cent on the previous
year's 209,021.
Most manufacturers are now expecting a market increase approaching 10 per
cent this year.
The UK industry was unable to prevent a further small imports rise last
year. Their market share rose to 36.32 per cent from 35.51 per cent in 1991.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Halifax says house prices fell by 0.6% last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE prices remained weak last month, Halifax, Britain's largest building
society, said yesterday.
Its house price index showed a fall of 0.6 per cent in December, reversing a
brief hope of recovery in November when the index rose 0.1 per cent.
The figure for December represents a slightly larger drop than the 0.2 per
cent fall reported by Nationwide, the second-largest building society, on
Wednesday. The Halifax index showed price falls in all months last year
apart from June and November.
'The seasonally adjusted fall continues the pattern of house price weakness
that has been apparent for much of 1992 and which will probably continue
into 1993 before house prices stabilise as housing market activity recovers
in the spring,' Halifax said.
House prices ended the year 7.8 per cent below 1991 prices. The average cost
of a house was Pounds 61,169 last month compared with Pounds 66,330 in
December 1991. The fall in prices paid by first-time buyers was even
greater. Last month first-time buyers paid an average of Pounds 44,297, a
drop of 8.7 per cent on the previous year.
Halifax said it expected prices to stabilise this spring with its estate
agents reporting a significant increase in demand by prospective buyers to
view houses. But it does not expect to see any price increases until the
second half of the year, 'leading to a more sustained recovery in 1994'.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, yesterday warned against 'panic
schemes' to revive the housing market after reports that Mr John Major, the
prime minister, was considering cash help for first-time buyers.
He said the priority for government funds should be for homes to rent for
those 'forced on to the streets through repossession'.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Card processor to shed staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST Data Resources, the largest credit-card processing company in the UK
and the US, is to cut 460 jobs over the next few months.
The company - which processes on behalf of banks 10m credit card accounts,
or about half of banks cards - said the losses would be across the board at
its Southend and Basildon offices in Essex.
FDR, part of the US-based First Data Corporation, whose majority shareholder
is American Express, said voluntary redundancies were being sought, but if
too few people volunteered it would seek compulsory redundancies.
Its workforce will be reduced to about 1,900 after the job losses, it said.
The company said it took the decision because of the 'sluggish' economy.
'Although our business during the holiday season was brisk we do not expect
that the volumes of 1993 business will support the total staff size that we
have employed,' the company said.
It said the introduction of new technology had replaced labour-intensive
operations. The implementation of new technology has not been without
trouble.
Last summer a flaw in FDR's software resulted in some customers being
double-charged on their credit card bills. Those most affected were National
Westminster Bank's 250,000 Gold Card holders.
Bifu, the banking union, said the decision was 'a major blow' for the Essex
economy.
A year ago FDR cut jobs by 320, and that followed the loss of 166 jobs in
October 1991.
'The Essex operation was originally set up to process the Access credit card
and employment will have halved to 1,800 in three years,' said Bifu.
It said a meeting with the company had been arranged for January 15.
FDR expanded its UK operations in July 1991 when it bought the
Basildon-based Signet card processor. Signet was jointly owned by NatWest,
Midland Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Bank.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Architects' confidence 'lowest since early 1991'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARCHITECTS ARE expecting a grim 1993 and confidence is at its lowest level
since the start of 1991, the Royal Institute of British Architects says in a
report published today.
Architects in every region expect a fall in workloads in the first half of
this year, with the gloomiest being those in Northern Ireland and south-east
England.
The figures coincide with a Gallup poll for Building magazine of 80 building
contractors, materials producers and consultancies which found that 53 per
cent believed the UK market would improve a little this year.
But building sector insolvencies are expected to continue at the same or a
higher rate by 89 per cent of those polled. More than half of the 33
housebuilders interviewed believe sales will be higher in the next three
months than in the previous quarter, and 55 per cent plan to build more
private-sector houses this year.
The institute says only 15 per cent of architects' firms expect any
improvement in workloads over the next six months while 47 per cent expect a
fall.
In the third quarter of last year a rise in public spending helped new
commissions to steady after marked falls in the first two quarters of the
year.
New commissions for housing and offices show marked declines in the quarter
although work on production drawings increased.
The institute sees this as the best sign in the figures because it may
signal that projects put on hold during the recession are gradually being
'unfrozen'.
Retail, leisure and industrial sectors all showed a decline in new
commissions.

FT  08 JAN 93 / AT&amp;T Istel to freeze pay and cut workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALARIES have been frozen for this year and some 375 jobs are likely to go
over the next six months at AT&amp;T Istel.
The company, a subsidiary of American Telephone and Telegraph of the US,
used to be the computing arm of British Leyland and is now one of the
largest UK-based computing services companies.
The measures indicate the impact of the recession on such companies, which
depend heavily on large-scale project work from big corporate clients.
Mr Peter Teague, the new chief executive of AT&amp;T Istel, said it was being
forced to rein back ambitious growth plans. 'We decided we had no
alternative but to take this painful action,' he said.
AT&amp;T Istel said the measures continued policies initiated by Mr Chris
Chiles, the previous chief executive.
The company, based in Redditch, Hereford and Worcester, employs 2,200 people
in the UK and a further 1,800 in continental Europe. It last made staff
redundant two years ago when 150 jobs were lost. A voluntary redundancy
scheme is now planned.
Last year Istel turned over Pounds 200m but is not thought to have made a
profit.
It specialises in systems integration and communication services including
electronic data interchange for a variety of industries including
manufacturing, finance and travel.
Computing services companies are a sensitive indicator of the health of
industry because new business initiatives have to be underpinned by computer
systems.
Dr Douglas Eyeions, director-general of the Computing Services Association,
a trade organisation, said there was little new work in the computer
industry.
Many were pinning their hopes on work from the health service and the
government's market-testing programme, which could result in some Pounds
750m of computing contracts being offered to the private sector over the
next few years.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Car industry is cautious over upturn: Sales for December 37
per cent higher; Ford loses lead to Rover for first time since 1984
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 37 per cent rise in new car sales last month compared with December 1991
does not signal that the motor industry has begun a sharp move out of
recession, industry leaders warned last night.
A significant factor in December's sharp rise was unusually large sales by
some motor companies to their employees which had a disproportionate effect,
in percentage terms, on the second smallest sales month of the year.
The 79,903 cars registered in December brought the total for all of last
year to 1,593,601 - only 0.08 per cent above the depressed level of 1991,
according to Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders statistics issued
yesterday. In December 1991 only 58,274 cars were sold, amounting to just
3.6 per cent of the year's total market.
However, last month's figures meant that new car sales rose in each month of
the final quarter of last year, indicating that a modest, sustainable
recovery is under way after the market's earlier collapse from a record 2.3m
units in 1989. Last year's sales were down 21 per cent on the 2m achieved in
1990 and 31 per cent down on the 1989 record.
Reflecting the stance of most UK motor chiefs, Mr Ian Mc-Allister, chairman
of Ford of Britain, said last night that 'it would be unwise to read too
much into the dramatic rise in December sales, where special factors were
involved. Incoming orders suggest that the underlying trend is showing a 10
per cent improvement, which is good news in itself.' He spoke as Ford came
to terms with the fact that in December it lost the UK market leadership -
to Rover - for the first time since 1984.
Rover's December sales rose two thirds compared with last year to give it a
market share for the month of 25.48 per cent compared with 16.65 per cent
for Ford and 13.8 per cent for Vauxhall. Rover acknowledged that some 4,000
cars had been sold at discounts of up to 25 per cent to employees, and for
the year as a whole it trailed well behind Ford - still in first place with
22.17 per cent.
With the share of sales accounted for by imports also being reduced
slightly, Sir Hal Miller, the society's chief executive, said the industry
was 'delighted' with the figures.
Volkswagen is to raise prices on its cars and vans by about 4.9 per cent
from January 18. The average price of VW cars will have risen by about 8 per
cent in two months.
VAG (UK), the importer bought by VW from Lonrho on January 1, blamed the
devaluation of sterling for the new increase.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Further trials loom for Lamont: The difficulties the
chancellor faces in preparing the Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trials of Mr Norman Lamont show few signs of ending. Having survived the
trauma of sterling's devaluation last September, the chancellor faces a
difficult two months in which to fashion his Budget.
The main challenge for Mr Lamont and his Treasury advisers - who will
discuss the Budget today and tomorrow at his residence in Chevening, Kent -
will be how to tackle the mounting financial deficit without constraining
any fragile recovery.
One option for the chancellor is to announce in March a modest increase in
taxation of perhaps Pounds 4bn with the aim of reining back the mounting
public sector borrowing requirement.
As any tax rise is likely to be unpopular, he may also want to cut interest
rates, now at 7 per cent, and announce measures to help industry. He will
almost certainly take some action to reduce the rise in the deficit, which
according to the Treasury's published assumptions will reach Pounds 37bn
this financial year and about Pounds 44bn in 1993-94.
Mr Lamont could gain an extra Pounds 4bn or so in tax revenues in 1993-94
through measures such as extending value added tax to newspapers and heating
bills, imposing an environmentally helpful increase in petrol tax and
ordering non-indexation of some income-tax allowances.
Without such measures and using calculations based on a rule of thumb used
by the Treasury to link likely deficits will projected growth, the PSBR
could easily stay at Pounds 40bn to Pounds 50bn until at least 1995-96.
On the worst-case assumption that growth remains extremely weak over these
years, the deficit could climb by then to Pounds 75.8bn or 11.2 per cent of
gross domestic product.
This would be a far cry from the position in the late 1980s, when Britain
for several years chalked up a surplus. Although a long period of large
deficits would not necessarily be catastrophic, it would probably weaken
international confidence in the UK. It might also require high interest
rates to gain funds from overseas investors via the gilts market.
The main culprit for the slide in the government's finances has been the
recession, which has eaten into tax revenues and pushed up government
spending on unemployment and social security.
If strong recovery were in prospect, the PSBR could be counted on to come
down fairly quickly as tax income rose and the jobless register fell. But to
many economists this appears unlikely.
The main restraints on a sharp upturn include the world economic slowdown,
together with continued nervousness by UK consumers and businesses about
taking on new credit after the large borrowings of the late 1980s. As a
result, real inflation-adjusted growth this year will probably be no more
than about 1 per cent, according to the Treasury and many private-sector
economists.
As for what happens after this year, the Treasury assumed in the Autumn
Statement that growth would pick up relatively quickly, reaching about 3.7
per cent in both 1994-95 and 1995-96 after 1.9 per cent in 1993-94.
Even on this fairly optimistic view, which implies higher growth figures
than those projected by many economists, the Treasury rule of thumb gives
PSBRs for 1994-95 and 1995-96 of Pounds 44.6bn and Pounds 43.7bn
respectively. The arithmetic based on this rule also implies a PSBR in
1993-94 of Pounds 48.3bn.
The rule of thumb, which assumes tax policy stays unchanged, is linked to
how GDP changes in relation to the 'trend' - the optimum rate at which the
economy can expand without either high unemployment or bursts of inflation.
This figure is normally taken to be about 2.25 per cent a year. According to
the rule, a drop in GDP of 1 percentage point below the trend rate for a
specific year leads to a fall of 0.3 points in the ratio of government
revenues to GDP.
Although the rule gives only a rough guide to expected deficits, it can
indicate how periods of high or low growth will affect the PSBR. On the
basis that the economy follows a 'medium growth' path - with GDP expanding
by 1 per cent, 2 per cent and 2 per cent in the three financial years from
1993-94 - the deficit would climb to Pounds 64.4bn in 1995-96, equivalent to
9.3 per cent of GDP. Such large figures appear plausible to many City
economists. Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers expects the PSBR to
climb to more than Pounds 60bn by 1995-96.
One view is that after the long recession output might rebound quickly, with
projected growth figures even higher than those published by the Treasury in
the Autumn Statement. But this argument is looking less respectable given
that a period of sharp growth, perhaps helped by large cuts in interest
rates, would almost certainly lead to a big rise in imports. As well as
pushing up the large current-account deficit this would certainly lead to
unacceptably high inflation, especially given the pound's depreciation since
its exit from the European exchange rate mechanism.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Spending curbs threaten 6,000 council jobs in Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP to 6,000 jobs in Birmingham and the Black Country could disappear as
local authorities struggle to comply with government spending constraints.
The region's six local authorities - Birmingham, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull,
Walsall and Wolverhampton - are scrutinising their spending programmes in
the hope of bringing expenditure in line with their anticipated income for
1993-94, the main element of which is the government's revenue support
grant. To avoid capping - the government's imposition of a limit on
expenditure and local tax gathering - every council will have to restructure
to reduce total payrolls.
Councils to take action this week include Birmingham, which may shed 3,000
jobs. With more than 2,000 employees over the age of 50, Birmingham is
seeking voluntary redundancies.
Dudley has written to all employees warning them that cuts totalling Pounds
17.5m need to be made to avoid capping. This means that, in addition to 235
voluntary redundancies already agreed, a further 750 jobs could go from a
workforce of 13,000.
Over the next fortnight Sandwell will look for Pounds 11.5m of cuts, and
will negotiate with unions over 300 proposed redundancies in its contract
services departments. If those are not agreed, the council fears that 1,000
jobs may be lost.
Walsall, now under Conservative-Liberal Democrat control, will meet unions
to discuss up to 500 job cuts as part of a plan to save Pounds 11.5m in the
next financial year and more in the following year.
Compulsory job losses should be less severe in Solihull and Wolverhampton.
Solihull, claiming the lowest ratio of council employees to total population
of any local authority in the country, is pruning spending plans by Pounds
2.6m, but is well within its capping limits. It does not forecast 'swingeing
redundancies'.
Wolverhampton went through a significant cost-cutting exercise last year.
when Pounds 12m was sliced from the budget and 600 jobs were lost.
In the coming year the council will cut a further Pounds 7m from the budget,
but has 356 applications for voluntary redundancy and expects compulsory
redundancies to be low because of natural wastage.
In absolute terms, the largest number of job losses among authorities in the
Birmingham-Black Country conurbation will be in Birmingham where, before
Christmas, the council predicted 3,000 voluntary or compulsory redundancies.
Since then the council has found greater flexibility.
It has convinced the government that mistakes of statistical interpretation
were made in its standard spending assessment - the amount the government
thinks a local authority should spend. This boosts its assessment to Pounds
887.8m for 1993-94 from Pounds 879m.
Although this will probably not affect the number of posts Birmingham will
lose, it should mean that cuts will be made with greater sensitivity and not
imposed across the board.
In contrast, Walsall has little flexibility. According to Mr Mike Bird, the
Conservative leader, Pounds 40m needs to be saved over the next two years to
bring the budget under control.
Charging that the previous Labour administration 'robbed the balances', Mr
Bird described the present budgetary situation as 'quite frightening'.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Council tax may bring lower bills
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE average council tax bill in England will be lower than the poll tax per
household, according to Local Government Chronicle. Its study of more than
half the councils in England suggests the average council tax bill from
April will be Pounds 505. Allowing for inflation, that is lower than the
average household poll tax of Pounds 500.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Howe warns of increased taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HOWE, the former Conservative chancellor, yesterday predicted that the
government would have to raise taxes if it was to control public sector
borrowing, Emma Tucker writes.
The election promise to keep taxes low in an economy that encourages free
enterprise would have to stand as a 'medium and long-term pledge', he said.
'It is most important that the government should keep its borrowing
requirement under control and the prospect of borrowing more than Pounds 1bn
a week in the year ahead must be something the chancellor is concerned
with,' he added.
Lord Howe said on BBC radio that a recovery began shortly after he put up
taxes in his 1981 Budget, a fact which should be taken seriously by Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor. 'Sooner rather than later is the right time
to change taxes,' he said. 'Increases are tough, but sometimes necessary.'

FT  08 JAN 93 / Menem spends to cut poverty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem, bolstered by figures showing inflation
at its lowest level in 20 years, yesterday unveiled a Dollars 1.5bn package
to improve the lot of the poor, the old and very young.
The package coincides with a popularity offensive by Mr Menem to amend the
constitution so he can stand for re-election when his term ends in 1995. His
government is now aiming for a sweeping victory in September's mid-term
congressional elections to secure two-thirds of the seats in the Chamber of
Deputies, the lower house. The amendment requires a two-thirds majority of
Congress.
Mr Menem, who is more than halfway through his six-year presidential term,
has sound opinion poll ratings, although his popularity has been declining
over recent months. Pollsters say low inflation remains the key to any
politician's popularity, but public opinion is focusing on poverty, falling
real incomes and worsening social services.
The government has already raised this year's spending estimate by 17.4 per
cent to Dollars 39.65bn, a figure Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, says
cannot be increased. Officials insist that funds for the social package have
already been allocated in the budget.
Government figures published this week showed retail prices rose by only 0.3
per cent in December, bringing the inflation rate for 1992 down to 17.5 per
cent from 84 per cent for 1991. Wholesale prices rose even more slowly: last
year's index rose 3.1 per cent, and wholesale prices actually fell 0.7 per
cent in December.
This modest rise in wholesale prices is allowing Mr Cavallo to argue that
companies' export competitiveness is not at risk, and that there is
therefore no need for a devaluation of the peso, fixed against the dollar
since April 1991. Mr Menem is weakening the power of the unions by breaking
their hold on workers' health and social security services by throwing them
open to competition. The services, funded by compulsory payroll deductions
worth billions of dollars a year, are a pillar of union power and a source
of corruption.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US must do more to improve the career prospects of the three quarters of
Americans who do not graduate from college, Mr Robert Reich, labour
secretary-designate, said in Senate confirmation hearings yesterday. The
task was not just to create more jobs but higher-quality ones.
He expected the Labour Department to play a more prominent economic role in
the new administration. Global economic integration meant the 'American
workforce is coming to be the American economy'.
Mr Reich, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government, provided much of
the intellectual input for President-elect Bill Clinton's economic plan,
Putting People First. Having known Mr Clinton well since both were at Oxford
in the 1960s, he is expected to enjoy greater access to the president than
previous labour secretaries.
Mr Reich said his first goal was to provide a path to good jobs for the 75
per cent of young people who do not complete four years of college. This
involved easing the 'school to work' transition for less academic students
and putting greater emphasis on certification and standards so 'employers
know what they are getting'.
Other goals would include helping displaced workers find new jobs and
fostering business organisations that provided career ladders for less well
educated employees.
He also intended to promote 'family friendly' employment. US employers
needed to pay more attention to issues like parental leave, child care,
elder care and pensions.
Mr Reich said the US also needed to review unemployment insurance provisions
which had been designed to cater for short business cycle fluctuations. Much
unemployment today tended to be long-term and structural.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Aspin warns defence cuts will be difficult
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton's choice to be the next secretary of defence
warned yesterday that the new administration might find it difficult to cut
defence spending by even as much as projected by departing President George
Bush, let alone achieve the bigger savings Mr Clinton wants.
Mr Les Aspin, previously chairman of the House of Representatives armed
services committee, reiterated the Clinton team's goal of cutting an extra
Dollars 60bn (Pounds 39.4bn) over the next five years from the Bush defence
budget, which itself includes big reductions.
But Mr Aspin and Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services
committee, warned that the budget baseline figures used by the Bush
administration, which show Dollars 280.5bn of defence and national security
spending in fiscal 1994, might be unreliable.
Mr Nunn said it would be impossible to pay for a 450-ship navy, as planned
by the Bush administration, with the money currently allocated.
The attack on the Bush defence budget projections echoed more general
criticism voiced earlier this week by Mr Clinton of his predecessor's
overall budget legacy.
Mr Bush's pro forma budget for 1994 shows a record deficit of Dollars
327.4bn this year, dipping slightly before climbing again to Dollars 319.8bn
in 1998.
Mr Clinton accused the outgoing administration of camouflaging the gravity
of the outlook for the deficit, which he said would, if left unchecked,
'soar above Dollars 400bn near the end of the decade'.
Mr Aspin acknowledged that it would not be easy to achieve further defence
savings, but said it would be possible to reshape forces at a lower level
than envisioned in Mr Bush's 'Base Force' while maintaining their
effectiveness.
'The Bush administration had presented a force and a budget that took
cognisance of one revolutionary development in our international security
picture - the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, but not another - the dissolution
of the Soviet Union itself. It was a one-revolution budget in a
two-revolution world,' Mr Aspin said in answers for his Senate confirmation
hearings.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Brazilian taxation reform for debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN congressmen are to cut short their summer recess and return next
Monday to a special session of Congress which has tax reform as its central
issue.
The session will be an early test for President Itamar Franco's strategy. He
hopes to succeed during his two-year term by building consensus among
legislators and opinion leaders, in contrast to the obdurate approach of his
predecessor, Mr Fernando Collor de Mello, who resigned last week.
The government is seeking additional tax revenues to reduce the budget
deficit and to provide funds for social and infrastructure spending. It
hopes that further changes in the tax code, together with already-approved
adjustments in business income taxes, will bring it Dollars 12bn (Pounds
7.8bn) more in revenues this year.
The main proposal under consideration includes a levy on financial
transactions, called a cheque tax, of 0.25 per cent. It would also simplify
the dozens of individual levies in the Brazilian tax code. The
administration is also considering a tax on company assets.
A constitutional amendment, requiring two-thirds approval of both chambers,
will be necessary if any new levies are to be implemented this year. The
constitution stipulates that new taxes can only take effect in the 'fiscal
period' subsequent to the one in which they are passed.
One attorney speculated that the administration might try to skirt the need
to change the constitution by defining each month as a 'fiscal period' and
applying the tax in February if passed this month. If so, he predicted a
flurry of company lawsuits.
A bill approved by Congress in December lowered corporate tax rates from 30
to 25 per cent. However, many companies, especially those showing losses,
will pay more because financial and operational income will be taxed
separately. With Brazil's high interest rates, even money-losing companies
have significant income from financial investments.
The government hopes to obtain Dollars 5.2bn of the Dollars 12bn it says it
needs through this mechanism. The National Confederation of Industry is
threatening to go to court.
Some observers believe higher taxes could reinforce a vicious circle of
higher levies and growing evasion in Brazil. Brazilian tax rates are already
high.
The local subsidiary of Arthur Andersen, the US consulting firm, estimates
that in 1992, federal and local taxes combined produced a tax rate of nearly
47 per cent on business. Other tax experts have estimated evasion rates of
about 50 per cent.
Some opponents of the reform argue that the government should merely do a
better job of collecting taxes already on the books. Recent published
estimates suggest that out of an economically active population of 61m, only
7m pay personal income tax, while 55,000 companies pay 80 per cent of
corporate tax revenues due from 2m companies.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Report spells out passive smoking risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 3,000 US non-smokers die from lung cancer caused by exposure to
tobacco fumes each year. 'Second-hand' smoking produces 150,000-300,000
cases of bronchitis or pneumonia in children under 18 months each year. Up
to 15,000 of those infants end up in hospital.
These are the conclusions of a long-awaited report on 'environmental tobacco
smoke' (ETS), published yesterday by the Environmental Protection Agency,
the US federal agency responsible for air and water quality. It is an
incendiary document, guaranteed to fuel arguments about smoking's social
dangers, and to raise the possibility of tighter smoking restrictions.
The study has been a long time in the making. A draft version, suggesting
tobacco smoke was a serious carcinogen, was published in June 1990, and drew
a fierce response from the tobacco industry. In 1991, an EPA science
advisory board sent the report back for better justification of its
conclusions . A second review last summer endorsed the risk assessment.
The conclusions are on both analysis of ETS and its human 'uptake'; on a
review of some 30 statistical studies which have examined the relationship
between lung cancer and exposure to secondhand smoke in people who never
smoked; and on about 100 studies which looked at the respiratory impact of
ETS on children.
Aside from the headline conclusions - that ETS is a human lung carcinogen,
responsible for several thousand deaths a year - the EPA has also decided
that exposure to ETS increases the risk of asthma for 'normal' children, and
the severity of symptoms in children prone to asthma.
All this has prompted a sharp counter-attack by the tobacco companies.
Philip Morris called a press conference at which it reiterated claims that
the EPA had not looked at all available studies, and had tweaked some of the
normal statistical yardsticks. 'It's an example of adjusting science to fit
policy,' said Thomas Borelli, director of scientific affairs.
While statisticians and lobbyists battle over the study's merits, a more
basic question centres on the practical impact of the EPA's conclusions.
Already, rising public awareness of the health risk attached to smoking has
caused steady decline in US cigarette sales. The annual fall in unit sales
has been running at approximately 2-3 per cent, while the percentage of the
adult population which smokes has declined from over 40 per cent in 1965, to
around 25 per cent.
But US anti-smoking activists have not had everything their way. In the law
courts, 'smokers' suits' - attempting to place liability for lung cancer
deaths among smokers at the cigarette companies' doors - have conspicuously
failed.
By contrast, the effort to curtail smoking in public areas and the workplace
has been increasingly successful. Today, 46 states and the District of
Columbia have laws restricting smoking in some public places. Since the late
1980s, a handful of municipalities have also passed ordinances requiring
restaurants and/or workplaces be 100 per cent smoke-free. In 1990, Congress
banned smoking on domestic flights. In the same year, New York City outlawed
cigarette vending machines, except in bars.
But the key issue now is whether the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, part of the Labour Department and responsible for workplace
safety and worker health, feels moved to act on the EPA conclusions. To
date, apart from obvious guidelines on smoking where combustible materials
are present, it has been silent on the ETS issue. In September 1991,
however, the agency began its own examination of air quality in the
workplace, and a public comment period closed last year. The EPA
conclusions, it says, will be studied.

FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Clinton's first big challenge: meet
Salinas and save Nafta - The two men have much in common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON his maiden foray into international diplomacy, President-elect Bill
Clinton is going only one state away - to Austin, Texas, where he will today
meet Mexican President Carlos Salinas.
The two presidents will find they have much in common. Both attended
university abroad (Mr Clinton in the UK, Mr Salinas in the US) and became
young government reformers with pro-business views. Both are 'policy wonks'
 -fascinated with the technicalities of making government work. They are
both 'baby boomers' and know that unless they 'bond' swiftly, the future of
the North American Free Trade Agreement - involving the US, Mexico and
Canada - is at risk.
However, Mr Clinton assured Canada's Prime Minister Brian Mulroney by
telephone yesterday that he would not be left out of any serious discussions
with Mexico on Nafta. The meeting with Mr Salinas would only be a
'get-acquainted session'.
It was Mr Ross Perot, the independent presidential candidate, who fanned the
burning coals of public doubt about Nafta into blazing opposition during the
televised campaign debates. The quirky Texas billionaire repeatedly claimed
to hear 'a sucking sound' to the south, drawing US manufacturing jobs out of
the country.
Those who opposed the agreement - carefully cultivated by grassroots
environmental, labour and citizen groups - had little difficulty in
extracting promises from numerous congressmen to oppose the treaty. It
stands in danger of defeat.
Mr Clinton should have already won favour with the Mexican president, by
agreeing not to demand a renegotiation. Instead he promised to negotiate
'supplemental' agreements to protect the environment and labour standards
and guard against import surges.
Among Mr Clinton's Democratic supporters are three factions: business
groups, which care only that Nafta offers opportunity for new investment,
markets and cheap labour; the opponents, who believe the pact can be
improved with tough enforcement measures; and those - many in unions - who
will work to kill any deal.
There is also organised opposition in both Canada and Mexico, and the
citizens from the three countries will marry their views in a common paper
to be delivered this month.
Although there are some differences in interpretation of the Nafta text,
most opponents say the current version would depress wages and employment
levels, diminish labour rights and standards, degrade the environment and
promote massive migration and human rights violations.
'Nafta is by no stretch of the imagination free trade,' says Ms Thea Lee of
the labour-supported Economic Policy Institute. 'It is an investment
agreement and a sophisticated form of managed trade for the multinational
corporations.'
The Economic Strategy Institute, in a recent report called 'Nafta: Making it
Better', concluded that the pact as it now stands would stimulate foreign
investment in Mexico, but at the expense of US industry.
The opposition has grown so strong that Washington lobbyists acknowledge the
necessity of negotiating the side agreements and presenting them as a 'new'
Nafta, different from the one savaged by Mr Perot.
'We have to reposition the issue to take the focus away from the loss of
manufacturing jobs and focus on the overall closer economic and political
relationship between two neighbours,' says Mr Harry Freeman, a trade
lobbyist.
Those willing to accept a 'new' Nafta want one which would encourage
pollution clean-up in Mexico, raise standards of food safety, and boost the
living standards of Mexican workers. Their goal is 'the EC model' under
which countries were only admitted after democratic reforms took root and
the poorer countries are given compensatory payment for social programmes.
Mr Clinton has promised to establish a strong environmental protection
commission with substantial powers and resources to prevent and clean up
water pollution and encourage enforcement of air pollution laws.
But he has been vague about the relationship between the side agreements and
the original Nafta text. The critics will insist that this linkage be
formalised, so failure by any of the three governments to meet their
obligations on environment and labour could be punished by higher tariffs.
Mr Clinton will also have to make changes to the proposed dispute settlement
mechanism, according to Mr Alex Hittle, a spokesman for Friends of the
Earth, who is willing to support 'a Nafta with teeth'. The president-elect
apparently envisions a process under which citizen groups would take their
complaints to US officials, who would then pass them to their Mexican or
Canadian partners.
Environmentalists want the process opened to public participation. The
current text says both sides in a dispute must agree before outsiders are
brought into the process.
Mr Clinton will be leaned on hard, and he will have to press Mr Salinas, who
in turn has signalled that the price of new negotiations could be a
multi-billion-dollar fund to help pay for Mexico to develop infrastructure
and clean up its environmental. He may also reopen talks about labour
mobility.

NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, yesterday said it had won an FM700m
(Pounds 87.5m) order for a digital telephone system from Malaysia.
The five-year agreement signed with Telecom Malaysia covers the installation
of 800,000 subscriber lines and includes the costs of commissioning and
training.
The project strengthens Nokia's position in the expanding Asia-Pacific
market and enhances the development of telecommunications infrastructure in
Malaysia. It said the Asia-Pacific market now accounted for around 20 per
cent of its telecommunications activities.
Malaysia is giving top priority to the development of telecommunications
infrastructure and hopes to provide for universal access to services and to
develop a telecommunications industrial base by the year 2000. The Nokia
project is part of a plan to install some 4m subscriber lines in the next
five years.
The system being installed is the DX200 digital switching system, which is
already in place or on order in more than 20 countries, including the UK and
Sweden. The project will be implemented by a special joint venture company,
Sapura-Nokia Telecommunications, in which Nokia holds 40 per cent.
Mr Keijo Olkkola of Nokia Telecommunications said: 'The Telecom Malaysia
project is an important step for Nokia in the Asia-Pacific switching market
and marks a major expansion of Nokia's Malaysian activities.'

FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Airbus steps up Japanese discussions -
European consortium widens co-operation talks on super jumbo aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Airbus consortium is stepping up discussions with Japanese
aerospace manufacturers about possible co-operation in future Airbus
programmes, including the development of a 600-800-seat super jumbo
aircraft.
Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus chief executive, said he would visit Japan at the
end of this month for talks with Japanese aerospace officials and the three
big aerospace companies, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy
Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries.
The Japanese initiative coincides with discussions between Airbus partners
and Boeing of the US over possible co-operation in development studies for a
super jumbo aircraft.
The discussions with Boeing have been led by Deutsche Aerospace, the 37.9
per cent German partner in the European consortium. The talks with Boeing,
the world's largest maker of commercial jets and Airbus's main competitor,
have led to speculation of rising tensions inside the European consortium.
But Mr Pierson said the four Airbus partners - Aerospatiale of France,
Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - remained united
and there was 'no question of treason' inside the consortium.
He said Deutsche Aerospace received a mandate last year from the Airbus
supervisory board to conduct exploratory talks with Boeing about possible
co-operation in developing a super jumbo.
However, he acknowledged that not all Airbus members agreed on the benefits
of collaboration with Boeing and there were still serious doubts over
Boeing's motives for co-operating with the Europeans.
The question was whether individual members were conducting separate talks
with Boeing which could undermine the cohesion of the consortium, several
aerospace industry analysts suggested yesterday.
Despite Mr Pierson's confidence about the unity of the Airbus partners, the
consortium has continued to be affected by the conflicting interests and
problems of the four partners.
For this reason, Mr Pierson yesterday spoke of an urgent need to transform
the Airbus partnership into an independent public limited company so it
could operate as a conventional enterprise.
Mr Pierson cast doubt on whether a super jumbo would ever be built, saying
the technological and financial challenges were 'huge'.
Neither Airbus nor Boeing could undertake such a project on its own. For
this reason, Mr Pierson said, Airbus had approached potential Asian and
Russian partners. He indicated it was open to discussions with US
manufacturers: 'But let's not get excited. I don't know if anything will
happen and if there will be a larger new aircraft at all.'
But Mr Pierson said his main concern was not so much the discussions on the
development of a super jumbo as the immediate challenge of competing against
Boeing on current airline business and ensuring Airbus was efficiently
coping with the aerospace industry slowdown.
He said he saw no signs of a recovery in the civil aerospace business this
year or in 1994.
Airbus last year had sales of Dollars 7.6bn (Pounds 5bn) compared with
Dollars 7.7bn in 1991. It expects an increase to Dollars 8.7bn this year.
Although the consortium suffered cancellations from Northwest Airlines, it
won 136 new aircraft orders last year, compared with 101 in 1991.
But the slump in the airline industry has forced it to scale down its
production rate. Airbus output is expected to total 150 aircraft this year
compared with 157 last year and will now grow to only about 170 aircraft in
1995, down from an original target of 220.

FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Tanabu to debate rice issue with EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Masami Tanabu, Japan's agriculture minister, plans to visit Brussels next
week to argue the country's case that rice should be excluded from trade
liberalisation under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
The Japanese government has said 'flexibility' will be shown in handling the
issue of rice imports, but Mr Tanabu is under pressure from farmers' groups
to show the government is defending their interests in the Uruguay Round.
However, his ministry has already begun studying methods of compensating
farmers affected by liberalisation of the rice market, and newspaper opinion
polls suggest a large majority of Japanese are in favour of a market
opening.
Mr Tanabu is to attend a January 15 meeting of Japanese and EC ministers,
which will also be attended by Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, and
Mr Yoshiro Mori, the new minister of international trade and industry.
The Japanese ministers will want also to discuss the recent confusion over
whether Italy and France intended to ban imports of Japanese cars.

FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: France confirms Taiwan jets sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSE trade relations between the US, France and China worsened yesterday
when Paris officially confirmed the sale of 60 Mirage jet fighters to
Taiwan, which has also bought US-made F-16 fighters.
The French deal, the latest step in the island's efforts to bolster its
defences against China's growing military power, has attracted Chinese anger
since it first emerged in Taiwanese press reports last November. Until
yesterday, the French government refused to acknowledge the sale.
'The French government's approval for the sale of these fighters to Taiwan
has caused serious deterioration to relations and gravely damaged their
foundations,' the Chinese Foreign Ministry said yesterday.
Mr Li Lanqing, Chinese trade minister, said Beijing did not rule out steps
against the US, which last year authorised the sale of 150 F-16 jet fighters
to the island, over which China claims sovereignty.
Until yesterday, China had given no indication that it might widen its
retaliation against French business interests to embrace the US. Over the
past month, China has ordered France to close its consulate in the southern
city of Guangzhou, the economic capital of one of the world's fastest
growing regions and banned French companies from a Dollars 1bn subway
project there.
The sale of Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn) worth of Mirage fighters, plus
1,500 missiles bringing the total contract value to Dollars 3.8bn, is a
lifeline for the prime contractor, the Dassault aerospace group. Dassault
has not had a military export order for four years.
It brings to an end a long French government wrangle between the defence,
industry and trade ministries, keen to further the ailing interests of the
French aerospace industry, and a cautious foreign ministry, unwilling to
jeopardise relations with such a powerful ally as China.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Dangers behind the stand-off with Iraq: Saddam Hussein
continues to call the tune in spite of the latest sabre rattling by the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERVERSITY of Middle East politics makes it probable that the longer the
confrontation lasts between President Saddam Hussein and the western allies
the greater will be the benefit to the Iraqi leader and others who want to
undermine the more conservative regimes in the region.
The US, Britain and France would be bound to react militarily if
surface-to-air missiles were to remain in the exclusion zone imposed south
of the 32nd parallel last August. The missiles threaten allied aircraft and,
like yesterday's skirmish at the Kuwaiti border, appear designed to provoke
a response.
Limited air strikes against the missile batteries would make little
difference to the situation on the ground and will not assist the Shia
population in the south. Politically it seems unlikely to hasten Mr Saddam's
departure.
However, in the wider Islamic context, any allied action could be presented
in a very partial light. Further bombing of Mr Saddam's forces will contrast
sharply with the perceived Allied indifference to the fate of Moslems in
former Yugoslavia. Such vigorous western insistence on Iraqi compliance with
UN resolutions will be set alongside the toleration of Israel's rejection of
UN resolution 799 demanding that Israel takes back 415 Palestinians it
ejected from the occupied territories.
The west's friends in the Middle East were unhappy about the southern air
exclusion zone when it was imposed. They feared the start of a process which
would divide Iraq into three: the autonomous Kurdish region in the north,
the Shias in the south, and the central portion controlled from Baghdad.
Iranian officials point out that the two air exclusion zones incorporate the
areas where Iraq's main oil fields and pumping stations are located, Kirkuk
in the north and Basra in the south.
They choose to see the US-led action as an extension of its policy to secure
control of Middle East oil supplies, with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia having
already in effect been militarily occupied.
Kuwait, which will always feel vulnerable to its northern neighbour, is the
only Gulf country which fully backs an American military presence. The fear
for other countries, in particular Saudi Arabia, is that the allied air
forces and navies are becoming a fixture.
After the Kuwait crisis it was with a sense of huge relief that the ruling
family in Saudi Arabia watched the bulk of the US forces depart. The
financial damage to the nation's exchequer had been substantial but the
social and political fabric had survived with no more than a containable
backlash from the more extreme clergy.
Evidence of Saudi sensitivity to international attention was again evident
when visa requests from American journalists were refused last summer as US
aircraft returned to Saudi bases to police southern Iraq.
Now, more than ever, there is no obvious cut-off point or moment when
victory could be declared and the Shias said to be safe from persecution.
Worse than that, Saddam Hussein will see it in his interest to keep a US
military force in the region as a way of deflecting attention in Baghdad
from worsening economic conditions. In such an open-ended situation it is
the Iraqi leader who can call the tune, while it may be the western allies
who ultimately suffer more from their response.

A Commonwealth-brokered plan to defuse political tensions in Kenya by
arranging a meeting between President Daniel arap Moi and opposition leaders
appeared to have collapsed last night, writes Michael Holman in Nairobi.
The country's newly formed opposition alliance ended five days of talks with
the announcement that they would take up their parliamentary seats following
last month's elections, but failed to say how they would make good their
threat to prevent Mr Moi exercising power.
Britain and the Commonwealth observer group came under sharp attack by the
opposition, which said it 'abhors' Whitehall's qualified acceptance of the
outcome of the election.

<TEXT>
RESIDENTIAL property prices in Tokyo fell 14.5 per cent last year, the
largest fall since an annual industry survey of prices began in 1979, and a
sign of the pressure on financial institutions heavily exposed to the
property market, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
The MRD Nationwide Real Estate Information Centre said the sharp fall in
Tokyo prices followed a decline last year of 13.5 per cent, while houses on
the fringe of the metropolitan area saw a drop of 30 per cent in price.
Prices in Osaka, the second largest city, fell 9.8 per cent, and officials
at the centre said further declines are expected this year in both Tokyo and
Osaka, as soundings of customer intentions suggested that many are not yet
ready to enter the market.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Algerians ponder sad prospect of more of the same: Political
stalemate and economic stagnation in France's former colony are as
entrenched as ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON JANUARY 11 last year, Algeria was plunged into crisis: the president
resigned and the country's new leadership suspended elections, in effect
declaring war on the opposition Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which was
poised to win a second round of voting.
One year on, Algeria's problems seem further than ever from resolution.
Hardly a day goes by without members of the security forces and Islamic
fundamentalists killing each other. The troops and gendarmerie have failed
to destroy what the prime minister, Mr Belaid Abdessalam, has called the
'spider's web' of Moslem radical groups - many of whom appear to operate
independently of the FIS.
Allegations of torture, which have been growing since a law in autumn
allowing detention for ten days (often longer in reality) are making
Algerians fearful that practices they thought had been abandoned after the
bloody riots of October 1988 are back.
New special security units are known locally as Ninjas because they operate
clad in balaclava-type headgear leaving only their eyes visible.
The atmosphere in Algiers is further darkened by tighter government control
on the media. Since last summer, articles attacking France, which senior
Algerians suspect of taking a lenient attitude towards FIS activists, have
become common. Some newspapers have even gone so far as to accuse France of
being behind the murder of the former head of state, Mr Mohammed Boudiaf,
who was gunned down by a member of his bodyguard last June.
This at a time when they they are hoping to convince the authorities in
Paris to refinance part of Algeria's FFr30bn (Pounds 3.6bn) debt owed to
France. Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, is due to arrive today
in the first visit by a senior official from the former colonial power since
the killing of Mr Boudiaf.
Perhaps understandably, western leaders are as confused as ever as to how to
deal with Algeria. The view is widespread that a FIS victory would have been
both the beginning and the end of Algerian democracy - that it would have
been a case, as a senior US official, Mr Edward Djerejian, put it last
October, of 'one person, one vote, one time.'
Those who lead Algeria today, whether civilian or military, are by no means
all corrupt. But for the many ordinary Algerians who have neither home nor
job, officials are seen as having enjoyed good jobs, travel and education
abroad for their children. The common view of the haves by the have-nots is
'Ils ont bouffe' (they have been eating, or helping themselves). Bitterness
has increased by the sight of the middle classes voting with their feet.
Even those who fought France between 1954 and 1962 are queueing up for
French passports.
As for the Lazarus-like resurrection of Mr Abdessalam, who was Algeria's
economic overlord throughout the 1965-78 reign of the late President Houari
Boumediene and who was appointed prime minister last July, it poses more
questions than it answers. A hard-working man who brooks no contradiction
and whose personal integrity has never been questioned, Mr Abdessalam was
the original architect of Algeria's energy and industrial policies. While
the country's gas sector became a success under his guidance, its dash for
industrialisation is widely held to have been a failure.
Over the past six months, little has happened in the economic sphere Imports
are now tightly controlled as Mr Abdessalem sees this as the best way to
manage scarce resources. But a 70 per cent debt service ratio leaves his
government scant room for manoeuvre to import the raw materials necessary to
increase industrial output, currently running at only half of capacity, and
cut unemployment.
The government has made progress in improving its payments record. Over the
past two years, commercial arrears have been reduced from over dollars 800m
to as low as dollars 50m and one year credits by half to dollars 900m. Hard
currency reserves stand at dollars 1.5bn.
This policy has been made possible by the refinancing of commercial bank
debt and bilateral debt with Italy completed last year. Algeria has not
broken with the IMF as many had feared. But last week's visit to Algiers by
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, does not mean the two parties
will reach agreement easily.
Whatever reforms the prime minister proposes, he faces an uphill task in
selling them, complicated by the fact that he is operating in a political
vacuum. The national assembly remains dissolved. Most town councils have
been suspended. The government refuses to talk to the fundamentalists - and
to the two main secular opposition parties, the Front de Liberation
National, which until 1988 was Algeria's only political party, and the Front
des Forces Socialistes, whose support is drawn from the Kabyle Berbers in
and around Algiers.
It is a deeply unstable mix, and one that leads some observers to wonder how
long the army will sit by and watch. It was the army that gave power to Mr
Abdessalam, and the army could take it away. The problem is that the army
itself may be as divided as Algerian society.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Suharto budget makes hefty cut in fuel subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia yesterday unveiled a budget for 1993-94 which
allowed a marginal increase in government expenditure but included the
removal of Rp3,000bn (Pounds 950m) in domestic fuel oil subsidies.
Mr Suharto said Indonesia, Asia's largest oil and gas exporter, should
prepare for a 'fundamental change' in its economy. By the end of the century
it would become a net importer of oil, he said.
The scale of the fuel price increases for the home market were not
specified, but donors such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have
argued for the abolition of fuel subsidies.
'The price increase in fuel oils will be followed by similar increases in
electricity tariffs and transport costs,' he said. To cushion the blow for
public sector employees, Mr Suharto announced a rise in civil service and
Armed Forces wages of 12-18 per cent.
Mr Suharto forecast state revenue in 1993-94 would grow 11.1 per cent to
Rp62,322bn, more than the rate of inflation currently running at about 6 per
cent a year. Higher revenue is forecast from oil exports, accounting for 29
per cent of total revenue, with a budgeted price of Dollars 18 per barrel.
Income tax receipts are expected to rise 36 per cent to Rp14,848bn.
Economists warn both targets may be optimistic.
The budget forecasts aid from foreign donors in 1993-94 of Rp9,553bn and
puts the cost of servicing the Dollars 50bn public foreign debt at
Rp16,425bn. By law, government expenditure must not exceed revenue. The
President Suharto announced over Rp3,000bn for road construction and power
sector, education and agriculture schemes.
A budget of Rp660bn was also announced for science and technology, although
donors say actual funding for state-owned industries involved in aircraft,
shipping, telecommunication and munitions manufacturing is much higher.
Mr Suharto said the current account deficit in the fiscal year beginning in
April would be Dollars 3.2bn, down from a forecast Dollars 3.8bn in fiscal
1992.
He said 1992 had been a year of mixed fortunes with 'strong inflationary
pressures, a substantial current account deficit and a flow of commercial
offshore loans which has almost exceeded the safe limit'.
On the positive side non-oil/gas exports rose by nearly 25 per cent to over
Dollars 14bn in the first 10 months of last year. This had 'strengthened our
confidence' in deregulation which would be expanded to other sectors such as
agriculture, he said.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Israel lets Red Cross visit Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday made its first concession on the fate of 415 Palestinians
expelled to south Lebanon, agreeing to allow two Red Cross officials to
visit the encampment where the alleged Islamic fundamentalist militants have
been stranded for three weeks in freezing conditions.
The announcement came shortly before a senior UN envoy was due in Jerusalem
to make a second attempt to persuade Israel to abide by Security Council
Resolution 799 demanding that those expelled be allowed to return home.
Premier Yitzhak Rabin was apparently trying to fend off international
pressure over the expulsions by making a concession on humanitarian supplies
to the 415. But there was no sign he was willing to back down on his refusal
to allow the men to return.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said two delegates would be
allowed to travel by UN helicopter from Israeli-held territory to the
encampment. But the visit would be only to assess conditions and would not
include delivery of food or medicines.
Lebanon has refused to allow the Palestinians to go deeper into the country
or receive supplies, saying they were Israel's responsibility. Israel
refuses to allow supplies through unless Lebanon does likewise.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak said they hoped the visit of Mr Chinmaya Gharekhan, an adviser to Dr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, would lead to a breakthrough on
the expulsions.
Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, leader of the Palestinian negotiating team at the
Washington peace talks, refused yesterday to return to the talks until those
expelled were allowed home.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Allies confident of air superiority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, France and Britain have been able to wield the threat of
overwhelming air power to back up the UN's ultimatum to Iraq over the recent
deployment of anti-aircraft missiles in the country's southern no-fly zone,
writes David White, Defence Correspondent.
More than 200 US, French and British combat aircraft deployed within
striking distance of Iraq provide a force considered by the US defence
department to be easily sufficient for a punitive action.
Three-quarters of these fighters and bombers are based in Saudi Arabia,
including 20 F-117A 'Stealth' aircraft - the type that led the air attacks
on Baghdad in January 1991 - stationed at the southwestern base of Khamis
Mushayt. Aircraft concentrated at Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia include US
Air Force F-15s and F-16s as well as F/A-18s and F-14 Tomcats disembarked
from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, currently in the Gulf.
The US also has specialised anti-radar aircraft in place - versions of the
F-111 and F-4 - equipped with jamming equipment and Harm anti-radar
missiles.
Other aircraft at Dhahran include six British Tornado bombers recently
arrived from Bruggen in Germany, and eight French Mirage 2000 fighters. The
three allies also have some 52 combat aircraft at Incirlik in southeastern
Turkey.
The Iraqi air-defence missiles which have given rise to the latest
confrontation provide relatively easily targets. The Soviet-made SA-2 and
SA-3 are weapons of 1960s vintage, both guided by radar. If the radars were
emitting they would be attacked with Harm missiles or the British
equivalent, the Alarm.

GENERAL Mohamed Farrar Aideed, Somalia's strongest warlord, last night caved
in to pressure and agreed a tentative outline for a national peace
conference after US Marines dealt him a devastating military blow in
Mogadishu.
Delegates at the exploratory Somali peace talks in the Ethiopian capital
said the 57-year-old general, who has been blocking agreement between 15
factions since Monday, had finally agreed to three out of a five point
proposal.
The points accepted include an immediate nationwide cease fire and the
convening of a national political reconciliation conference either in
Mogadishu or Addis Ababa in late April. Yet to be agreed are a list of
participants to the conference and an agenda.
The breakthrough came after US Marines, backed by M1-A1 tanks and Cobra
helicopter gun ships, blasted two compounds housing gunmen loyal to Gen
Aideed and captured an arsenal of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, battle
wagons and heavy artillery pieces.
Delegates said both the US military action in Mogadishu and an eleventh hour
intervention by Mr Meles Zenawi, the Ethiopian President, had persuaded Gen
Aideed that if he did not join the growing consensus at the exploratory
peace conference he would be completely isolated.
But they warned that Gen Aideed could easily reverse his position. 'He has
agreed tonight because of the pressure he is under,' said Mr Mohamed Farrar
Siad, a member of self styled interim President Ali Mahdi's delegation. 'But
the problem remains that Aideed wants the presidency and everything decided
here could affect that ambition. He could change his face tomorrow ..we are
in dialogue with an abnormal person.'
Yesterday's dawn assault in northwest Mogadishu, which saw a 20 minute
exchange of fire, was the most biggest military strike by US forces since
they landed in Somalia last month and marks a new 'get tough' approach to
Somalia's armed factions.
There were no figures available last night for the number of casualties on
the Somali side, but one Marine was wounded.
Hours before the last minute agreement delegates from other factions could
hardly hide their joy at the way the general's wings had been clipped by US
forces. 'Good,' said Mr Ali Mahdi, Somalia's self-styled interim president
and Gen Aideed's arch rival. 'It's very nice.'
The warlords and political leaders are expected to sign a commitment today
to hold a reconciliation conference but it is possible agreement may take
several more days.

<TEXT>
PARLIAMENTARY approval of constitutional amendments to Germany's liberal
asylum laws is expected to be postponed until next month because of concern
among legal experts that they are incompatible with the European Community's
Dublin and Schengen agreements.
Those agreements, which have yet to be ratified by all EC member states, are
aimed at regulating the status of refugees in any EC country. In essence,
they state that the EC country which issues a visa to a refugee or would-be
asylum seeker, is responsible for that person even if he or she enters
another EC country in transit.
However, amendments worked out last December between the ruling Christian
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and Free Democrats coalition
government, and the opposition Social Democratic Party in response to the
rise in right-wing violence against foreigners, might mean that Germany
would not be able to participate in the Dublin and Schengen agreements.
One main amendments to the asylum law, enshrined in Article 16 of the
constitution, says Germany has the right to send back any person entering
the country from a safe neighbouring third country, including Poland, the
Czech republic and the Slovak republic. Over 70 per cent of asylum seekers
arrive in Germany by land, some 10 per cent by airport.

FT  08 JAN 93 / No further nuclear armscuts in view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VEXED issue of whether British and French nuclear arsenals should be
included in the arms control process may not have to be addressed for some
years, a senior US official indicated yesterday.
Mr Ronald Lehman, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
said he did not expect a further round of nuclear arms cuts for the time
being. Implementation of this month's Start 2 treaty, designed to reduce US
and Soviet strategic stockpiles to 3,000-3,500 warheads each, would 'keep us
quite busy'.
The priority for the US was to reach agreement on help to Russia so that the
Start cuts, not due to be completed until 2003, could be accelerated. On
widening nuclear disarmament, he said: 'We have had enough difficulty
dealing with the US, the Soviet Union and now Russia. It may be a bit
premature talking about the next leap.'
The Start 2 pact rested on assuming all strategic weapons held in Ukraine,
Belarus and Kazakhstan would be gone within the seven-year completion period
of the original Start 1 pact of 1991. Speaking on a Worldnet satellite TV
link, Mr Lehman was sure Ukraine would join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty. The US had pledges that all short-range nuclear arms formerly
dispersed around the Soviet republics had been accounted for.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Milosevic seen as key to peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen have called for Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to attend 'last chance' peace talks on Bosnia-Hercegovina due to
resume in Geneva on Sunday.
The two international mediators wrote yesterday to Mr Dobrica Cosic,
president of the rump Yugoslavia, suggesting he 'consider' including Mr
Milosevic in his delegation to the talks, seen as a last chance to avoid
international military intervention in Bosnia.
The Serbian president, a hardline nationalist, is widely blamed for helping
to foment the civil war in Bosnia but has not thus far had any formal role
in the peace negotiations.
The mediators' move follows Mr Milosevic's apparently positive response in
talks in Belgrade on Wednesday to their proposals for a constitutional
settlement for Bosnia based on a decentralised state with 10 autonomous
provinces.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen, who co-chair the international conference on
ex-Yugoslavia, are hoping he can persuade the Bosnian Serbs to drop their
demand for a 'state-within-a-state'.
The first session of peace negotiations bringing together for the first time
the leaders of the three warring factions adjourned on Monday after the
Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said he needed to consult
Belgrade.
The Moslem-led Bosnian government also refused to sign the three documents
prepared by the mediators, mainly because it disputes some provincial
boundaries, but it is under intense international pressure to settle. The
Bosnian Croats have already signed.
At the UN in New York President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia evoked memories
of the appeasement of Hitler and compared himself to Czechoslovak president
Eduard Benes, whose country was gobbled up by Nazi Germany.
In Zagreb, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister of Denmark, which holds
the EC presidency, ruled out full military intervention in Bosnia but said
more force could be used under UN mandate to protect aid missions and uphold
UN resolutions.
Reuter adds from Sarajevo: Bosnian Serbs and Moslems resumed fighting in
earnest in central Sarajevo after a lull earlier yesterday.
The area around the parliament building and the border river of Miljacka
dividing the Serb and Moslem lines rang with artillery shots and small arms
fire.

FT  08 JAN 93 / West German jobless total grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE combined effects of harsh winter weather and recession pushed 150,000
west Germans out of work last month, raising the jobless total to more than
2m. Numbers on short time surged by 180,000, the federal labour office said
yesterday.
Mr Heinrich Franke, labour office president, who recently forecast average
unemployment this year of 2.1m, blamed the weather for the sharp increase.
The seasonally-adjusted total for December was 1.97m, up just 20,000, he
said.
However, the critical underlying trend in the labour market was highlighted
by the jump in short-time working and figures from the federal statistics
office which showed that numbers employed in the west fell during November
for the first time since the mid-1980s.
German industry's capacity to create jobs faded markedly during the year as
economic decline accelerated and companies unveiled medium-term plans to
slash tens of thousands of jobs.
Some 650,000 people were effectively laid off during the month compared with
478,000 in November and 173,000 in December, 1991. The figure was swollen by
leading vehicle makers which sent workers home before Christmas for extended
breaks.
According to the labour office, the average unemployment rate in west
Germany last year was 6.4 per cent compared with 5.7 per cent in 1991. In
the former East Germany the number unemployed in December was 1.1m, barely
changed on the month, although a little below the year's average of 1.17m.
Mr Franke pointed out that a further 355,000 easterners were still occupied
in state-funded work-creation schemes during the month. The labour market
was 'stagnant,' he said, and there was still no sign of any improvement.

THE next two weeks will see a sharp increase in the tempo of negotiations to
agree a 'solidarity pact' in Germany, between central and local government,
opposition, trade unions and employers, before the end of the month.
Senior officials said yesterday that Chancellor Helmut Kohl remained
committed to the idea of a broad agreement on budget cuts, wage restraint
and increased private-sector investment, in order to boost the east German
economy.
It would be submitted to the parties in the German Bundestag by the end of
January.
A deal is seen as essential to pave the way for a cut in interest rates by
the Bundesbank. The bank has been insisting on clear evidence of wage
restraint from the unions, and budget discipline from central and local
government, before it relaxes its tight monetary policy.
Government and trade union officials dismissed claims yesterday by
opposition Social Democrats that the negotiations had collapsed because of
the insistence of Mr Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel, his finance minister, that
savings must include significant cuts in social spending.
The need for social spending cuts is one main conflict area, while another
is how to share the burden of spending cuts between the central government,
the 16 federal Lander, and local authorities. How far the trade unions can
go in publicly committing themselves to wage restraint, in both east and
west Germany, is also open to question.
The first round of talks of the year is scheduled for the weekend, when Mr
Waigel will meet a committee of finance ministers from the Lander in
Stuttgart, to try to agree on measures to keep their spending plans to a
maximum 3 per cent growth. If they fail, Mr Kohl will be advised by his
officials to take over the negotiations.
Talks also begin today on a public-sector pay deal. The trade unions are
seeking a pay rise of up to 5.5 per cent, while the government side wants to
keep the increase to a maximum 3 per cent.
The most obvious sign of progress in the solidarity pact talks has been the
agreement by Mr Kohl to draw up a new industrial policy for east Germany.
The aim is to preserve 'core industries', even if they cannot immediately be
sold off to the private sector.
The problem remains to define which industries can be saved, and how long to
give them to restructure before cutting off support.
Officials say a general willingness exists in the business sector to step up
investment in east Germany, provided a clear commitment is made by the trade
union side on wage restraint. The pact could end up as a joint declaration
of all participants, or a series of independent declarations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission's effort to beef up the EC's foreign affairs
portfolio has run into difficulties, with commissioners and civil servants
jockeying for power.
Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK commissioner responsible for trade
relations, tried to clear up the confusion during a lunch yesterday with Mr
Hans van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister who holds the external
political portfolio.
EC officials described the talks as amicable, but predicted that Commission
president Jacques Delors would have to step in to settle differences between
Sir Leon and Mr van den Broek, both political heavyweights.
The turf battle was caused by the Commission's decision to split the
external affairs portfolio previously held by Mr Frans Andriessen, the
long-serving senior Dutch Commissioner who departed last month.
Mr van den Broek inherited external political relations and the lead role in
'enlargement' talks with applicants for EC membership - Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Norway. Sir Leon, previously responsible for competition, is to
handle trade relations with industrial nations, including the Gatt
multilateral trade talks, anti-dumping policy and aid to eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union. Last month, both men stressed their common liberal
and 'Atlanticist' views, but difficulties have arisen over the allocation of
duties.
One model is to divide the civil service according to geographic regions.
Others prefer a split between politics and economics, with Mr van den Broek
effectively the EC's 'political supremo' - an ambition he clearly outlined
at the first full meeting of the Commission on Wednesday when he spoke at
length about the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and the plight of Palestinian
refugees stranded in southern Lebanon.
But EC officials admit that the world is not carved up so easily. For
example, Sir Leon is expected to lead the EC side when a high-level Japanese
delegation arrives in Brussels on January 15 for talks on trade, investment
and the global economy. Moreover, some countries such as Korea and Mexico
resist being classed as developing countries, which are the responsibility
of a third commissioner, Mr Manuel Marin of Spain.
The result is that no one in Brussels is sure which commissioner is directly
responsible for relations.
To add to confusion, a new recruit to the Commission is Mr Joao de Deus
Pinheiro, the highly regarded former Portuguese foreign minister who is
expected to pitch in on foreign affairs. 'At this rate, we will have to
organise a peace conference in Brussels to settle the differences,' quipped
one observer.

FT  08 JAN 93 / French industry given Pounds 1.3bn VAT lifeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday threw a FFr11bn (Pounds 1.33bn) lifeline to
businesses, to help them through the high interest rates needed to defend
the franc.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, announced that companies will be
able to claim back a proportion of value added tax on their monthly
purchases faster than before. Companies can in their February VAT returns
deduct 10 per cent of the VAT due on their January purchases, on top of the
deductions on December purchases that would normally figure in next month's
returns.
They will be able to make the same advance deductions in future months, said
Mr Beregovoy. This would 'lighten company charges and limit the consequences
of the temporary rise in interest rates,' said the Budget Ministry.
The measure received a cool welcome from the Patronat employers'
association, which called it 'partial and limited' despite the fact that
employers lobbied unsuccessfully for just such assistance in last autumn's
budget. It will further increase the current year's government deficit,
already set at FFr165bn in the budget.
French interest rates are among the highest in real terms in Europe. On
Tuesday the central bank raised one of its official rates to fend off fresh
speculation against the French franc. The government's hard franc policy
obliges it to wait for a significant drop in German rates before it responds
to demands from business and some members of the right wing opposition for
lower French borrowing costs, seen as badly needed to stimulate the flagging
economy and reverse the growth in unemployment.
Industrial investment will show no real recovery this year after falling by
5 per cent in 1992, according to a study earlier this week by Banque
Nationale de Paris. BNP expects French companies' operating profits to rise
by 1 per cent this year, a marked slowdown from the 4 per cent rise of last
year.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Germany cedes the lead on European rates: How inflation
robbed Frankfurt of its place as the EC's interest policy model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING most of the 14 years of operation of the European Monetary System
(EMS), one country habitually has had the EC's lowest short-term interest
rates: Germany.
As part of the seismic shift in the European monetary landscape caused by
the strains of German re-unification, that has changed.
Beset by an inflation rate of close to 4 per cent - twice as high as the
Bundesbank would like - and a high budget deficit, Germany has lost its
place as the Community's interest rate paradigm.
With Europe suffering its period of slowest growth for more than a decade,
all countries are easing their monetary policies. But Germany - as was
underlined by the low-profile action from the Bundesbank yesterday - is
adopting a more cautious stance than the others.
D-Mark interest rates are therefore being undercut by a number of countries
both within and outside the exchange rate mechanism.
The Bundesbank's main obligation is to control German inflation, not to
solve the difficulties of weaker currencies in the EMS. The central bank is
still far from confident that German inflationary pressures have been
brought under control.
Among the 17 members of the EC and the European Free Trade Association, only
five - Austria (4.1 per cent), Italy (4.7 per cent), Spain (5.2 per cent),
Portugal (8.7 per cent) and Greece (15.9 per cent) - have higher inflation
rates than Germany's 3.8 per cent.
Yesterday's cuts in Dutch and Belgian official interest rates illustrate a
trend in evidence since December 1991. Whereas in the past the Bundesbank's
monetary moves nearly always triggered identical policy action in
neighbouring countries, other EMS members are now able to take a more
independent line.
The same is true of Switzerland and Austria, two countries outside the EMS
which traditionally have kept their currencies and their monetary policies
closely aligned to Germany's.
Hours before the Bundesbank's council completed its deliberations,
Switzerland felt bold enough to cut its discount rate 0.5 percentage points
to 5.5 per cent, taking it 2.5 points below the corresponding German level.
Within the EMS, Germany now has four 'hard core' partners which have kept
their exchange rates close to the D-Mark in recent years: the Netherlands,
Belgium/Luxembourg, France and Denmark. The first two now have lower
short-term interest rates than those in Germany.
Yesterday, three-month Euro-D-Mark rates stood at 8.5 per cent, against 8.3
per cent for the Belgian franc and 8.2 per cent for the guilder.
The Dutch and Belgian central banks have been able to act independently of
the Bundesbank in making several successive cuts in key interest rates since
September's European monetary unrest.
The Belgian National Bank, which formally pegged its currency to the D-Mark
in 1990, stressed yesterday that it acted 'in concert' with the Netherlands
central bank.
Both the Dutch and the Belgians justified their action on the grounds of
their currencies' strength within the exchange rate mechanism. Both central
banks this week have had to intervene to support the Irish punt.
Explaining that the guilder's external strength gave the Nederlandsche Bank
more leeway to cut rates, a Dutch official said yesterday: 'We are abiding
by the rules of the game. We are at the top of the ERM grid.'
The Swiss National Bank's go-it-alone move on the discount rate marks a
further attempt to take advantage of the central bank's small margin of
monetary policy independence.
In December 1991, the bank decided not to follow the Bundesbank when it
raised its rates by 0.5 percentage points. But the Swiss franc fell rapidly
once the gap with German rates widened - leading the National Bank to drive
up interest rates and rein in monetary growth in the early summer.
After the autumn monetary unrest revived the Swiss franc's attractiveness as
a haven currency, it strengthened considerably. Furthermore, amid continued
recession in the Swiss economy, the Swiss National Bank's main target, the
monetary base, showed a 1 per cent contraction between the fourth quarters
of 1991 and 1992.
A spokesman for the Swiss National Bank yesterday underlined how the bank
was taking no risks yesterday in cutting the discount rate. 'We are
confident that the Swiss franc will remain a stable currency this year,' he
said.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Baghdad stalls on UN missile ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON, LONDON, SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ last night delivered an apparently inconclusive reply to the United
Nations' ultimatum that it withdraw missile batteries near the no-fly zone
in the south of the country by this evening.
Mr Nizar Hamdoon, its ambassador to the UN, told western UN representatives
in New York that Iraq had the sovereign right to deploy its military on its
own territory - a response similar to that given earlier by Mr Tariq Aziz,
the deputy prime minister.
There was no clear reaction from the western delegation pending consultation
with their governments. Mr Thomas Richardson, the deputy UK representative,
said 'the essential question' was whether Iraq removed its missiles from
south of the 32nd parallel and not violate the no-fly zone.
He added: 'So in a sense the question depends on what happens on the
ground.'
Mr Hamdoon repeatedly ducked questions about the Soviet-made missiles at
issue. He said: 'I have not addressed the question of the missiles per se.'
Earlier, the US defence department said it had indications that some were
being moved but, with low clouds hampering aerial and satellite surveillance
in the region, there was no word later of their whereabouts and some concern
that they were merely being relocated in more heavily fortified
emplacements.
Officials insisted it was 'premature' to suggest that President Saddam
Hussein was making a 'positive' response to the 48-hour UN ultimatum handed
to Ambassador Hamdoon on Wednesday evening by the US, France, Britain and
Russia, threatening military retaliation. They noted that Iraq had
frequently used the tactic known as 'cheat and retreat' in testing the
resolve of the US and its allies.
In what looked like a propaganda ploy, Mr Hamdoon invited a US congressional
delegation to visit Iraq 'to see the situation in the no-fly zone and
regarding all other disputed issues between the US and Iraq'. This was
presumably a reference to western concerns that President Saddam is
preparing for a crackdown on the Kurds in northern Iraq. British officials
said that unless it was clear the missiles had been moved out of the air
exclusion zone allied aircraft would attack military targets in Iraq within
hours of the ultimatum expiring.
The Soviet-made SA-2 and SA-3 missile batteries were moved adjacent to the
32nd parallel after the downing on December 27 of an Iraqi MiG aircraft by
US jets when it violated the UN-proscribed no-fly zone. President George
Bush was said to be resolute after a meeting with Republican congressmen.
President-elect Bill Clinton's spokesman said he agreed with the policies
being pursued by Mr Bush. 'There will be no toleration of any violations of
the UN resolutions by Saddam,' Mr George Stephanopoulos said. Mr Aziz denied
Iraq was using the impending change of government in Washington as an
opportunity to improve its military posture.
Britain warned Iraq of 'very serious' consequences if it did not remove the
missiles from the no-fly zone.
Mr Zuhair Ibrahim, head of the Iraqi interests section at the Jordanian
Embassy in London, was summoned to the Foreign Office for a 10 minute
meeting. British-Iraqi diplomatic relations were broken off at the start of
the Gulf war in 1991.
An Australian aid worker was shot and killed and another injured after a
village meeting in the UN-controlled Kurdish zone in northern Iraq, the aid
agency CARE Australia said early today, Reuter reports from Sydney. It was
reported that the UN aid programme in the region was subsequently suspended.

FT  08 JAN 93 / MPs seek probe into all aspects of safety in tankers
</HEADLINE>

A POLITICAL row has broken out over the terms of the government's inquiry
into the Braer tanker disaster off Shetland.
As gales prevented salvage teams from boarding the vessel to see how much of
the tanker's cargo of 84,000 tonnes of crude oil remained in its tanks, MPs
and maritime unions called for the inquiry to be broadened to cover all
aspects of tanker safety.
Mr Brian Orrell, assistant general secretary of Numast, the shipping
officers union, said the government was 'skirting round the real issue'. The
union would like to see the inquiry broadened to cover the 'horrendous
decline in safety at sea'.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said his department's Marine
Accident Investigation Branch would investigate six areas: the causes of the
accident; the action taken to prevent it; the action taken after the event;
the seaworthiness of the vessel; the competence of the crew; and the safety
of navigation.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environmental protection spokesman, described the
inquiry - which is to start immediately - as 'totally inadequate.'
The Braer's operator, B&amp;H group, said last night a salvage barge was being
prepared to remove the remaining oil from the tanker. It is expected to
arrive off Shetland on Sunday.
The Braer, which ran aground at Garths Ness in Quendale Bay at the southern
end of Shetland on Tuesday, has not broken up. But bad weather, expected to
continue for at least two days, forced a reduction in flights to spray
chemical dispersants on the oil leaking from the tanker.
Deep oil slicks run for about 5 to 6 miles both north and south from the
tanker. The slicks are about 50 metres wide and are being pushed against the
shore by strong westerly winds.
A thin film of oil, described as a rainbow sheen, runs for 14 miles on the
west side of the island and reaches the entrance of Clift Sound and the
south end of Burra island, bringing it within a few miles of salmon farms,
one of the sectors of the Shetland economy most threatened by the spill.
Shetland Islands Council revealed that it had drawn up a contingency plan to
evacuate residents from the area close to the wreck if atmospheric pollution
were to pose a threat to health, but it said that so far there was no danger
to health. It refused to give details of the plan, which could involve
moving several hundred people.
By yesterday, some 235 dead birds had been found in the area since the
tanker ran aground and 45 live birds had been rescued.
Privately, the emergency co-ordination team acknowledged that the pollution
could have been much worse. The slick is relatively small, most of the oil
is light and 30 per cent of it is thought to be evaporating.
Mr George Sutherland, director of marine operations for Shetland Island
Council, said: 'If anything is good about this incident it is the wind
direction.'
Lord Caithness, the shipping minister, who has been in Shetland since
Wednesday, said he was worried that exaggerated reports about the disaster
would damage the prospects of the Shetland salmon farming and fishing
industries, even though they had not been affected.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Burton cuts 2,000 full-time jobs in switch to part-time
working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURTON, the retail group, is cutting 2,000 full-time jobs, but creating up
to 3,000 part-time ones, in the latest evidence of a growing trend towards
part-time employment in retailing.
Some 933 head office jobs will be lost, roughly one in four, together with
about 1,000 jobs in the group's shops, which include Debenhams, Burtons, Top
Shop, Principles and Dorothy Perkins.
Mr John Hoerner, who took over as chief executive last February, said
yesterday the wide-ranging changes in organisation and management would cost
between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m, but would save a similar amount on staff
and management costs this year.
He said the move towards greater part-time working would enable savings to
be made as staff could be targeted to work at the busiest periods. He hoped
that many full-time staff would remain as part-time workers.
'There is no question about the fact that as social trends change, and more
and more people work and so want to shop outside traditional shopping hours,
there will be more part-time workers required', he said.
Burton now employs about 36,000 staff, about 17,900 of them part-time. In
the retailing sector as a whole, more than a third of workers are part-time,
with the proportion expected to increase to 50 per cent.
Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said it was alarmed at the prospect of such
heavy job losses at a time of high unemployment.
'We are equally worried about this further move away from full-time into
part-time employment, which is bound to harm career prospects for our
members,' said Mr Frank Murphy, Usdaw's national officer at Burton, who is
to meet the management for talks today.
Burton, one of the most successful retailers of the 1980s, slipped into an
annual loss of Pounds 13.4m in 1990, before recovering to a profit of Pounds
9.4m last year. During that time it saw the departure of two chief
executives. Analysts expect profits to top Pounds 30m this year.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Dublin lifts overnight rate to 100%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND'S central bank was forced yesterday to raise its overnight lending
rate from 50 per cent to 100 per cent as the punt continued to come under
intense pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism, write Tim
Coone in Dublin and James Blitz in London.
The Bundesbank's decision to trim its short-dated money market rates raised
hopes that the ERM might survive recent tensions, and allowed a number of
European countries - including Belgium and the Netherlands - to cut their
interest rates.
However, the punt continued to face selling pressure and traded at its
floors against two of the strongest ERM currencies, the Belgian franc and
the Dutch guilder.
The Belgian and Dutch central banks cut their rates in moves which
underlined the easier policy stance shown by the Bundesbank. The Dutch
central bank reduced three important rates - the discount, secured loans and
promissory note rates - by 25 basis points to 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5 per cent
respectively.
The Belgian central bank cut its discount and emergency lending rates by 25
basis points to 7.50 and 10 per cent respectively. The Swiss national bank
cut its discount rate by half a point to 5.5 per cent.

FT  08 JAN 93 / Bundesbank movehelps to ease tension in ERM: Central bank
cuts money market rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK eased its short-term money market interest rates yesterday,
raising speculation that cuts in its Lombard and discount lending rates
could come as early as next month.
The central bank council's decision to relax the terms applied in its
securities repurchase operations with banks was a 'small but psychologically
important signal that rates are off the top', said Mr Richard Reid of Union
Bank of Switzerland.
The cut in the money market rate helped to ease some of the recent tensions
inside the European exchange rate mechanism, pushing the French franc
further away from its floor against the D-Mark.
Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London,
said: 'This marks the passing of the peak of the pressures in the ERM.' The
move, however, had little impact on the punt, which continued to trade below
its floors against the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder.
Council members decided at yesterday's unusually lengthy meeting that the
so-called 'repo' rate would be reduced to 8.60 per cent from recent levels
of 8.75 per cent and higher. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president,
said later that the move was 'not a signal, but a continuation of our
existing policy of relaxation in money markets'.
There were suggestions yesterday that the Bundesbank would await the outcome
of talks on this year's public sector wage round and German state budget
before taking any more decisions on whether to ease policy.
However, yesterday's move was widely read as an indicator that the bank
wanted to reduce other rates, and was preparing to.
Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at the Bayerische Vereinsbank, said the
Bundesbank was getting people used to the idea that changes were coming.
He expected cuts in the leading rates within two months, while Mr Axel
Siedenberg at Deutsche Bank Research suggested change could come within four
to six weeks if the central bank continued cutting the 'repo' rate, which
has recently been steered down by more than 100 basis points. Most German
experts had expected Lombard and discount rate reductions at the end of
March or later.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, who has been exercising discreet pressure
for relaxation in monetary policy in the light of deteriorating domestic
economic conditions, said the latest move would give a positive impulse to
international economic development, in Europe especially.
Mr Wolfgang Roth, economics spokesman for the Social Democrat opposition,
accused the bank of neglecting its domestic and international
responsibilities, saying it should ask itself if it wanted to cause a long,
deep recession.
Mr Schlesinger, who on Wednesday firmly squashed lingering hopes of a cut
this week in leading lending rates, said yesterday's decision followed 'an
exhaustive debate on the monetary and currency situation'.
Local experts, who suggested that industrial orders data had probably been
released early by the economics ministry in an attempt to influence the
council, dismissed some interpretations that the move was intended to help
relieve pressure on the French franc, still close to its floor within the
ERM. 'If they wanted to help, they would have cut the Lombard and discount
rates,' Mr Hufner said.
Mr Reid at UBS said that while the international effects of Bundesbank
policy appeared to have encroached more on the central council's thinking,
it did not want to be seen to be acting to influence exchange rate policy.

FT  07 JAN 93 / County Hall hotel proposal approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAMBETH Council has approved a planning application by Shirayama Corporation
of Japan to turn County Hall, the former headquarters of the Greater London
Council, into a hotel.
The council's planning committee gave permission to a planning application
at a meeting on Tuesday evening, subject to further consideration later this
month of the community benefits the developer will provide.
The developers plan to convert the building into a 600-bed hotel with
conference and leisure facilities.
Shirayama says it will keep all the historic rooms intact and 'brought back
to their original splendor'. There will be a chapel and a health club in the
basement and a 24-hour public restaurant on the riverside terrace.
The council was advised to accept the planning application for a number of
reasons, including the need for high-quality hotel accommodation in London
and employment potential.
The council originally wanted to keep the building in local government or
public use, favouring a proposal by the London School of Economics to
acquire it. The acrimonious battle between Shirayama and the LSE over the
future of County Hall ended last September when the government rejected the
LSE's bid.
Shirayama is contracted to complete its pounds 65m purchase of the County
Hall riverside building at the end of October. The London Residuary Body
which has the task of disposing of the GLC's assets, launched an
international marketing campaign for the remainder of the 5-hectare site
last November.

'computer-phones'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications company, has
formed an alliance with Novell, the leading supplier of computer networking
software, to develop and market products linking computer networks with
telephones.
Products resulting from the joint efforts will 'bring the power of
computer-telephone integration to desktop comp-uters,' the companies said
yesterday.
They aim to help businesses increase office productivity by integrating
existing telephone and computer networks to provide 'telephony services'.
Merged computer-telephone networks will eventually be accessible from all
types of desktop computers, the companies added.
The first product, called a 'telephony server NetWare loadable module', will
link Novell's popular NetWare computer networks with AT&amp;T's Definity
communications systems.
It will allow customers to use common telephone features, such as
auto-dialling, conference calling and message management, in combination
with information stored in their computer networks.
Users will be able to speed-dial numbers and take notes on their computers.
Notes from previous conversations will be available with each new call.
The companies also plan to develop products that integrate services such as
electronic mail, facsimile and voice mail.
Mr Ray Noorda, Novell president and chief executive, said: 'Telephony
services are a powerful combination of technologies which will benefit
customers by providing integration between their existing voice and data
networks.
'The technology will simplify management and pave the way for delivery of
many new services.'
Mr Jerre Stead, president of AT&amp;T Global Business Communications Systems,
said: 'The market for computer-telephone integration is expected to almost
double each year during the next five years as customers discover its
productivity benefits. We intend to be leaders in this emerging market.'

motor side
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, has expanded its motor
import and distribution operations in the Middle East.
It has bought a 49 per cent beneficial interest in Towell Auto Centre, which
has exclusive import and distribution rights for Mazda in Oman, for OR5.6m
(Pounds 9.6m).
It is paying WJ Towell, TAC's owner, Pounds 8.4m cash on completion and the
balance in equal chunks over three years.
Inchcape will manage TAC, which has a 7 per cent share of the car market in
Oman, selling 2,100 cars a year.
In addition, TAC distributes Castrol lubricants, Lucas parts and Suzuki
motorcycles in the Sultanate.
Mr Derek Whittaker, a director, said: 'Inchcape has a long-standing
relationship with Mazda.
'It is the exclusive importer and distributor of Mazda vehicles in France,
Hong Kong and Finland, has a 40 per cent share of the Mazda UK import and
distribution business and 50 per cent of the joint venture which markets
Mazda vehicles in South China.'
He added that Inchcape already had a number of joint ventures in Oman with
WJ Towell, which will control the remaining 51 per cent of TAC.
In March 1992, Inchcape bought TKM, funded by a Pounds 376m rights issue.
It now sells more than 350,000 vehicles a year in 26 countries.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: GE's finance arm expands through
Dollars 525m GNA buy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GE CAPITAL, the fast-growing financial services arm of General Electric, is
to expand into the wholesale annuity and mutual fund business through the
purchase of GNA Corporation from forest products group Weyerhaeuser for
Dollars 525m in cash.
Weyerhaeuser will assume GNA's outstanding Dollars 225m of borrowings.
GNA writes and markets tax-deferred annuities and wholesales proprietary and
third-party mutual funds through financial services companies, such as
commercial banks and savings and loans.
Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital, said that GNA was a leader in
'one of the fastest-growing segments of financial services - pre-retirement
savings plans. As ageing baby-boomers augment their retirement savings, this
market could more than double in size before the year 2000.'
For Tacoma-based Weyerhaeuser, the deal is a further stage in the refocusing
of the company. It instituted a wide-ranging 'business improvement plan' in
1989, which involved shedding peripheral assets and raising the financial
returns of its core businesses.
GNA, founded in 1980 and bought by Weyerhaeuser three years later, sold
products last year with a gross value of Dollars 3.2bn. It contributed
Dollars 421m, or about 5 per cent, of Weyerhaeuser's 1991 group revenues.
Weyerhaeuser said yesterday it had not been offering the business around,
but was willing to sell because GE Capital would provide the financial
resources GNA needed to take advantage of its market position. Weyerhaeuser
was not planning to sell its remaining financial services operations, in
mortgage lending and real estate development.
With assets of more than Dollars 80bn, GE Capital is the second-largest
non-bank finance company in the US, with 20 businesses ranging from aircraft
leasing to third-party credit card services. Over the past two years it has
begun a significant expansion into the European and Asian markets.
Mr Patrick Welch, chief executive of GNA, will continue to manage the
company. He said yesterday GE Capital had assured him that the business
would remain an independent, stand-alone operation.
GE Capital declined to comment yesterday on market rumours that it is also
negotiating to buy the loan portfolio of Westinghouse Electric's troubled
financial services arm. Westinghouse announced plans to quit financial
services last November.

<TEXT>
FORD Motor yesterday claimed a significant symbolic victory over Japan when
its Taurus mid-sized car narrowly beat the Honda Accord to be the
top-selling car in the US in 1992.
The Accord has held the number one position since 1989.
Ford's recapture of the top spot will be taken as a further sign of the
renewed competitiveness of the US motor industry against Japanese rivals,
which was indicated yesterday by 1992 sales figures for the US vehicle
industry as a whole.
Ford saw its car and light truck sales rise 11.2 per cent to 3,233,502
units.
Troubled General Motors saw a 1.8 per cent increase to 4,449,878.
Among the major Japanese manufacturers, Toyota increased its sales 1 per
cent to 1,023,641.
Nissan was virtually unchanged at 578,844, while Honda sales dipped 4 per
cent to 768,845.
According to Ford's estimates, the total US car and light truck market rose
4 per cent over 1991 to 13.1m units.
The Ford Taurus, relaunched in late 1991, sold 409,751 units, up from
299,700, while the Honda Accord dipped from 399,297 to 393,477.
However, Ford's victory was only achieved through offering big discounts and
cheap lease finance to customers.
The drive began in August and reached a peak last month as the company
scrambled to close the gap with Honda.
Ford offered even more lavish incentives, including rebates to dealers
willing to put additional Tauruses into their demonstration fleets.
Honda replied with cheap financial packages of its own.
Ford was also helped both by its far greater number of dealer outlets across
the US - some 4,300 to Honda's 1,000 - and the fact that while Honda's sales
go mainly to retail customers, a large proportion of Tauruses go to fleet
buyers, such as rental companies.
Nevertheless, Ford will use the victory as an important marketing tool and
plans a major television advertising campaign.
Dr David Cole, an automobile expert at the University of Michigan, said that
yesterday's figures were an indication that the US was 'at the threshold of
building a very powerful industry. The Japanese are scared to death.'
However, other analysts said the Japanese were holding their fire in the
battle for market share, lest they be accused of causing further job losses
at ailing General Motors.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Storm clouds facing tour bosses - Airtours'
hostile bid for Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLIDAYMAKERS heading for the sun this summer may never notice the
difference. But their tour operators are likely to be in the midst of one of
the most fundamental shake-ups in the holiday industry since Harry Goodman's
International Leisure Group crashed in 1991.
Yesterday, Airtours, the UK's third largest tour operator, launched its much
flagged hostile bid for Owners Abroad, the number two in the industry.
Should the deal go through, the enlarged Airtours will have nearly as large
a share of the UK market as Thomson, the dominant market leader for much of
the last decade.
Apart from any regulatory hurdles on competition grounds, the main obstacles
to this being a straightforward takeover battle is the presence of Thomas
Cook, once a subsidiary of Midland Bank but now controlled by Westdeutsche
Landesbank, the Dusseldorf-based state bank.
Last month, Owners Abroad and Thomas Cook agreed a tie-up which would give
Thomas Cook a 10.3 per cent stake in Owners.
The German-controlled company said its wanted to be a part of Owners' plan
to develop a pan-European travel company.
In return, Owners would get access to the well known brand name for
marketing purposes and increased access to the extensive Thomas Cook chain
of retail outlets.
All eyes are, therefore, on WestLB, LTU, the rapidly growing German tour
operator in which the bank has a 34 per cent stake, and Thomas Cook.
'There is a big difference between putting Pounds 237m in a bid and what
they (the Germans) are proposing,' said Mr David Crossland, chairman of
Airtours. 'Are they really that serious or do they just want a tricky
arrangement.'
The proposed deal was not good for Owners' shareholders, when compared with
the benefits of accepting the Airtours share offer, he said.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners chairman, said yesterday that he still believed in
the commercial logic of the deal with Thomas Cook and that the Airtours
offer undervalued the benefits of the tie-up.
'The Thomas Cook deal is right for Owners shareholders; we are fully
committed and Cooks and LTU and Westdeutsche are fully committed,' he said.
'We believe it is a better deal.'
But there is little doubt that should WestLB and Thomas Cook want to push
through with the alliance, Owners shareholders may require a rather sweeter
deal to be put to them if they are not to be tempted by an Airtours offer.
That is not to say that Airtours offer is a knockout blow. The offer, worth
Pounds 221m at yesterday's close, represents a substantial discount to the
market's prospective earnings multiple. As one City observer said yesterday:
'The price does look a bit mean if Airtours is gaining control and doubling
its market share.'
But there again, Airtours boasts a substantially glossier track record.
In the five years since Mr Crossland floated Airtours, with a market
capitalisation of Pounds 27m, earnings per share have grown at a compound
annual rate of 59 per cent and market share in tour operations has grown
from 4 per cent to about 13 per cent, much of it at Thomson's expense. In
1990 and 1991, Airtours was among the fastest growing stocks in the London
market and now has a market capitalisation of nearly Pounds 300m after
issuing only Pounds 17m of new shares.
By comparison, Owners Abroad has not shone. In particular, it missed its
footing in the early marketting of its 1992 holidays, believing the market
would sustain a price increase, and did not take as much advantage of the
ILG collapse.
While Airtours' profits in the year to September last year rose 33 per cent
and sales grew 40 per cent, Owners' profits fell nearly 20 per cent on sales
that grew only half as quickly. In the real acid test for shareholders,
Owners' earnings grew only 6 per cent on a compound basis over the last five
years.
In announcing its deal with Thomas Cook, Owners said it would benefit from
Pounds 7m of cost savings in the first year of the tie-up.
Airtours said yesterday that its savings from a merger would be
significantly in excess of this. Mr Crossland said their combined marketing
operations would benefit as Owners was stronger in the south of England
while Airtours was stronger in the north and in Scotland.
The combined group would also be in a far stronger position in the buying of
40m bed nights a year in Europe - it did not take a calculator to see what
impact a 10p per bed saving would have on profits, Mr Crossland said. And
finally, Airtours would reduce what it sees as a confusing number of Owners
holiday brands.
Ultimately, Owners seems likely to maintain its independence if it can
convince shareholders that the commercial logic of developing a pan-European
holiday company is worth more than Airtours offer.
Potential shareholders in an enlarged group should remember, however, that
Thomson may well try to defend its relative market position by initiating
yet another price war.

the US - some 4,300 to Honda's 1,000 - and the fact that while Honda's sales
go mainly to retail customers, a large proportion of Tauruses go to fleet
buyers, such as rental companies.
Nevertheless, Ford will use the victory as an important marketing tool and
plans a major television advertising campaign.
Dr David Cole, an automobile expert at the University of Michigan, said that
yesterday's figures were an indication that the US was 'at the threshold of
building a very powerful industry. The Japanese are scared to death.'
However, other analysts said the Japanese were holding their fire in the
battle for market share, lest they be accused of causing further job losses
at ailing General Motors.

FT  07 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: TV-am places 16% stake in Metro
Radio for Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 8th January 1993) appended to this article.
TV-AM, the loss-making commercial breakfast television company, has placed
its 16 per cent stake in the Newcastle-based Metro Radio Group in a deal
worth some Pounds 4m.
The exact price of the deal, which involved 2,77m shares, was not disclosed.
Metro shares yesterday rose 8p to 158p.
The sale of the shares is the latest sign that TV-am, which went off the air
on December 31 before giving way to Good Morning Television, is clearing the
decks for a voluntary liquidation of assets.
Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am chairman, is planning to move to Australia to be
chairman of Channel 9 and it was announced yesterday that Mr Statis
Zographos, finance director since 1984, is to be commercial director of the
ITV Network Centre.
Talks are believed to be under way with the Virgin Group about selling
TV-am's stake in Virgin Radio, the joint venture which will launch a
national commercial pop radio station this spring.
At the moment Mr Gyngell is chairman of the station which is based at Woking
in Surrey.
TV-am is also in talks with two potential purchasers of its studios at
London's Camden Lock.
Last month the company announced it was distributing Pounds 26m in surplus
cash to shareholders.
CORRECTION
TV-am, which has lost its breakfast television franchise, was incorrectly
described as a loss-making company in yesterday's edition.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Technology: Ageing hydros get a new lease of life -
Rehabilitating old power stations has become a thriving business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent approval by the Ontario government of a CDollars 1.2bn (Pounds
600m), 20-year project to renovate 34 small hydro electric power stations in
the Canadian province highlights the growing potential of retrofit
programmes for old hydro plants.
At a time when the construction of new hydro electric projects is being
stalled throughout the world by environmental and financing problems,
electric utilities are turning to renovation of old plants as a way to
increase power output significantly and quickly without adding to
environmental disturbance.
There is hardly a single component in an old hydro station whose performance
cannot be improved by a more efficient modern equivalent. Digital controls,
for example, permit more efficient use of the water flow than old manual
ones.
Thanks to the recent development of computer-aided flow simulation
technology, the biggest gains can now be obtained by designing new,
optimised turbines to make maximum use of the available water.
According to the Escher Wyss division of Sulzer, the Swiss engineering
group, retrofitting newly designed turbines can yield increases of power
generation capacity from an existing plant of between 15 and 20 per cent. If
combined with redesigned and manufactured waterways and generator sets, the
gains can be even larger.
The benefits from good turbine design are of two types. First, the
efficiency of the turbine itself can be improved. However, the potential
there is relatively modest, the big gains having been made already. The
efficiency of modern turbines is generally over 90 per cent compared with 75
per cent in 1900.
The other, more important, benefit comes from designing the turbine so that
the flow rate from the same head of water can be increased. The problem with
high flow rates is that the differential in pressure between the two sides
of the turbine blades rises and this accelerates erosion of the blades
through a process known as cavitation (air bubbles imploding against the
surface of the blade). Using computational fluid dynamics, it is possible to
optimise the shape of the blades and water guides to minimise the erosion.
Escher Wyss, one of the world's top three water turbine makers, claims a
lead over its competitors in the lively retrofit sector because of the high
level of sophistication of its computer simulation programmes, developed
during the 1980s in co-operation with the University of Lausanne.
The company says that its programmes work considerably faster than those of
its competitors, so that it can carry out a flow analysis of a specific case
in only a few hours.
This means it can explore several alternative solutions over a period of a
few weeks to find the most suitable one. 'The bottleneck today is the
engineer's understanding, not the computer,' says Helmut Keck, head of
research and development at the hydraulics division of Sulzer-Escher Wyss.
The programmes have also become increasingly precise, with a recent addition
even to simulate cavitation. The company is working on a programme that will
simulate the whole turbine-generator complex.
Keck says that, in cases of small turbines at least, there is no longer any
need to go through the expensive and time-consuming step of building a scale
model to verify the performance claims produced by its computer analysis.
This means that the time from order to completed installation can be cut
almost in half from about two years to one year.
The company's first large-scale use of the technology was for the McCormick
power station of Manicouagan Power in Canada's Quebec province. New turbines
were designed to fit into the existing casing, and the computer simulation
suggested an increase in output of about 14 per cent. A model test confirmed
the indication, and the actual installation, which is just now taking place,
appears to be confirming the projections.
On the Ontario Hydro contract, Escher Wyss's Canadian subsidiary will make
comprehensive proposals for rehabilitating 34 power stations throughout the
province and supply what it calls water to wire electro-mechanical equipment
packages for them. The value of its contract is about CDollars 350m.
Christian Habegger, general manager of hydraulics at Sulzer-Escher Wyss
headquarters in Zurich, says the retrofit business looks set to continue to
grow, especially in industrialised countries where nuclear power plants have
become unpopular.
Habegger says the technology could also be helpful in eastern European
countries where many hydro plants are in a poor state of repair and where
utilities urgently need new sources of power so that they can shut down
their dangerous nuclear plants.

ELF ENTERPRISE announced the award of a Pounds 70m contract to SLP
Engineering to build an accommodation platform for its Claymore oilfield in
the North Sea yesterday.
The platform will include the up-to-date safety measures in the
accommodation module that are required in the wake of the Cullen report on
the Piper Alpha oil platform tragedy, in which 167 people died in 1988. It
will replace the existing accommodation facilities on the Claymore A
platform and the floating unit moored alongside.
Safety measures on all North Sea facilities must be updated as a result of
recommendations in the Cullen report.
The new 11,000-tonne accommodation platform will be built at SLP
Engineering's two yards at Lowestoft and Teesside. The platform will provide
work for 670 people and is due to be installed in early 1995.
Phillips Petroleum yesterday announced the award of a Pounds 28m contract to

<TEXT>
Correction (published 8th January 1993) appended to this article.
A BRICKLAYER has won against a London council one of the highest recorded
settlements in compensation for sexual and racial harassment at work,
Catherine Milton writes.
Ms Tracie Simpson, 28, told an industrial tribunal that local officials from
one union had participated in her harassment while Ucatt, the building
union, had been slow to give effective support.
Greenwich Council agreed to pay Ms Simpson Pounds 1,500. She lost her job in
October 1991 and is now unemployed, with no plans to return to construction.
The settlement came after the tribunal decided her case should be heard even
though she failed to raise her claim within the three-month time limit. The
tribunal accepted that she had experienced 'considerable sexual and racial
harassment', some of which was perpetrated by the 'lower tiers of
management' and that the council had failed to take 'effective action' to
stop it.
CORRECTION
MS TRACIE SIMPSON won Pounds 15,000 compensation for sexual and racial
harassment from Greenwich council in London and not Pounds 1,500 as reported
yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STUTTGART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE great and good of Germany's troubled Free Democratic party descended on
Stuttgart for their traditional Epiphany rally yesterday, ostensibly in
search of three wise men. They came away with a crown prince, if not two.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, top civil servant, one-time boss of the German intelligence
service, now transformed into foreign minister, finally let it be known that
he was willing to stand as the new party leader this summer.
His decision was greeted with obvious relief and prolonged applause in the
packed rows of the monumental state opera house, if not quite universal
acclamation.
He has, after all, been a full member of the party for rather less than two
years. Yet he is undoubtedly seen as a great white hope by many members of
the FDP, the liberal minority member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling
coalition.
The party has been battered in a series of local elections, and then rocked
by the scandal which forced Mr Jurgen Mollemann - the man who might have
been an alternative leader - to hand in his resignation as economics
minister at the weekend. It urgently needs new blood to revive its public
standing, and it seems to think the refreshingly blunt and often
undiplomatic Mr Kinkel is what is needed.
The second crown prince, who was not really confirmed, except by the
incessant attention of photographers and TV cameras, was Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
the man now regarded as most likely to be put forward as the new economics
minister.
Formerly the senator responsible for finance in the Berlin city council,
then chairman of Citibank's subsidiary in Frankfurt, and now a board member
of the Treuhand privatisation agency in the former East Germany, Mr Rexrodt
was available for pictures (he turned up half an hour early), but not for
comments.
The party leadership and members of parliament will decide on whom to put
forward tomorrow.
If Mr Rexrodt was silent, Mr Kinkel was certainly not. He delivered an
hour-long address on 'liberalism in the 1990s', to demonstrate to any
remaining doubters his command of the full range of party policy.
His most thoughtful remarks were on the subject of German identity, and the
difference between the dangers of nationalism, and the alternative of
'honest patriotism'. His most passionate words were to condemn all forms of
racism and right-wing extremism.
He gave a grim warning, that Germany had once again reached a critical point
in its history - as critical as in 1945. 'The confidence of our citizens in
politics has reached a new low,' he said. 'Abroad, they are asking the
question whether we are still reliable democrats ..'
'There is no cause for exaggerated fears, but there is reason for concern
and careful thought. What is needed is political, spiritual and moral
leadership, which will give our people back a confidence in their future,
and will not gamble away Germany's reserves of trust abroad.'
As for the ruling coalition, he pledged his firm loyalty to it - no doubt
reassuring words for Chancellor Kohl. But he warned that the combination of
financing east German recovery, cutting the budget deficit, controlling
immigration, fighting extremism and organised crime, meant the government
was facing a more complex series of challenges than any since the first
governments after the war.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Orthodox Christmas offers little cheer

A HANDFUL of Serbs gathered yesterday in a Sarajevo church, within range of
the heavy guns of their brethren, for a chilly and somber commemoration of
Orthodox Christmas that matched the mood of the besieged capital.
Orthodox Christmas is normally a joyous occasion, but there was little to
celebrate yesterday. Several miles west of St Michael the Archangel church,
venue of the Christmas Mass, 108 elderly citizens huddled in the only heated
room of their nursing home.
The building, in the Serb-held suburb of Nedzarici, is under continuous
small-arms fire. More than 40 residents have died since October, most of
them victims of the war or the bone-numbing cold of a Balkan winter.
The home's social worker, Ms Lydia Groznic, said on Tuesday that 10 had died
in the past 36 hours. Their bodies were wrapped in blankets and stored in an
empty room. No autopsies were done, but with inside temperatures at -14
degrees Celsius cold appeared the culprit.
Reporters dodged sniper fire yesterday to enter the home. They saw 50 people
huddled near wood-burning stoves; one old woman was in a coma while others
appeared to be suffering from frostbite. Attempts to talk to the home's
supervisor were cut short by armed Serbs who chased the reporters out of the
building.
Relief officials have forecast that thousands will die this winter of cold
and hunger in Sarajevo and more isolated areas of war-wracked Bosnia.
Temperatures have been as low as -17 degrees Celsius in many Sarajevo homes
in recent weeks, and the city has been without electricity since its main
power lines were downed in heavy fighting nearly a month ago. The power
cut-off has also stopped pumps that supply water for the city's 380,000
residents. Many houses are without window glass or walls.
UN officials also say a pipeline carrying Russian-supplied natural gas is
being cut off somewhere in Serb-controlled territory.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees announced on Tuesday that it was
doubling food shipments to Sarajevo to 400 tons a day, but it was unclear
whether the agency could make good on the promise.

according to an opinion poll published yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
The survey in the daily Le Parisien newspaper said the highest number of
would-be emigrants, 53 per cent, were Dutch, followed by Germans, Britons
and Belgians.

FT  07 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Traffic figures hurt BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VEILED profits warning from British Airways (BA), together with
disappointing air traffic figures, prompted forecast cuts across the board
and led the shares to slide 20 to 288p. The stock was one of the biggest
casualties in the London market in percentage terms - down 6.5 per cent -
and, at 26m shares, recorded its highest daily turnover for nearly a year.
The airline announced that its December 1992 passenger load factor, the
figure which reflects the percentage of aircraft seats taken up, fell 1.1
percentage points from a year ago to 66 per cent. BA also produced a very
cautious statement which pointed out that first class and business class
passengers were staying away and that there was a general surfeit of seats.
Finally, there was growing realisation of the extent to which sharp currency
shifts in September may have hit full-year profits.
Most securities houses, including BA's joint brokers SG Warburg and UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, cut profits estimates. Warburg came back by Pounds 40m to
Pounds 220m for the current year and by Pounds 30m to Pounds 320m for next.
Holiday bid
The much-heralded bid for Owners Abroad from its smaller rival Airtours sent
shares in the two holiday tour operators in widely different directions. The
market was almost unanimous in the view that the bid will have to be
increased if it is to succeed.
Brokers recommended Owners shares on the likelihood of either an increased
offer or a rival bid. Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court said: 'It will be an
exciting joint venture if successful, but Airtours will probably have to pay
around 150p a share to get it.'
Paribas said the possibility of another bidder and the probability of a
higher offer meant investors should sell Airtours and buy Owners. Shares in
the latter climbed 11 to 120p in big turnover of 12m. Airtours dropped 19 to
302p.
There were also hints of a boardroom split at Owners, a development which
analysts thought might increase the chances of success for an increased
offer from Airtours. According to some specialists, discussions between the
two companies were first initiated last summer. But the talks broke down and
Owners then went on to agree a tie-up with LTU, the German travel group.
This deal, which seems to have finally forced Airtours' hand, was to be
voted on tomorrow, but has been postponed. LTU is now being tipped as a
potential white knight.
ICI again strong
Shares in ICI performed strongly for the second day as Zeneca, the company's
pharmaceuticals arm, announced it had submitted a new drug for regulatory
approval in Italy, Europe's biggest antibiotics market. ICI jumped 24 to
1109p.
Zeneca said its new antibiotic, Merrem, was the first of five compounds to
come through its development pipeline and that Italian approval would open
access to other EC countries. It expects Merrem to be launched in Italy
early next year. A US new drug application is expected later this year.
Smith New Court estimates that Merrem will generate sales worth between
Pounds 100m and Pounds 200m within five years. Analysts said the news was
expected but it followed a strengthened recommendation from agency broker
James Capel on Tuesday. Zeneca is to hold a meeting with analysts on Monday
to discuss biotechnology prospects.
Tesco became the latest food retailer to report a surge in sales in the
period leading up to Christmas. Analysts, fearing that the group might have
been trapped between resilience at J. Sainsbury and discounting at Kwik
Save, had been preparing to downgrade. Instead, the reverse happened, with
BZW moving from a sell to a hold while other houses also largely responded
positively.
Tesco said its like-for-like sales growth in the four weeks to Christmas was
1.5 per cent, lagging Sainsbury's 5 per cent but ahead of market
expectations. Several houses were active in buying the stock yesterday,
sending the shares forward 13 1/2 to 271 1/2 p in turnover of 13m. However,
NatWest Securities retained their 'weak hold' stance for the stock,
believing that the sales growth gap between Tesco and Sainsbury will widen
this year.
Kwik Save is expected to announce its sales figures officially today. They
are widely believed to be between 13 and 15 per cent up from the same period
last year. The shares advanced 17 to 803p. Sainsbury added 2 at 579p, while
Asda gained 4 at 63p. It is expected to declare a like-for-like sales rise
of one per cent.
There was only limited interest in the banks sector. Barclays lost 7 more to
379p as the market's persistent worries about property losses once again
triggered a debate about the bank being in a position to maintain the final
dividend.
Switching from Barclays to NatWest helped the latter edge up 3 to 422p on
3.2m traded. The sale of a block of 1.5m Royal Bank of Scotland at 208 1/2
left the shares 2 off at 209p.
Merchant banks mainly retreated, although Singer &amp; Friedlander edged up 2 to
52p on heavy turnover of 13m.
The composite insurance sector, shaken on Tuesday by news of the oil spill
off the Shetland Islands, staged a good rally, led by Royal Insurance, up 6
at 284p on 3.6m traded.
JIB took up the running in insurance brokers, closing 6 higher at 175p. The
recent strength of sterling took the shine off Sedgwick, which eased 2 to
180p.
BP was the busiest stock in a generally very quiet oil sector, with the
shares managing a minor improvement, up 1 1/2 to 238p, in the absence of any
cash-raising exercise. Turnover, however, was a poor 4m shares, although
their was some brisk activity in the traded options market.
Specialists said BP had put up a creditable performance in view of the
recent flurry of US selling and the worrying decline in crude oil prices in
recent days.
Dealers reported further switching from the regional electricity
companies(recs) and the power generators into the water stocks. Among the
latter, Wessex added 6 at 595p, South West 3 at 494p and Thames 2 at 498p.
Anglian lost 4 to 492p after Kleinwort Benson told clients to switch into
Thames. National Power receded 4 to 273p and PowerGen 3 to 274p. Norweb,
480p, and Yorkshire, 491p, were both 7 easier and the weakest performers in
the 'recs'.
Racal Electronics was among the best performers in the electronics area of
the market, the shares rising 10 to a record 179p after a number of buy
recommendations from leading UK broker houses, notably Kleinwort Benson.
Turnover in Racal shares was a hefty 5.4m.
There was no shortage of strong risers in the electronics sector. Volex
climbed 11 to 410p. Cray Electronics was 7 firmer at 116p - the highest
level since July 1989 - on exceptionally high turnover of 8.2m shares.
Motor issues rose on expectation that December car registration figures, due
today, would show a 30 per cent increase over the same period of 1991. T.
Cowie put on 10 at 174p, further boosted by a raised profits forecast from
Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. Evans Halshaw gained 19 at 238p.
Sears added 3 1/2 at 101p as the company hosted a series of meetings and
told analysts that flat pre-Christmas trading was offset by subsequent
buoyant sales.
Retailer Burton saw exceptionally heavy turnover as dealers reported good
two-way business and a large agency cross by Cazenove. The shares held at 78
1/2 p with 25m traded.
Speciality chemicals group Laporte fell 16 more to 613p, leading to
speculation that it might have to announce bid terms for Evode today in
order to calm shareholder concern.
An analyst said it would need to announce a rights issue of some Pounds 150m
to fund the bid, but another argued that a paper offer worth the equivalent
of 100p a share need not be dilutive. Wassall, which rescinded the 'final'
from Tuesday's final 95p a share hostile bid, was steady at 207p, while
Evode added another penny at 105p.

FT  07 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Second tier stocks continue to lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIVERGENCE between blue chips and second tier stocks continued to widen in
London yesterday as the market's top 100 stocks backed away on currency and
interest rate uncertainty while the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which ranges
further down the list of London quoted stocks, extended its recent gain to
close at a new peak.
Attention now focuses on this morning's policy meeting at the Bundesbank, in
the hope that a cut in German rates will open the way for rate reductions in
the UK. As expected, the Footsie stocks responded yesterday to moves in the
March futures contract on the FT-SE Index, which improved briefly but then
led the stock market lower.
An erratic session saw the FT-SE Index peak early for the day at 2,839.2
before drifting down to a close of 2,826.0, a net loss of 7.6. The index has
fallen by around 1.2 per cent from its all-time high of 2,861.5, reached on
January 4.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, however, gained a further 9.1, or 0.2 per cent, at
2,919.3, yet another record high, as investors continued to buy the
domestically orientated stocks thought likely to benefit from the signs of
improvement in the UK economy apparently signposted by the outcome of
consumer spending at the UK stores over Christmas.
The increased significance of the second tier stocks was reflected in plans
for a new futures instrument to incorporate the smaller stocks. From today,
Smith New Court, one of London's most aggressive marketmakers, will make
markets in futures contracts on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index and five sector
indices - banks, electricity, health and household, oils and water indices.
Seaq volume of 701.0m shares provided another indication of the underlying
strength of the stock market. Tuesday's Seaq total of 769.1m shares was
worth Pounds 1.42bn in retail business, one of the best daily totals for the
past four months.
However, traders were still inclined to caution, pointing out that Scottish
institutions have not yet returned to full working levels, and that many
London-based fund managers are on holiday until the end of the week.
Firmness in sterling, conventionally a support for base rate optimism, was
overshadowed by developments in other European currencies and by caution
ahead of the Bundesbank meeting. The absence of the rights issue from a blue
chip company with which the market had been threatened on Tuesday brought
only temporary relief since many strategists believe that equity
fund-raisings, together with government financing, will provide a serious
threat to progress in share prices in the early months of this year.
Store shares, which provided much of the momentum for the pre-Christmas
advance in the UK stock market, drifted yesterday as they awaited further
confirmation of improvement in consumer spending.
At NatWest Securities, the equity strategy team suggested that 'the fun is
over' for UK equities, following the 25 per cent upsurge in the market
during the latter part of last year.
If shares advance further on the expectations of lower interest rates, then
the NatWest team advises selling into strength. It comments that any UK
recovery will be export-led, with only modest improvement in consumer
spending.

FT  07 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIN trading as institutional buyers sat on the sidelines in advance of
today's Bundesbank meeting produced a fairly featureless day in the futures
market, writes Christopher Price.
The March contract on the FT-SE Index opened weakly at 2,853 and was quickly
sold down, with independent traders leading the way.
However, a bout of positive news from the currency markets, where short
sterling was reported strong, led to a squeeze and March rallied. It reached
a high for the day of 2,869 by noon.
The rest of the day's trading was conducted in a narrow 20-point range, with
many of the big institutional buyers taking a back seat in anticipation of
the Bundesbank meeting in Germany today. While the market does not seriously
expect a rate cut, it is hoping for some indications of the direction of
German monetary policy.
March drifted in the dull afternoon session, closing at 2,847, down 3 from
the previous day and at an estimated 7-point premium to fair value of around
14. Volume was an unexceptional 5,132 contracts.
A more lively options market saw 29,100 contracts transacted, 8,462 of which
were in the FT-SE 100.
BP was the top traded stock option with 4,141 lots dealt. This was followed
by British Airways on 1,400, British Aerospace on 1,329 and Pilkington on
1,240.

FT  07 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Middle East reports cloud
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were mixed in a very large turnover yesterday as underlying
optimism about the economy and equities was tempered by concern about
developments in the Middle East, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.71 off at 3,305.16 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.18 firmer at 434.52. The Nasdaq composite,
however, driven by strong demand for secondary stocks, registered an
impressive gain of 7.51 at a record high of 681.85. Trading volume on the
New York SE was exceptionally heavy at 295m shares.
As happened earlier in the week, blue chips struggled to hold on to early
gains while secondary issues, especially small company growth stocks, posted
rises to add to Tuesday's solid advance.
Investor sentiment about the economy remained broadly positive, if somewhat
cautious ahead of tomorrow's important jobs data for December. A cloud was
cast over the market, however, by reports that the US and its allies were
ready to issue an ultimatum to Iraq to remove recently deployed
surface-to-air missiles from the southern part of Iraq.
In the light of yesterday's belligerent statements from Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein investors were worried that a resumption of hostilities in the
Middle East could undermine US consumer confidence temporarily and hinder
recovery.
Philip Morris continued to decline, weakening Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 71
7/8 in volume of 9.4m shares. Troubled early in the week by reports that
cigarette taxes in New York state might be raised, the stock was hit
yesterday by reports that recent sales of its Marlboro brand have been worse
than expected, and by news that the Environmental Protection Agency was
about to declare that 'passive' tobacco smoke is a human carcinogen - a
finding that could lead to drastic new curbs on smoking in workplaces and
public areas.
The company countered yesterday by claiming that the EPA had ignored
research findings showing that non-smokers had no cancer risk from passive
smoke.
Car issues remained in the spotlight as the motor show in Detroit entered
its third day. Chrysler jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 36 in volume of 8.6m
shares, aided by a Wall Street broker's earnings upgrade and reports that
analysts are looking more positively at the company and its new vehicles.
Chrysler said yesterday that it was considering launching a credit card.
General Motors, which already has its own credit card, moved forward Dollars
 3/4 to Dollars 34 and Ford edged Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 44 3/4 .
Drug shares were generally weaker on worries about price controls being
imposed by the Clinton administration, but Pfizer stood out, falling Dollars
1 5/8 to Dollars 68 1/4 after a California court upheld the earlier decision
of a lower court to allow recipients of the company's Bjork-Shiley heart
valve to sue Pfizer in the California courts over malfunctions of the valve.
Canada
TORONTO ended flat after heavy volume as lack of direction on Wall Street
continued to restrain gains and the market traded sideways ahead of
fourth-quarter financial earnings. The TSE 300 index eased 0.4 to 3,353.0
but rises led declines by 326 to 264 after turnover of 52.6m shares.

FT  07 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate prospects sway
continental trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate considerations moved a number of bourses yesterday. Milan,
Madrid, Stockholm and Vienna were closed for a public holiday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS had a volatile and heavy day's trading as the CAC-40 went as low as
1,846.99 and as high as 1,870.44 before ending 8.85 higher at 1,859.63. A
firmer franc and hopes of lower interest rates also supported the market.
Turnover was a heavy FFr3bn, due to activity in leading stocks such as
Societe Generale and Alcatel.
Alcatel fell FFr13 to FFr675 on news that the company was calling in its
series of 6 per cent convertible bonds issued in 1989 from February 3. The
stock has also been downgraded by some brokers recently.
Societe Generale dropped FFr9 to FFr608 and Paribas rose FFr11.20 to
FFr351.70 on reports that Lehman Brothers had recommended a switch from
Societe Generale into Paribas. Dealers added that Societe Generale was due
for a correction after its recent gains.
The hypermarkets group, Carrefour, rose FFr41 to FFr2,391 on news that its
December sales had risen 7.9 per cent from December 1991 to FFr16.1bn.
FRANKFURT was stopped in its tracks after the Bundesbank president, Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, said in a speech in Oslo that German inflationary risks
must be capped before interest rates could come down.
This soured hopes that the Bundesbank would cut key interest rates at
today's council meeting, following speculation of a rate cut on Tuesday when
France and Germany pledged support for the embattled franc.
German market turnover fell from DM4.1bn to DM3.4bn. The DAX index closed
virtually flat, just 0.04 lower at 1,556.38 after Tuesday's 1.6 per cent
gain.
However, there was some movement in second-liners. AMB rose another DM37 to
DM820, up DM70 this week on the sale of a majority stake in BfG to Credit
Lyonnais. Escada dropped another DM17 to DM122, compared with a 1992 high of
DM585, on worries about the fashion company's future following the death of
its co-founder, Ms Margaretha Ley, last year.
AMSTERDAM, encouraged by hopes of a cut in domestic interest rates today,
enjoyed another strong day with the CBS Tendency index rising 0.9 to 97.4.
Among the day's features, VNU gained Fl 3.10 or 3.5 per cent to Fl 92.50 as
investors continued to react to Tuesday's report that it expected an 8 per
cent improvement in 1992 net profit. Elsevier was Fl 2.40 stronger at Fl
124.30.
Wessanen, the food group, advanced Fl 2.30 or 2.3 per cent to Fl 102.40
after it forecast a 12 per cent increase in 1992 earnings. Elsewhere,
Nedlloyd advanced Fl 1.10 to Fl 34.50 and DSM was 30 cents higher at Fl
76.10.
The financial sector went against the trend after recent gains with ING down
70 cents at Fl 56.30 and ABN Amro losing 10 cents to Fl 52.00.
ZURICH featured an accelerated fall in CS Holding following confirmation of
its planned takeover of Swiss Volksbank, the bearers finishing SFr120 or 5.7
per cent lower at SFr1,980. There were outside estimates of a 12 per cent
dilution in CS Holding earnings for 1993 as a result of the Volksbank
acquisition.
Investors were encouraged to switch to other banks. SBC rose SFr13 to SFr326
and Volksbank closed at SFr1,100, up SFr380 from its pre-suspension close.
The SMI index fell 3.5 to 2,124.4.
BRUSSELS closed mostly lower as the retailer, Delhaize, fell another BFr32
to BFr1,248. Its US unit, Food Lion, is due to release its December sales
figures today and Delhaize is expected to make a statement on its 1992
earnings tomorrow. The Bel-20 index fell 6.4 to 1,132.13 in turnover of
BFr962m.
Among other leading stocks, Petrofina saw its Tuesday gains wiped out as it
fell BFr130 to BFr7,480, and Solvay eased BFr25 to BFr11,600.
OSLO rose another 1 per cent, helped by expectations of lower domestic
interest rates. After the market closed, the central bank said that it was
cutting the overnight lending rate to 10.5 per cent from 11 per cent from
today. The all-share index gained 4.12 to 394.93 in turnover of NKr338m.
Among major stocks, Norsk Hydro and Kvaerner free shares both gained NKr4 to
NKr163 and NKr169 respectively.
ISTANBUL gained 1.1 per cent in selective trade based on year-end company
profit expectations, and the 75-share market index ended at the highest
close in more than three months, up 46.52 at 4,125.00.
DUBLIN reflected the heavy speculation in the London and New York currency
markets against the Irish pound. The ISEQ overall index rose another 20.49
to 1,295.77, extending its gain to 5.6 per cent in three days.
Once again, five majors combining a domestic play with overseas earnings led
the gains, Allied Irish Banks outdistancing Bank of Ireland, Irish Life, CRH
and Smurfit with a rise of 8p to IPounds 1.82.

FT  07 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): De Beers rises 3.5%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DE BEERS led shares higher in Johannesburg yesterday, although trading
volumes were generally thin.
The overall index added 31 at 3,280 and the industrial index climbed 43 to
4,406. The gold index was up 7 at 782. Dealers said activity was likely to
improve later in the week as more investors entered the market after
evaluating investment strategies.
De Beers reported that rough diamond sales by its Central Selling
Organisation had fallen by 13 per cent during 1992 to Dollars 3.42bn, with
second-half sales declining by 12 per cent to Dollars 1.63bn. However, the
fall was smaller than most analysts' forecasts and De Beers closed R2, or
3.5 per cent, up at R59.75.
De Beers' associate, Anglos, reversed an earlier loss to finish R1.15 ahead
at R87.90.
Gold shares showed resilience as investors looked for a bounce in the price
of bullion from its recent lows. Vaal Reefs gained R2 at R139 and Kloof
added 25 cents at R24.25.
Elsewhere, Gencor appreciated 20 cents to R10, Richemont improved 45 cents
to R37.25 and Sasol moved forward 35 cents to R16.85.

FT  07 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls on
arbitrage selling
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES-linked arbitrage selling gave a downward impetus to Tokyo share
prices in another day of quiet trading, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended at 16,782.88, down 59.70 from Tuesday's close. The
index followed the previous day's pattern, reaching a high of 16,862.45 in
early trading before selling by arbitrageurs pushed it to a low of 16,650.35
in the afternoon. The market rallied shortly before the close.
Declining stocks outnumbered rises by 569 to 347, with 179 issues unchanged.
Volume remained low, at an estimated 170m shares against Tuesday's 167m. The
Topix index of all first section shares dipped 6.26 to 1,291.87. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.70 to 1,054.25.
Brokers expect trading to remain quiet for the rest of this week, with no
important economic data announcements scheduled which could provide impetus
to a lacklustre market.
'Most of us are still waiting for the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of
Japan to show their hands,' said Mr Brian Tobin of SG Warburg. 'A lot of
people were expecting there would be an interest rate cut by the end of
1992.'
Construction, heavy industry and foods issues led a decline in most sectors,
with only a few stocks backed by specific buying incentives.
Brokers said some issues, such as Nintendo and Sega, which traditionally had
a year-end run were still holding up well, because their profitability stood
out in contrast to other companies.
Isuzu Motors kept its position as the most actively traded stock for the
third consecutive day, easing back Y9 to Y329 after recent strong gains on
expectations of restructuring. Other motors closed mostly lower after
Tuesday's news that new vehicle registrations in Japan fell by 7.2 per cent
last year. Nissan Motor declined Y12 to Y550 and Toyota Motor and Honda
Motor each slipped Y10 to Y,1440 and Y1,310 respectively.
Asics, the sporting goods company, was the day's biggest loser, dropping Y43
to Y420 after announcing a 55 per cent year-on-year decline in pre-tax
profits.
Dowa Mining gained Y14 at Y544 in volume of 2.6m shares on reports of its
successful development of superconductive thin films. Fujitsu General, the
consumer electronics affiliate of Fujitsu, was traded heavily for a second
day on news that it is to handle production of Fujitsu's new home-use
multi-media device. Late profit-taking left Fujitsu General down Y3 at Y464.
In Osaka the OSE average finished 30.62 down at 18,393.98 in volume of 58m
shares.
Roundup
THE REGION saw mixed performances yesterday.
HONG KONG ended higher in moderate trading, helped by expectations of
renewed institutional buying in the new year and the suspension of trading
in CITIC Pacific amid rumours that it was about to make a HKDollars 7bn
placement to buy a 10 per cent stake in Hong Kong Telecom held by its
Beijing parent.
The Hang Seng index put on 38.64 at 5,586.67 as turnover improved further to
HKDollars 2.02bn from HKDollars 1.71bn.
HSBC Holdings topped the actives list and jumped HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars
57, followed by its Hang Seng Bank unit, which gained 50 cents at HKDollars
53.50, and HK Telecom, up 5 cents at HKDollars 9.70.
TAIWAN closed at a 26-month low on poor economic data and political worries.
The weighted index fell 153.74, or 4.6 per cent, to 3,188.44 in moderate
turnover of TDollars 10.75bn.
The data revealed that the country's trade surplus had shrunk to an
eight-year low while the average annual inflation rate had reached an
11-year high in 1992.
SINGAPORE suffered from profit-taking after sharp gains on Tuesday. The
Straits Times Industrial index shed 4.13 to 1,558.22 in volume of 149m
shares.
Foreign shares of SIA, OCBC, DBS and UOB topped the list of losers, eaching
falling between 40 and 20 cents.
SEOUL finished easier as large-capitalisation shares lost momentum. The
composite index was 2.39 lower at 688.40 in turnover of Won677.34bn, against
Won667.62bn.
BANGKOK saw heavy buying of banks in the afternoon, boosting the stock index
to a close above the 900 level for the first time since authorities filed
share manipulation charges against a leading investor in November. The SET
index rose 13.20, or 1.5 per cent, to 904.11 in active turnover of Bt9.92bn.
MANILA was lifted by the oil sector and the composite index moved up 2.81 to
1,277.42 in turnover of some 236m pesos. Philippine Long Distance Telephone
lost 5 pesos to 875 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR showed some improvement on bargain hunting. The composite index
rose 2.77 to 633.66 in volume of 74m shares. Multi-Purpose Holdings group
shares led the gains as Multi-Purpose added 12 cents at MDollars 1.82 with
7.6m shares traded.
AUSTRALIA fell back on profit-taking before the release of November balance
of payments data. The All Ordinaries index lost 22.7 to 1,542.1 in turnover
of ADollars 276.3m.
News Corp weakened 80 cents to ADollars 28.60 on news that the head of its
Fox Broadcasting unit in the US had resigned.
NEW ZEALAND was depressed by interest rate rises, the NZSE-40 capital index
falling 26.36, or 1.66 per cent, to 1,557.07. Turnover was high at NZDollars
27m.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Punt under intense pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc improved against the D-Mark inside the European exchange
rate mech-anism yesterday, but pressures on the Irish punt intensified
sharply, writes James Blitz.
A series of measures taken on Tuesday by the Bundesbank and the Bank of
France to support the franc continued to have a positive effect on the
currency yesterday. It closed  1/2 centime higher at FFr3.409 to the D-Mark.
However, the focus of attention inside the system moved to the Irish punt.
In early afternoon trading in Europe, the punt fell to its ERM floors
against the Dutch guilder and Belgian franc, the strongest currencies
operating within narrow bands in the system.
In consequence, the Irish authorities announced at the end of ERM trading
that they would be hoisting the overnight rate in the Irish punt money
market to 50 per cent today from around 14 per cent.
The move could not prevent the punt falling below its respective ERM floors
against the guilder and Belgian franc later in the US.
The Irish pound is certain to be the focus of attention in currency markets
today. But the key question in the ERM remains whether the French franc can
survive the recent pressures.
There were more indications yesterday that a number of continental fund
managers had actively hedged themselves out of French francs in recent days,
believing a devaluation could occur. But several analysts pointed out that
French corporates remain long of French francs, and that greater pressure on
the currency now requires weakness from France's domestic investors.
There will be a strong focus today on the Bundesbank council meeting, and
the possibility that interest rates may be cut. Few in the market believe
that there will be an easing in official rates. But a new set of economic
forecasts has underlined the need for a policy easing. The DIW Institute's
forecast for 1993 was particularly startling, predicting a 1 per cent drop
in GDP in western Germany this year.
There was some speculation that the Bundesbank might carry out a 'cosmetic'
50 basis-point easing in the Lombard rate today. At 9.5 per cent, its level
is well above market rates of about 8.75 per cent.
The omens for this were not promising, however. The Bundesbank said there
will be no press conference after today's council meeting, and Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the central bank's president, yesterday reiterated his
counter-inflationary policy in a speech in Oslo.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, continues to believe
that the French franc will survive the present crisis. 'I simply do not
believe that something like the devaluation of the franc, with all the
political consequences it would have, could occur without a real fight,' he
said. 'We have not seen anything like the number of rabbits that could be
pulled out of the hat by the French.'
