FT  05 JAN 93 / Redland agrees European deals of Pounds 59m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDLAND, the building materials group which paid Pounds 624m in shares for
Steetley last year, has raised Pounds 100m through disposals. It is
reinvesting Pounds 58.6m in its continental European tile and brick
activities.
Redland is forming a joint venture with Koramic, a private Belgian company,
encompassing the two companies' brick making in the Netherlands, Germany and
Belgium. The new company will be the largest facing brick maker in
continental Europe.
Profits of the combined activities in 1992 would have been Pounds 15.9m, of
which Redland's share would have been Pounds 5.8m. The 50:50 joint venture
will own 70 per cent of the combined activities, giving Redland a 35 per
cent economic interest but joint control. Redland will also receive Pounds
17.3m in cash.
Redland is increasing its stake in Coverland, the French roof tile producer,
from 43 per cent to 67 per cent by acquiring part of St Gobain's
shareholding. Options for Redland to purchase St Gobain's remaining 33 per
cent for Pounds 24m have been agreed.
Redland and St Gobain are each subscribing Pounds 36m of new equity in
Coverland to redeem Pounds 72m of debt, and Redland is paying St Gobain
Pounds 12m. Coverland made a small operating loss in 1992 but had made
Pounds 10m in 1990.
Braas, Redland's German roof tile subsidiary, is buying Dan Tegl, the
leading Danish clay tile maker for Pounds 10.6m. It made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.4m in 1992.
Mr Robert Napier, Redland's chief executive, said the disposals had been
made on good terms in spite of current difficult market conditions. They
are:
Steetley Clay Tiles for Pounds 19m, against net assets of Pounds 17m, to
Eternit Group of Belgium;
Steetley Refractories which made a Pounds 1.4m pre-tax profit in 1992 to JE
Baker of the US, for Pounds 14.3m. As well as the cash Redland has an
agreement to supply raw material to Baker;
Redland's 20 per cent stake in Lafarge Platreurope, a plasterboard maker, to
Lafarge Coppee, its joint venture partner, for Pounds 41.25m;
Construction Jean Bernard, a loss-making French civil engineering group for
a nominal sum;
Redland's 50 per cent stake in Columbia River Carbonates to its joint
venture partner for Pounds 3.8m;
Its Waco quarry business in Texas for Pounds 4.6m.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Companies in clash over Skoda shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPLIT has developed between the Volkswagen-controlled company that is
taking over imports of Czech-built Skoda cars to the UK and Skoda (GB),
which has handled them for the past 27 years.
Skoda (GB), owned by Motokov, the former Czechoslovak state foreign trade
organisation - itself being privatised - is refusing to allow its 250
dealers to sign contracts with the new company, Skoda Automobile UK, while
negotiations continue on whether Skoda (GB) should continue to play an
operational role in the import and distribution of the cars.
About 10,000 Skodas are sold in the UK each year.
Mr David Wilks, of Skoda (GB), said yesterday the company had expected that
the import and preparation centre it had operated for many years in Kings
Lynn, Norfolk, would continue to process the cars under contract to Skoda
Automobile UK.
Instead, VW is planning to set up its own import and distribution
arrangements, in keeping with its intention to expand Skoda sales greatly.
It hopes to quadruple sales - to 40,000 a year - by as early as 1996.
VW already has management control of the Czech manufacturer and is building
a 70 per cent stake.
Skoda (GB), while refusing to release dealers from their franchise
contracts, said it had temporarily freed them from their obligation to buy
cars exclusively from Skoda (GB) - in effect allowing them to take supplies
from the new company while negotiations continue and when Skoda Automobile
UK starts making its own shipments.
With the UK new car market still in recession, most dealers are believed to
have sufficient stocks to last through protracted negotiations.
The cooling in relations between the two sides comes as a setback after 13
months of mainly amicable negotiations over the transition.
More than 29 Skoda (GB) personnel have already transferred to the new
company. However, the impasse over the Kings Lynn import centre has led to
44 people being made redundant there.
Skoda Automobile UK formally took over as the UK importer on January 1 and
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Skoda Automobilova. VW already holds 31 per
cent, with the balance in the hands of the Czech government.
Its managing director, Mr Robin Woolcock, is a former managing director of
MAN Volkswagen Truck and Bus, the UK importer of Volkswagen and MAN
commercial vehicles.
Mr Woolcock has been managing the negotiations with Skoda (GB) and the
creation of the new company, which has just set up offices in Milton Keynes.
The expected leap in sales is based on a significant investment programme
for Skoda vehicles.
The DM8bn (Pounds 3.3bn) programme will lead to new models and is designed
to more than double Skoda's capacity to 460,000 cars a year by the mid
1990s.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Pounds 5.5m for Bristol warehouse project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED MOLASSES is to build a Pounds 5.5m warehouse at Bristol's Royal
Portbury Dock which it says will be the biggest in Europe for handling
animal feedstuffs and fertilisers.
The warehouse is part of a Pounds 15m investment by the dock company to
develop handling facilities for agricultural and related products.
United Molasses expects the warehouse to be operating by July. It will
initially handle soya and maize gluten and fertilisers.
Mr Tim Holderness-Roddam, deputy managing director of United, said: 'This
will be the biggest and most modern handling facility in Europe, capable of
discharging vessels of up to 120,000 tonnes deadweight.'
United, part of the Tate &amp; Lyle sugar group, sees the investment as a key
part of its strategy to develop the dry bulk handling of by-products for the
animal-feed industry.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Old ways dull the call to a new Ukraine: Chrystia Freeland
and Edward Balls on reluctance to reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the former Soviet Union's few military-industrial enterprises that
could make a relatively smooth transition to the market economy is Ukraine's
Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev. But its director, Mr Yuri Makarov, seems in
no hurry to usher in the new era.
Mr Makarov is reported to be giving no encouragement to western companies
keen to place million-dollar orders for double-hulled oil tankers with the
shipyard.
'Tankers are just empty boxes with nothing like the technical sophistication
of an aircraft carrier,' Mr Makarov says, with a disdainful nod toward the
bulky oil tankers which can fetch Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.7m) a piece.
Instead, with fond memories of the shipyard's more glamorous past, he says:
'Building an aircraft carrier - now that's true technology.'
Mr Makarov, a bulky, genial man edging towards retirement, finds it
difficult to accept that, with little prospect of military orders from
Ukraine's bankrupt and inflation-plagued government, the days of building
giant aircraft carriers are gone - at least for the foreseeable future.
Low labour costs and an upsurge in demand for double-hulled oil tankers in
the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill might just make it possible for the
Black Sea Shipyard - in a leaner and partly privatised incarnation with a
foreign partner - to make a profit.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is considering offering
finance and help in the restructuring if the shipyard spins off its tanker
and marine production facilities into a separate private venture.
The EBRD estimates that if the privatised arm of the factory were to sell
three tankers and 2,500 tonnes of marine chain a year it could operate
profitably while more of its plant is converted to non-military production.
'Military conversion is a priority area for the EBRD,' says Mr Ron Freeman,
first vice- president for merchant banking. 'But, as you can see from the
Nikolayev project, management commitment is paramount before anything can go
ahead.'
The yard's deputy director, Mr Boris Goldberg, is eager to adopt the EBRD
plan, despite the hostility of the director, and says he is ready to lay off
up to 40 per cent of the workforce to make the factory more efficient.
He has powerful supporters. Mr Anatoli Kinakh, the Ukraine government's
regional representative in Nikolayev and a man of considerable influence in
Ukraine's centralised polity, backs the partial privatisation and conversion
of the shipyard and insists the deal will go ahead.
The yard itself is littered with piles of metal, the remains of an aircraft
carrier which took six years to build - and six months to dismantle for
scrap. Towering over them is the graceful but unfinished Variah, the Viking,
which was 65 per cent completed when the Ukrainian government decided to
stop pouring money into a ship that it was unlikely ever to use or sell.
A minority of the workforce is building trawlers for which no market exists,
but most are idle and absent. 'This is what conversion means for us,' Mr
Makarov says as he walks across the abandoned, rusting skeleton of the
Variah. 'Everything is lying dead.'
The profligate ways of Mr Vitolv Fokin, Ukraine's recently ousted prime
minister, have given the Black Sea Shipyard, like the rest of the country's
lumbering state sector, the luxury of hesitation.
Over the past six months, the Black Sea Shipyard has received Rbs3bn in
unbacked bank credits at an interest rate of 5 per cent a year, according to
government officials. These cheap loans allow Mr Makarov to pay his 25,000
employees the generous salary of Rbs18,000 a month and mourn the passing of
the cold war.
Mr Makarov's story is a familiar one in Ukraine. Over the past year the
government has issued more than Rbs1,100bn in credit to prop up the
inefficient state sector and prevent politically difficult bankruptcies and
lay-offs.
The result is the creeping hyperinflation, now more than 30 per cent a
month, which threatens to undermine Ukraine's fledgling currency, the
coupon. 'If net credit emission does not soon cease, it will seriously
undermine the government's stabilisation policy,' says Mr Oleh Havrylyshyn,
deputy minister of finance.
Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's new and reform-minded prime minister, has said
large-scale credits to state industries must stop. But Mr Havrylyshyn
suspects that in November, while Mr Kuchma was recovering from a thyroid
operation, the central bank ignored his moratorium on the emission of new
credit.
Moreover, last month the government issued a further Rbs229bn in subsidies
to coal and agriculture which will push the budget deficit toward 40 per
cent of gross domestic product for 1992.
Such monetary credits would have to be stopped if Ukraine is to bring
inflation under control and meet the strict monetary targets the
International Monetary Fund is demanding as a condition of western aid.
Ukrainian officials say the IMF, which recently sent a mission to Kiev,
wants Ukraine to pare its budget deficit down to 6 per cent of GDP next year
and inflation to 3 per cent in the last quarter of 1993.
Yet chastened by the political difficulties provoked by orthodox monetary
policies in Russia, Ukrainian reformers are worried about the political
consequences of forcing state factories to break their addiction to
government subsidies overnight.
World Bank economists in Ukraine, say that a combination of stabilisation,
liberalisation and western aid is needed to finance the budget deficit
without printing money. But for the 50 or 60 largest enterprise in the
country, in particular the large loss-makers, the government should prepare
individual plans to phase out subsidies gradually, thus giving the private
sector time to grow and soak up unemployment.

Excessive packaging of consumer goods sold in Germany has largely

Topfer, environment minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
Under the law, shoppers unhappy with packaging added to make goods more
attractive can take the wrapping off in the shop and dump it there to be

Nearly three quarters of all German drinks were now sold in reusable

FT  05 JAN 93 / Circulation of The European rises to 200,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN newspaper is about to enter its second year of non-Maxwell
ownership with sales of about 200,000.
The international newspaper, which many expected would not long survive the
death of its founder and patron Robert Maxwell, was relaunched under the
ownership of the Barclay brothers on January 6 last year.
'We have increased sales week after week since,' said Mr Charles Garside,
editor of the weekly, which was losing about Pounds 1m a month under
Maxwell.
The newspaper's period of crisis after Maxwell's death severely affected its
complex distribution system, and Mr Garside believes the paper has come from
80,000 to about 200,000 in the year, although official sales figures are not
available.
In May the paper was able to bring back its suspended third section Elan and
resume promotion.
Mr Garside said that the owners, Mr David and Mr Frederick Barclay, who live
in Monte Carlo and own hotels and shipping lines, are pleased with the
progress of their first newspaper.
The main growth in sales has come from France, Germany and Spain. Sales in
the UK account for about a third of the total, although that proportion is
declining.
Mr Garside would not disclose details of the newspaper's financial
performance but said that all newspapers take about four years to break into
profit. The European is now 2 1/2 years old.
'We have a more than a good chance of making it work in the not-too-distant
future,' Mr Garside said.
He is also encouraged by the number of his newspaper's reports that are
being followed up each week by other newspapers.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Drug ills blamed on deprivation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BISHOP of Hulme, whose diocese includes the rundown Moss Side area of
Manchester where a 14-year-old boy was shot dead at the weekend, blamed
unemployment and deprivation yesterday for the scale of drug-trafficking and
violence in the area.
The Rt Rev Colin Scott warned that his own fear was that the rising scale of
violence in the area might drive away vital traders and businesses.
The death of John Benjamin Stanley, killed on Saturday night while queueing
at a West Indian take-away, is the latest in a series of incidents in a 2 sq
mile area of 1960s housing estates.
Bishop Scott said: 'The background reason is obviously the level of
unemployment, a dilapidated estate and very few opportunities for work
there, particularly for school leavers.
'If the future doesn't hold any promise, it is tempting to be drawn either
into drugs as a personal escape or into drug pushing as a way of making easy
money.'
He said the area was difficult to police and had become a marketplace for
drugs, attracting customers and suppliers from outside the area  - although
he said many of the drug pushers were from the estate itself.
Bishop Scott, who is also Acting Bishop of Manchester, said: 'The violence
only involves a minority of people. But what is frightening is if shops and
businesses are frightened away. That will do an even greater harm to the
community there.'
He said although police had made mistakes in the past and had sometimes been
guilty of 'insensitivity', they were working hard to build up a good
relationship with the community.
Other local initiatives and the City Challenge scheme also held promise, but
it took a long time to undo the damage.
'I am frightened, as other people are, at the way young school leavers are
turning to drugs,' he said.
Moss Side is one of the most deprived urban areas of Britain but is less
than a mile from Manchester city centre. In 1981, up to 1,000 people were
involved in disturbances in the area.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Motive sought for 'contract' murder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE investigating the killing of Mr Donald Urquhart, a London property
consultant, were still searching for a motive yesterday.
Detectives were making inquiries in the Marylebone area of London's West End
where Mr Urquhart, 55, was shot on Saturday night by a man who escaped on a
motorcycle.
The businessman had property dealings through a company called Bellgap and
was part-owner of the Elstree Golf Club at Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.
Police are convinced that the shooting was the work of a professional
killer.
Mr Urquhart was with his Thai-born girlfriend Miss Pat Iamspithone when he
was attacked near his penthouse home in Nottingham Street on Saturday night.
The gunman, wearing a crash helmet, shot Mr Urquhart in the head with a
revolver at close range. Mr Urquhart died three hours later in hospital.
Police were also examining files stored in Mr Urquhart's car, a stretched
Rover 827, which he used as a mobile office.
Mr Urquhart, who told business colleagues he started work as a hod carrier
on a building site, built up his fortune during the property boom of the
1970s and 1980s. He had connections abroad with tax havens such as Jersey in
the Channel Islands.
Detective Superintendent Bill Scholes, heading the investigating, said:
'This murder has all the hallmarks of a professional killing, by which I
mean somebody has been paid to do it, and it's been very professionally
carried out.'
Scotland Yard said: 'We are attempting to unravel Mr Urquhart's finances.
There is no evidence to suggest he was involved in anything illegal.'

The first snow of the winter in the Yorkshire coalfields covers the
stockpiles at Sharlston Colliery, near Wakefield, one of the pits threatened
with closure.
Opposition to the pit closure programme will be stepped up tomorrow when
mining unions meet the TUC to plan the next stage in their campaign. The
National Union of Mineworkers, the pit deputies' union Nacods and the
British Association of Colliery Management will hold talks with the
emergency committee set up by the TUC to campaign for jobs and economic
recovery.
The mining unions will later meet rail unions to 'discuss developments'
since they last met in October, just after British Coal announced its plan
to close 31 pits with the loss of 30,000 jobs.
The unions want to keep pressure on the government after the pre-Christmas
High Court ruling that the closure programme was unlawful.
The talks at the TUC will be followed by a meeting of the TUC
public-services committee to discuss opposition to the government's 1.5 per
cent ceiling on public-sector pay rises this year.

FT  05 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Record close after an erratic session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATE optimism returned to encourage the London stock market on its
first trading day of 1993, taking the FT-SE Index ahead to set an all-time
high, but only towards the close of an erratic session. Dollar strength
helped the blue chips, while pressure on the French franc appeared to
increase the likelihood of interest rate cuts across the ERM countries, thus
opening the way for the widely predicted cut in UK rates.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,861.5, up 15 points on the day at
a new closing peak, which followed a trading record of 2,867.9 reached at
mid-afternoon. But the morning session saw the Footsie down by more than 16
points in the face of weakening prices for UK government bonds.
Dollar strength was broadly helpful across the range of international stocks
but suggestions of demand for stock index futures was not borne out by
trading specialists. Interest rate hopes, on the other hand, spurred the
second line stocks ahead again vigorously, taking the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
ahead by around 1.2 per cent to a fresh peak of 2,896.4. Increased demand
for the Mid 250 second line issues is believed by many analysts to provide
the clearest evidence to date of a genuine revival in confidence in the
stock market and in the wider economy.
Seaq trading volume jumped to 606.6m shares, still on the low side in spite
of comparison with the 228.9m shares traded on New Year's Eve, when retail
value, the true measure of equity market activity, reached only Pounds
383.6m, barely one-third of normal levels.
Initial weakness in equities reflected warnings from some market strategists
that the stock market rally could be challenged by rights issues as well as
by increased government funding. Nervousness was also fuelled by the falls
in government bonds and by perceptions that Mr John Major, the UK prime
minister, had in a television interview expressed somewhat cautious views on
the inflationary outlook in the UK.
Market strategists remained optimistic towards the outlook for UK equities
for this year, although several expressed relative caution over the short
term. Hoare Govett, the UK securities house, saw a 'muted recovery' in the
British economy, with a fall in base rates to 5 per cent providing a boost
for equities by the second half of 1993.
At Nikko, Mr Peter Thorne forecast a Footsie at 2,900 by March and 3,000 by
the year-end, regarding possible weakness in gilts as the main danger to UK
equities. On a global view, Nomura Research Institute Europe calls for an
aggressive shift into equities, with the UK and Japan leading the way higher
in the near term.
Store and retail issues hung fire yesterday, awaiting details of the
suggested buoyancy in Christmas trading. Some strategists believed that it
was too early for any response from consumer spending levels to any economic
improvement prompted by the devaluation of sterling.
Overall, however, traders doubted whether yesterday's session reflected a
return to full trading in the stock market. The Scottish funds, in
particular, were thinly manned as a slow return was made from the New Year
holiday, and the stock index futures market played a more subdued role than
in recent sessions.

FT  05 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets made a subdued return from the New Year holiday, and
stock index futures, in particular, failed to join the underlying stock
market in its rise to new peaks, writes Terry Byland.
The March futures contract on the FT-SE Index traded close to fair value,
the premium which allows for financing and dividend flows.
It closed at a premium of 20 above the cash market, of which 15 was
accounted for by estimates of fair value. At no time did the contract make
any move to challenge its peak of 2,891, reached over the Christmas/New Year
period. Trading volume, at 8,459 lots at the official close, indicated a
modest day's business.
Traders commented that many funds were still on the sidelines, and that
stock index futures had been left to the locals, or independent traders.
Strategists commented that the futures markets had been able to dominate the
underlying stock market over the holiday period, but that it could well
prove more difficult when the market returned to full-time working.
In traded options, however, business was a more healthy 20,476 contracts,
compared with only 8,691 on New Year's Eve. Among individual stock
contracts, Fisons headed the list with 1,234 lots dealt, followed by BP on
1,199, Asda on 1,075 and TSB on 1,004.
Also active was the Euro FT-SE contract, with 597 lots traded in a busy
session.

FT  05 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: New year gain for Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUGS group Wellcome attracted support, partly in reaction to a clinical
study favourable to Retrovir, the company's Aids treatment. The shares rose
12 to 979p
Yesterday was the first day that investment funds which took responsibility
for the Wellcome Trust's portfolio on January 1 were able to deal. The
portfolio has been spread among blue chip stocks following the Trust's
massive sale of Wellcome shares during the summer.
There was talk among market traders and professionals that one of the funds
had adjusted its share of the portfolio and that the movement of two large
buy programmes through the market was responsible for turning the FT-SE 100
index around. Dealers said UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was consistently on the bid.
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund management is one of the portfolio handlers appointed
in October.
Wellcome sources said it was too early for any significant position-taking
and most of the money raised by the flotation had been invested in equities
before Black Wednesday on September 16.
Owners Abroad strong
Market hints that a predator may be about to pounce on Owners Abroad, the
package tours holiday group, before Owners' shareholders vote at this
Friday's extraordinary general meeting, saw the company's shares outpace a
very firm leisure sector.
At the close, Owners Abroad were 11 higher at 107 1/2 p after some
aggressive buying interest which boosted turnover in the stock to an
unusually busy 3.8m shares.
Owners has been surrounded by takeover bid stories since the middle of last
year, with Airtours, another of the most powerful tour operators in the UK,
favourites to launch an offer. The speculation diminished, however, when
LTU, the German company which controls the Thomas Cook travel group, said it
would take a 10.3 per cent stake in Owners.
Although specialists expect Owners' shareholders to approve LTU's
acquisition of shares, there could be a surprisingly high level of
opposition to the move. Airtours is thought to have made a tentative
approach to Owners Abroad last year. Airtours shares also made strong
progress yesterday, helped by reports of strong summer holiday sales,
closing 13 higher at 420p ex-dividend.
Glaxo active
Shares in pharmaceuticals group Glaxo reversed earlier weakness on news that
the US Food and Drug Administration had approved the company's Zofran drug
in oral form.
The FDA gave permission for Glaxo to market the oral form of Zofran, which
prevents nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. The
injectable version has been available in the US since February 1991. The
shares were lower in morning trade as US house Goldman Sachs said the recent
rush of FDA approvals, which prompted a rise in share prices, provided a
profit-taking opportunity in the sector.
Goldman said several UK drug companies are on overvalued ratings and will
see pressure in coming months from news on drug pricing in Europe, as well
as a shift into 'better perceived investment opportunities elsewhere in the
economy'. Glaxo closed 6 higher at 799p on active turnover of 3.2m shares.
News that Budgens, the supermarkets group, had appointed Morgan Grenfell as
its merchant bank, replacing Lloyds Merchant Bank, was the trigger for a
burst of takeover speculation in the food retailer's shares.
Dealers said there were suggestions around the market that Sir Ron Brierley
may be about to put his near 27 per cent stake in Budgens up for sale and
that a European predator was about to move in to buy the stake and launch a
full takeover bid.
Budgens shares rose strongly to close a net 5 higher at 44p; at the
beginning of December they were changing hands at 33p.
TSB was among the least impressive of the banks, the shares settling only 2
1/2 firmer at 155p after BIFU, the banking and insurance industry union,
ordered a one-day strike for Friday in protest at job losses at the bank.
Insurance brokers performed well, reflecting the strength of the dollar.
Sedgwick added 9 at 177p and Willis Corroon 3 at 192p.
The oil majors suffered from intermittent bouts of selling from New York. BP
eased 2 1/2 to 246p and Shell 4 1/2 to 558p. Lasmo, however, responded to
buy recommendations in the weekend press, racing up 9 to 167p.
Dealers adopted a much more relaxed view of the price initiative instigated
last week by J. Sainsbury. But a general view was that the big retailers
would probably indulge in a traditional bout of selective price cuts which
would have only limited impact on profits.
Sainsbury shares rallied 10 to 574p on relatively thin turnover of 3m, while
Tesco picked up 7 to 256p after a hefty 10m shares changed hands. Asda was a
strong market and finally 3 1/2 higher at 59 1/2 p on 9.9m traded.
Kwik Save was keenly bought and 5 up at 778p, with some retailing
specialists confident that Thursday's annual meeting could bring good news
on trading.
Reports of buoyant holiday sales and the prospect of increased spending as
consumers react to lower mortgage costs was put forward as boosting the
whole of the leisure sector.
First Leisure, the largest pure leisure company in the UK, advanced 13 to
351p with dealers said to be anticipating good results when the company
announces preliminary figures a week tomorrow. Rank Organisation, set to
report finals the following day, also made good progress, moving up 10 to
698p.
P &amp; 0 climbed 15 1/2 to 520p after its ferries subsidiary said it was
closing the service between Dover and Boulogne to concentrate on the shorter
Dover-Calais route. Analysts said the move showed the group was addressing
problems on the cross-Channel routes which would now be more competitive
against the Channel tunnel.
News and information organisation Reuters saw its shares perform well with
the help of an upgrade by US house Merrill Lynch. Merrill changed its
recommendation on the stock to a strong buy from a buy and raised its 1993
profit forecast. The stock was principally boosted by buying from the US and
closed 22 higher at 1430p.
ICI improved 11 to 1070p after the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said
it had completed the internal split, or hive-down, of the group into two
separate organisations on January 1, as scheduled.
Hive-down is the first step towards the planned demerger of Zeneca, the
biosciences part of ICI, and ICI Plc, which will retain the chemicals rump
of the existing group. The ICI board will consider full demerger in February
in the light of prevailing economic and market conditions.
Long-standing takeover speculation continued to drive a number of the
building industry stocks higher. Blue Circle moved forward 12 to 211p,
Pilkington 3 to 104p and Tarmac 3 to 106p. The last-named was also boosted
by news of asset sales totalling Pounds 13m. Redland received a strong lift
from news of disposals worth some Pounds 100m and the shares gained 16 to
423p.
Defence group British Aerospace was one of the strongest performers in the
market. The shares jumped 10 to 175p after a Sunday newspaper prediction
that the company would make profits of at least Pounds 100m in 1993. BAe was
also included in a list of 10 companies tipped by London investment firms as
likely targets for takeover bids in the coming year.

FT  05 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sharp bond rally fails to
boost share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK prices ended mixed across the board yesterday, in spite of more
good economic news and a sharp rally in bond prices, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.11 at 3,309.22. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.33 off at 435.38, while
the American SE composite lost 1.88 at 397.35 and the Nasdaq composite was
5.15 lower at 671.80.
Trading volume on the New York SE came to 201m shares, and declines
outnumbered rises by 1,043 to 878.
Prices opened solidly firmer, with the Dow advancing almost 15 points in the
first half-hour of trading, as investors went in search of bargains after
the New Year's Eve sell-off. The buying, however, quickly petered out, and
for the rest of the day blue chips moved in a narrow, but positive, trading
range while many secondary stocks weakened.
More good economic news, in the shape of a much larger than expected 2.1 per
cent rise in November construction spending (its highest level for more than
two years), failed to boost sentiment. Investors also ignored a strong bond
market, where the benchmark 30-year government issue climbed almost a full
point.
Market watchers said investors were probably holding their fire until
Friday's important jobs data, which is expected to give the best reading yet
on the state of the economic recovery.
Among individual stocks, leading industrial issues were mixed. IBM, which
took a dreadful beating in 1992, started the new year on a negative note,
dropping back from an early gain to end Dollars  1/4 down at Dollars 50 1/8
after volume of 3.5m shares. Merck rose Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 43 7/8 ,
Eastman Kodak put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 41 1/8 and Du Pont added
Dollars 1 at Dollars 48 1/8 .
Motor shares were buoyant, aided by hopes that rising consumer spending will
boost car sales this year. General Motors appreciated Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 32 3/4 , Ford Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 44 and Chrysler Dollars 1 1/8
to Dollars 32 5/8 .
Helene Curtis moved ahead Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43 1/8 after the
Chicago-based cosmetics company announced a fiscal third-quarter profit of
44 cents a share, up from 36 cents a year earlier. Hubco strengthened
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 18 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange amid reports
that analysts' estimates of Dollars 1.70 a share for 1993 earnings could be
far too conservative.
On the Nasdaq market, selected leading technology stocks eased. Microsoft
dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 85 1/8 , Apple Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58
1/4 and Intel Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 86 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks finished mixed as a dropping gold bullion price hammered
precious metals shares. The TSE 300 index edged up 0.6 to 3,351.0 but
declines outpaced advances by 294 to 276. Volume was a fairly heavy 30.9m
shares.
COMEX gold closed weakly but above a seven-year low hit earlier in the day.
The February contract was finally down USDollars Dollars 4.70 at USDollars
328.40 an ounce.

FT  05 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses open new year in mixed
fashion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL bourses started 1993 in a mixed fashion, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT, not widely fancied as a prospect for 1993, started the new year
by giving up most of the gains it made on window-dressing last week. The DAX
index closed 13.72 lower at 1,531.33 as turnover fell from DM3.8bn to
DM2.3bn.
Sunday's resignation of the economics minister, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, added
to negative sentiment created by the poor outlook for the German economy.
Retailers were weak as the January sales started, Karstadt dropping DM18 to
DM482.
PARIS eased in thin trading as a rise in short-term interest rates fanned
fears of a possible rise in headline rates to defend the franc. There were
reports of central bank intervention to support the French currency
yesterday. The CAC-40 index fell 14.70 to 1,843.08 in low turnover of
FFr1.2bn.
Elf fell FFr6.20 to FFr356 and BSN ended FFr9 to FFr945.
MILAN ended firmer in thin trading and the best performers were banking
shares and other privatisation candidates. The Comit index was estimated at
451.86, up 5.53, but an official figure was not available. Turnover was
estimated at L165bn after L145bn on December 31.
Credito Italiano rose L109 to L3,269 and Banca Commerciale Italiana added
L98 to L4,838.
ZURICH extended its good run of 1992 with the SMI index 10.7 higher at
2,117.7. Among banks, CS Holding rose SFr40 to SFr2,170 and SBC bearers by
SFr7 to SFr308. Trading in Swiss Volksbank was suspended at the request of
the bank which plans to make a 'positive' announcement tomorrow.
AMSTERDAM was encouraged by a firmer dollar, with the financial sector
making strong gains. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.1 higher at 95.5. ING,
up Fl 1.20 to Fl 55.80, and Aegon, Fl 1.30 higher at Fl 76.50, both finished
at new 12-month highs. Hoogovens went against the trend, losing Fl 1.10 to
Fl 21.90.
STOCKHOLM greeted the new year with a 1.9 per cent rise, largely due to the
stronger dollar. OSLO and HELSINKI followed suit with, respectively, the
composite index up 7.26 to 379.38 and the Hex 21.06 better at 850.06.
Sweden's Affarsvarlden general index added 17.4 to 930.0 in moderate
turnover of SKr400m. Volvo B shares advanced SKr15 to SKr358 despite the
release of statistics indicating that new car registrations fell 23 per cent
in December and that total registrations for 1992 were the lowest since
1958.
VIENNA lost some 3 per cent on institutional selling. The ATX index fell
24.68 to 723.02 with OMV declining Sch26 to Sch590.

INTEREST in equities was slack on the first trading day of the year, and the
Nikkei average gained marginally in the half-day session, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average finished 69.13 higher at 16,994.08 after a low of
16,875.09 and high of 17,034.01. Volume fell to 80m shares from the 113m
recorded on December 30. Declines led rises by 472 to 356, with 201 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 1.85 to
1,305.81, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.06 to 1,067.63.
A weak futures market prompted index-linked selling by arbitrageurs, which
was offset by public fund buying. Reports of financial assistance by the
authorities for ailing financial institutions over the holidays triggered
some short-term trading by dealers.
Taiheiyo Bank, a regional bank based in Tokyo, was the day's biggest gainer,
rising Y40 to Y339 on a report that the Bank of Japan will provide Y60bn for
its restructuring.
Nippon Housing Loan, the leading housing loan company, gained Y36 at Y318 on
reports that financial authorities were considering allowing ailing housing
loan companies to shift their bad loans to a new company.
Isuzu Motors was the most active stock, rising Y12 to Y344 on rumours of
changes in management.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 98.42 to 18,584.25 in volume of 12.1m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC RIM markets were generally stronger in the first session of the new
year. However, HONG KONG went against the trend after China again sought the
withdrawal of Governor Chris Patten's democratic reform proposals. The Hang
Seng index lost 74.59, or 1.35 per cent, to 5,437.80 in thin turnover of
HKDollars 956m.
BOMBAY was another loser in its first session for 10 days: the BSE index
slipped 75.70 to 2,539.67 but volume was reported to be low.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Intervention to support franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH the Bundesbank and the Bank of France intervened on the foreign
exchanges in support of the French franc yesterday, as dealers indicated
that they may be prepared to carry out the threatened new year speculation
against the French currency, writes James Blitz.
The intervention by both central banks was estimated to be on the modest
side, and by the close of European trading the franc was at FFr3.419 to the
D-Mark, still more than a centime above its floor against the German
currency in the exchange rate mechanism.
But the French franc's weakness was underlined by the fact that it fell by
nearly a centime on the very same day that the dollar enjoyed one of its
strongest rallies since the autumn currency crisis.
In the past, the dollar's strength has helped to ease ERM tensions. But,
yesterday, buoyed by a very good set of US economic indicators over the
Christmas and New Year period, the dollar peaked at DM1.6413. It closed at
DM1.6365, up nearly two pfennigs on the day. In New York the US currency
gained further ground to end at DM1.6389.
There was a feeling yesterday that the foreign exchange market was still not
operating at full speed. Not all dealers had returned from holiday, and Mr
Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said many
analysts were waiting to see whether the Bundesbank would ease rates at its
council meeting on Thursday. Mr Hannah admitted, however, that the prospect
of this was small.
The quietness of trading was not enough to stop a number of alarm bells
going off in the ERM, however. The first was a sharp rise in French money
market rates, with the overnight rate seen as high as 13 1/2 per cent
yesterday. The Bank of France did not raise its intervention rate, although
a sustained period of high market rates would make this unavoidable.
The Irish punt also came under renewed pressure on the first full day of
trading after the abolition of exchange controls on January 1. The one-week
rate in the Irish punt market rose to 45 per cent as the currency fell to
its ERM floor against the Belgian franc.
Outside the ERM, the Italian lira was a notable loser from D-Mark strength.
falling to L929.6 per D-Mark from a previous L909.5.
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swissbank in London, cautioned against
the belief that a dollar rally might ease ERM tensions and save the French
franc.
First, he believes that the dollar's rally may signify a flight out of
European currencies altogether, as ERM turbulence continues, rather than a
move out of the D-Mark.
He also believes that the Bundesbank will be increasingly concerned by the
prospect of imported inflation if the dollar continues to gain strength
against the German currency. 'Dollar strength could make an easing less
likely,' he said.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Money Markets: French rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN money market dealing yesterday got off to a lively start after the
New Year holiday, with many traders trying to work out the Bundesbank's
intentions for monetary policy, writes James Blitz.
As expected, the return to full trading was accompanied by renewed pressure
on the French franc and the Irish punt inside the European exchange rate
mechanism. Both currencies came under speculative pressure, and there were
sharp rises in their cash rates.
In the early morning, trading across Europe was quite bullish, and some
London-based dealers even wondered whether the March short-dated sterling
contract might break through the 93.50 barrier following the UK prime
minister's weekend comment that sterling would not return to the ERM this
year.
That bullish sentiment was broken later in the morning by the Bundesbank's
announce-ment that it will hold a securities repurchase tender at variable
rates for 15-days and 29-days today.
In recent months, the Bundesbank has restricted itself to issuing two-week
repos to give itself greater flexibility. A strong view in the market was
that the longer duration of today's repo has scotched any hopes that the
Bundesbank would cut rates at this week's council meeting. 'Why invite
offers to tie up funds for nearly a month if they are planning to cut rates
this week?' asked one dealer.
However, one analyst suggested that the 29-day repo could be a convenient
excuse for bringing the Bundesbank's repurchase rate down to the lower
levels in the money market periods. Both two and three-month money were
trading yesterday as low as 8.65 per cent.
The news had a negative effect on the March Euromark contract, pushing it
down 6 basis points from its opening level to a low of 92.18. It later
picked up to close at 92.20.
The March French franc contract was worse hit, because the news helped to
weaken the French franc to FFr3.419 per D-Mark. The contract tumbled 35
basis points to a low of 90.38 before finishing at 90.48.
French cash rates firmed sharply yesterday, with overnight rates seen as
high as 13 1/2 per cent at one stage, and closing at around 12 per cent.
In the sterling market, three-month money ended unchanged at 7 1/16 per
cent.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian wheat crop ravaged
by storms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 40 per cent of Australia's wheat crop may have to be downgraded
because of damage caused by heavy rain and hail storms, the Australian Wheat
Board said yesterday.
Mr John Lawrenson, managing director, said it would be several days before
an accurate picture of the 'disastrous' harvest would emerge. However, the
worst hit farmers are expected to lose up to half their forecast income.
Officials said early estimates suggested that about 6m tonnes of the
forecast crop of 14.4m tonnes had been affected by the weather, mostly in
the week before Christmas.
The bad weather has had little impact on the most valuable wheat grades,
which are mainly produced in the warmer growing areas of Queensland and
northern new South Wales.
Conditions in South Australia, Victoria and southern New South Wales have
had a devastating effect on production of Australian standard white wheat,
which accounts for about 80 per cent of exports.
About half the damaged wheat may have to be downgraded to feed grade wheat,
intended for animal consumption.
Feed grain is expected to sell for about ADollars 120 a tonne gross,
compared with ADollars 180 a tonne for standard white.
The board said it may be difficult to dispose of thedamaged wheat because of
an international glut of feed grain caused by weather damage to European and
Canadian crops and a record US maize harvest.
Officials said there were no plans to destroy surplus grain, but some of the
damaged wheat may be placed in storage until next year in the hope that
prices will rise. Some of the damaged crop will be sold as lower grade
milling wheat, at prices between ADollars 145 and ADollars 165 a tonne.
Prices for the premium grades are expected to be unaffected.
The board said it expected gross returns of ADollars 230 a tonne for prime
hard wheat at 13 per cent protein, and ADollars 192 a tonne for hard wheat
at 12 per cent protein.
Growers had hoped for a big improvement on the 1991-92 crop of 9.6m tonnes,
when drought exacerbated the effects of a financial squeeze caused by high
interest rates.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World bank unblocks Bolivian
mining credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Bank has released the remainder of a Dollars 35m mining credit to
Bolivia.
It had been withheld since 1989 in protest at the slow pave of change within
Comibol, the state mining corporation.
According to World Bank officials, the Bolivian government was informed on
December 17 that its right to make withdrawals from the fund had been
reinstated. As some Dollars 4.3m had been disbursed by October 1992, Dollars
30.8m remains in the fund.
Recent actions within Comibol prompted by the World Bank include the signing
of an agreement with the Pincock consultancy to undertake a structural
review of the corporation. Comibol has also taken steps to reform its board
of directors and acquired a new president in July.
The long-awaited disbursement of the World Bank credit signals what is
widely expected to be the beginning of the end for the state mining
corporation. The credit is specifically targeted at encouraging the
participation of the private sector investment in Comibol's mine holdings
and may eventually lead to the partial, or even full-scale privatisation of
the corporation.
Two obstacles to this course of action remain however in the form of union
opposition and the Bolivian constitution, which currently bars the
privatisation of the corporation.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Gloom
behind the cocktail chatter - Devaluation has masked the problems facing
British farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHRISTMAS cocktail circuit in which the farming industry indulges is a
little different to that in suburbia. Much of it takes place in association
with rural pursuits such as pheasant shoots and fox hunts.
I will not enter the debate about the ethics or the need for such activities
but will suggest that enthusiasm for them among farm folk is as much to do
with the opportunities they provide for getting together and talking shop in
a relaxed atmosphere as for the kill or the chase. In that respect their
function is similar to urban drinks parties.
Chatter over mulled wine, whisky macks and rusty nails during the recent
festive season has been, perhaps surprisingly, moderately bullish.
Last year saw the beginning of a fundamental reform of the system of
European Community agricultural support that will cut commodity prices
substantially over the next three years, as well as the most difficult
autumn for decades. But it also embraced a devaluation of the pound that, in
the short term at least, led to increases in those same commodity prices,
producing windfall returns.
Reform of the EC's common agricultural policy and the introduction of
virtually compulsory set-aside was undoubtedly was the biggest shock in
1992. Reared in the tradition that progress is synonymous with increased
production, most farmers abhor the prospect of leaving 15 per cent of their
land uncropped.
A few say, even now, that they will forgo the compensation that those who
take the statutory proportion of their land out of production are entitled
to, and attempt to survive at the reduced guaranteed prices imposed by the
EC's council of agriculture ministers.
The majority, however, myself included, will bow to the will of the
politicians and leave part of our land to grow weeds. The fact that the
compensation for so doing has been initially set at what are widely
recognised as fair figures and that these too will be raised, in the UK, by
the devaluation of the pound, is clearly significant to our decision.
It is something of a paradox that a reform package advertised as being
intended to bring agriculture closer to real market forces has had the
effect of stimulating every farmer to calculate the mix of cropping and
set-aside most likely to provide the biggest income. In the great majority
of cases this has resulted in a decision to farm for the maximum subsidy
more than most have ever done before.
The political culture shock was followed by another of an extended
meteorological nature. Half way through the grain harvest of 1992 it began
to rain. At first it was welcomed as a break in the near four-year drought
and a boost to depleted water reserves. But it continued until the end of
the year - causing untold damage to soil structure as well as the loss of
thousands of acres of potatoes and sugar beet. The rains also had made it
impossible to plant between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the autumn grain
intended for harvesting next August and led to poor establishment of much
that was planted.
The costs of that wet weather will not be felt until later this year and
perhaps beyond. They will take the form of a severely reduced UK harvest
next summer and massive expenditure on cultivations as farmers attempt to
repair soil structure by draining and sub-soiling.
That is something to contemplate in the future, however. Most of the talk
over Christmas was of the high prices farmers had made on the grain they
gathered from last harvest; of the savings they had made as a result of
lower bank interest rates or overdrafts; and of the reintroduction of
capital allowances in the chancellor's autumn statement, which would help
them re-tool with much needed equipment instead of paying tax on the
unexpected profits.
Much of the relief they felt arose from the fact that they found themselves
at the end of what could have been a horrendous year, in many ways, better
off than they had feared. Their delight, in other words, was somewhat
Micawberish in that they now expected to make a small profit instead of a
small loss. I was left with the impression that many also followed the
Dickens character in their hopes for the future in the perhaps naive belief
that, as with the 1992 devaluation 'something will turn up'.
I hope those who think that way are right. But there is nothing on the
immediate horizon to suggest that prospects have really improved. Moreover,
what can be foreseen indicates that the les welcome effects of sterling's
devaluation story will soon start to bite on farmers - if it has not
already. UK farmers import a great many of their livestock and crop
production requisites from countries that have not devalued their
currencies. These inputs are now having to be paid for in greatly
depreciated pounds.
The British government and the European Commission have, anyway, by
restricting the green currency system used for intra-community trade,
effectively deprived UK farmers of the full benefits that might have been
derived from the sterling devaluation. So the foreign exchange bonus enjoyed
by arable farmers has proved to be very limited.
Levels of compensation for not producing - for setting aside land - are
another issue. It has always been made clear that the scheme was
transitional in nature, aimed mainly at cushioning farmers as they adjusted
to the reality of world market prices. UK farmers also fear that they face
the inevitable antipathy of taxpayers when they become fully aware that
their cash is paying for farmers not to grow food. Public opinion may
decree, the farming commu ity believes, that compensation should be, at the
very least, significantly reduced.
Over the predicament of the UK farmers there hangs the unfinished business
of the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They have
been assured by politicians from Mr John Major, prime minister, downards
that the compromise reached by the EC with the US late last year and any
agreement concluded in the Gatt forum would able to be accommodated within
the measures already taken to reform the CAP.
Few British agriculturists who have done the calculations believe that this
is possible. Some even predict that successful conclusion of the protracted
Gatt negotiations could lead to more than double the present area of British
farm land being set aside, without any guarantee of compensation.
Previous challenges to UK farm profitability have normally been satisfied by
increases in production. Now, since the introductiuon of set-aside, that is
no longer an option. About the only thing that may 'turn up' to save the
situation is a food shortage. With world stocks of some key commodities
still at relatively critical levels that prospect may not be as far fetched
as it might seem.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price plummets to lowest
level since 1986
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD'S PRICE in US dollars slumped to its lowest level for seven years
yesterday, the first trading day of the new year.
Ironically, the fall was sparked partly by Australian and South African gold
producers who could not resist selling forward at the very high prices
quoted in their local currencies - a phenomenon caused by the strength of
the US dollar.
Dealers suggested that there was also some speculative selling from
Switzerland by Middle East syndicates and that South Africa's central bank,
the Reserve Bank, stepped in at one stage to buy gold in an attempt to slow
the price's rate of descent.
Gold was 'fixed' in London yesterday afternoon at Dollars 328.25 a troy
ounce. Traders said that the price dropped to Dollars 327 at one stage and
that, if it stayed below Dollars 328 - a key chart point - for any length of
time, it might fall by another Dollars 5 or Dollars 10 an ounce. The
precious metal closed in London last night at Dollars 329.15, down Dollars
3.90 an ounce from last Thursday's close.
'We are in an area where the professionals don't have many signposts to
guide them,' Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland pointed
out.
'I don't expect we will see a Dollars 20 or Dollars 30 move down, just moves
of Dollars 5 to Dollars 10 and then some temporary recovery - a sawtooth
pattern.'
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of Banque Bruxelles
Lambert, said gold was in a period of seasonally weak demand so the
equilibrium of the market was tilted in favour of downward movements. She
recalled gold touched Dollars 285 an ounce in February 1985 and June 1982
and suggested that some professionals now had that level as a target. 'But
if it holds above Dollars 320 in the next week or so it will stay there.
There is nothing to give it an upward impetus.'
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, said a
number of market participants were looking at Dollars 280 an ounce as 'a
realistic downside target.' The reasoning was that in theory about 35 per
cent of western world gold mine capacity, or 623.4 tonnes, should close down
after a year or two because they would be uneconomic with prices at that
relatively low level.
He added: 'The gold market has now reached a point where prices will only
rise sharply if there is a dramatic change in either the supply or demand
side of the equation. And I strongly doubt that anything very dramatic is
going to happen on the demand side.'

SOUTH AFRICA'S sugar cane growers produced a drought-hit 1992-1993 crop of
1.507m tonnes, the worst since 1984, industry officials said yesterday,
reports Reuter from Johannesburg.
The South African Sugar Association, which markets the country's sugar
output, said the effects of the severe drought last year could affect the
1993-1994 crop.
Cane in the fields suffered from 'green drought phenomenon', said Mr Chris
Fitzgerald, spokesman for the association. 'It looks nice outside but inside
there is no growth,' he explained.
He said the 1992-1993 crop was 'slightly better' than the 1.377m tonnes
produced in the disastrous 1983-1984 season.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber reference price under

THE INTERNATIONAL Natural Rubber Organisation says it will hold a meeting on
January 29 to decide if its buffer stock reference price should be cut.
It sets the trigger level for Inro's buffer stock buying or selling
interventions in the market.
Under Inro rules the reference price must be reviewed every 15 months.
Depressed rubber prices over recent months could mean a cut of 5 per cent or
more in the reference price. Inro has stockpiled more than 160,000 tonnes of
natural rubber over the past three years in an attempt to stabilise prices.
Rubber traders say they are confident of some firming of prices in the
coming months but doubt that a cut in the reference price can be avoided.
Traders say that with the US economy showing signs of recovery, demand from
the tyre manufacturers is likely to pick up this year. China is also
expected to become a leading player in the international rubber market.
The Inro affiliated international natural rubber study group forecasts that
China will replace Japan as the world's second largest natural rubber
consumer this year, with consumption of nearly 700,000 tonnes. The US
remained the largest rubber consumer in 1992, with consumption of 825,000
tonnes.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dominican nickel production
suspended until end of March

FALCONBRIDGE Dominicana, the Dominican Republic's nickel producer, has
suspended its operations until the end of March because of a weak
international market caused by high stocks and low prices.
According to Dominican government officials, the decision by the company, in
which Falconbridge of Canada has a majority stake, followed a fall in nickel
prices from an average of Dollars 3.10 a lb to Dollars 2.50 a lb. These
prices, they said, could not provide the company with a 'beneficial profit'.
World nickel stocks had risen to about 200,000 tonnes, which is about two
and a half month's supply, the officials said, and the company's three month
closure is expected to coincide with a draw down of these inventories and a
hardening of the market with prices recovering.
The Dominican Republic's nickel production between January and September of
last year was 16,974 tonnes, 26.9 per cent less than production in the
corresponding period of 1991. Production in 1991 was 29,000 tonnes, 1.6 per
cent less than 1990. The Caribbean Republic has reserves of 38m tonnes of
ore graded at 1.75 per cent nickel.

Copper, tin and nickel prices began 1993 on a strong note at the London
Metal Exchange. The COPPER market ended at the highest level for three
months in a follow through to last week's move above Dollars 2,300 a tonne.
Yesterday traders noted good Chinese buying and some suggested that today's
LME warehouse stocks figures might show a fall. Sentiment was also buoyed by
news of a 2.1 per cent rise in US construction spending in November, which
continued a recent wave of positive data from the world's major economy. The
three month copper price closed Pounds 39.75 up at Pounds 1,577.75 a tonne.
Copper's bullish mood spilled over into NICKEL up Dollars 214.50 to Dollars
6,237.50 a tonne for three months delivery, and TIN, up Dollars 157.50 to
Dollars 6,002.50 at tonne, although conditions in both markets were
described as thin. At the London Futures and Options Exchange the March
robusta COFFEE futures position surrendered its New Year's Eve rally to
close Dollars 11 down at Dollars 1,012 a tonne after trade selling in New
York had put the market on the defensive.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Old neuroses over the ERM mar restart of
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond prices dipped in early trading yesterday before
bouncing back later in the day as the markets continued to display some of
the neuroses that had infected them at the end of 1992: fears that the
French franc would be forced to devalue, dealing a further blow to the
exchange rate mechanism, and that hefty borrowing in some quarters would
force yields higher.
Longer-dated UK government bonds opened slightly down from their close at
the end of the old year, but promptly slipped as much as half a point in
thin trade. Profit-taking was blamed for the slide, though the low level of
trading suggested no big investment institutions were active in the market.
Shorter-dated paper held steady during the day, leading to a steepening of
the sterling yield curve and reversing the flattening that had taken place
at the end of 1992. Traders warned against seeing the movement as a signal
of further rises in long gilt yields in the short term - though most expect
such a movement later this year, once the scale of the next financial year's
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement becomes clearer and the funding of the
1992/93 deficit begins in earnest.
THE German government bond market shook off the resignation of economics
minister Mr Jurgen Mollemann with barely a flicker. More important in
determing the direction of bund prices will be the public sector wage
negotiations which begin on Friday, said Mr Richard Grey, economist at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
The Bundesbank switched back to a variable rate tender for its latest
repurchase agreement operation, after the series of fixed-rate repos at the
end of last year. Economists warned against reading this as a sign that
German interest rates are set to fall, though, and the repo rate, when it is
announced today, was expected to remain steady at around 8.75 per cent.
Similarly, there are few expectations of any relax-ation when the Bundesbank
council meets on Thursday.
PRESSURE on the French franc built up yesterday as the anticipated new year
attack on the currency began in earnest. At its latest repurchase agreement
auction, the Bank of France drained FFr24.5bn from the markets, indicating
an intention to keep conditions tight, though the key intervention rate
stayed unchanged at 9.1 per cent, with the 5-10 day repo rate at 10 per
cent.
These rates are well below money market rates, though, with 3-month money
yesterday trading at around 12.5 per cent, prompting suggestions that the
Bank of France will not be able to hold official rates low for much longer.
Shorter-dated paper lost ground, with the yield on the 7.5 per cent bonds
due April 1995 rising from 8.01 per cent to 8.06 per cent during the day,
though longer-dated bonds held generally steady.
AIDED by a stronger dollar, US Treasuries posted big gains at the long end
of the maturity spectrum yesterday morning.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/16 at 103
21/32 , yielding 7.316 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 100 9/32 , to yield 4.458 per
cent.
Overseas investors continued to buy Treasuries across the yield curve, lured
primarily by the recent strength of the US currency, which makes dollar
assets more attractive. This buying, combined with short covering by dealers
in New York, pushed prices, especially of longer-dated securities, up
sharply.

FT  05 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Ontario set to lead in
Canadian borrowing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Province of Ontario looks set to be the first major Canadian borrower of
the year, writes Brian Bollen.
It plans this month to launch its third global US dollar bond issue, through
Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers, to complete its borrowing programme for
the financial year ending March 31 and pre-funding part of next year's. The
maturity is likely to be between seven and 10 years, and the amount around
Dollars 2bn, says Salomon Brothers.
The World Bank plans to launch its 30-year US dollar global bond towards the
end of this week. The bank will be looking to raise Dollars 1bn to Dollars
1.5bn over 30 years with an issue which will be non-callable and stripable,
allowing banks to detach the coupons on the bonds and sell them separately.

FT  05 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Nordex share trading system
ceases operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROSS-BORDER share trading system that had sought to pioneer international
screen-based dealing in Europe has ceased to operate, sounding a warning to
other planned ventures which aim to service Europe's equity markets in the
coming months.
Nordex, launched two years ago to trade Scandinavian and, later, Dutch
shares, ceased to operate as a market just before Christmas. It had acted as
an anonymous screen-based dealing service, capturing trade that flowed
between the home markets of the companies whose shares were traded and the
active international share market in London.
At its peak, Nordex only managed to capture around 2 per cent of the
international market in these shares, said Mr Clive Archer, managing
director of Transvik, which owned Nordex. He blamed lower volumes in
Scandinavian stocks and high Scandinavian settlement charges, which he put
at around Pounds 50 a trade.
Nordex also suffered from the extra costs associated with using Citicorp as
a central guarantor to the system. Besides the cost of paying the bank for
providing the guarantee, Citicorp acted as a counterparty to all
transactions, effectively doubling the number of trades that needed to be
settled and doubling settlement costs. Nordex had also antagonised some of
its broker-dealer users when it began to offer the service direct to their
institutional customers, said Mr Archer.
The closure comes after a difficult period for Scandinavian markets
generally, and an attempt by Sweden to recapture turnover in Swedish shares
by dropping its turnover tax. The London Stock Exchange said that, while the
volume of Scandinavian shares traded on its Seaq International market had
not declined, it has lost two Scandinavian market-makers in the past year,
reducing the number to eight.
Nordex's departure comes as other providers are preparing to target the
secondary equity markets in Europe. Among them is Tradepoint, a venture
which plans to use trading technology developed by the Vancouver Stock
Exchange to break into the European market. Mr Peter Bennett, chief
executive, said yesterday that Nordex's failure did not spell problems for
Tradepoint, which would target London-based share trading and had already
sorted out technological and regulatory issues ahead of its launch which
took Nordex two years to resolve.
Tradepoint was officially given a listing in Vancouver at the end of last
year.

<TEXT>
DESPITE the recession and a sluggish stock market, equity issues in Canada
raised more than CDollars 13bn (USDollars 10bn) last year, compared with
CDollars 8.9bn in 1991.
The 1992 total included CDollars 11.8bn in common share issues, including
both primary and secondary financings. The oil and gas sector was most
active, because of increasing exploration and development, and other
resource sectors were also busy.
Privatisation accounted for one large financing, a CDollars 850m issue of
Nova Scotia Power shares.
For the first nine months, new issues totalled CDollars 5.1bn against
CDollars 5.7bn a year earlier, the Investment Dealers Association of Canada
said. Underwriting revenues ran higher for brokers and the large investment
bankers. RBC Dominion Securities led the field in underwriting.

FT  05 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Brisk beginning to year with Finnish
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Finland helped to produce a brisk start to the new year in
the international bond markets by announcing its latest big foreign currency
borrowing, one of two major issues in the D-Mark sector yest-erday.
Finland's new DM2bn seven-year bond issue, lead-managed by Dresdner Bank,
will be priced today at 50 to 55 basis points over German government bonds.
This compares with a spread of 63 basis points on Finland's most recent
D-Mark bond, a DM1bn five-year exercise last October.
Mr Veikko Kantola, Finland's director of finance, says that the lower
indicated spread for a slightly longer maturity reflects an improvement in
Finland's perceived credit worthiness as the recession bottoms out, economic
news becomes more positive and Finland prepares for negotiations to start on
its application to join the EEC.
Bankers say that Finland is benefiting more from a lack of supply of higher
yielding bonds in the seven-year range, and that the indicated pricing looks
on the demanding side.
Coupled with the SFr500m bond issue launched in mid-December, this marks a
solid foundation for Finland's foreign borrowing this year. The indications
now are that the country will be looking to borrow Dollars 7bn to Dollars
8bn externally, as government borrowing climbs to around 40 per cent of GDP,
compared with 20 per cent a year ago.
Finland will concentrate on borrowing in the main European currencies,
supported by borrowings in dollars and yen, some of which could be swapped
to keep their combined share of the country's foreign currency borrowings at
around a quarter of the total.
The other D-Mark issue, Deutsche Bank's DM1bn 10-year issue for itself, was
very well received, thanks to the name, said bankers.
Banks are reporting continuing demand for US dollar collared floating rate
notes, as continental European investors, who are bullish on the dollar,
seek to reduce interest rate exposure. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reported demand
across Europe for its Republic of Austria Dollars 200m 10-year issue with a
five per cent minimum coupon and 8 1/4 per cent maximum. Austria has an
existing issue on the same terms, which is currently trading over par, says
UBS.
Austria's new issue went well and slightly overshadowed the other three
launched yesterday. Credit Local de France's Dollars 150m 10-year issue
through Goldman Sachs International was said to be selling slowly but
surely.
Swedish Export Credit re-opened an issue due in November 2002, with a
further Dollars 50m tranche through Morgan Stanley International, while
Helaba (Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen Girozentrale) is raising Dollars 100m on
a subordinated basis over 10 years through Kidder Peabody.
The coupon will be set at  1/8 per cent below six-month Libor, with a
minimum of 5 per cent and a maximum of 9 1/4 per cent.
The Council of Europe is raising a further Dollars 100m through a re-opening
of an existing fixed-rate issue due in October 1999, to meet professional
demand.

SHAREHOLDERS of Saudi American Bank (Samba), the biggest joint-venture bank
in Saudi Arabia, are to meet today to decide on plans to double the bank's
share capital to SR1.2bn (Dollars 320m), Reuter reports from Manama.
Mr Zakariya al-Kabbaa, general manager, said the extraordinary meeting would
review plans for a one-for-one bonus issue, paying for it by transferring
SR600m from its reserves. At the end of 1991, the bank's statutory and
general reserves stood at SR2.4bn.
Mr Mehli Mistri, managing director, said last month that Citibank, part of
Citicorp of the US which holds 30 per cent of Samba's equity, would maintain
its stake and remain a long-term partner.
A year ago, Citibank sold 10 per cent of the bank's shares to two Saudi
national social welfare agencies for an undisclosed amount.
United Gulf Industries (UGIC), a Bahrain-based conglomearate, is to offer
28m new shares later this week to raise its paid-up capital to BD40m

PAKISTAN'S first Toyota car assembly plant begins trial production in
February and commercial production in May.
The plant is being set up by Indus Motor, a joint venture between Toyota and
Karachi-based Habib Group, at a cost of Rs2bn (Dollars 78.3m) and will have
a capacity to produce 20,000 vehicles annually.
Initially, it will build the 1.3-litre Corolla car - Toyota's best-selling
model in Pakistan - with output set according to demand. Import figures give
an indication of what demand might be: for 1992, the government estimates
about 3,000 cars of all makes with 1.3-litre engines were imported, as well
as 10,000 used cars, of which almost 90 per cent were older Corolla models.
Mr Farhad Zulfikar, Indus Motors' chief executive, said the car's selling
price had not been set, but added: 'It should be much lower than any
imported car in its range.'
Indus Motors has lobbied the government to discourage the import of used
cars and allow tax incentives to Pakistanis living abroad to buy vehicles
produced in the country.
The Toyota plant will be the second Japanese car factory in Pakistan after
that of Suzuki, which assembles the country's most popular 800cc cars and
small pick-up trucks.
Additionally, Honda and Nissan are finalising plans to set up similar
ventures with Pakistani companies and Daewoo of Korea is examining the
feasibility of setting up a plant.
The foreign carmakers hope to take advantage of Pakistan's growing consumer
market and export to Afganistan and the newly-independent central Asian
Islamic countries.

This has been a cosy relationship, secured by cross-shareholdings and a deep
sense of local loyalty - Hyogo companies would naturally turn to Hyogo Bank.
However, once-conservative regional banks developed ambitions far beyond
their local boundaries during the late 1980s bubble. They and their
affiliates were big lenders to Tokyo and Osaka property developers, and
ventured abroad, providing funds to companies ranging from Olympia &amp; York to
the GPA group, the aircraft leasing company, which borrowed from at least 16
Japanese regional banks.
The risks of this rapid expansion, particularly the exposure to the domestic
stock and property markets, are increasingly obvious. Hyogo Bank, whose
deposits fell 16.5 per cent in the first half and whose short-term deposits
have fallen by an estimated 50 per cent over the past year, is now receiving
intensive care from three large banks - Sumitomo Bank, Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan, and Industrial Bank of Japan.
Hyogo, whose 10 largest financial affiliates have outstanding loans
estimated at Y1,600bn (Dollars 13bn), many of them property-related, is also
receiving a little help from the Bank of Japan. Along with the Finance
Ministry, the Bank of Japan is sending managers to oversee the reform of
Hyogo. The central bank has also provided loans at the official discount
rate of 3.25 per cent, allowing the troubled bank to profit from the
difference in market rates.
The share price of Taiheiyo Bank, a Tokyo-based regional institution, rose
Y40 to Y339 yesterday after reports that the central bank was providing
similar assistance. Taiheiyo, which turned to property developers in its
quest for expansion, had previously sought assistance from its leading
shareholders, a group of four commercial banks, Sakura Bank, Fuji Bank,
Tokai Bank, and Sanwa Bank.
It is unclear exactly how many other regional banks are receiving or in need
of assistance, but a Bank of Japan official confirmed that extra loans were
being provided to troubled banks. One sign of the problems is that
provisions or write-offs of non-performing loans by 13 regional banks around
Tokyo rose 3.4 times during the half to the end of September, according to
the district financial bureau.
This ever-increasing burden arises from the ambition of some out-of-town
institutions to compete with the big city banks. This has left the regional
institutions, or their affiliates, with customers these larger institutions
rejected. As a result, regional banks were prominent lenders to bankrupts,
ranging from Nanatomi, a stock and property speculator with debts of Y300bn,
to Ms Nui Onoue, the 'bubble lady' of Osaka, who had investments of Y890bn
at the height of her seance-inspired onslaught on the stock market.
Regional bank officials hope that the new loan and land collateral purchase
agency to be established by the banking industry this month will relieve the
burden. The Regional Banks' Association says the banks will not need public
assistance: 'We don't think there will be a serious crisis among regional
banks. We think the problem can be solved.'
One solution is to encourage mergers. The Finance Ministry recently approved
a merger between two regional banks in the north-east, Ugo Bank and Akita
Akebono Bank, which had reported a 98 per cent fall in pre-tax profit last
year following huge appraisal losses on securities holdings.
The Finance Ministry says there are too many regional banks, 130 in all, 64
first-tier and 66 second-tier, and that a streamlining is necessary. Mr
Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister, had encouraged smaller banks to
look for partners, warning that financial deregulation would put them under
extra competitive pressure.
Meanwhile, regional banks have become a popular theme for financial industry
specialists at foreign securities houses. Analysts are attempting to
spotlight the most vulnerable institutions, while recommending those
institutions which remained conservative during the bubble era and have
better profit prospects than their big city cousins.
The healthier regional banks tend to be based in areas which experienced
strong growth, without reaching the speculative heights of Tokyo or Osaka.
There are concerns that some of these regional cities are only now beginning
to experience the burst of the bubble, but those banks which did not stray
far from the traditional client list generally appear to have strong balance
sheets.
An important test is the level of unrealised gains on the banks' securities
holdings. Mr Paul Heaton, financials specialist at Smith New Court Japan,
estimates that about 11 of the first-tier regional banks will still have
unrealised gains on stocks if the Nikkei average falls to 7,000. However,
seven banks will have these gains wiped out if the market hits 13,000.
The figures are less attractive at the second-tier regional banks, 15 of
which have no unrealised gains if the the index hits 16,000, and nine of
which are showing losses below 18,000. The Nikkei average closed yesterday
at 16,994.08.
In Japan, these unrealised gains are perceived as an important part of the
bad debt strategy, and a bank with a large portfolio of non-performing loans
and severely diminished unrealised gains is seen as particularly vulnerable.
Lending by regional banks to international property developers highlights a
curious characteristic of the Japanese system.
The participation of smaller institutions in international deals often
followed an introduction from a larger bank, which implicitly or explicitly
guarantees that the loan would be repaid. It is unclear how much lending is
covered by informal agreements, but these 'understandings' explain why some
regionals are relaxed about exposure to troubled international companies.

autonomy

<TEXT>
DAEWOO, South Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, plans to promote
management autonomy among its subsidiaries in the first step toward the
group's eventual dissolution, according to Mr Kim Woo-choong, the Daewoo
chairman.
South Korea's big conglomerates, or chaebol, have been criticised for
becoming unwieldly and cumbersome due to their size and range of business
operations.
The government has tried to impose credit restrictions on the chaebol to
force them to streamline activities and improve competitiveness.
Although the chaebol have not reduced operations, they are promoting greater
decentralised management in what is regarded as a preliminary step to the
eventual break-up of these groups over the next few decades.
Mr Kim, who founded Daewoo in 1967, said he would begin to give full
managerial independence to profitable subsidiaries this year, detaching them
from group control.
Mr Kim may have made his decision in response to criticism among some senior
executives that the group had grown too big for the Daewoo chairman to
retain close management control over the conglomerate.
Mr Kim said management independence would not be given to Daewoo's main
shipbuilding and heavy machinery units until they are merged by the end of
1994.
The government agreed in 1989 to provide rescue loans to debt-ridden Daewoo
Shipbuilding, an unlisted subsidiary, on condition it would later merge with
listed Daewoo Heavy Industries to improve the group's financial stability
and rationalise operations.
Officials originally ordered that the merger should be completed by the end
of 1992, but agreed last month to delay it for another two years.

THE US Federal Commun-ications Commission has approved the sale of a
majority holding in Puerto Rico's long-distance telephone company to
Telefonica de Espana, 10 months after the island's government said it had
concluded the deal.
The sale of 80 per cent of Puerto Rico's government-owned Telefonica Larga
Distancia for Dollars 141.6m needed FCC approval because it breached
regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning more than 40 per cent
of any US telephone company. Puerto Rico is a Caribbean possession of the US
and is subject to federal regulations.
The FCC reported that its approval of the sale to the Spanish company was
based on the Puerto Rican administration's failure to obtain reasonable
offers from US companies, and because the privatisation of the carrier
promised a more competitive service. The government is retaining a 20 per
cent stake.

claims

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET securities house Salomon Brothers announced last night that it
had settled employment-related compensation claims with two of the four top
executives who resigned in August 1991 over the Treasury market scandal.
The four executives were forced to step down after it was revealed that they
had failed to inform the authorities immediately of false bids submitted by
the firm's government bond trading desk.
Under the terms of the settlements - which Salomon said had been reached in
light of information about the executives' conduct in the Securities and
Exchange Commission's recent report on the affair - Mr Thomas Strauss, the
firm's former president and chief operating officer, has been allowed to
exercise some of the stock options held by him when he left last August.
Mr Strauss was also allowed to keep the benefits of compensation plans
awarded before his resignation. Shares in his account in Salomon's equity
partnership plan were bought from him at market prices.
Mr John Meriwether, a former vice-chairman, was also allowed to receive
payments from various compensation plans that pre-dated his resignation, and
was awarded Dollars 8m extra compensation for his contribution to the firm's
earnings in 1991.
Additionally, Mr Meriwether surrendered his interest in the equity
partnership plan in exchange for restricted stock and cash, and received
about Dollars 1.7m to cover losses suffered when Salomon refused to allow
him to exercise previously awarded stock options in November 1991, before
all of the facts about the Treasury market scandal had been determined.
Salomon said it had been unable to reach agreement with Mr John Gutfreund,
its former chairman, and Mr Donald Feuerstein, the firm's former chief
counsel, over their employment-related compensation claims.

BLOCKBUSTER, the US video rental chain which owns the Cityvision group in
the UK, yesterday said that Mr Joseph Baczko had resigned as president and
chief operating officer. Mr Baczko will be replaced as president by Mr
Steven Berrard, the company's vice-chairman.
The resignation of Mr Baczko - who had been with the company since January
1991 - was described as part of a reorganisation of Blockbuster that follows
a series of acquisitions.
Separate divisions have been created, including domestic home video,
international home video, domestic music retailing, international music
retailing and new technology ventures.
Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman, said the company's recent acquisition of music
store chains and its new joint-venture in music retailing with Mr Richard
Branson's Virgin group would lead to new opportunities.
He said Blockbuster and Mr Baczko agreed on the president's resignation plan
and added that Blockbuster would become an investor in a new retailing
venture planned by Mr Baczko.
Blockbuster's results for the third quarter of 1992 showed a 50.9 per cent
rise in after-tax earnings, to Dollars 41.3m.
Sales rose 24 per cent to Dollars 283.7m.

reservation sales agents across the US.
According to the company, the job cuts were being made on a straight
seniority basis, and would not affect on-board service or flight staffing
levels. Northwest employs about 46,000 people.
Yesterday's announcement comes less than a month after Northwest was forced
to cancel orders for 74 new aircraft worth Dollars 3.5bn as part of a

FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Double find leads to about-turn
 -The transformation of Freeport McMoRan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREEPORT McMoRan is not one of those companies nursing a hangover after the
excesses of the 1980s. Although the US minerals group spent heavily on
acquisitions in the last decade, since 1989 it has sold assets in order to
raise cash - some Dollars 2bn so far.
There are, however, good reasons for this abrupt about-face. As Mr James R.
Moffett, chairman - known to his colleagues as Jim-Bob - points out,
Freeport has had the good fortune to discover not one but two massive
natural resource deposits.
One discovery gives Freeport, in the same deposit, one of the world's five
largest copper reserves as well as the largest economic gold reserve outside
South Africa - at least 41m troy ounces.
The find will enable Freeport's 74 per cent-owned subsidiary,
Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, to increase production at its mine in a
remote area of Indonesia to 1bn lb of copper and 1m troy ounces of gold a
year, making it the world's second-largest copper producer (accounting for
about 5 per cent of western world output) and owner of one of the world's
biggest gold mines.
'It has been suggested that we would be the equivalent of two major oil
companies in one,' says Mr Moffett, never one to understate his case. 'Not
only will we have a substantial outflow of copper and gold but we can
sustain that from our present reserves for 23 years from 1996.'
The copper-gold discovery was an extension to a deposit which Freeport has
been mining for 20 years. The US group recently signed a 30-year contract
with the Indonesian government giving Freeport exclusive mineral rights over
6.5m acres around its present mining area.
This covers a major mineral 'trend', or zone, which already has yielded
significant ore discoveries.
Mr Moffett suggests: 'This deposit is an omen about what may be in the rest
of the mountainside there (in Indonesia). It's like the first big discovery
in the North Sea or the first big discovery in the Gulf of Mexico.'
It was in the Gulf of Mexico, on the doorstep of Freeport's headquarters in
New Orleans, that Freeport made its other important find - Main Pass, the
first sulphur deposit discovered in 25 years and the largest in North
America. Even at today's depressed prices, sulphur is eight times more
valuable than oil, and Mr Moffett is confident that one day it will be worth
much more.
It took two years to bring Main Pass into production in 1992. As a bonus,
the sulphur is below a layer of oil (albeit a high-sulphur crude, which is
not highly-valued) and Main Pass has become one of the biggest oil producers
in the Gulf of Mexico.
Freeport's jubilation about the success of its exploration efforts was muted
by the realisation that it would cost at least Dollars 1bn to develop the
discoveries to a point where they would generate cash flow and profits.
Mr Moffett points out: 'In a natural resource business you have to be
reactive. We had to change our strategy. We had to sell assets if we wanted
to avoid our debt going over Dollars 3bn. Those discoveries don't do
anything for your cashflow until you've spent the money to get them into
production. So we sold Dollars 2bn worth of assets.'
This was a reversal of the policy the group had followed from 1981, when it
was formed via the merger of Freeport Minerals with McMoRan Oil and Gas.
Until 1988, when it made its two huge discoveries in the space of six
months, Freeport was in a race against time to find acquisitions to provide
it with Dollars 100m of annual cashflow about to disappear at the end of the
1980s, when its two 30-year-old sulphur mines were expected to be depleted.
A five-year acquisition spree doubled Freeport's oil and gas reserves, more
than doubled its agricultural minerals business and added the second-largest
US producer of geothermal energy to its portfolio.
Freeport also spun off parts of some subsidiaries and had them traded
separately on the New York Stock Exchange so the outside world would have a
clearer perception of the true value of previously 'hidden' assets.
Today, Freeport owns only 74 per cent of Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold,
and only 51.3 per cent of Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners, which in turn
owns 58.3 per cent of Main Pass and is the operator.
Mr Moffett explains: 'Our exploration-acquisition strategy in the early
1980s came about because we did not want to bet the company on finding big
reserves. If someone had told me in 1982 that in 1988 we would find Main
Pass and Grassberg (the new Indonesian copper-gold deposit), I would not
have bought those companies. So we bought geothermal and Canadian oil and
gas, both with 30-year cash flows. We couldn't bet that we would beat the
system. We needed cash flow to replace those two sulphur mines which were
going out of business.'
Since the two discoveries, Freeport has sold the geothermal operations, its
Canadian and US oil and gas businesses, its ammonium nitrate interests and
its Nevada gold mining company. 'It was the right thing to do,' Mr Moffett
insists. 'They were all great assets, all long-life assets, but small
potatoes compared with what we had found.'
He stresses that the discoveries should also provide low-cost resources.
For example, Freeport Resource Partners is an integrated producer of
phosphate-based fertilisers, using its sulphur to produce sulphuric acid
which is reacted with the phosphate rock the company mines in Florida to
produce phosphoric acid.
This is further processed into three types of finished fertilisers. Mr
Moffett suggests the company can produce the most important type - Dap, or
diammonium phosphate - more cheaply than any of its main competitors.
Mining in Indonesia is not cheap - Freeport is having to provide for a
remote, mountainside town of 9,000 people - but the Ertzberg-Grasberg
deposit is so rich that both its copper and gold are cheaper than 75 per
cent of output in the rest of the world outside the former Soviet Union.
Nevertheless, in spite of its obvious attractions, investors have tended to
shy away from Freeport because of its debts - the 1991 annual report showed
Dollars 1.9bn. The company's debt rating, in the double-B range, is below
investment grade and Mr Moffett and his board consider the shares
undervalued. So Freeport has avoided straight debt or equity offerings to
raise cash in favour of other instruments, such as convertible debt and bond
issues.
Mr Moffett points out that Freeport's debt - all owed to the public, 'we
don't owe any money to banks' - is down to Dollars 1.2bn and the company has
Dollars 400m cash in the bank. He says Freeport will borrow another Dollars
150m so as to have the cash in hand ready before moving ahead with the
Dollars 550m expansion in Indonesia.

THE US Federal Communications Commission has approved the sale of a majority

The sale of 80 per cent of Puerto Rico's government-owned Telefonica Larga

regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning more than 40 per cent

Announcing the sale 10 months ago, Telefonica de Espana said it would invest
another Dollars 50m in the Puerto Rican venture to upgrade its facilities.
The purchase represents Telefonica de Espana's second venture in Puerto
Rico. The company already owns 40 per cent of Telefonica Hispanoamerica,
which manufactures telephones and other equipment on the island.
Telefonica de Espana, which also has investments in telephone companies in
Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, said it would use its increased presence in
Puerto Rico to develop the island as a hub for its operations in the
Americas.

<TEXT>
DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, will record a 1992 net loss,
following Dollars 5bn of one-time charges the company said it would be
taking to conform to new US accounting standards concerning employee
retirement, healthcare and insurance benefits as well as income taxes.
Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman of Du Pont, yesterday bemoaned the rising cost of
healthcare in employee benefit programmes, noting that Du Pont's plan, which
covers 145,000 employees and their families, cost Dollars 500m in 1992,
twice the level of 1987.
He said that poor economic conditions around the world, and stiff
competition from non-US companies that do not have to pay directly for
employee healthcare, had eliminated the option of passing such costs on to
consumers.
Yesterday, the company said that in addition to the accounting charges it
would record a Dollars 275m fourth-quarter charge related to redundancy
incentives and payments in the petroleum, fibres and imaging systems
divisions.
To comply with the accounting changes Du Pont will restate financial results
for the first three quarters of 1992, which as of last September 30 totalled
Dollars 1.4bn of net profits on sales of Dollars 28.7bn. Some Dollars 4.8bn
of the Dollars 5bn of accounting charges will be recorded for the first
quarter of last year, while a further Dollars 200m will be spread over the
year.
Du Pont's share price rose Dollars 1 yesterday to Dollars 48 1/8.
The Du Pont writedown translates into a Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars
3.70-a-share special non-cash charge for Seagram, the global drinks group,
in the year ending January 31 1993, writes Robert Gibbens.
Seagram, Canada-based but accounting in US dollars, is adopting the same US
accounting standards as Du Pont for fiscal 1993. It holds 25 per cent of Du
Pont.
The non-cash charge will turn Seagram's expected fiscal 1993 profit of
Dollars 1.87 a share into a loss of about Dollars 1.83.

CLUB Mediterranee, the French holiday village group, reported a 4.8 per cent
rise in turnover to FFr8.22bn (Dollars 1.48bn) in the year to last October,
despite the gloom in the travel industry.
The group released its turnover figures yesterday, a month after publishing
a return to profits of FFr160m in the year under review, from a FFr17m loss
in 1991. However, Club Mediterranee's recovery appears far from complete,
given that the group recorded a 4.6 per cent decline in sales to FFr2.33bn
in the final three months to October.

MANULIFE Financial is the first Canadian life insurer to set up a bank under
federal financial services deregulation.
It is fully owned by Manulife, and it starts with nearly CDollars 1bn
(USDollars 786m) assets and 14 branches. But it will not compete directly
with the Big Six Canadian national chartered banks.
Manulife Financial is the holding company for Manufacturers Life Insurance,
Canada's second-largest life insurer. The new Manulife Bank of Canada is
being built on a base of three small trust companies.
At December 31 1991, Manulife Financial's total assets were CDollars 33bn
and 1991 profit was CDollars 209m. The insurance operations are being
aggressively expanded across Canada with new products.
The company said formation of the bank is aimed at delivering a broader
range of products and services to Manulife clients, including personal,
consumer and commercial loans.
'We can use our banking powers to help clients achieve financial security,'
said Mr Thomas Di Giacomo, chairman.
Banks, insurers and trust companies can now enter into each other's business
fields, with few restrictions.

FOREIGN motor companies, notably Renault and Suzuki, plan extensive capital
spending in Spain.
Renault, the French car manufacturer, is to invest Pta60bn (Dollars 526m) in
its Spanish subsidiary Fasa-Renault. Japan's Suzuki plans a Pta27bn
viability plan for Santana Motor, the loss-making four-wheel vehicle
producer it controls in Spain.
The planned investments coincide with a forecast of a 5 per cent drop in
Spanish vehicle sales this year after an estimated rise of 8.3 per cent to
961,000 sold units in 1992.
The forecast comes as all the main car manufacturers, except General Motors,
have introduced short working weeks to reduce stocks.
Anfac, the car manufacturer's association, estimates Spanish car exports
will be hard hit this year after growing by just 0.9 per cent between
January-October 1992.
Exports over the first 10 months of 1991 grew by 20 per cent.
The Fasa-Renault investment, to be spread over six years and incorporate
unspecified subsidies, is understood to involve the development of a new
high-powered diesel engine, likely to be built at its Valladolid plant.

FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Braddock prescribes some
healthcare for his future - The move to fast-growing Medco by the former
Citibank president is intriguing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET was taken by surprise last October when Mr Richard Braddock, the
president of Citicorp, America's largest bank, announced he was resigning.
But many are even more intrigued at the new job the 51-year-old Mr Braddock
has just landed - this time as chief executive of a small, but fast-growing,
healthcare company located in suburban New Jersey.
Conventional wisdom had it - and Mr Braddock admits he was prone to the same
view - that the Citicorp man would go into executive hibernation for several
months until he had found a suitably traditional and high profile corporate
post.
There was even speculation Mr Braddock might be asked to succeed Mr James
Robinson, who will be resigning as chief executive of American Express, the
rather battered financial services and travel group.
Instead of a conventional career move, Mr Braddock - who began his
pre-Citicorp career in consumer marketing at General Foods - will this month
become chief executive of Medco Containment Services, a company with 6,000
employees and Dollars 1.8bn of revenues in its last financial year.
Medco is a darling of the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, although its share
price of about Dollars 38 is no bargain at nearly 40 times prospective 1993
earnings.
But the company is the leading mail service distributor in the US of
prescription drugs to employer and insurance company healthcare benefit
plans. It acts as a middle man, buying from drug manufacturers and offering
discounted prices to beneficiaries of company healthcare plans.
Mr Kenneth Abramowitz, a healthcare analyst at the New York research firm of
Sanford Bernstein, reckons Medco controls about 50 per cent of the Dollars
4bn-a-year US market in mail service prescriptions. He and other analysts
say the market is likely to enjoy annual growth of 25 to 30 per cent during
the 1990s.
'Medco is a very tough competitor and a very innovative company, so I would
expect them to hold the market share,' says Mr Abramowitz.
He is not the only analyst who has been heaping praise on the company. A
recent study by Merrill Lynch noted Medco held the key to success by
combining large pools of healthcare beneficiaries with economies of scale
and then relying on systems and software to get the most cost-effective
medicine to patients.
'We know of no other company presently that possesses all these attributes
for success,' said Merrill Lynch.
Medco at present has more than 1,200 institutional clients, ranging from
dozens of Fortune 500 companies such as General Electric to federal
employees; it is a pool of more than 32m people in the US. The company
earned Dollars 102m of net profits in the year to June 30, and analysts
expect it to make Dollars 130m on 39 per cent higher revenues of Dollars
2.5bn in the year to next June.
The need to reduce healthcare costs has been a big theme of President-elect
Bill Clinton and was also discussed last week by Mr Harold Poling, the Ford
chairman who complained that 'the rapidly rising costs of healthcare are a
concern not only to Ford, but to the entire nation.' Thus corporate
managements, insurers and government agencies all need to manage their
healthcare liabilities.
That is perhaps why Mr Braddock displays such a boyish enthusiasm for Medco,
saying the company has 'an awesome upside potential'. His bullishness is
doubtless helped along by a five-year contract which will pay him Dollars
750,000 a year, plus an attractive stock options package for 1.25m shares of
Medco and half a million more shares in two quoted Medco subsidiaries.
The job offer came to Mr Braddock the day after his Citicorp resignation was
announced. Mr Martin Wygod, who founded Medco eight years ago and serves as
its chairman, telephoned him immediately, having got to know the Citicorp
president as a private banking client of the bank.
Mr Wygod says he was motivated by the success Mr Braddock had in the 1980s
in managing high-growth businesses on the consumer side of Citicorp and by
his consumer marketing background.
'I was always interested in him. It's very hard to find somebody who can
deal with a substantial amount of change, who can turn a short-term
advantage into a long-term strategic advantage,' he says.
Mr Wygod, who is 52, has experience as an entrepreneur. Just before he
founded Medco in 1983 he had sold out Glassrock, another publicly-quoted
healthcare company he had started. The buyer, for a total of Dollars 125m,
was British Oxygen.
For his part, Mr Braddock says he wanted to get out of banking. 'I don't
consider myself a banker,' he explains, noting that his real desire was 'to
manage a rapidly-growing consumer business'.
As the new chief executive, Mr Braddock expects to develop Medco's retail
side, where the company has point-of-sale ties to 57,000 pharmacies across
the US.
Both he and Mr Wygod are also keen to make more acquisitions, such as last
month's takeover of American Biodyne, a California-based manager of cost
containment in mental healthcare with Dollars 130m of annual turnover.
'This company,' says Mr Braddock, 'can define its own upside. What we have
to do is make the right strategic choices and get the right people.'
Mr Braddock cites as possible growth options the widening of product lines
beyond prescriptions and mental healthcare to workmen's compensation, as
well as increasing market share by signing up more employee benefit schemes.
And he notes with relish that Medco has a unique database of patients, many
of whom have a plastic card that could be developed for other products.
While he is excited about his new career, Mr Braddock is distinctly
unsentimental about leaving Citicorp. 'It's history,' he says with a shrug.
He also notes ('to put things in context') that Medco's market
capitalisation of Dollars 5.9bn is not far from that of Citicorp, which is
about Dollars 7.8bn.
Medco's prospects as a go-go company in the 1990s are summed up by Mr
Abramowitz, who believes pharmaceutical cost-containment is still in its
early days. 'Drug costs in America are out of control and very few companies
know how to control them. Medco is one of the very few that can.'

Senior Engineering, the tubing, boilers and ductwork group, said yesterday
it had sold its Senior Davis Derby offshoot, which makes communications
equipment for hazardous environments, to Communication &amp; Control
Engineering.
The deal, for which terms were not disclosed, comes less than two months
after Senior said it would be withdrawing from the mining equipment business
due to the contraction of the UK coal industry.
The purchase trebles the size of CCE, a private company with 45 employees
which specialises in electrical equipment used in environments where fire is
a hazard. The combined company will have annual sales of about Pounds 8m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased interest charges contributed to a 40 per cent contraction in
interim profits at Neepsend, the Sheffield-based tool, metal processing and
DIY products group.
Although trading profits for the six months to September 30 were static at
Pounds 323,000, interest payable of Pounds 221,000 (Pounds 196,000) left the
pre-tax line at Pounds 102,000 (Pounds 172,000). There was an exceptional
credit last time of Pounds 45,000.
Mr Hugh Sykes, chairman, said the recent reductions in interest rates would
help the company in the future.
Turnover improved marginally to Pounds 7.86m (Pounds 7.71m), bolstered by
improved export sales which jumped 62 per cent against the first half of
1991. Home sales, however, dipped 11 per cent.
The interim dividend is halved to 0.25p, payable April 3, from earnings of
0.42p (0.66p) per share.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: NatWest seeks a new life - Resolution to
secure long-term income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW year's resolution of most high street banks is to make more money
than in the past year. Beset by provisions on bad loans, they are seeking
ways to increase steady sources of income.
This is why National Westminster Bank is placing both hope and Pounds 105m
in a new insurance subsidiary.
National Westminster Life Assurance is an expression of optimism for the
future. Mr Lawrence Churchill, its chief executive, believes it can sell
200,000 policies in its first year. NatWest Life starts underwriting this
week, and has a regional sales force of 1,900 already in place.
But the venture is also an admission of past error. The bank did not tie to
a life insurer in 1988 when the Financial Services Act forced it to choose.
It made great play of the fact that its NatWest Insurance Services
subsidiary was an independent intermediary which offered unbiased advice.
Things have changed since then. Although NatWest Insurance Services
contributed profits of Pounds 54m in the first half of last year, the bank
has come to have second thoughts about advising the most profitable segment
of its customer base to take its related business elsewhere.
The growth of 'bancassurance', the sale of insurance through banks, in
Europe is being matched in Britain. Of the 1.2m Lloyds Bank customers with
life and pensions policies, 14 per cent are with its Black Horse Financial
Services subsidiary. Lloyds thinks it can raise that to 35 per cent by 1995.
Life assurance sales fit well with NatWest's attempt to remodel its branch
network, removing much processing work and making more space available as a
customer service and sales area. For branches to become more profitable,
they will have to generate more sales of financial products.
Part of NatWest's strategy, along with that of other high street banks, is
to raise non-interest income which does not carry the risk of loans going
bad. At the half-year, the non-interest income was Pounds 1.38bn, about 43
per cent of the total, and the bank wants to increase this.
The sale of tied life assurance fits well with many of NatWest's intentions.
Potentially at least, it is a good way of making money compared with
lending.
'Life assurance has high quality profits. People tend to die in a
predictable way, so you can price risk,' said Mr Churchill.
The bank has devoted considerable effort to analysing and planning its new
venture. It is the dominant partner, with a 92.5 per cent stake, but has
involved Clerical Medical, the life insurer, to handle the fund management
and provide start-up advice on administration and systems.
NatWest Life will offer 12 standard life products, which it believes will
cover 95 per cent of what its customers want. Most of the selling will be
done by 1,500 financial advisers, who will work from referrals by branch
staff, and independent requests from NatWest customers for advice.
A venture into tied life assurance selling raises several issues for a
clearing bank.
There is the question of exploiting a bank's customer base to sell products.
One reason for the growth of tied sales is that 'warm selling' through
branches is more effective than cold calling. Bank advisers usually sell
about four policies for every one managed by an insurer's sales force.
However, there is great potential for upsetting customers by selling too
aggressively. As Mr Churchill admitted, those going into bank branches may
get 'cheesed off' by a succession of offers. He insisted that the bank's
priority was to develop a trusted relationship rather than exploit it.
The fine dividing line has already been recognised in the banking code of
practice, introduced this year, which prevents bank sales forces from simply
tapping into customer databases to find potential customers. Customers have
to be referred by branch staff.
There is also the question of the selection and training of staff. The
cultural divide between many traditional branch staff and insurance sellers
has already been recognised by NatWest. It has used psychometric tests to
help recruit internally staff who will be happy to talk and sell to
customers.
It has also introduced unusual employment terms.
Unlike most insurance sales forces, NatWest Life's advisers will be paid
largely by salary with a small bonus linked to sales. Mr Churchill said this
would restrain over-enthusiastic selling. But it could also encourage
inertia.
Finally, there is the question of how quickly NatWest Life will start
contributing to profits. Mr Churchill hoped it would contribute a
'significant proportion' of profits in the long term. In terms of the
embedded value of policies, he thought it would be profitable by the end of
the first year.
However, he estimated that it would be three years before it passed on a
dividend to the bank. This means that NatWest cannot hope for it to balance
the weight of lending problems as fast as it might wish.
Mr Churchill said the bank took a long-term view. 'This is not the flavour
of the year. Internally, it is viewed as one of the most visible strategy
moves in 20 years,' he said.
This part of the NatWest's new year's resolution will have to wait until
past the end of 1993 to prove its value.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: CRH pays Fl 108m for Dutch companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRH, the Dublin-based international construction materials group, has begun
the new year as it finished the old - with a further round of acquisitions
in the Netherlands.
The company yesterday announced the cash purchase of Struyk Holding and
Kleiwarenfabriek Wessem for a total of Fl 108m (Pounds 39m).
CRH said the two companies, which had a combined trading profit of Fl 18.7m
on turnover of Fl 137m in the year ended December 31, would provide
additional paving materials and clay brick manufacturing capacity.
Last November, CRH doubled its number of builders' merchants outlets in the
Netherlands by acquiring Braks and Monster, as part of a broader IPounds 22m
(Pounds 23.5m) international expansion also involving acquisitions in the UK
and US.
Mr Brian Hill, group director responsible for Europe, said yesterday 'In the
course of 1992 we have strengthened our strategic position in the
Netherlands by bolt-on additions in three of our core business areas . . .
.The addition of Wessem to our clay brick group consolidates our leadership
of the quality brick sector while the acquisition of Struyk significantly
strengthens CRH's presence in concrete products on the European mainland'.
According to BCP stockbrokers in Dublin, 21 per cent of operating profits in
1991 were derived from operations in the Netherlands.
These profits are forecast to rise to IPounds 20m this year from IPounds 14m
last year.
CRH's latest purchases now give it a broad presence in the Dutch market for
concrete, bricks and clay products and fencing, together with a strong
distribution network of builders' merchants and DIY outlets.

<TEXT>
The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the tablet version of
Zofran, an anti-nausea drug that has become one of Glaxo's best sellers less
than three years after its launch.
Glaxo shares rose 6p to 799p on the news yesterday.
The drug's sales in the year to June 1992 were Pounds 259m, including sales
in the US of the injectable version, approved by the FDA two years ago.
Analysts estimate total of Zofran sales this year to rise to almost Pounds
400m.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wimpey disposes of Liverpool shopping site
for Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGE WIMPEY, the construction group, has conditionally agreed to sell its
shopping development site at Clayton Square, Liverpool, for Pounds 20m.
The group said the sale would lead to a provision of Pounds 11m which would
be taken through the profit and loss account of its annual results for 1992,
due in March.
However, it said the disposal would have a minimal impact on the balance
sheet, as the Clayton Square development had already been written down in
the 1991 accounts, which included a write-down of Pounds 27.6m in the value
of the group's investment properties.
Wimpey repeated its warning, given at the time of its interim results in
September, that a year-end evaluation of its land bank and commercial
activities was 'expected to result in substantial further provisions.'
Analysts now expect these provisions to exceed Pounds 100m, leading to
pre-tax losses of about Pounds 120m, compared with Pounds 16.1m losses last
time. Wimpey's shares closed 1p higher at 115p.
The sale means that Wimpey has raised more than Pounds 300m since it
announced a planned Pounds 400m disposal programme to reduce gearing in
1991.
Year-end debt is put at less than Pounds 180m, which on estimated
shareholders' funds of Pounds 500m gives gearing of about 35 per cent.
Wimpey halved its interim dividend to 2p, and is still expected to halve its
final payment to 3.25p.
In November, Sir Clifford Chetwood, who has just retired and been replaced
as chairman of Wimpey by Sir John Quinton, forecast that the recession in
the construction industry could last until 1995.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Evode omits profit forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVODE, the chemical and plastics group fighting a hostile Pounds 94.3m bid
from Wassall, yesterday omitted a profits forecast with its final defence
document.
Mr Andrew Simon, Evode's chairman, said it was not practical to publish a
profits forecast after only three months of trading since its financial year
ended on October 3.
Evode's document, which contained its balance sheet for 1992, rebutted many
of Wassall's earlier comments, accusing the mini-conglomerate of an
'ill-informed and over-simplified attack' on the company.
Mr Chris Miller, Wassall chairman, said he was 'amazed' that Evode declined
to publish a profits forecast or give details of its current trading
performance.
'The absence of any comment on current trading, let alone a profit or
dividend forecast, will suggest to Evode shareholders that its board lacks
confidence in its ability to deliver satisfactory results in the future.'
Evode recently produced a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 10.2m, for the 53 weeks to October 3. Its shares
yesterday firmed 1p to close at 103p, while Wassall's shares were unchanged
at 217p.
Wassall may raise its 80p-a-share offer today. But Mr Miller warned he was
not willing to overpay. 'We have already raised more than Pounds 50m from
the first half of our rights issue and, if necessary, we will be in a very
good position to look for other acquisitions.'
Evode's document seeks to reassure shareholders that it has only been in
breach of interest covenants relating to the Dollars 43m (Pounds 28m)
unlisted US redeemable shares. Shareholders have waived their rights, from
the breach of covenant, to appoint directors to Evode's board.
The group said it was only close to breaching another covenant because of
the change in accounting rules which forced it to restate reserves.
It said it was confident of gaining the support of the two US preference
shareholders, US West and GE Capital, to change the covenants.
For the first time in two years Mr Simon and his chief executive, Mr David
Winterbottom, enjoyed pay increases. Mr Simon's pay rose to Pounds 127,487
(Pounds 124,019) and Mr Winterbottom's to Pounds 141,114 (Pounds 136,304).

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ECC selling Haul-Waste to South West Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE latest move in its strategy to sell non-core businesses, English
China Clays, the world's largest producer of china clay, is selling
Haul-Waste, its waste disposal operations, to South West Water for a total
Pounds 27.5m.
The initial consideration is Pounds 25m cash, payable on completion,
expected in early February. Mr Peter Elliott, company secretary, said that
the payment of part or all of the balance would be triggered by the further
availability of landfill sites.
ECC announced in August that it intended to sell Haul-Waste, a waste
management company which operates landfill sites and collects and disposes
of dry and liquid wastes in the south-west of England. The August
announcement prompted a 24p rise in ECC's shares to 481p. Yesterday they
slipped 4p to 453p, while SWW's eased 2p to 487p.
The disposal programme will enable the group to concentrate on its core
industrial minerals and construction materials businesses.
Mr Ken Hill, SWW finance director, said that SWW was buying 18 of 20
Haul-Waste's sites, giving nearly 12m cu m of void space, and that there
were another 10 potential sites that ECC was excavating. He said the initial
Pounds 25m was being raised by a private placement.
Northumbrian Water Group has bought the Burnhills Quarry landfill site from
Tilcon. It will use the site for the disposal of hazardous and restricted
wastes.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance cuts bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the composite insurer, yesterday announced cuts in the bonuses
it pays on with-profits life insurance contracts.
Pay-outs on 10-year endowments, which Sun Alliance expects to account for a
large proportion of its business following heavy sales of the product in
1983 and 1984, will drop by 14.94 per cent, compared to this time last year.
Assuming the policy was taken out by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 per
month, a pay-out of Pounds 7,060 on January 1 last year would have dropped
to Pounds 6,005 by the beginning of this month.
Cuts in 25-year pay-outs have been less marked, and on the same assumptions
a Pounds 52,021 pay-out will drop to Pounds 50,048.
The company chose to make cuts in annual or reversionary bonus rates, which
are announced annually and then cannot be taken away from the value of the
contract.
It said this reflected its expectations of lower investment returns and
inflation for the next decade.
Capital bonuses, added only at the end of the contract, remain unchanged but
are reviewed monthly.

Maddox Group has agreed to sell off its two electrical wire and cable
distribution subsidiaries for Dollars 29.6m (Pounds 19.1m).
Cables &amp; Flexibles and Seacoast Electric Company are to be sold via a
US-based management buy-out. The disposals underline its decision to
concentrate on the core computer maintenance business.
Maddox will have the option to convert a loan note which will form part of
the consideration into a 49 per cent equity interest in Lantek Electronics,
the main buy-out vehicle, in three years' time.
C&amp;F made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 277,000 in the five months to September 30
1991 while Seacoast made Dollars 893,000 profits in the nine months to that
date.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: TSW and UK Safety delay talks until March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION South West, the former ITV company, will in March re-open talks
about a reverse takeover with UK Safety Group, the Bristol-based specialist
shoe manufacturer.
TSW, shares in which were suspended at 29p yesterday, and UK Safety decided
that a full set of 1992 accounts would be needed for detailed negotiations
to get under way.
The group, replaced as the ITV broadcaster for the west of England by
Westcountry on January 1, expects to complete its final set of trading
accounts by the end of February.
A reverse takeover of UK Safety to give the shoe manufacturer a Stock
Exchange listing is the most likely future for TSW, although a liquidation
has not been ruled out.
An auction of remaining equipment will be held in April and attempts will be
made to sell the Plymouth headquarters site. Because of the depressed state
of the property market short-term lets are more likely.
TSW's assets include a tiny, but valuable stake in Astra, the
Luxembourg-based satellite system.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Bowater buys rest of MiTek
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER, the packaging, printing and building materials group, has, through
Rexham, its US subsidiary, paid Dollars 55m (Pounds 36m) for the remaining
44 per cent stake in MiTek, the builder's hardware supplier.
Mr Michael Hartnall, finance director, said Bowater always intended to take
over the Missouri-based company after it bought a 49 per cent interest in
1987 and another 7 per cent in 1989. The group decided to exercise its call
option on the remaining equity when it expired in December.
Mr Hartnall said MiTek was the leading North American supplier of metal
connector plates, used in timber construction, and complemented Bowater's
activities in the construction industry.
Operating profit was estimated at Dollars 14.5m on turnover of Dollars 127m
in the year to end-December, and its net assets of Dollars 45m included
Dollars 20m cash. MiTek has not been consolidated in Bowater's results
because it controlled only 49 per cent of the voting rights.
Bowater reported an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 52.5m to Pounds
62.4m in the half-year to June 1992, with market forecasts that at year-end
profits would improve from Pounds 113m to between Pounds 145m and Pounds
155m. A fifth of sales, worth Pounds 1.27bn in 1991, is derived from North
and South American operations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Storehouse, the retail group which includes BhS and Mothercare, added to
recent optimism in the stores sector yesterday when it announced its
Christmas trading had been encouraging.
The group said Christmas sales were in line with expectations, and
consistent with the trend of year-on-year sales increases, averaging about 8
per cent, which Storehouse has shown in the last 15 months. Margins, which
improved by between 1 and 2 percentage points in the first half of the year,
improved at a similar rate in the second half.
'The important thing is we had a pretty good Christmas the previous year, so
to continue to make progress was very pleasing,' the company said. It added
that Christmas offers at BhS on many items including special gifts, food and
lingerie had sold particularly well.
Trading last week, when many stores saw record numbers on the first days of
their January sales, was described as very good, well up on the same week
last year.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Volksbank shares suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the securities of Swiss Volksbank was halted before the opening
in Zurich yesterday at the bank's request in advance of an 'important
announcement' tomorrow.
Swiss stock market analysts said the troubled bank, Switzerland's fifth
largest in terms of assets, was probably negotiating some form of
collaboration with another bank, possibly even a merger or takeover. The
bank itself would only say that the announcement would be positive.
Last October, Volksbank said it would convert its capital structure from
that of a co-operative into a joint stock company. Mr Rolf Beeler, the
chairman, said the move would remove obstacles to co-operative agreements.
The bank's fortunes have plunged in the past few years because of its
excessive dependence on domestic customers, especially small and medium
Swiss companies that have been hard hit by the current recession.
Its net profit peaked in 1989 at SFr136.5m (Pounds 62m) and bank officials
said in November that this year's result would be below last year's SFr68.4m
because of the need for higher provisions against bad loans. Transfers from
hidden reserves would exceed last year's SFr100m.
The 1991 dividend was cut from SFr75 to SFr40. IBCA, the European rating
agency, and Moody's Investors Service have both downgraded its debt in the
past two months.
Volksbank shares peaked in 1987 at SFr2,655, dropping to a recent low of
SFr610. At that level, the market capitalisation of about SFr950m was well
below 1991 year-end book value of SFr2.2bn.
Last week, the shares rose from SFr680 to SFr755 in unusually active trading
which may have led Volksbank to seek an early trading suspension.
Mr Bernard Tschanz, head of investment research at Credit Suisse, said any
of the big three Swiss banks would face heavy rationalisation costs to
eliminate duplication of branches if it took over Volksbank. However, one of
them might become interested in a defensive way if a foreign bank attempted
a takeover.
Swiss national TV news reported last night that Credit Suisse was interested
in Swiss Volksbank, and that there had been board-level contacts between the
two, Reuter reports from Zurich.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Investors see a new star rising slowly in the east: Growth
in the former Soviet bloc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a hesitant start, paved with pitfalls, momentum is building behind the
growth of western investment and business in the 28 independent countries
that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet empire.
Over the year ending September 1992, western investors committed Dollars
28bn (Pounds 18.7bn) to 719 acquisitions, joint ventures and greenfield
projects in the vast area from the Elbe to the Pacific, according to East
Europe Investment Magazine. This tripling of commitments was accompanied by
a new willingness to go beyond the Czech republic, Hungary and Poland - the
main targets of western trade and investment - to encompass energy and
resource-rich countries further east. Kazakhstan, unknown to many in the
west before the Soviet Union disintegrated into 15 independent republics
just over a year ago, attracted investment commitments worth Dollars 9.1bn
last year.
There have been casualties, however. 'At first, it was all a big dream. Then
people started pulling out because transactions happened much more slowly
than they wished,' said Mr Michael Fortier, director in charge of eastern
Europe for Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank. 'Expectations were
simply too high.'
'Lots of companies sent out inexperienced professionals to an area where the
complexity of the task and the responsibilities of advisers were much
greater than usual,' said Mr Guy de Selliers, deputy head of merchant
banking at the European Bank for Development and Reconstruction. 'They soon
found out that payments cannot always be relied on, that fees are low and
mandates too competitive.'
Dealing with governments has also been challenging. Most advisers who sought
a long-term presence in the region started with mandates from governments.
These were funded mainly by the European Community 'Phare' programme, the
British government's Know-How fund or the US Agency for International
Development.
In Poland, where privatisation followed a 'sectoral approach', government
mandates turned out to be a nightmare for advisers charged with selling all
the enterprises in a specific industry as only a few companies in each
sector proved attractive to potential investors.
The Polish government's attempts to boost competition and break up large
industries also misfired by discouraging investors interested in acquiring
large market shares. 'Paradoxically, Poland has suffered from too much
government and too little,' said one investor.
In the Czech and Slovak republics, western advisers criticise the
authorities for focusing on mass privatisation to the detriment of direct
sales to foreign investors. 'The rules of entry for foreign capital were
left unclarified for a long time and the influx of foreign capital has
suffered as a result,' said Mr Daniel Arbess, a partner in White and Case, a
US law firm with offices in all east European capitals.
Disputes over the price of assets have sometimes damped the ardour of
willing buyers in Hungary. 'The Hungarian government has often overvalued
assets,' said Mr Sriram Chari, of Schroders, the UK merchant bank. The
over-valuation of assets also reflects the political sensitivity of
privatisation. Public concern has grown as the best enterprises have been
'cherry-picked' by foreign buyers. 'Getting high prices for companies is a
way for governments to protect themselves against public resentment,' said
Mr Keith Tilson, partner at Price Waterhouse, the UK accounting firm.
Governments are also looking for new ways to draw local investors into the
privatisation programmes. The popularity of distributing privatisation
vouchers to the public was underlined in the Czech republic where the
scheme's main architect, Mr Vaclav Klaus, won the Czech elections last June.
Since then Hungary has also been considering a similar scheme as well as
offering incentives to domestic investors willing to buy shares in local
companies.
For most foreigners, the quick transfer of ownership through privatisation
will be good news. 'It is difficult for governments to execute lots of
privatisation deals involving foreign capital. It is better to leave asset
sales to the privatised companies which are looking after their own
survival,' said Mr Arbess.
Financial advisers say they intend to focus increasingly on individual,
newly-privatised companies. Large enterprises have proved difficult to sell
because of the heavy costs included in restructuring. Mid-sized companies
have been quicker to find foreign partners, as shown by the many unrecorded
deals in eastern Europe falling in the Dollars 30m-Dollars 50m range.
'Establishing local low-cost structures is the key to targeting medium-sized
businesses,' said Mr Charles Harman, executive director at Credit Suisse
First Boston, the merchant bank which employs around 50 people in eastern
Europe.
Some financial advisers disagree. 'There is simply no money in medium-sized
deals,' said Mr Michael Ferriss, managing director at Bankers Trust, the UK
merchant bank which intends to concentrate on financing large infrastructure
projects. Mr Fortier of Salomon added: 'We cannot justify taking someone out
of the international market and making a specialist on two industries in
Poland.'
Direct foreign investors meanwhile welcome the shift away from dealing with
government agencies and procedures. In the Czech republic, where mass
privatisation is most advanced, potential buyers and partners are
negotiating directly with the new shareholders. This is made easier now that
70 per cent of all shares in privatised companies are held in private
investment funds which are acting as closed-end mutual funds for the public.
In three years a wealth of experience has been gained by governments,
advisers, investors and traders alike. The learning curve has been steep,
and the casualties high. But as the deals and the experience accumulate, the
transition to capitalism shows clear signs of acceleration.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Alfred McAlpine buys civil engineering side of AF Budge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALFRED McALPINE yesterday bought the civil engineering businesses of AF
Budge, which went into receivership last month owing its bankers Pounds 20m.
Budge's 26 current road and bridge-building contracts - many of them large
infrastructural projects - will carry on under McAlpine and up to 250
on-site jobs will be saved.
The deal is likely to lift Alfred McAlpine back into the top five of
Britain's civil engineering contractors, alongside Tarmac, Balfour Beatty,
Amec and Birse. Alfred McAlpine was nearly always in the top five in the
first half of the 1980s but had fallen back in the past five years.
Budge will also fill in a hole in Alfred McAlpine's national spread, as it
is based in East Retford, Nottinghamshire, and is usually automatically
asked to bid for public works in the East Midlands and East Anglia, where
Alfred McAlpine has been weak.
Alfred McAlpine, which has headquarters at Hooton, Wirral, will keep the
East Retford offices going. It frequently bids for road-building work with
Amec, based nearby in Sandiway, Cheshire.
The Leeds office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which kept Budge trading with 197 job
losses after being appointed receiver, last night said it was close to
clinching the sale of Budge's building division.
The buyer is likely to be one of Kier, Ballast Needam, Try or Miller, all
identified in undisputed trade press reports, along with Alfred McAlpine, as
bidders for parts of the Budge business.
Mr Ken Lever, finance director of Alfred McAlpine, last night refused to
disclose the price of the Budge contracting business, claiming commercial
confidentiality relating to existing contracts.
However, it has to be less than Pounds 8.2m, which is 5 per cent of Alfred
McAlpine's net assets of Pounds 164m, the level above which disclosure would
have been compulsory under Stock Exchange rules.
The acquisition will raise Alfred McAlpine's payroll to about 4,500, of whom
1,100 are employed in the US. Alfred McAlpine will also assume liability for
about 80 recently completed Budge contracts, making good any defects.
Budge's ongoing contracts include work on the A41 at King's Langley for the
Department of Transport and the Black Country spine road.

FT  05 JAN 93 / New index measures smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new FT-SE SmallCap index, which measures the share-price performance of
450 smaller UK companies, was calculated for the first time yesterday, as
the main UK indices closed at record highs.
The SmallCap index closed at 1377.88, up 14.09 points on the day. The FT-SE
100 index of the largest 100 companies by market capitalisation ended
yesterday at 2861.5, up 15.0, a record closing high but a much smaller rise
in percentage terms.
The FT-SE Mid 250, which contains the next biggest 250 companies, finished
at 2896.4 up 33.5, also a record. In percentage terms, the Mid 250 was the
best performer, with a rise of 1.2 per cent.
The SmallCap index contains all those companies in the FT-Actuaries
All-Share index which are too small to qualify for the FT-SE 100 or the Mid
250. The SmallCap is calculated both with and without investment trusts.
To make the SmallCap more representative, the All-Share was extended
yesterday from 651 to 800 companies, with market capitalisations as low as
Pounds 20m at the cut-off date in 1992. The All-Share also ended the day at
a record close: 1373.20, up 0.7 per cent.
The SmallCap index is published on the back page of the second section of
the FT each day, starting today.
The table on that page now includes the gross dividend yield and
price/earnings ratio for the FT-SE 100, the Mid 250, the SmallCap and the
FT-A All-Share.
These two measures show the relative value placed by investors on the
companies making up each index.
The FT-SE 100 yesterday had a dividend yield of 4.25 per cent and a p/e of
19.3; the FT-SE Mid 250 yielded 4.38 per cent with a p/e of 19.2; and the
SmallCap (excluding investment trusts) yielded 4.92 per cent with a p/e of
21.4.
The most widely used benchmark for calculating these measures for the whole
market is the 500 share index, the FT-Actuaries All-Share index excluding
investment trusts and financial companies. The expansion of the All-Share
means that this group now consists of more than 500 companies. For the time
being, however, the name has been retained in inverted commas as the '500'
share index. The '500' had a yield of 4.25 yesterday, with a p/e of 17.8.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Italy blocks cars from Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY is blocking further imports of cars from Japan, trade minister Mr
Claudio Vitalone, said yesterday. It wants the European Commission and Japan
to agree on the overall number of vehicles which it can export to the EC
this year.
France was last night understood to be planning to follow the Italian move.
It comes after inconclusive talks between the Commission and Japan's
Ministry of Trade and Industry in Tokyo in December.
Such blocks - described by Mr Vitalone as a 'temporary measure' - are
expected to have little, if any, overall impact on Japanese import sales
levels. However, this depends on an agreement being reached quickly when the
Commission-Miti negotiations reopen later this month.
The blocks should not apply to vehicles produced within the Community by
Japanese 'transplants', car plants run by companies such as Nissan which
manufacture within the EC. Any such blocks would breach an EC-Japan
'understanding' and provoke a furious government response from the UK where
most 'transplant' production is situated.
However, the unilateral action by two member states four days after the EC
single market took effect underlines widespread concern about the vagueness
of the levels of Japanese car sales within the region.
It provides for twice-yearly 'monitoring' of the EC market and agreement on
an appropriately 'prudent' level of sales for Japanese-built cars. But it is
so vaguely worded that some fear running disputes may mark the transitional
period until the EC becomes a completely open market for Japanese cars by
the end of 1999.
Until January 1, when nationally imposed quotas became illegal, Italy and
France had the most restrictive regimes on direct imports of Japanese-made
cars.
Under Article 115 of the EC treaty, individual member states can ask the
Commission to allow them to keep or reimpose controls to prevent 'economic
difficulties'. Commission officials said yesterday they had yet to receive
any formal such requests from Italy or France.
The talks in Tokyo in December ended when the Commission and Miti failed to
agree on the likely level of total EC car demand this year.
In Tokyo last night, the Miti expressed 'surprise and concern' and said it
was seeking formal confirmation from Italy and France that the blocks were
being imposed. 'If they are, it would appear to be a breach of the agreement
we have,' a spokesman said.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Trinity Insurance accused of 'imprudent' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME former directors of Trinity Insurance face possible legal action
following the collapse of the company last year with net liabilities now
estimated at Pounds 55m.
In the accounts for the year to December 31 1991 Mr John Winter, who was
appointed chief executive of the privately owned general insurance company
in January last year, said a series of 'inappropriate' or 'imprudent'
investment transactions contributed to losses of Pounds 80.1m in 1991.
The accounts show investment losses of Pounds 13.7m in 1991, including
several million pounds written off against loans to Panfida, an Australian
retailing group now in liquidation, in which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation had a 29.9 per cent stake.
The accounts come in a document, prepared by Price Waterhouse, provisional
liquidators, which advises Trinity's 15,000 policyholders and creditors to
approve a scheme of arrangements under the 1985 Companies Act which could
lead to a pay-out of between 60 and 70 per cent. The scheme would allow the
directors to remain in charge of the company during its winding down under
the supervision of an insolvency practitioner, and avoid the need for
liquidation procedures, which could delay any pay-outs for many years.
Ernst &amp; Young, which became auditors after the new directors asked Pannell
Kerr Forster to re-ign last July, said in their report to the accounts that
income and expenditure may have been incorrectly allocated between 1990 and
1991, and assets and liabilities misclassified in 1990. It said the
directors had told it they believed the 1990 accounts may have been
materially misstated and that a number of transactions with people linked to
former directors were not disclosed, as the law requires.
Trinity's 1991 accounts show exceptional losses of Pounds 26.4m, including
provisions of Pounds 5.1m against a guarantee on a loan from Barclays Bank
to GFA Holdings, Trinity's parent company.
Mr Grant Fowler, a former Australian rules football star, married to a niece
of Mr Murdoch, took over Trinity in 1988 but left last January at the
request of the non-executive directors.
Trinity had traditionally underwritten direct business, but increased its
exposure to higher-risk London market and reinsurance business from 1990.
Underwriting expenses soared to Pounds 17m in 1991, exceeding 50 per cent of
the company's net premium income. In spite of underwriting losses of Pounds
39m that year, Mr Fowler's salary increased by more than 50 per cent to
Pounds 557,000. Benefits in kind to directors more than doubled to Pounds
949,065.
There were also provisions of Pounds 1.4m to meet tax charges against five
houses worth about Pounds 3m bought by the company on behalf of three
directors.
Ernst &amp; Young submitted a report to the Department of Trade and Industry
last year on the regulatory implications of transactions since early 1990
totalling Pounds 20m involving Trinity and Bryanston, another general
insurer also in liquidation and also owned by GFA Holdings. No action has
been taken to date.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Bosnia peace talks break off: Conference to resume after
factions have considered proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEACE TALKS between the three warring factions in Bosnia broke up in
disagreement in Geneva last night, but will resume next Sunday after the
participants have consulted political and military colleagues on
constitutional and ceasefire proposals tabled by international mediators.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the co-chairmen of what have been described as
'the last chance' negotiations, said they would travel to Yugoslavia in the
next few days to pursue their quest for a peace settlement of the
nine-month-old conflict which has cost tens of thousands of lives. Mr Vance
said he would be seeing Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, in
Belgrade.
The first face-to-face talks between the Bosnian Moslem, Serb and Croatian
leaders since the start of the conflict began last Saturday in a
surprisingly positive atmosphere. But they adjourned last night without any
sign that deep differences between Bosnian Moslems and Serbs could be
resolved quickly.
After announcing that the co-chairmen had submitted two linked
constitutional and cessation of hostilities draft agreements to the
participants for signature, Mr Vance conceded that 'much remains to be
done'.
'We had hoped that all three would sign the documents we had prepared, but
the feeling among some of the participants was that they should go home and
consult', Mr Vance said. In the event, only one of the three
representatives, Mr Mate Boban, leader of the Bosnian Croat community,
signed both documents.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Moslem-led Bosnian government, said
that while he approved proposals to create a sovereign, independent and
decentralised Bosnia-Hercegovina, he could not accept the map of the 10
provinces into which the country would be divided under the Vance-Owen plan.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, said he needed time to
consult with colleagues at home.
In practice, the territorial disagreements are less extensive than at first
appeared. Bosnian Serbs and Croats have already indicated they could agree
to an adjustment of disputed boundaries of some of the three provinces that
have been allocated to each ethnic group.
Apart from territorial questions, the main disagreements between the Bosnian
Moslems and Serbs is over the constitutional status of the future Serbian
provinces of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The co-chairmen's proposals make clear that only the new state of
Bosnia-Hercegovina will have international legal status.
But Mr Karadzic is demanding the creation of an independent state within
Bosnia-Hercegovina, a solution incompatible with the Vance-Owen plan.
Royal Marines, due in Norway this month for an annual exercise, are being
placed on standby for Bosnia in a move described by UK defence officials as
'prudent contingency planning'.

FT  05 JAN 93 / P&amp;O shuts Dover to Boulogne ferry route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O European Ferries closed its Dover-Boulogne cross-Channel route
yesterday, in order to strengthen its presence on the shorter Dover-Calais
crossing.
The last sailing on the route, which carried 1m passengers last year, was
yesterday morning.
The company said there would be no job losses among the permanent crews of
the two ships or onshore staff at Dover, who will be redeployed on the
Dover-Calais crossing. The 44 Boulogne shore staff were offered transfers to
Calais, but 39 opted for redundancy.
The long-awaited closure is the latest stage in the concentration of ferry
services on the Dover-Calais crossing as they prepare for the challenge of
the Channel Tunnel, due to open later this year. The two main ferry
operators plan to offer more frequent services on the shortest and busiest
cross-Channel route to compete with the train shuttles running through the
tunnel.
Stena Sealink Line closed its Folkestone-Boulogne ferry service at the end
of 1991. In partnership with the French ferry company SNAT, Stena Sealink
Line last year carried 5.25m passengers on the Dover-Calais crossing.
P&amp;O, which last year carried 7.4m passengers on the Dover-Calais route, is
adding a fifth 'superferry' to its fleet in April. It plans to offer
sailings every 45 minutes in peak periods, with a new loading system to cut
check-in times.
The superferries carry more than 600 cars, three times the capacity of the
ferries on the Boulogne service, the Pride of Hythe and Pride of Canterbury.
The two boats will be sold.
The closure of the route is a further blow to the port of Boulogne, which
cannot accommodate the largest modern ferries.
The SeaCat catamaran service operated by Hoverspeed out of Folkestone is now
the only passenger service into Boulogne. Aimed at the day trip market, it
can carry only 80 cars on each of its six daily return crossings.
However, the direct rail transfer facilities at Folkestone and Boulogne
means the route is used as a link for rail services between London and
Paris, including the privately operated Orient Express.
Boulogne's Chamber of Commerce was instrumental in re-establishing a freight
service between Folkestone and Boulogne in the summer. P&amp;O is to ask the
Chamber to provide financial help for a coach service the company plans for
taking foot passengers between the Calais ferry terminal and Boulogne.

FT  05 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Wassall/Evode
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Evode's final defence document contains much spirited rhetoric. Still,
Wassall's generosity - or lack of it - will be the main determinant of
whether its bid for the adhesives group comes unstuck. Evode has shown it is
on the mend and should benefit from its high gearing in any upswing -
although the absence of a current trading statement is curious. But Wassall
has exposed Evode's rickety financial structure enough to worry shareholders
about its continued independence.
The conglomerate clearly does not want to overpay - for the sake of
long-term reputation as much as immediate profitability. The market, though,
is hinting it will have to lift its 80p offer by a quarter to succeed.
Wassall's reluctance to pay up may make things tight. Judging such calls
correctly is what distinguishes the good conglomerate from the bad.

FT  05 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Redland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Redland had a busy end to 1992, judging by yesterday's string of disposals
and acquisitions. The net effect on earnings will be small, probably to
raise them only by around 1p per share which will not do much for dividend
cover. But the market understandably took heart from the signal that Redland
appears able to raise reasonable prices for those parts of the Steetley
acquisition which it either does not want or has had to divest for
competition policy reasons. Given the weak French economy, the Coverland
purchase may look oddly timed. This is a strategic opportunity, though, and
in the short run there should be margin benefits from rationalisation.
Recovery in the US and Australia and lower capital spending should make
Redland cash neutral in 1993. Together with reduced gearing from further
disposals, that should lift uncertainty over the 1993 dividend, making the
yield of just under 8 per cent attractive. This still assumes that German
housing remains unaffected by recession. Doubts on that score may remain
until well into the second half, limiting the follow-through to yesterday's
4 per cent advance.

FT  05 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK water companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paying Pounds 27.5m for holes in the ground may sound extravagant, but then
valuing waste disposal companies has always been a tricky business. Besides,
there is a little more than this to South West Water's purchase of
Haul-Waste, and the deal fits its strategy of concentrating on buying
related businesses in its own region. Nonetheless, this is another worrying
example of water companies using special pleading to justify high-priced
acquisitions.
At best this may be an expensive way for shareholders to employ some of
their excess capital currently tied up in the water companies. Fear of the
regulator constrains dividend growth, while management ambition and stock
market pressure to outperform encourage the companies to spend. Successful
diversification on a large scale could theoretically lift a water company
from a yield to an earnings valuation, substantially boosting the share
price, while the solid regulated core business means that the dividend can
barely be under threat.
Yet the history of diversification by acquisition is not auspicious. The
right strategy for companies seeking to outperform the sector may be to sit
on their hands. Finding a clever way to repay shareholders before the
regulators claw the money back might be even better. This is even more true
for the cash-generating regional electricity companies, which face the same
problem in spades.

Perhaps Mr Jurgen Mollemann should be awarded the legiond'honneur for
resigning as Germany's economics minister. His departure certainly helped
weaken the D-Mark yesterday. That in turn made for a less determined new
year offensive against the French franc than many had expected. Holding the
line over the next few weeks may not be easy, however, especially since
France appears to have dipped into its foreign exchange reserves in the
second half of December.
True, that matters less if the Bundesbank is prepared to finance further
intervention. Much depends on German commitment and skill in managing the
markets. The Bundesbank will be teasing dealers today with its first money
market repurchase agreements of 1993. By moving out along the yield curve -
this package will include some one-month repurchases - it has created an
opportunity for a cut in the headline repurchase rate. That might buy time,
but it could as easily blow up in the Bundesbank's face by creating false
expectations of lower money market rates. Pressure on the franc will not go
away until the Bundesbank signals unequivocally that a substantial monetary
easing is in prospect.

FT  05 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Wimpey's home truths
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market is clearly expecting that the green shoots of recovery will
soon blossom into flowers but some chilling corporate news this spring may
yet deliver a nasty frost. Wimpey's promise yesterday that it will announce
further substantial write-downs on its residential land and commercial
property this March, for example, is only likely to damp recent hopes on the
housing front.
Although Wimpey has been among the most perennially pessimistic of
construction companies, its continuing revaluations suggest the spiral of
asset values may still not have reached its floor. Two months ago, Wimpey's
then chairman was forecasting further falls in construction output with
recovery delayed until 1995.
Wimpey itself certainly looks tired from the waiting. Provisions this year
may amount to Pounds 100m, whittling away shareholders' funds to less than
Pounds 500m. Borrowings of about Pounds 180m remain uncomfortably high. With
cash continuing to drain out of the business, it still has some way to go
before sorting itself out. Unfortunately, it is rapidly running out of
things to sell.
Even if a housing recovery does arrive, shareholders may continue to doubt
the prospects for volume house builders. The wreckage of recession will take
time for such housebuilders to clear. And, shorn of the restraints of an
exchange rate discipline, the government is likely to be unusually careful
in preventing another inflationary house price boom.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Leading Article: University challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID THE furore over school league tables and opting out, the biggest change
in UK education policy since the 1988 Education Reform Act has gone almost
unremarked. It is the decision, buried in last November's Autumn Statement,
to limit the growth in university student numbers to 13 per cent over the
next three years.
Though sudden, the move is far from arbitrary. In the 'new' universities
(former polytechnics), enrolments for full-time courses have been rising at
an annual rate of around 20 per cent for the past four years. Across the
sector, student numbers are already significantly above those projected in
last year's higher education white paper. Changes in funding methodologies
will cause anguish, but vice-chancellors should welcome the respite to
consolidate.
However, capping student numbers can only be a short-term policy. Before
long, pressure to expand further will be intense. Indeed, the decision to
concentrate extra state funding for the next few years on further education
for 16-19-year-olds will only increase the crush at the university gate. By
the end of the decade, as many as one in two school leavers may be qualified
to go on to university.
The question is not whether, but how, the next wave of growth is to be
accommodated. The answer will determine the shape of Britain's university
system into the next century. It is essential, therefore, that the
government use the current respite to launch a public debate on the options
in terms of funding, quality and structure.
Social equity
If supply is to keep pace with demand, and quality maintained, the higher
education bill could easily double in the next decade. With competing
demands for resources, not least from schools, it would be unwise to assume
that the taxpayer will meet the bill unaided. But the only other plausible
source of funds for tuition is students and parents themselves. As a simple
matter of social equity, there is a strong case for a means-tested student
contribution to fees, either in the form of loans or a graduate tax; it
could prove irresistible when expansion resumes.
Much depends upon the answer to two subsidiary questions. What quality
should students have a right to expect? And what aspects of higher education
should the state have an interest in funding?
At present, most students take for granted the right to study away from
home, adding greatly to the cost of their education. They also expect small
classes - but get anything from one-to-one tutorials at Oxbridge to jammed
lecture theatres at some former polytechnics. A national assessment of
teaching quality ought to be the first task of the new Higher Education
Funding Council. At the very least, state fees to institutions should be
geared to quality.
Priority subjects
The state has a strong interest in promoting the study of subjects, notably
science and engineering, likely to be of direct benefit to the economy. It
has almost none in giving teenagers a first chance to live away from home.
State funding should be directed accordingly. The process has already
started with differential fees for different subjects. The differential
needs to be increased, and combined with substantial bursaries for students
in national priority subjects. Financial support for students to study away
from home ought perhaps to be regulated on the same basis.
The relationship between research and teaching needs to feature prominently
in the debate. The platitude that 'good teaching and research go
hand-in-hand' is true enough. But with the expansion in postgraduate
studies, it is important that researchers concentrate their teaching efforts
on graduate students. Alas, Britain's ancient universities, which have many
of the best researchers, still give pride of place to undergraduates and
often treat graduate students as second-class citizens. In a national
context, that attitude makes no sense. There is a case for elite colleges
for the brightest undergraduates, but none for the country's leading
universities making the provision of them their main activity. The
government should say so, and prepare to adjust funding incentives
accordingly.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Personal View: Look to consultants for NHS efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER DRAPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As if to be sure of starting the new year with a new crisis, the government
is planning to lose no time in cutting London hospitals. Though the official
Tomlinson report that recommends closing 2,500 acute beds in central London
looks increasingly tattered as 'consultation' proceeds, health ministers say
the government will not waver.
The official line is that central London is overprovided with acute
hospitals, but general practitioner and community services need
strengthening. The latter is beyond dispute. However, in a wider appraisal
of London's health services, a King's Fund report concluded that inner
London was not over-bedded.
Tomlinson's approach to the problem of assessing future needs for health
services in central London was casual - 'we have looked briefly at various
indicators'. The report is full of contradictions; for example, it says that
on average 'Londoners are no less healthy than people elsewhere', yet on the
next page mentions death rates 21 per cent above average for people aged
15-64.
Similarly, Tomlinson refers to 'large numbers of homeless people' and quotes
a 'conservative estimate' of 60,000 people in London sleeping rough or in
temporary accommodation. But what, if anything, is allowed for extra
hospital needs for homeless people is (typically) not stated. The
implication is that it is nothing.
Though Tomlinson found that waiting times for treatment in inner London are
generally longer than average, he treated the problem as unimportant because
they had recently improved somewhat. Nonetheless, at June 1992, and even on
government figures, one in seven patients of inner London teaching hospitals
had waited more than a year for elective treatment, after the wait for
original consultations.
Then Tomlinson's assessment of acute hospital beds was that inner London
beds were not used efficiently. For instance, he says London teaching
hospitals in 1990-91 treated 1,000 'episodes of care' in 20.3 beds on
average whereas teaching districts outside London used 18.8 beds. Tomlinson
assumes that because such 'patient throughput' has been speeding up in the
UK and because some patients are being sent to outer hospitals, inner London
needs about 2,500 fewer beds. He doesn't tells us - because he doesn't know
 -how much London slowness is due to inefficiency and how much to other
factors such as in-patients not having a suitable place for discharge.
Perhaps the most critical feature Tomlinson overlooked was the mushrooming
of commercial medicine since the Thatcher government in effect deregulated
NHS consultants' contracts in 1980. A recent King's Fund report estimates
that 'full-time' and part-time NHS consultants in greater London as a group
now earn more from private fees than from the NHS. However, research has
shown the critical importance of consultants in determining hospital
efficiency. Are they available? Are they diligent in supervising their
junior staff?
What should be done?
First, the one sensible proposal in Tomlinson should be implemented at once
 -the strengthening of GP and community services.
Second, now that commercial medicine in London has grown from a marginal to
a major commitment for many consultants, they should be asked to choose
which demanding job they want to do, NHS or commercial medicine. Since
waiting lists are the main reason people use commercial medicine, it is
bizarre to put the senior NHS medical staff into a conflict of interest
worth another Pounds 50,000 a year on average.
Third, the auditor and comptroller general should make his presence felt.
Consultants who look in briefly at their NHS hospitals and then spend the
day in commercial medicine are giving their staff too much exciting
experience and defrauding the NHS.
When contracts have been tightened, when waiting lists have been cut and
when community care has been rejuvenated, it will be time to implement other
long-term plans for Londoners' health. Plan, that is, from a competent,
on-going health planning group for the capital that should be set up now.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Yeltsin's year of living dangerously: After an arduous 1992,
Russia faces further pain this year if reforms are to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boris Yeltsin and George Bush sat bathed in the television lights in the
Kremlin's St Vladimir's Hall. They had signed the Start 2 treaty cutting
more nuclear missiles than anyone had done before. They assured each other
of their place in history, of their triumph in making the world safer for
their children. Mr Bush went off to the airport to complete the last days of
what he calls his 'watch'. Mr Yeltsin now squares up to a year which
promises to be as hard as any he has had to face.
Even his successes, like Start 2, bring trouble: he now has to steer it
through a nationalist-minded parliament, where many of the deputies see it
as a sell-out to an American empire they still regard as evil. His 'friend
George', as he called him, expressed faith that Russia's would be 'a future
forever free': for Mr Yeltsin, the achievement of that goal will be through
the hardest of pounding.
It will be most severe in the economy. He has not wavered in his support for
the free-market radicalism which Mr Yegor Gaidar, prime minister for much of
last year, attempted to practise. He grumbled. In October, he made a speech
in parliament so lukewarm in its endorsement of the government that its best
line was 'any other would have been worse'. But he never seemed seriously to
consider any alternative.
He is aware, however, of the risks of continuing a policy so destructive to
the living standards of his people: end-of-year figures show wages have
risen 12-fold over the past year in nominal terms, but there has been a
20-fold rise in the consumer price index. With the exception of gas,
production has plunged in every sector including oil, which last year
amounted to a little more than 80 per cent of 1991's output. In his keynote
speech to the December Congress of People's Deputies, Yeltsin sought to
assure people that the state would not desert them; that he knew Russians
thought it should 'accomplish more for its citizens than is customary in
other countries', especially in industrial restructuring and social
protection.
But how, is the largest question of this year. How, without again churning
out credits (curbed in the last quarter of 1992) which threaten
hyperinflation? How, without closing many of the no-hoper Russian plants?
How, without forcing unemployment way up from its (alarming to Russians) 1.5
per cent present level? The president and his government began last year
with some prestige and could have carried through painful changes: there was
some pain, but worse must follow if reform is to be pursued. Now it will
come, if it does come, with a weaker productive base and a stronger
opposition.
Like Bush, Yeltsin wrung what solace he could from foreign triumphs: but
they were a different kind of triumph. He capitalised, like Mr Mikhail
Gorbachev before him, on the shrinking of Russia's power: almost everyone
loves a weak Russia, which allows arms cuts, peace dividends and need no
longer be feared in tracts of the world where it had dominated. Only the
Soviet clients, notably Cuba, Vietnam and the radical Arab states, regret
the passing of Soviet power - and they wreak what revenge they can on the
defecting 'elder brother' by refusing to pay their debts.
The president's foreign trips have been feted occasions for signing trade
and friendship treaties, for rhetorical set pieces (such as his
well-regarded address to the UK parliament in November) and for western
pledges of support. Only Japan has not been wooed: so icy has it remained,
indeed, that Mr Yeltsin cancelled a state visit at the last moment rather
than be snubbed over Russia's continuing possession of the four Kurile
Islands, which Japan insists on getting back before its economic might is
turned to Russia's aid.
But he has had to conduct two foreign policies: one for the world; one for
the 'near abroad', or the 14 former Soviet states that are now Russia's
neighbours. This has been a much larger test of his skill, one he has so far
passed
He himself took the heat out of many of these hotspots. He frolicked on the
beach at Dagomys with President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine - standing back
from confrontation over the Crimean region and the Black Sea fleet. He has
been able to persuade the Estonians and (to a lesser extent) Latvians to be
more liberal in granting rights to the Russians who have become de facto
citizens of their republics. He personally negotiated peace with the
Moldovan government after war threatened to erupt between Russian speakers
in that republic's Trans Dnestr area and the ethnic Moldovans. He has not
bowed to the temptation to rattle his sabre at the little states, where the
25m Russians-out-of-Russia feel under threat; and he has not stinted in his
support for Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the liberal and unpopular foreign minister.
Keeping the peace in the former Soviet Union has been hard to do and will
become harder. Many former supporters - like Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, chairman of
parliament's constitutional committee, and Mr Yevgenny Ambartsumov, chairman
of the international affairs committee - have become hard-edged
nationalists, demanding more protection for the 'foreign' Russians and
support for the Slav brothers in Serbia. The Yeltsin-Kozyrev line cannot
withstand many more wars on the borders - wars which, like those in the
Caucasus, have now slopped over inside Russia itself.
These will get worse - in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, where
the shattered economies are on a war footing: perhaps in other states
nervously 'at peace'. The root cause of the tensions with Ukraine were
smoothed, not solved: the Crimea and the Black Sea fleet remain flashpoints,
as does the Trans Dnestr and, conceivably, the many Russian areas of the
Baltic states.
Mr Yeltsin's best hand has been the political one. He finessed two
Congresses in April and December, in both cases appearing to go down before
an assault of hardliners only to snap upright again like a skittle on a
spring. Most important, he sustained his reformist cabinet through the year,
its very existence proclaiming that Russia was changing. He did this in
spite of its unpopularity in the country and the detestation felt for it by
most deputies.
Though Mr Gaidar was sacrificed in the end, his reform strategy and his team
have survived so far. The former premier himself, as Mr Yeltsin made clear
in his new-year message, remains on the shelf waiting to be plucked down
again for a future 'high post' (a comment that cannot have made Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, Mr Gaidar's successor, sleep more securely).
The byzantine politics which produces these switchbacks, where no outcome
seems consonant with preceding events, is explicable only if one realises
that the power of the Russian state still seems to hold. Whoever heads it -
tsar, general-secretary or president - has been able to call on vast powers
and equally vast submission: enough of both remain for Mr Yeltsin to be able
to dictate the forms of government, if not always the substance.
This year may be the limit for the efficacy of such power games within a
nominally democratic framework. If the rudiments of a pluralistic order are
not set down, there will be no alternative for Mr Yeltsin but to turn to a
more authoritarian rule. That he still means to try the democratic way seems
evident in his naming of April 11 as the day when the people of Russia will
be asked to vote on a constitution, in which the powers of presidency,
government and parliament are at last codified. Only if some form of this is
accepted will the construction of a civil society be possible: only then
will the leading institutions and individuals begin to feel constrained -
and supported - by laws which they too easily regard as contingent on their
own ambitions and positions.
All politicians at his level are walkers on tightropes: but Boris Yeltsin's
is higher than any other's. Where his fellow leaders generally administer
settled societies, he must sit atop a state in which every institution,
private and public, is being rebuilt, in which the very individuals are
seeking to remake themselves. He cannot know how successful he will be. He
has lived dangerously, and will not rest from doing so this year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOSS of ministers from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition is starting to
match the loss of steam in the German economy.
The weekend resignation of Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, who
admitted signing official letters promoting a product invented by his wife's
cousin, was not, by itself, a very significant event. The minister's title
of vice-chancellor reflected his now-dashed standing and ambitions in the
Free Democratic party, the coalition partner of Mr Kohl's Christian
Democrats, rather than his real political weight. Mr Mollemann's failure to
make headway with his insistently argued support for free-market policies
and a Gatt trade deal is adequate testimony to his junior status.
Nonetheless, Mr Mollemann's departure provides another illustration of
disarray in the German cabinet, which has seen the premature departure of
five ministers in just over nine months. It strikes a jarring note in Mr
Kohl's efforts to bring about improvement in economic policy. Amid
increasing signs that Germany may be moving into serious recession, the
government's problem-solving ability seems inversely proportional to its
challenges.
Mr Mollemann's much-publicised aims of cutting subsidies in the west of the
country and encouraging a self-generating upswing in the east bore little
fruit. For these failings, however, he is not the only person to blame.
Onerous burdens
Mr Mollemann has also played a central role in recent talks between trade
unions and the government, aimed at reaching a 'solidarity pact' to curb
inflationary pressures and put the financing of German unity on to a sounder
footing. These negotiations, designed to reach agreement on wage restraint,
public spending cuts and reallocation of tax revenues, have been faltering
for several weeks, primarily because of a dispute over social security
reductions.
Recognising that a credible deal would greatly improve the chances of
significant cuts in Bundesbank interest rates, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance
minister, has urged the need for a successful conclusion this month. If his
hopes are dashed, the burdens awaiting Mr Mollemann's successor are likely
to be still more onerous - as will be the economic difficulties for
Germany's EC partners.
Waning star
In an ideal world, Mr Kohl and his coalition partners would use the
opportunity of Mr Mollemann's resignation to refashion the economics
ministry's role and responsibilities. Mr Kohl's world is not, unfortunately,
ideal. The ministry, presided over by Mr Ludwig Erhard between 1949 and 1963
and by Mr Karl Schiller between 1966 and 1972, became a byword for the
liberal policies which powered West Germany's postwar revival. For 20 years,
however, the ministry's star has been waning, while the men in charge have
become accident-prone. Mr Mollemann is the fifth minister since 1977 to
leave under a cloud. The ministry's monetary policy remit was transferred to
the finance ministry in 1972. Its responsibilities have become increasingly
focused on subsidising traditional industries like shipbuilding and coal,
and new ones such as electronics and the Airbus: activities which neither
have led to successes, nor sit easily with the old Ordnungspolitik credo.
Yet even if Mr Kohl wanted to reshape the economics ministry's tasks, he
lacks either the powers or the personnel to carry this out. Under the
existing coalition agreement, the Free Democrats are free to choose Mr
Mollemann's successor. There has been speculation that Mr Kohl might want to
bring in a Christian Democrat politician such as Ms Birgit Breuel, the head
of the Treuhand agency. But the chancellor will probably not risk a
coalition squabble on this. Nevertheless, the new minister will need to
command more confidence from industry than did Mr Mollemann.
Whoever takes over must - like Mr Mollemann - make east Germany's economic
rebirth a priority. But slogans alone will not work. Germany's economic and
social rigidities represent a powerful handicap to the free-market policies
which would represent the best chance for speedy east German renewal.
Unhappily, politicians of Erhard's stature are no longer on offer and
neither is the environment in which his precepts once flourished.

When it comes to generating extra work for themselves, accountants
traditionally win high marks. But Price Waterhouse's proposed scheme of
arrangement for the creditors of Trinity Insurance deserves a special
mention in dispatches.
A six-page letter in an appendix comes out strongly in favour of the scheme
suggested by the provisional liquidators, in preference to the alternative
of liquidation. So who are the provisional liquidators to whom the letter is
addressed? Partners at Price Waterhouse.
And who wrote the letter? A firm of accountants called, er, Price

It may not surprise the cognoscenti of the art world to see Hugues Joffre,
the 34-year-old Frenchman who headed Sotheby's contemporary art department
in London, resurface as senior director of 20th century pictures at arch
rival Christie's. But such a switch at this level is highly unusual.
Both auction houses live in dread of experts, together with their clients
and contacts, being nabbed by the competition. Indeed, there is supposed to
be a gentlemanly 'no poaching' agreement.
A few years ago Sotheby's so dominated modern art that Christie's was
thinking of abandoning its London sales in this market. But now Christie's
is on a high, and claims to out-sell Sotheby's in post-1870 pictures. So the
arrival of Joffre has caused some turbulence. Tobias Mayer, at 29 one of the
firm's young high-flyers, has already jumped ship and can now be found
heading contemporary art at Sotheby's.
At this rate the world's two biggest auction houses could find themselves
juggling, like football clubs, with an expensive transfer market in top
players. Somehow one senses that they have too much to lose for this to
happen.

South African rugby fans will be hoping that the passing of rugby supremo
Danie Craven ushers in a new era for the beleaguered national team whose
return to international competition has been less than triumphant.
Even worse than performances on the pitch - played five tests, lost four -
has been the attitude off it, where rugby has given every impression of
being deeply mired in the symbolism of old South Africa. Unlike cricket,
rugby is a classic contact sport and this is one of the reasons why black
South Africans were so long ostracised.
Having presided over the game for more than 40 years, Craven must inevitably
take some of the blame. But though he may not have been fully prepared for
the new South Africa, nor was he ever much in sympathy with the old regime.
Indeed, he always prided himself on being a supporter of Jan Smuts and was
never close to the Afrikaans political establishment.
He was no friend of the ANC, though, and spent much of his time telling it
to stop meddling in rugby's affairs.
Craven's replacement has yet to emerge. His co-president, Ebrahim Patel, has
the right political credentials, but no support base. Some believe that
Louis Luyt, the maverick Transvaal rugby boss and former fertiliser magnate,
is the only man for the job, but he suffers from the opposite defect. Former
captains like Morne du Plessis and Wynand Claasen have the right profile,
but haven't served administrative time.
Ironically, it fell yesterday to cricketing chief Ali Bacher, ANC sports
head Steve Tshwete and the South African and Indian cricketers playing in
the test at Newlands to be the first to mark Craven's passing with a
minute's silence. Rugby fans must be hoping that someone of similar
political and diplomatic skills to Bacher can now be found to make their
sport more internationally acceptable.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Letter: Analysis without sentimentality in the coal mining
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM EDWARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the great energy debate the FT will wish to make the case that sound
economics must not be swamped by latter-day sentimentality about British
coal mining. Neither is it easy to determine the truth in the swirl of rival
prices and costs. But the 'Grimy face of coal' (December 29) does not help
FT readers to a sound analysis of the environmental issues in the energy
debate. It is remarkably misleading. For example:
The issue is not about increasing coal burn, but the size of the reduction.
The 'additional' tonnages now being mooted will not affect the environmental
issues one way or another.
Coal-fired power stations contribute about 8 per cent of the world's
greenhouse gases. CO emissions by UK power stations are falling; It is CO
emissions from transport that are rising.
The UK did not obtain lenient targets under the EC large combustion plant
directive by promising to burn more gas in power stations. Gas burn for
power stations was not even considered. The targets were lenient because the
electricity industry argued that it needed time because it had fitted
flue-gas de-sulphurisation (FGD) and British power stations were very large.
FGD reduces sulphur and nitrous oxides to very low levels. Twelve gw of FGD
were agreed to enable the 80m tonnes of coal then being burnt at UK power
stations to comply with the directive. This was reduced to 8gw to make the
sale of the generators easier but now only 6gw are being built. Germany has
50gw installed at its privately-owned power stations. One year of the
British nuclear levy would fund 10gw of FGD and the power would still be
cheaper than nuclear.
Nevertheless, sulphur and nitrous oxide emissions from British power
stations are falling and will continue to fall. It is again transport that
is causing nitrous oxide emissions to rise and this is responsible for the
reports of 'poor air quality'.
Any government initiative that can now be detected is likely to make
open-cast emissions more difficult to get, not less.
The article is redeemed by its last sentence. Coal burnt in combined cycle
would reduce sulphur and nitrous oxide to minimal levels and CO by at least
20 per cent and produce cheap power.
Any grime there is can be cleaned from the face of coal if today's
technology is fully utilised; the new coal technology combined with vigorous
conservation will clean it cheaply. The antithesis in the article is not
real.

FT  05 JAN 93 / A rebound with risks: Japan's economy is set to recover in
1993 - Forecast 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MASARU YOSHITOMI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two outstanding features of Japan's current recession. One is the
gross national product gap, the difference bet-ween potential and actual
GNP, and the other is the sharp deterioration of financial institutions'
balance sheets.
The GNP gap is widening rapidly. There is a simultaneous decline in
investment in manufacturing, commercial business construction and consumer
durable goods. All three sectors are now suffering from excessive stocks,
and all are victims of the deflation of Japan's 'bubble' economy of the
1980s.
Falling investment is partly the result of an increase in capital costs.
Whereas companies could raise funds through the issue of equity at an
abnormally low cost of about 1 per cent during the late 1980s, the decline
of the stock market has confronted companies with higher financing costs. In
the corporate bond market, for example, the cost of capital is about 5 per
cent.
The plunge in prices of stocks and land has hit consumer demand, and
contributed to a sharp increase in real estate-related bankruptcies. The
value of these bankruptcies has climbed steadily over the past two years,
reaching a record for the post-war period.
The sharp fall in stock prices, which saw the Nikkei index fall by 26 per
cent last year, has threatened financial institutions by undermining their
ability to meet the Bank for International Settlements requirement of an 8
per cent capital adequacy ratio by the end of March 1993.
However, it has become increasingly clear that the more important culprit in
weakening banks' balance sheets has been the decline of land prices and the
widespread uncertainty over real estate price trends in the future. As a
result, there has been an accumulation of non-performing assets at the banks
and an increase in defaults by their clients.
There is much speculation about the magnitude of this problem, but the scale
is large enough to make commercial banks worried about the adequacy of their
own capital, regardless of the BIS regulations. Meanwhile, deferred interest
payments and the writing-off of bad assets are also large enough to erode
the bulk of banks' gross profits.
In these conditions, financial institutions have naturally become
risk-averse in their lending policies. One result is that there is little
increase in money supply, and only a small increase in bank lending - in
other words, a credit crunch.
Bank loans for small and medium-scale enterprises are stagnant, which is
unusual. In past recessions, banks vigorously extended loans to such
enterprises, allowing them to play a leading role in the recovery from
recession.
The Japanese government recognised the unique features of the current
recession, and launched a comprehensive Y10,700bn (Pounds 56.6bn) spending
package in August. As a result, government investment in public works will
increase by 13 per cent in the year to the end of March 1993. Government
loans for private housing at low interest rates are already contributing to
a recovery in residential construction.
In sharp contrast to private institutions, government financial institutions
have been extending loans to small and medium-scale enterprises. The value
of such loans is currently growing at an annual rate of 6 to 7 per cent. At
the same time, the government has been increasing its procurement of land in
an attempt to stimulate real estate transactions.
Given the government policy package, what are the prospects for the Japanese
economy? Two groups of forces are at work, but pulling in different
directions. One is the government-supported expansion of public investment
and housing development, and the other is sluggish activity by the
manufacturing, commercial building, construction and consumer sectors, which
is depressing economic growth.
Only during 1993 will the successful adjustment of capital stock levels
reduce these negative forces, leading to a recovery of final demand. Private
economists forecast that real GNP growth will reach about 2.7 per cent for
fiscal 1993, compared with 1.6 per cent for this year. The present slump is
expected to bottom out in the first half of fiscal 1993, and be followed by
a second-half recovery which will be sluggish.
But there are two risks. First, will an unemployment problem eventually
emerge? Second, could the expansion of Japan's trade surplus cause fresh
conflict with the new US administration?
If weak final demand further threatens the labour market, the government
should consider the introduction of income tax cuts, combined with the
promise of an increase in consumption tax a few years later. This
value-added tax now stands at 3 per cent.
The policy combination would meet two requirements simultaneously, providing
a shorter-term stimulus of demand, and achieving the medium-term target of
transferring the country's tax collection system from direct to indirect
taxes. It would also help to contain the budget deficit.
Strong political leadership is required for this simultaneous commitment. It
is also clear that short-term interest rates should be lower than during a
normal recession to ease the shortages of capital and credit.
On the trade front, Japan's surplus has expanded rapidly over the past year
and a half. It is often assumed that the recession must be responsible for
this expansion, by depressing demand for imports. But more than 80 per cent
of the surplus is due to more favourable terms of trade for Japan because of
the appreciation of the yen and to reduced 'financial transactions'.
For example, export prices in dollar terms are higher, and the price of
imported petroleum has declined. In addition, a sharp decline in gold
imports has added to the surplus.
A recovery of the US economy will certainly enlarge the external imbalances
of both the US and Japan. This will create a pattern in which the additional
shortage of US domestic savings required for that country's recovery and
growth will be financed by the further expansion of Japan's surplus.
How these larger external imbalances are perceived and dealt with by the new
US administration is just one of the uncertainties facing Japan in the
coming year.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Letter: Real cause of damage to US silver mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER S BRIDGES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I enjoyed Arnold Wilson's article on Leadville and skiing ('Leadville,
living on a legend', December 24). He writes that 'In 1893, when along with
other old mining towns . . . Leadville had its heart torn out by a
government decision to end the silver standard.'
It was in fact only in 1900 that bimetallism officially ended in the US,
when Congress passed the Gold Standard Act. But Mr Wilson is correct in
indicating that the real damage to Colorado silver mining was done in 1893 -
by the British authorities as well as by the American.
In June 1893, India ceased coining silver, and the price of silver tumbled
in four days from 83 to 62 cents an ounce. In October 1893, the US Congress
repealed the Sherman Act which had required our Treasury to purchase several
million ounces of silver annually. And any hope of a recovery in silver
mining ended in the presidential election of 1896, with the defeat of
William Jennings Bryan and 'Free Silver'.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Tough task ahead: US revival will be weaker than many expect
 -Forecast 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN FELDSTEIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year 1993 should be a good one for the US economy: low inflation,
declining unemployment, and legislative progress to reduce future budget
deficits. It should be good, but it is not guaranteed to be. The unusually
weak character of the recovery that began 21 months ago raises doubts about
its robustness and even its sustainability. And although President-elect
Bill Clinton's rhetoric has been reassuring since the election, the hard
task of legislating for tough deficit-reduction policies still lies ahead.
Consider first the economic recovery. The strong upturn of demand and
production that began in September and October has induced most private
forecasters to predict that real gross domestic product will increase at
least 3 per cent this year, more than enough to assure that the unemployment
rate will continue its decline. From a peak of 7.7 per cent in June 1992,
the unemployment rate has already fallen to 7.2 per cent.
Three per cent GDP growth in 1993 would bring the unemployment rate by
year-end to less than 7 per cent, reinforcing consumer confidence but
leaving enough slack in the economy to keep the recent 3 per cent rate of
consumer price inflation from rising.
A big reason for the recent cyclical acceleration has been the increase in
retail sales provoked by the recovery of consumer confidence that began in
October. Retailers reported strong Christmas sales, suggesting that the
decline in inventories that began in September has continued and will
stimulate increased production in the new year.
The decline in intermediate and long-term interest rates that began in early
December could continue as financial markets grow confident that the Federal
Reserve will maintain its anti-inflationary policy and that the new
president will succeed in enacting legislation to cut the deficit. Such
declines in interest rates would stimulate housing and other investment and,
by reducing the value of the dollar, would increase net exports.
While a mild upturn is more likely than not, there are three reasons why the
recovery will be weaker than the consensus forecast and might run out of
steam completely.
First, consumers lack the incomes to sustain their recent rate of growth of
spending. Real disposable income rose only 1 per cent during the five
quarters from the start of the recovery until the third quarter of 1992 and
declined in the most recent month. The primary reason for the slow growth of
incomes is that payroll employment is lower now than when the recovery
began. And with the personal saving rate down to only 4.2 per cent of
disposable personal income - lower than any year for at least three decades
 -there is little prospect for increased spending without a rise in
employment and incomes.
Second, there is no external driving force of the sort that stimulated and
sustained past upturns. Although short-term interest rates are depressed,
the low inflation rate and the steep yield curve imply significant real
interest rates for longer-term credits. With the broad M2 monetary aggregate
up at a rate of only 2 per cent over the past six months, only a very
unusual rise in velocity would lead to the projected 6 per cent rate of
increase of nominal GDP during the next six months.
Third, despite the large federal deficit, the behaviour of the combined
federal and state-local budgets is likely to be slightly contractionary in
1993 on a cyclically adjusted basis. And the higher international value of
the dollar, combined with the weakness of other in-dustrial economies, is
likely to reverse the rise of US exports that began in September.
The recovery's strength is also endangered by unusual transition factors:
defence cuts, banks' reluctance to lend while they try to conform to higher
capital ratio guidelines, and the freeze on commercial construction in
response to high office vacancy rates.
In short, while there are reasons to be optimistic about 1993, there are
also substantial uncertainties. The same is true for longer-run policy
decisions.
The most important long-run problem remains the budget deficit and the
resulting low rate of national saving. Households, corporations and
state-local governments now save only 5 per cent of GDP after providing for
depreciation. The federal government must borrow two-thirds of that saving
to finance its cyclically adjusted structural deficit. Net national saving
has thus been reduced to only 2 per cent of GDP. With the inflow of foreign
capital at only about 1 per cent of GDP, total funds available for business
investment and housing construction are only 3 per cent of GDP.
During the election campaign, Mr Clinton generally ignored the budget
deficit. He issued a campaign budget proposal that called for a middle-class
tax cut and a variety of spending increases. His budget only limited the
structural deficit to an unchanged 3 per cent of GDP for the next four years
by a variety of wishful-thinking improvements in government efficiency. The
Clinton plan to provide health insurance to 37m uninsured Americans was
omitted from his budget. In addition, top advisers called for a big
supplementary deficit increase in 1993 to stimulate the economy.
Fortunately, since the election Mr Clinton has emphasised his determination
to reduce future budget deficits. He has indicated that the middle-class tax
cut may be postponed. He has talked about limiting the favourable tax
treatment of health insurance premiums paid by employers and taxing social
security benefits. Some in the Clinton camp have advocated significant
increases in gasoline taxes.
Nevertheless, talking about deficit-reduction strategies is easier than
getting the congressional votes. President Reagan sought to cut social
security benefits and limit health insurance tax breaks but could find no
support in Congress. Although the Democrats' control of Congress may allow
Mr Clinton to achieve certain things more easily, Republicans are unlikely
to vote for politically unpopular benefit cuts or tax increases, and
Democrats will not be eager to do so on their own.
The opportunity to reduce future budget deficits, like the prospect of
accelerating economic activity, may look better now than it has for years.
But uncertainty will remain at least until the cherry blossoms bloom in
Washington.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Letter: Peso reform cosmetic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms FRANCES STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In a short account of Mexican currency reform ('Mexico slims peso',
December 31) you illustrate the change by pointing out, first, that a meal
for four in a top Mexican restaurant will no longer cost 1m old pesos, but
will cost 'just' 1,000 pesos; and 'alternatively' that the minimum daily
wage will be a 'mere' 12 pesos. Such cosmetic change will not alter this
shocking ratio, viz that individuals in Mexico spend on a single meal more
than 20 times the daily minimum wage - which often supports as many as six
people. If such a family on the minimum wage eats twice a day, and spends 70
per cent of its income on food, then each person's meal will at most cost
0.3 per cent (three thousandths) of the price of the meal of each person at
the top restaurant.
Unfortunately, it is not just the peso which is being slimmed, but also the
many millions in Mexico surviving on the minimum wage or less. The 1980s saw
'liberal' pro-market policies adopted in Mexico, in which wages were
deliberately reduced so as to release resources to repay debts and increase
profits. The data you quote is the result.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Letter: Corporate rescue can be costly and pointless
exercise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER GORDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am a small shareholder in a small public company currently in
administration.
I have just received four documents, weighing 2lb 2oz and comprising 244
pages, setting out proposals for the reconstruction of the company. The two
principal documents tell me that if I am in any doubt about the action I
should take I should immediately consult my 'stockbroker, bank manager,
legal adviser, accountant or other professional adviser authorised under the
Financial Services Act 1986'.
Insofar as the directors 'believe that if the proposed reconstruction is not
approved and implemented there is no likelihood of any distribution being
made to ordinary creditors, nor of any value being preserved for ordinary
shareholders' I am not, in fact, in any doubt about the action which I
should take.
While, on the one hand, however, I cannot fail to be impressed by the
lengths to which the company and its advisers have had to go to protect the
interests of small shareholders, on the other, the whole (obviously very
costly) exercise does seem somewhat pointless.
The company has a substantial balance sheet deficit - a fate unfortunately
shared by many other companies at the present time - and I would have
thought it desirable for some less cumbersome and costly process to be
introduced where rescue operations are being considered and where the
shareholders have no effective interests to be protected.

No matter how many excellent documentaries they make about prisons - and
there has been a fair number of them in the past five years - I suspect they
make not a jot of difference to the average British citizen's conviction
that sentencing is too lenient and prisons not nearly grim enough. Prisoner
On the Run on ITV at 10.40 takes the case of an absconding 'lifer', and
through it examines the arguments being made for reforming the life-sentence
or abolishing it altogether.
It may be a minority view but I find the hidden world of prisons a good deal
more absorbing than hospitals. But Operation Hospital, a new series
beginning tonight on C4 at 8.30, may yet change my mind. The series offers a
fly-on-the-wall view of life at King's College, the inner London teaching
hospital which faces particularly difficult decisions about reshaping to
meet the future.
For Love of Money (C4 at 9.00), the irritatingly trivial programme about
antiques which used to appear as part of 'Without Walls', has now developed
a life of its own.
A treat tonight will be the appearance of Jeremy Paxman, explaining why he
collects stuffed fish.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Arts: Domingo's Walkure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Placido qua, Placido la. Not content with virtually every leading Italian
and French tenor role, Domingo conducts, sings pop and broadcasts
multilingual New Year messages. Now comes Domingo as Siegmund in a new
production of Die Walkure at the Vienna State Opera (broadcast by Radio 3 on
January 2).
For once, Domingo's famed professionalism was not enough. His German diction
was poor. He looked uncharacteristically old and clod-footed, standing out
awkwardly in a cast of experienced, authentic Wagnerians. His Italianate
delivery - which stood him in good stead in previous Heldentenor roles such
as Lohengrin - was inappropriate to Siegmund. No-one can blame Domingo for
wanting to take on the part: as a popular tenor with a beautiful voice, he
can virtually dictate terms to managements (and record companies) grateful
for commercial success. He has the vocal stamina and technique - and as he
nears 60 (whatever the dictionaries may say), he must seize the remaining
challenges while still in good health. Also, how many acceptable alternative
Siegmunds are there today?
But this was Domingo's Siegmund, not Wagner's. His thick southern European
accent discounts him as a credible Wagner tenor. Where the composer's deeply
Teutonic text demands understanding and clarion despatch, the words came out
as a string of indistinguishable vowel sounds. Where Wagner's music
corresponds to the sharp consonants and forward sonority of the German
language, Domingo softened the tonal contours. Pre-occupied with an alien
text, he seemed unsure how to respond to Wagner's musical spaces, vacuously
splaying his arms, his Calaf-like pony-tail adding to the out-of-context
appearance. One is forced to ask - just how much does Domingo re-think his
stage persona for each character he portrays?
The performance began to settle only after Siegmund's demise. Even then, it
was uninvolving. Conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi and produced by Adolf
Dresen, this Walkure (part of a new Ring to be completed in May) is a feeble
successor to the 1957 Karajan-Preetorius staging. The imbalance in the cast
is the least of its problems. Herbert Kapplmuller's poorly-lit sets - a
fur-lined igloo in Act one, a black field-tent for Act two, a risible
mini-volcano for the magic fire circle - offer a flimsy platform for
repertory-style acting. Dresen offers not a single original idea.
Dohnanyi conducted efficiently: but it all sounded too calculated. Robert
Hale, now the favoured Wotan in Vienna, Berlin and Munich, was handsome in
voice and appearance, but lacked personality. Kurt Rydl made a powerful
Hunding, his battle with Siegmund providing a lone moment of dramatic
veracity. Ute Priew's Fricka was a big, busty bossyboots, not unlike some of
the Viennese matriarchs in the audience. Waltraud Meier's first Sieglinde
was subdued: she needs a more suitable partner. Hildegard Behrens's
Brunnhilde struggled valiantly to bring some life to the proceedings. Was
there ever a greater indictment of 'international opera' than this?

FT  05 JAN 93 / Arts: 'Germinations' spreads through Europe - William Packer
welcomes the expanding scope of the Young Artists' Biennale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's Germinations calls itself, in its subtitle, the European
Biennale for Young Artists, but it is something more particular than that.
It began seven manifestations and ten years ago as an initiative of the
Franco-German Office for Youth, which still takes the principal
responsibility in organising what has by now become a remarkable growth  -
Germinations indeed a happily prescient label to adopt.
That first exercise was a simple collaboration between France and Germany,
by which the work of promising art students of the two countries was shown
together in Berlin and Paris. The following year, British art schools were
invited to join, with the show visiting Kassel, Edinburgh and London. Here I
should declare an interest, for I was the chairman of that first British
selection panel, a role I also took on for Germinations 4.
So the pattern was set, of an international exhibition every year or two,
travelling always to different cities, of a selection of the work of
Europe's art students. It has tried itself as an annual - last year it was
at Aachen - but as it has grown, so its organisational and logistical
commitments have proliferated, and a biennial cycle is likely to prove the
more comfortable - Breda is provisionally the next venue, but not until
later in 1994.
By Germinations 4 of 1987, the Netherlands had made it a club of four. Now,
in Germinations 7, ten of the 12 member states of the European Community are
represented, Luxembourg and Italy the exceptions, and three countries of the
former Eastern bloc, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, have been invited
to take part; in all there are 62 exhibitors. The practice tested in
previous Germinations, of setting up workshop and studio exchanges among the
participating artists, has been continued, with Budapest, Prague and
Grenoble the host cities.
What all these developments represent in terms of human opportunity,
especially now with the Community newly opened up, the world at large more
volatile than ever, and the need simply to speak across national and
cultural barriers never more apparent, hardly needs spelling out. Needless
to say, our own Department of Education &amp; Science, in its wisdom, withdrew
its previous modest funding from the current exercise; fortunately the
British Council, the Arts Council and the National Association of Fine Art
Education were able jointly to make up this deficiency.
To be fair, some of the exhibiting countries were supported in their
contributions only from the Commission's enabling funds and those of the
Franco-German Office, which together keep the show on the road. Whether such
an apparently inequitable situation can or should continue is another
matter. Given the record and the ever-expanding international scope of
Germinations, the attractive possibilities of even modest commercial
sponsorship seem obvious enough.
But the question in principle remains, as to whether or not Germinations
should be allowed to continue to expand exponentially. It is a matter
variously of character, focus and practicalities. To grow overlarge,
cumbersome and sluggish was the dinosaur's fate. My own view is that no
matter how many contributory states are welcomed into the Germinations club,
not all of them should expect, nor even wish, to exhibit every time. A
constant permutation of ten or so, with a constant round of fresh partners
and new places, would keep it manageable, the focus tight, the spirit fresh.
It is too good an enterprise to be allowed to founder under its own weight.
'And what, Mrs Lincoln, did you think of the play?' Well, the show is
beautifully installed in the Grenoble Magasin: most surprising is the
consistency. I had expected more variety, and had hoped for at least some
true idiosyncracy. That said, what follows is predictable enough, for, in a
knowing age, these young artists are nothing if not professional, and what
they have given us, most especially of sculpture, is very much the staple of
the international galleries and art magazines.
Here is the elegant disposition of given materials, sometimes in bizarre or
surreal juxtaposition, as with Gilles Barbier's line of familiar objects
(Fr) - telephone, broom handle, chair, cupboard door and so on, strung
together to articulate crankily across the floor - or the barely visible
minimalism of Wolfgang Ritter's low glass and metal slabs (D). It was no
surprise that the large relief installation by Mathieu Manche (Fr),
consisting of hooded and sinisterly extended plastic overalls hung along the
wall, should win the Georges Boudaille Prize of a solo show at the Magasin
in the near future.
The painting was less conspicuously chic and fashionable and, in
consequence, more variously engaging - though how one longs for some genuine
and substantial response to the visible world, seen, studied, analysed and
properly restated. But then I would say as much of an student show I have
seen these 20 years. Here an intensely-felt drawing of herself by Namora
Quintino de Barros (P), and the simple still-life drawings of Gomes de
Araujo Queiroz (P), come the nearest to so old-fashioned an ideal.
For the rest, the dark expressionist street-scapes of Anja Leu (D) are very
strong, for all the modesty of their scale and presentation. I also like the
hard-edge tartan abstractions of Susanne Paesler (D), and the deceptively
simple come-and-go of Niall Persaud's painted surfaces (GB). The rectilinear
grisaille abstractions of Philip Smith (GB), and Anna Cooley's simplified
lamp set against a colour-field (GB), are also notable. Lee Mulligan's
lipstick video (Ir) is hauntingly engaging in its sheer desperation.
'Germinations 7': Magasin, Centre National d'Art Contemporain, Grenoble,
until January 24: supported by the European Commission and individual
cultural ministries or institutions.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Arts: Clouded by the death of a master - Ballet in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The accounts for 1992 do not balance. Loss outweighed gain; the good had to
be set against much that was footling, inadequate. The year was overshadowed
by the death of Sir Kenneth MacMillan, whose career was dedicated to the
idea of ballet as an art of our - rather than our grandparents' - time. He
found a way to show the springs of behaviour through eloquent movement, and
sometimes questioned ballet itself in order to reach a truth. His last gift
to the Royal Ballet was The Judas Tree, seen in March, a work as densely
layered with meaning as anything he had created, and one which showed him
still finding stimulating dance imagery. It was a piece centred upon Irek
Mukhamedov, but like all MacMillan's repertory, it inspired superlative
performance from its entire cast.
Mukhamedov, at the peak of his powers, was the year's dominant performer
from the January evening when he stepped on Covent Garden's stage as a
tremendous Albrecht in Giselle. I have been fortunate enough to see almost
every leading Albrecht of the past 50 years, both East and West. None, for
me, has gone more potently to the core of Albrecht's being than Mukhamedov,
nor made the romantic agonies of the role so moving. He went on to give a no
less grandly romantic interpretation of Solor in La Bayadere, in a cast
which brought Altynai Asylmuratova as the ideal Nikiya, Darcey Bussell as a
virtuoso Gamzatti, Stephen Jefferies as a commanding Chief Brahmin. The old
ballet came gloriously alive.
Mukhamedov's artistry was also fascinating when he was cast against type, as
des Grieux in Manon, where his dramatic intelligence was matched by that of
Jefferies' menacing Lescaut; these two vivid theatrical temperaments were
also ablaze when Mukhamedov made his debut as Romeo with Jefferies as
Mercutio. To watch Mukhamedov's Rudolf in Mayerling was, again, to see a
reading of passionate truth. In his MacMillan roles Mukhamedov has found
artistic justification for his decision to join the Royal Ballet.
This repertory has had most rewarding playing from the company. Michael Nunn
won his laurels in his created role in The Judas Tree, and, in the biggest
challenge of his career, showed us a Rudolf whose vulnerability was made
clear by his refinement of means as dancer and actor. From Tetsuya Kumakawa
dancing of technical brilliance as Colas, as Solor, as Puck, and in Scenes
de ballet. To the company's credit we must also place Viviana Durante's
mysterious dignity as the woman in Judas Tree, Darcey Bussell's speed and
clarity in Balanchine works and in Forsythe's In the middle, and
interpretations by Leanne Benjamin, Fiona Chadwick, Lesley Collier, Gillian
Revie, Natalie McCann and Jane Burn in Mayerling.
Performances of Scenes de ballet, of Balanchine's Symphony in C and Violin
concerto were a joy of the year, and I salute the musical standards that
obtained under Barry Wordsworth's baton. Forsythe's In the middle (fast
junk-food for the eyes) sat heavily on the debit side, as did the decision
to turn a lightweight film into the interminably flimsy Tales of Beatrix
Potter on stage.
Birmingham Royal Ballet produced an impressive revival of MacMillan's The
Burrow. The acquisition of his Romeo was a move which seemed at first to
over-stretch the company, though Nina Ananiashvili made a noble and touching
Juliet. I have never been an admirer of Kurt Jooss's brand of European dance
 -too earnest for its limited means - but BRB's revival of The Green Table,
to mark the piece's 60th year, was well liked by its fans. A new piece by
Oliver Hindle, pious about American Indians, also failed to convince me that
worthy causes necessarily make worthy ballets.
English National Ballet had a bad year, its repertory too reliant upon
stagings by Ben Stevenson. His crass Nutcracker and noxious Cinderella
contrive to minimise their interpreters. ENB offered one interesting
creation, Kim Brandstrup's poetic White Nights, which was given in the
welcome context of an evening of short pieces that included two brief
dance-jokes by David Parsons, well told by their casts; something rather
earnest about Schubert by Robert North (though the admirable and Apollonian
Thomas Edur came to its rescue) and L, a muscle-bound moment from the
inescapable Mr Stevenson which lived up to its title.
That ENB acquired the Moscow star Ludmila Semenyaka as guest and then hardly
cast her, was like using a Faberge Easter egg as a door-stop. She was
allowed, though, to redeem the role of Cinderella (a task akin to turning
plastic into platinum). ENB spent the year looking far below its best,
without concern for its historically interesting repertory, and without a
classical ballerina (Semenyaka's role, but one denied her). If I have a hope
for 1993, it is that the company be rescued from its artistic and technical
doldrums.
Elsewhere 1992 was (like every other year, alas) much concerned with
swan-upping. Performance of Swan Lake was an epidemic. The Royal Ballet
began the autumn season with its choreographically admirable, but
dramatically anxious, staging. In June, Birmingham also offered swans.
London City Ballet toured a version throughout the first months of the year.
Northern Ballet Theatre, with an improbable staging (but ah] the title])
presented it for 16 weeks. 'Stars of the Bolshoy' travelled the land with
the second act for three months, though with the redeeming presence of
Natalya Bessmertnova. The National Ballet of St. Petersburg (resounding
title; less than resounding company) also trudged the provinces with a
version, made bearable by Nadezhda Pavlova and Lubov Kunakova as guests. I
need hardly add that ENB will mount a new production early next year. That
there are precious few ballerinas - and how precious that few - who should
be entrusted with its leading roles, is yet another nail in the coffin of
this masterpiece.
When not distracted by our feathered friends, London City Ballet showed
sound triple bills of work by Balanchine, Ashton, Lichine, Jack Carter -
pleasingly done. Northern Ballet Theatre, as an alternative to its alleged
swans, came up with A Christmas Carol. Dull choreography was rescued by well
focussed performance, songs, brilliant design by Lez Brotherston, and enough
sentiment to knock Tiny Tim off his crutch. Clinging desperately to my
principles, I enjoyed it.
A year of directorial uncertainty did not inhibit London Contemporary Dance
Theatre from performing with tremendous verve, and acquiring work to
challenge its excellent dancers. PIeces by Mark Morris, Christopher Bruce,
Amanda Miller were all welcome, and found the company in cracking form.
Rambert Dance Company produced a lot of new choreography, and lost Richard
Alston as director. Workshops in May brought intriguing (and in the case of
Mark Baldwin, intriguingly different) dances. By the time the company
reached the horrid Royalty Theatre for a summer season, six new pieces had
been introduced to the repertory, including a disappointing 'first' - Merce
Cunningham's Touchbase, which was shared with Cunningham's own company and
was reportedly partly 'generated' by computer. It looked it. Serious design
is part of the Rambert image, and Paul Huxley's bold set for Alston's Cats
Eyes was distinguished. Novelties from Mark Baldwin and Paul Old were
welcome, but the most impressive creation was Siobhan Davies' Winnsboro
Cotton Mill Blues, in which the lives of the workers and their looms seemed
one.
Among the year's dance pleasures was Siobhan Davies' White Bird Featherless,
made for her own troupe. It was clear-toned, allusive, and Sean Feldman's
dancing was outstandingly elegant. But dominating the year's free dance
creativity was DV8's Strange Fish, a fierce theatre piece about faith, love,
belief, and the way they all, says DV8, let us down. No matter what the
message, the ensemble playing was stunning, with Wendy Houston and Nigel
Charnock leading a troupe of hair-raisingly committed artists.
Nothing else approached this, and much of what was on view - from dim
British groups to dimmest French ensembles - was a vexation to the spirit.
Michael Clark's MMM, was a joy-ride on a stolen Sacre du printemps,
noteworthy only for his own exquisite solo. Adventures in Motion Pictures
took a flyer at The Nutcracker at the Edinburgh Festival, and Matthew Bourne
made something merry of it, though Tchaikovsky's greatest moments escaped
him. I did not enjoy Jonathan Burrows new Very as much as I had hoped, but I
am eager to see anything this gifted creator shows. And whatever the ups and
(mostly) downs of the year's free dance, the work of The Place as a platform
for every kind of movement performance remains invaluable. Adventurous,
generous-minded, its policies are admirable, no matter how awful some of the
things on view. Prospective sponsors, please note.
Visitors included the Berlin Ballet with a less than happy repertory; the
Australian Ballet with sound classical stagings; Alvin Ailey's company with
familiar work and familiar energy; Cumbre Flamenca, with Mariquilla
hammering rhythms into the ground; the Ballet du Nord with an enchanting
re-creation of the original Fille mal gardee. Mikhail Baryshnikov came with
his White Oaks Project, and remains a prodigious artist in Mark Morris's Ten
Suggestions and in Graham's El Penitente. The rest of the White Oaks
offerings ranged from the tedious to the frightful. The Royal New Zealand
Ballet came to the Derngate Theatre in Northampton (which has the liveliest
dance programming of any British theatre outside London) with a theatrically
vital Hamlet. Nederlands Dans Theater appeared briefly in Bradford.
Russian companies, bearing a variety of improbable names, came in quest of
hard currency, with stagings hardly worth a rouble at today's rate. The
presence of the princely Yury Posokhov, from the Bolshoy, made Moscow City
Ballet's Sleeping Beauty bearable. Star-less, their Nutcracker was also
pointless. Bessmertnova toured with a Stars of the Bolshoy group, lustrous
still as Giselle; the National Ballet of St. Petersburg swanned around. The
Ballet Theatre of St. Petersburg came burdened with supposedly modern
choreography by Boris Eifman - an experience not recommended.
These visitors are victims of economic conditions in Russia. Tour they must,
in quest of convertible funds, in order to exist (and there was a depressing
rumour that some corps de ballet dancers received bed and breakfast and just
Pounds 30 a week as recompense for slogging night after night at the mill.
Slavery is not dead). That most of their offerings were conceived without
regard for Western standards in design and production, and that lack of
resources meant pauperish presentation, is sad, but no excuse for risibly
inadequate stagings, nor for standards of dancing that are, shall we say,
variable.
There are significant companies in Russia apart from the Mariinsky and
Bolshoy troupes - the Perm Ballet has a fine reputation - but care is
essential is showing them off. The visit of the Kiev Ballet to Paris was
less valuable than we had hoped, as I reported from the Palais des Congres.
The good name of Russian ballet must not fall victim to audiences willing to
clap anything with a Russian name - or to fast-buck impresarios.
Among performances abroad - the Paris Opera Ballet on magnificent form;
Roland Petit's endearing Chaplin tribute in Rome - the second Bournonville
Festival in Copenhagen is the year's happiest event. There were ten days of
Bournonville's choreography; the Master's bust garlanded with flowers in the
dear King's Theatre; a 'family' of admirers from round the world; the
delights of Copenhagen itself. Good ballet-goers are Danes at heart.

<TEXT>
E THOMAS CONSTRUCTION has been celebrating Christmas with more than Pounds
10m worth of new business from a large foodstore chain.
Following its first contract for Safeway Stores earlier this year, the
company has now won three more at Newquay, Penzance and Totnes.
E Thomas is to fit out a Newquay store in Treloggan Road, for which it has
recently completed the shell.
Safeway has awarded the company management contracts to extend its Penzance
premises and to build and fit out a new foodstore at Totnes.
The 10-month Totnes project involves a structure similar to the Newquay
building, with a mostly single-storey foods store of about 48,000 sq ft. It
will be built on the site of the demolished Harris Bacon factory close to
the river Dart, together with complete external works, roads, car parks,
drainage etc, and construction of a new bridge over the leat. At Penzance,
the Safeway foodstore on the approach road to the town will be expanded by
15,000 sq ft to provide a new cafe, shop, a larger petrol filling station,
and increased car parking space.

FT  05 JAN 93 / People: Valerie Strachan promoted at Excise board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Valerie Strachan, one of two deputy chairmen at Customs and Excise, has been
promoted to the chairmanship of the board, in succession to Sir Brian Unwin
(see above). The appointment is at permanent secretary level, making her the
third woman currently - alongside Stella Rimington, boss of MI5, and Barbara
Mills, director of public prosecutions - to attain the highest grade within
the civil service.
For the past three years, Strachan, 52, has been director general
responsible for the internal taxation and customs group, which has put her
very much in the spotlight during the run-up to 1993; during the UK
presidency she chaired the group of member state officials in Brussels
charged with the indirect tax and customs arrangements to come into effect
from the beginning of this year.
Speaking on the fourth day of the operation of the single market, she admits
it is 'too soon to be totally confident about everything. But so far as the
immediate effects are concerned - what happened to travellers - it seems to
have gone well, and people are generally satisfied we have done what we said
we would. As for the impact on business, it is too soon to say. I expect it
will be a little rough round the edges before everything settles down.'
Consequently, she signals that 'making sure the single market works' will be
one of her principal tasks in the next year or two. She is keen to stress
that, while there have been a number of headline successes in combating
drug-smuggling, some 'very big challenges remain'. And, despite its
essentially regulatory role, the department has various standards to meet as
regards the citizen's charter.
Recently, the top job at Customs &amp; Excise has appeared to alternate between
an internal appointee - as Strachan is - and an outside candidate - as was
Sir Brian. Strachan herself joined the department from university in 1961,
but she has worked elsewhere within Whitehall, including the Home Office,
the Treasury and the Cabinet Office.
Her contribution to the European cause was last year recognised when she won
the UK Woman of Europe award.
*****
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, has appointed
John Cheffins (above) as the company's new director for civil engines
following the departure last month of Frank Turner to take over as the new
managing director of Lucas Aerospace.
Cheffins, who is 45, has spent all his working life with Rolls-Royce. After
joining the company's Derby operations as an undergraduate apprentice,
Cheffins was transferred to Rolls-Royce's Canadian operations in 1975. He
became president of Rolls-Royce Industries Canada in 1989.
Cheffins will be replaced by Barry Eccleston as president and chief
executive of the Canadian operations. Like Cheffins, Eccleston is also 45
and joined Rolls-Royce as an undergraduate apprentice. He has worked for the
company in Japan as well as holding several marketing posts, including four
years with International Aero Engines (IAE), the US-based aero-engine
consortium of which Rolls-Royce is a leading partner.
*****
Thorntons, the chocolate manufacturer and retailer, has strengthened its
board with the internal appointment of five new directors.
John Coyle, John Culverhouse, Nigel Etchelss, Peter Heaps, and David
Mitchell were all divisional directors of the company before their
appointment to the board.
John Thornton, chairman, said all five would 'bring with them considerable
experience of the business, skill and expertise'. Since the group's listing
in 1988, its main board - comprising himself, Michael Thornton, deputy
chairman, Alan Goodwin, finance director, and two non-executive directors -
and the divisional directors had in practice worked together as one board.
The new appointments simply formalised this position.
Thorntons, 48 per cent owned by the Thornton family which founded the
business in 1911, is currently expanding its UK and European operations. It
plans to increase the number of UK shops from 395 to 650 in the next five
years.

FT  05 JAN 93 / People: Sir Brian Unwin customised for EIB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The man who made his mark renegotiating the UK's contribution to the EC
budget under Margaret Thatcher in the mid-1980s has just been given a job at
the heart of the Community's financial establishment.
Sir Brian Unwin, the 57-year old chairman of HM Customs &amp; Excise, is to
become president of the European Investment Bank at the beginning of April,
making him the first Briton to hold the position and the fifth president in
the bank's 35-year history.
His arrival comes at an intriguing time. The EIB, which last year lent more
than Ecu15bn - making it a bigger lender even than the World Bank, and the
biggest borrower on the international capital markets - has been handed a
central role in the EC growth package agreed at last month's Edinburgh
summit of Community leaders.
His 17 years at the UK Treasury up to 1985, including the agreement reached
at Fontainebleau on the UK budget contribution, would seem to make Sir Brian
better suited to restraining ambitious EC financing plans, rather than
promoting them. Speaking from his office in London yesterday, though, he
appeared an enthusiastic supporter of the Edinburgh agreement. The Ecu5bn of
extra financing over the next three years, and the establishment of a new
European Investment Fund, was a 'very significant package' which would
greatly advance the sort of infrastructure investment in which the EIB
specialises, he said.
Sir Brian points to extensive experience in EC-related negotiations to fend
off any suggestions that he is ill-suited to handling pressure from
politicians in Brussels. This includes leading the UK's negotiators on the
harmonisation of EC banking law in the mid-1970s, and serving as the senior
UK director on the EIB's board for three years in the mid-1980s. As chairman
of Customs &amp; Excise in the run up to the EC's single market, he has also had
to oversee what he calls 'a vast administrative upheaval'.

trees.
The London Borough of Newham has awarded Tarmac a Pounds 2m contract to
build the next phase of the East Ham town centre relief road, a half-mile
section between Harrow Road and Barking Road.
From Kent County Council comes a Pounds 1.6m contract to improve nearly a
mile of the South Thames Development Route, adjacent to the Dartford river
crossihg, upgrading the route from single to dual carriageway.
Operating from bases in Wolverhampton, Manchester and Newbury, Tarmac

FT  05 JAN 93 / Technology: Dethroning King Cotton - Courtaulds hopes an
unusual new fabric will take the fashion world by storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a widely held rule of innovation that companies should not venture
into new products and new customer markets simultaneously. Yet this seems to
be what Britain's second biggest chemicals company, Courtaulds, is doing
with its new fibre, Tencel.
The fibre has just been officially launched amid much fanfare - not
surprising considering that 14 years of development absorbed Pounds 45m and
the new production plant in Mobile, Alabama, cost another Pounds 55m.
Technologically, Tencel is related to viscose rayon, the material on which
Samuel Courtauld &amp; Co's fortunes were built in the early years of the
century. Both are based on wood pulp; only the manufacturing process
differs.
At the Tencel plant in Alabama, wood pulp is mixed with amine oxide until it
is dissolved. The solution is then filtered and extruded to form fine
filaments. These are washed, dried, crimped and cut to form staple fibres
for spinning.
The technique is called solvent spinning. Tencel is Courtaulds' brand name
for the fibre made by this process, and lyocell is a generic name fixed in
1989 for solvent-spun fibres by the Bureau International pour la
Standardisation de la Rayonne et des Fibres Synthetiques.
It was developed partly in anticipation of tighter pollution laws. Viscose
manufacturing is notoriously dirty, with sulphurous compounds often released
into the atmosphere or rivers. In solvent spinning, the solvent can be
removed during the washing process then purified and concentrated before
being re-used.
The technology is innovative enough, but the fibres produced have some
unique characteristics. Tencel garments can look as if they are made of
rough denim but have a heavy, velvety feel. To the touch, they are like
brushed cotton but with the floppiness of silk.
On top of its luxurious feel, Courtaulds' tests show it to be twice as
strong as cotton when dry and an even better performer when wet. This means
dyers, finishers, weavers and knitters can make a wide range of fabrics.
Selling to the luxury market is an unusual experience for Courtaulds. Not
since the company commercialised rayon in 1905 has it faced the problems of
making a new product and selling it to new customers.
Alan Jones, Tencel's international marketing manager, acknowledges he faces
a tough task. His proposed solution is simple: the technical strengths and
unusual properties of the material will sell it.
So far, the signs are promising. Well-known clothes designers such as the
UK's Zandra Rhodes and Anne Klein of the US have begun to use the material.
Their clothes have found buyers in the test market of Japan, in spite of
high prices. People have been prepared to spend more than Pounds 200 for a
denim-lookalike jacket or pair of jeans.
To keep the product exclusive, only a small number of designers have been
allocated cloth. Japan is still the only market where Tencel clothes are
widely available; the US and Europe should get their first garments in this
year's spring collections. In their turn, the fabric makers and clothes
designers have become part of Courtaulds' sales effort. 'We wanted to get
some interesting fabrics produced. They were in effect part of the
development process,' says Jones.
Yet Courtaulds' approach stands in contrast to the conservative way its
rival, ICI Fibres, promoted a new product called Tactel. Tactel fabrics are
made of very fine filaments of nylon. The surface can be treated to give it
a more natural feel, which means it can be used to make clothes for markets
that perceive nylon to be uncomfortable.
ICI launched the product in 1983 into an area with which it was familiar,
sportswear. It was not until 1989, when the technical capabilities of the
product were well understood, that it relaunched Tactel for the fashion
industry.
Tactel has been a success for ICI, now accounting for about 35 per cent of
the company's entire fibres output by value. The potential for Tencel is, if
anything, higher. It is in a position to take a slice out of the market for
King Cotton, which accounts for about half the world fibre consumption by
weight.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Technology: IT invasion of eastern Europe - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dilemma facing the east European states is an uncomfortable one. Beset
with problems over food supply, galloping inflation, rising unemployment and
the collapse of foreign currency earnings, they are struggling to enter the
world free market and compete on an equal footing with western nations.
However, to compete they must have internal infrastructures that allow them
some sort of parity with their trading partners. At present, these
infrastructures simply do not exist. The dilemma is evident: countries must
either invest large sums of precious foreign currency and update their
information technology systems to create fundamental necessities such as
efficient banking systems, or forego such expenditure and address their
chronic social problems. It is an unenviable decision.
The east European states really have no choice - they have to look to the
future and make funds available for IT to develop the infrastructures needed
to build a modern capitalist state. The experience of Germany in its drive
to make reunification work illustrates the problem perfectly.
How can companies in former East Germany hope to match their counterparts
from the west in terms of efficiency if they still rely, for example, on
antiquated billing methods for customers? Until this is changed, west German
business will continue to be leaner, more efficient and more profitable
because of its more advanced IT-based systems.
The argument for investment in effective IT is just as valid at the macro
level of the country as for businesses within it. To give an example:
without the effective collection of funds from taxation that IT systems
allow, public expenditure will be limited. If a state's revenue stream is
low, it will not be able to afford vital infrastructures such as road and
railway networks.
In short, it is precisely the application of appropriate technology
solutions that will help guarantee a stable economy and prosperous future
for central and eastern Europe. The new states have recognised this and are
now prepared to invest in IT infrastructure projects in the belief that they
will reap the benefits.
Understandably, the actual payment for the technology is a central issue for
all the east European countries. But it need not be as difficult as might
first appear. For instance, grants, particularly for government projects,
are relatively easy to secure from international bodies such as the
International Monetary Fund, World Bank and EC.
Clearly, the installation of hardware systems is not the end of the story.
It is also not simply a matter of dumping cheap or obsolete hardware - as
some have tried to do - on countries where IT skills are in relatively short
supply and where computer literacy, which the west now takes for granted, is
not highly advanced. Instead, a more strategic and consultative approach is
required.
Perhaps it is a simplistic analogy, but I often use a comparison with Rip
Van Winkle when discussing the east European states because they too have,
figuratively, been asleep for a number of years and are only now just waking
up. This dormancy and isolation has meant that, typically, they hold little
knowledge of modern IT. They know what they want it to do for them but do
not appreciate exactly how to achieve the results.
It is, therefore, the responsibility of western IT suppliers not only to
sell the solutions that will help create future prosperity, but also to give
comprehensive guidance on how these solutions can be used most effectively.
The reality is that without the introduction of IT, east European countries
will not be able to enter the world economy as equal partners. Using IT to
build an infrastructure capable of rebuilding economies shackled by decades
of state control will allow these countries to generate wealth and play a
competitive role in the world market.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Technology: Watching the shopper's every move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALLYSON STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tempting shoppers into a store is one thing. Persuading them to buy is
another, even in the busy winter shopping season. But working out the
proportion of people who spend money, and in which parts of the premises at
what times of the day, has been a task more subject to guesswork than
analysis.
Increasingly, however, big stores realise that monitoring in-store traffic
and customer service can pay dividends. This is especially true in the US,
where companies such as Burger King, Toys-R-Us and Walt Disney use a new
system which does just that.
Called ShopperTrak, its idea is to cut down long waits in check-out queues
and weary searches by customers for staff. Frustrated branch managers often
say they have little control over floor staffing, since weekly plans are
generally decided by head office.
The system was developed by Datatec Industries of the US, which also sells
it in Europe. It tracks people entering and leaving stores, where they go
when inside, and the average amount of time spent there. ShopperTrak even
distinguishes adults from children. It uses infra-red sensors above entrance
and exit doors, at the ends of aisles, and at other strategic points like
stairways. The sensors are linked to the retailers' tills or
electronic-point-of-sale systems.
By comparing till receipts with the number of employees on the floor and the
volume of shoppers at any time of the day, ShopperTrak enables managers to
adjust staffing plans according to demand. The idea is to increase purchases
per visit, encourage shoppers to return, and to lift 'conversion rates',
says Chris Carey, Datatec's president.
Conversion rates - the percentage of people entering stores who actually buy
something - differ according to the type of retailer. In the US, specialist
retailers such as fashion and sports outlets will typically have rates in
the low teens, says Carey. In out-of-town centres the rates rise to about 25
per cent. But mass merchandisers such as Woolworths have rates of between 50
and 80 per cent.
Carey observes that in the US, ShopperTrak data is used to improve customer
service (including staff training and behaviour). In recession-hit UK, it is
mainly a straightforward aid to sales, enabling stores to match staff
numbers and open tills to customers. Since conversion rates are lower in the
UK than in the US, retailers want to squeeze more sales from the large
numbers of people entering shops. After five weeks with ShopperTrak, a US
general retail outlet in a shopping centre can raise its conversion rate by
three percentage points to nearly 25 per cent, says Datatec.
'We're looking also at France and Sweden,' says Carey, who sees a growing
demand for such systems among retailers. Their prices range between Pounds
1,500 and Pounds 10,000 - depending on the number and width of entrances and
exits.
Though some high-profile retailers in the UK use ShopperTrak, many are not
aware of its strategic aspects. These include use of the information to
improve the quality and style of service through better training, and the
passing of more decision-making powers down to branch level. Stores can also
be designed more effectively based on the results of in-store promotions.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Ready for the new VAT
regime - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The removal of most border controls and customs checks has led to a radical
change in the way businesses must collect VAT data and trade statistics.
A handy guide* to the new VAT regime called 1993 - Are you Ready? has been
provided by accountants Price Waterhouse. It describes the information
companies will be required to file, explains the new terminology and
provides examples of new VAT registration number formats in the EC
countries.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 18 per cent of UK small businesses have capitalised on Britain's
departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the fall in sterling by
raising prices in foreign markets, according to a survey of 450 small
businesses carried out for Barclays Bank.
Thirty-nine per cent of the businesses had made no changes in their
marketing plans while 64 per cent had no strategy for managing exposure to
foreign exchange risk.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Surviving at home and
away - A look at the challenges posed by Europe in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year ahead promises to be a challenging one for the smaller business.
The creation of the single European market will present companies with
threats and opportunities in the international context while recovery from
the UK recession - if it comes - will pose problems at home.
A continuation of the recession will not be welcome but an upturn may be
scarcely less painful. If previous experience is anything to go by, failure
rates will increase as swelling order books put yet more strain on cash
flow. Small firms will be looking for a gentle upturn so that they can gear
themselves up gradually.
But it will be the long-awaited creation of the single European market that
will dominate thinking in the first few months of the year. Those business
owners and managers who took a decision to do nothing until the market was
in place will start to see whether this approach was the right one.
If they decide, after all, that the European market does offer attractive
openings they will need to develop or improve exporting skills.
They may need to contact the Department of Trade and Industry's export
department* or their local chamber of commerce to start researching European
markets. They should also consider taking part in exhibitions on the
European mainland or joining trade missions.
Managers may need to appoint agents or distributors in continental Europe or
start to cultivate links with potential joint-venture partners. Contacts can
be made through the European Commission's Business Co-operation Network,**
linking more than 600 business advisers throughout the EC, or the regular
regional partnership fairs known as Europartenariat.*
They will need to think seriously about acquiring language skills and
gaining familiarity with export procedures. These have been simplified but
still need to be understood. Owner-managers may have to check with the
experts whether their products are up to European safety norms and make sure
that their promotional material and users' manuals are available in the
appropriate European languages.
They will probably want to target one or two continental countries,
preferably those with which they are already familiar or for which
management and staff have basic language skills. There is no sense in
dispersing their export effort over too wide a front.
Even if management has decided that it does not (yet) need to start making
sales in Europe, it must be aware of the danger that continental European
rivals will start to make inroads into British markets. This may require the
UK company to improve quality, modify its products or adjust prices.
Managers need to be aware of the continuing stream of directives coming out
of Brussels. Businesses need to keep an eye on the Department of Trade and
Industry's Single Market guides, which provide a regularly updated overview,
as well as other government publications.
Businesses that already do a substantial volume of import or export business
within the community or that plan to expand their EC trade will need to take
account of the considerable changes in dealing with VAT and trade statistics
that took effect this month.
The removal of most border customs posts means that companies are now
directly responsible for compiling VAT data in a format acceptable to
Customs and Excise and for filing trading information.
Customs have said they will be lenient in the first few months but it is in
companies' own interests to make sure their systems are operating
efficiently.
Regardless of how their continental rivals react to the single market,
British companies will have to adjust over the next few months to the impact
of sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. As sale and
purchase contracts come up for renegotiation, UK businesses will need to
adapt their costings and prices to take account of sterling's fall against
several European currencies. This may be the time to rethink decisions on
whether to price goods in sterling or the local currency.
On the domestic front, British companies will be looking closely for signs
of an increase in consumer confidence and an upturn in demand. This will be
welcome when it comes but is already prompting fears about the ability of
businesses to raise finance for growth.
The banks have become so restrictive in their lending policies over the past
12 months that many companies fear they will not make the funds available
for growth. There are also concerns that the banks will use an upturn as a
reason to call in their security on some problem loans.
The venture capital industry is going through a period of retrenchment and
has anyway retreated from the financing of early stage businesses so there
will be little relief from that source. Equity capital may be an option for
some businesses however and small firms may need to review their dependence
on overdraft finance.
The next year will require businesses to maintain the defensive strategies
they have had to adopt over the past two to three years. This means a close
eye on credit control procedures, checking the credit-worthiness of new
customers and regularly reviewing the status of existing ones.
Businesses must continue to make sure that invoices are settled promptly and
be prepared to chase customers who delay payments. This depends on financial
reporting systems within the company being able to provide timely and
accurate information.
Tight controls must be maintained on cash flow and stock levels should be
closely monitored. Despite, or because of, concerns about the willingness of
the banks to finance the upturn, businesses must maintain good relations
with their bank manager.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Czechs and balances - Two
views prevail on the role of chambers of commerce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should chambers of commerce be voluntary organisations - as they are in the
UK - or should they be official bodies with compulsory membership of the
entire business community?
As the chambers in eastern Europe slough off their communist past they are
faced with a choice between the British and the continental European models.
Their decisions could have an important impact on the effectiveness of the
small business sector, which will play a crucial part in the regeneration of
their economies. In the former Czechoslovakia, ironically, the business
community is now pressing for compulsory membership of a proposed new
Economic Chamber while the government is keen on a voluntary body.
The row reflects the growing importance of the private sector in the economy
and its outcome is likely to influence its role in the continued drive to a
market economy.
The chamber is designed to replace the old Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, which has existed in one form or another for 150 years.
Legislation designed to transform it into a new, modern body based on the
German model was passed by the federal parliament last May. It stipulated
compulsory membership for businesses, an elected governing body and a
federal structure with 17 regional divisions.
Since the elections last June which led to the break-up of Czechoslovakia,
the Czech Republic government, led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, has
reviewed the legislation and is now seeking to pass an amendment allowing
for voluntary membership.
From the chamber's point of view, this fundamental change in its
constitution means abandoning the German model, whose central feature is
compulsory membership, in favour of the British system, where membership is
voluntary.
Antonin Smid, the chamber's executive director, points out that only
compulsory membership with different rates of entry fees, depending on the
size and efficiency of the business, could give the new chamber the
financial resources needed to provide the private sector with the support
and influence it needs.
Czechoslovakia's entrepreneurs have been lobbying unofficially to ensure
that compulsory membership is retained. Jan Mazacek, general secretary of
the Association of Czech Entrepreneurs, insists it is essential to police
the private sector, which currently operates in an almost completely
unregulated environment.
He says the amendment is dictated by the government's fear of the power
which would be wielded by a body representing the entire business community,
from the largest industrial group to the most humble sole trader.
Both the chamber and the association estimate that there are 1m potential
members, which would give it significant negotiating power with the
government.
The association, which has 150,000 members, is the largest of several such
organisations. It is a signatory to the social contract drawn up among
unions, employers and the federal government as part of the transition to a
market economy. 'The point of the dispute is that the new government
realised our potential strength and is afraid of it,' Mazacek says.
The government wants entrepreneurs to decide for themselves whether they
wish to incur the costs of joining the Economic Chamber. Mazacek believes a
compromise can be agreed, allowing compulsory membership for a period of
three to five years.
'That would enable us to achieve a smooth transition to the market and see
the private sector firmly established,' he says. 'Maybe then we could revert
to voluntary membership but that is as far as we will go.'

FT  05 JAN 93 / Profit by power to the middle manager: How companies are
enhancing the functions of supervisors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Sharon Roy, a supervisor at Buckingham Foods, where 1m snacks pour off
the production lines every year, used to think of herself as a line leader
who made sandwiches. 'I never thought about profit,' she says.
She does now, and enjoys her job a lot more. In management jargon, she has
been 'empowered', which means she is no longer an overseer but rather plays
an active role in managing both the shop floor and the production process.
Identified by many think tanks as one of the weak links in British industry,
supervisory training - or the lack of it - has been an important management
issue in the past year.
Mrs Roy's experience is an example of what can happen in a reasonably
enlightened company.
'I'd describe myself as a middle manager,' she says. 'I make my own
decisions about how I achieve the production targets and I am responsible
for quality control. Before, I used to come in and pick up a sheet which
said how many sandwiches we had to produce and what variety.
'I had no influence on the number of staff required on a line, any input
into how long processes should take, or any direct control over the
machinery. Things have changed. If the line breaks down now, I don't just
report it to my superior, like I used to do. Rather, I have the authority to
get hold of the engineer to get the work done. I have production targets and
I want to meet them.'
Her change in status is reflected in the fact that she and the other 17
supervisors in a plant employing about 500 full-time workers have moved to
monthly salaries, which incorporate overtime.
She attends regular off-the-job training sessions. Mr Tony Prichard, the
factory manager, says: 'These not only enhance individuals' skills but send
very clear signals to the workforce that supervisors are important.'
Buckingham, a subsidiary of Booker, the food group, operates in a highly
labour-intensive business. It realised that supervisors were a key group of
workers whose role had to be addressed if other shop-floor reforms -
including more up-to-date information systems - were to succeed.
It is an insight that a comparatively small, but growing, number of British
companies is coming to share, including British Rail, BP Oil, Dunlop, Fisons
and foreign-owned companies including Nissan, the carmaker.
A measure of how fast they are putting their perceptions into practice was
provided last year with the publication by the Management Charter
Initiative, a government-backed body that seeks to improve management
training, of national standards to assess and improve the quality of
supervisors.
The standards, linked to the new national vocational qualifications -
attainment of which the government hopes will raise skill levels in the UK -
cover four main management areas: finance, information, people and
operations.
Not all standards are applicable to all supervisors because of the diversity
of roles they play in different industries.
Inadequate supervisory skills have been part of the productivity problem of
British industry for many years. Supervisors, like much of the workforce,
have suffered from a lack of adequate training.
The UK's 1.2m supervisors are a disparate group - ranging from line leaders
in a Belfast missile factory to British Rail station managers. Few
organisations have had a clear idea of what supervisors do, let alone what
they should do.
In many traditional UK companies they have been neither members of
management nor part of the workforce - 'piggy-in-the-middle' is how they can
best be described.
That came about in an ad hoc manner - traditional supervisory activities
such as production scheduling, quality control and employee training were
withdrawn from supervisors under the influence of 'scientific' management.
That required all jobs to be broken down into their simplest elements, with
each worker performing only one set of actions.
In recent years the 'human relations' school of management has emphasised
the importance of the supervisor in motivating the work group. But the rise
of the specialist personnel department also resulted in a reduced role for
the supervisor in recruitment and industrial relations.
The increasing sophistication of manufacturing also reduced the supervisor's
technical discretion. The result, says a recent report from the National
Economic Development Council, has been that the 'resulting supervisory
function has been a residual one'.
Yet supervisors have stubbornly maintained their presence on shop floors, in
spite of moves in some companies to abolish the role, as at Birds Eye, the
food company.
However, organisations such the Confederation of British Industry argue that
if Britain is to undergo a skills rev-olution, the supervisor needs to take
the centre stage.
A recent CBI report spelt out the task: 'The potential among middle managers
and supervisors exists but is not being harnessed. It is a resource which is
currently being ignored, under-utilised and demotivated. We need trained,
skilled supervisors whose role is clear, whose contribution is valued and
whose motivation is assured.'
The CBI draws on a study of engineering and textile plants in Britain,
France and Germany between 1988 and 1990 to press home its message.
The study, by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, found
significant differences between Britain, France and Germany in the range of
functions undertaken by supervisors.
In Germany, line supervisors were aware of their section's production costs
and received production schedules well in advance for forward planning.
In Britain, supervisors frequently faced 'crisis management', chasing
supplies, rescheduling because of breakdowns and training new staff because
of high turnover.
French supervisors were also under strain because of anxieties that their
craft training was inadequate to cope with production demands influenced by
new technology.
Only in Germany did a large pool of skilled workers created by the
apprenticeship system ensure that almost all supervisors were qualified at
least to craft level and above.
Research from the former National Economic Development Council reinforces
that view. The proportion of German supervisors working in manufacturing
industries with qualifications in 1991 was nearly double that of the UK.
That was reflected in pay - with a much greater pay differential between
craft workers and supervisors in Germany.
Many of the issues thrown up by comparative work on supervisors is relevant
to the wider training field.
UK employers, are for example, not yet convinced of the need to enhance pay
in recognition of the acquisition of skills, or that training pays.
Companies such as Nissan, which pays its supervisors salary levels equal to
those of professional engineers and other equivalent positions, are rare.
Buckingham Foods, which is comparatively fresh to the world of training, is
becoming a convert. It says improvements at its plant - identified and
implemented with the help of Peter Chadwick, the management consultants -
have generated savings of about Pounds 800,000 in the past year.
Mr Peter Halman, managing director, says changes to the supervisory roles
were not the only ingredients of the improvement to the bottom line, but
they were significant.
Buckingham spent Pounds 35,000 on off-the-job training in the past year.
That compares with nothing four years ago, and Mr Halman believes the amount
will continue to increase.
As in much of British industry, the approach is softly, softly. Mr Halman
has not offered his supervisors the new supervisory qualifications. Indeed,
he had not heard of them. 'That may be for the future,' he says.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Cork Gully issues Harry Neal writ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORK GULLY, the receiver of the Harry Neal building group, has issued a High
Court writ against the company's directors concerning a property deal nearly
six years ago.
The writ, which has not yet been served, concerns the company's sale of two
buildings to Berrington Developments, a company partly owned by Mr Harry
Neal, chairman of the building company.
Cork Gully believes Mr Neal's involvement in Berrington was undisclosed. It
says that was a breach of fiduciary duties by Mr Neal and seven other
ex-directors of Harry Neal, who should pay damages for negligence or breach
of contract. It said that the writ, which names all of Harry Neal's former
directors, was drafted to cover all possibilities.
When Harry Neal went into receivership in November 1990, it was owed Pounds
6m by Churchill Securities, Berrington's parent company, relating to
deferred payments for the properties and their refurbishment.
Cork Gully, which has not yet investigated the valuations of the buildings,
has not alleged that the sale was made at an incorrect price.
The writ was described as a protective writ, since it reserves Cork Gully's
right to bring proceedings six years after the transactions took place,
which is the normal time limit for legal action.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAFT guidelines for tighter planning controls on gravel extraction and rock
quarrying in England and Wales were published by the government yesterday.
The Department of the Environment hopes that the guidelines will encourage
the construction industry to open new sources of supply - such as coastal
'superquarries', accessible only from the sea, such as that at Glensanda on
the west coast of Scotland.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England said the guidelines failed
to address the fundamental issue of the environmental damage caused by
mineral extraction.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Motive sought for 'contract' murder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE investigating the killing of Mr Donald Urquhart, a London property
consultant, were still searching for a motive yesterday, Richard Donkin
writes.
Detectives were making inquiries in the Marylebone area of London's West End
where Mr Urquhart, 55, was shot on Saturday night by a man who escaped on a
motorcycle. Police are convinced that the shooting was the work of a
professional killer.
The businessman had property dealings through a company called Bellgap and
was part-owner of the Elstree Golf Club at Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.
Police are examining files stored in Mr Urquhart's car, a stretched Rover
827, which he used as a mobile office. Scotland Yard said: 'There is no
evidence to suggest he was involved in anything illegal.'

FT  05 JAN 93 / Land Rover lifts production 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAND ROVER, the four-wheel-drive vehicles subsidiary of Rover Group,
increased its production by nearly 5 per cent last year to 57,316 - the
highest level since 1979 - in spite of one of the worstdeclines on record in
the UK car market.
The increased output reflected the Birmingham-based group's continuing high
export content.
More than 70 per cent of vehicles were exported to about 100 markets
worldwide.
The increase was due entirely to the Discovery model launched by Land Rover
in 1990.
Its output jumped by 26.4 per cent last year to 24,347.
Production of the more luxurious Range Rover and the utility Land Rover
models each fell by about 6 per cent.
The company, which refused yesterday to forecast likely sales or production
for the current year, had to step up production twice in the second half of
last year and resort to Saturday working to meet demand for the Discovery.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Graduate commitment 'weak'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRADUATE recruits are more likely to quit their jobs if they think their
colleagues are incompetent, delegates at the annual conference of the
occupational psychology section of the British Psychological Society in
Brighton were told yesterday.
Researchers at Manchester School of Management surveyed 580 graduates in
their first four years of work in eight different organisations, returning a
year later to study the same sample.
The study tested the effect of a range of different work experiences on
graduates' intentions to leave and their commitment to their new employers.
It found that most graduates, while not actively thinking of leaving, have
only a 'lukewarm' commitment to their companies. A total of 50 graduates,
including 24 from one company, left their jobs over the year.
Graduates generally have good relationships with their colleagues, but
'encounters with unproductive and ineffective people in the organisation . .
. did tend to predict high intention to leave'.
Pay is less important than uncertainty about career paths and limited
opportunities for developing skills in prompting a graduate trainee to
leave.
Most graduates are satisfied with their opportunities for skill development,
but feel they lack clear information about career paths.
The project's director, Dr John Arnold, said graduates might be asking the
impossible: 'In the current times of change, job titles appear and disappear
with amazing rapidity - even their bosses don't know where they are going to
be in two years' time.'
Graduates usually enjoy a year-long 'honeymoon' in their posts, Dr Arnold
said.
Responsibility, working on prestige projects, relationships with senior
staff, feedback and the success of the company have a limited impact on
graduates' decisions to leave their jobs.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Prison Jobclubs suffer dual burden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR ORGANISATION and lack of resources are hampering prison Jobclubs,
according to a study by the Department of Employment.
Even so, they are achieving results comparable with mainstream Jobclubs, the
study by the occupational psychology branch of the Employment Service
concludes. The study focused on two prison Jobclubs, which aim to help
offenders find work during the final weeks of their sentences.
The study cites as difficulties factors including lack of telephones and
inadequate communication between the Employment Service, the Prison Service
and agencies that run Jobclubs.
Ms Jo Rick, research director, said yesterday: 'With a new project of this
nature, there are bound to be a lot of teething troubles, but this research
has shown us how we can develop the programme to run more effectively in
future.'

FT  05 JAN 93 / MMC chairman to head inquiry into ITV network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, is
to head the investigation into ITV networking arrangements.
The commission's investigation has been requested by both the Independent
Television Commission, the commercial broadcasting regulatory body, and by
the ITV Association, the industry trade body.
They are appealing against a finding by the Office of Fair Trading that
ITV's networking arrangements were anti-competitive and unfair to
independent producers.
The referrals are the first to go to the monopolies commission under the
1990 Broadcasting Act. The investigation, the outcome of which is binding,
is expected to take three months.
The OFT, which has a responsibility under the act to ensure that the
arrangements for the national networking of ITV programmes are fair,
demanded two important changes in the proposed arrangements.
ITV wanted to be able to buy the UK rights to an independent production for
up to 10 years, with a further option for five years. The OFT decided the
maximum should be five years with an option for two years. It also ruled
that independent producers should have the option of being contracted
directly by the ITV network centre rather than having to work with a
sponsoring ITV company.
Independent producers welcomed the OFT report, which was published last
month, but ITV expressed outrage.
The Independent Television Commission is principally concerned about how it
could enforce compliance with broadcasting rules and regulations under the
OFT regime. The 1990 act makes the individual ITV companies, rather than the
television commission, responsible for what is broadcast. If an ITV company
errs, the television commission can fine it, or as a last resort remove its
licence.
The television commission is asking what would happen if an independent
producer contracted with the network centre were responsible for a breach of
the rules. The television commission has no direct power over the network
centre.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CINEMAS generated revenues of more than Pounds 340m last year, according to
a study of the industry, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The figure compares with Pounds 349m last year - but in spite of the small
fall in turnover, profits are rising rapidly, the report by Dodona, a market
research company specialising in the media, says.
Total pre-tax profits are estimated to have increased from Pounds 9m a year
to Pounds 25m between 1990 and 1991.
'Figures for 1992 and subsequent years are forecast to show further
improvements in profitably,' Dodona says.
The main reason is less pressure on profit-and-loss accounts now that the
peak of building multi-screen cinemas seems to be over.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Loyalist paramilitaries reject SDLP talks offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOYALIST paramilitaries in Northern Ireland last night rejected an offer of
talks with nationalists amid fears of an escalating murder campaign against
Roman Catholics.
The banned Ulster Freedom Fighters, one of the Protestant groups involved in
a wave of sectarian shootings, said it was not prepared to sit down with Mr
Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the predominantly Catholic SDLP and MP
for Newry and Armagh.
Mr Mallon had challenged loyalist gunmen to meet him after the Ulster
Volunteer Force claimed responsibility for the first serious terrorist
attack of 1993 - the murders of a Catholic father and son near Dungannon, Co
Tyrone.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday: 'We will
bring quite impartially the full force of the law - the army supporting the
RUC - against people of whatever persuasion who use violence for political
ends.'
He rejected holding any negotiations with those who used violence for
political ends. 'If violence is abandoned, disavowed, forsworn, set behind
them by the IRA, and they give us sufficient time to see that that is for
real, and that they mean it, then people will talk to them,' he told BBC
Radio 4's Today programme.
He said he believed a debate was under way in the IRA and its political wing
Sinn Fein and many realised they could not win through violence.
Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein and a former MP, said that if Sir
Patrick was serious about peace he should initiate a dialogue.
'The Sinn Fein view is quite clear,' he said on BBC Radio 4's The World at
One programme. 'There should be a demilitarisation of the situation.' He
added: 'Mayhew has to start peace talks. It is as simple as that.'

FT  05 JAN 93 / Fujitsu expands plant with Pounds 35m investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, the Japanese electronics group, is gearing up for a big increase in
production at its sole European microchip manufacturing plant at Newton
Aycliffe, Co Durham.
Process and test equipment worth Pounds 35m, which marks the only new
investment worldwide this financial year by Fujitsu's electronic devices
division, has been installed in the plant's 'clean room' production area
with the objective of more than doubling its output by April.
Throughout the Christmas and new year holiday shutdown, a team of 50
engineers and technicians commissioned the equipment ready for a swift
increase in production of 4-megabit D-ram (dynamic random access memory)
chips in time for all 450 employees who resumed work yesterday.
Fujitsu, the world's second-biggest computer company and sixth-biggest
semiconductor producer, cut its capital spending last year and reported a
net after-tax loss of Y19.2bn (Pounds 102m) for the half year to September,
its first net loss.
In spite of a decline in the world computer and semiconductor markets, it is
continuing investment in Newton Aycliffe. The site, where the company has
spent Pounds 230m since the project was announced in 1989, has a strategic
role for Fujitsu in penetrating the European market, since its output is not
subject to import tariffs.
It is also at the forefront of Fujitsu's technical advances. Investment in
excess of this year's Pounds 35m has already been allocated for the plant
for 1993-94 to allow it to start production of 16-megabit D-ram chips, the
next generation of memory technology after 4-megabit chips. Fujitsu says it
is the world's most advanced volume microchip plant.
Mr Shiro Fujimoto, Newton Aycliffe-based managing director of Fujitsu
Microelectronics, said: 'Investment here is going faster than in Japan. In
Europe many customers require our products. It is a very important factory
with the newest technology.'
Fujitsu expects to raise production at Newton Aycliffe from the current
500,000 chips a month to 1.2m by April. Mr Llew Aviss, personnel director,
said: 'They're anxious to see we meet our production goals but very
supportive. We're quite bullish about it.'
The project was expected to cost Pounds 400m and employ 1,500 people by the
end of 1994. The payroll, 36 of them Japanese, includes 150 technicians and
engineers and is expected to reach 500 by the end of this year. The company
says the pace of technological change means it is unlikely to employ 1,500
for another 10 years, but investment may be greater.
'The number was Pounds 400m plus,' says Mr Aviss. 'It's going to be a hell
of a plus.'

MR Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday claimed that the Bank of
England's intervention to defend sterling on 'Black Wednesday' may have cost
the Treasury up to Pounds 1.7bn, Ivo Dawnay writes.
He demanded an independent inquiry into the events of September 16 when the
UK left the exchange rate mechanism. He said independent advisers had
calculated the figures based on interventions totalling Pounds 11bn to
Pounds 14bn.
Mr Brown released the figures to coincide with the three-month deadline for
the UK to repay the German authorities for their interventions in defence of
sterling.
He said: 'The extent of the loss could be as much as the whole budget for
trade and industry this financial year.'

FT  05 JAN 93 / Labour attacked on Clinton focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR's leadership receives a fresh challenge today when Mr John Prescott
renews his criticism of its fascination with US president-elect Bill
Clinton's victory.
As the leading shadow cabinet sceptic, Mr Prescott will use an appearance on
the BBC's Kilroy programme to warn against politicians' decisions being
driven by public opinion, the views of image makers or the findings of
polls.
Meanwhile, advocates of a fundamental change of identity for Labour are
preparing to press their case with the publication of an article, entitled
Lessons from America, drawing strongly on the Clinton campaign's
achievements.
The paper, by Mr Philip Gould and Ms Patricia Hewitt - close aides to Mr
Neil Kinnock in Labour's 1992 election team - is published in the first
edition of Renewal, a new constituency activists' magazine from the Labour
Co-ordinating Committee.
It argues that the party must refocus its appeal by creating new populist
politics, aimed at the majority, not minorities, and one that abandons
'stereotyped political language.'
Last night, Mr Prescott reiterated his claim that the so-called
'Clintonisation' of Labour is becoming a crucial struggle for the future of
the party. In a foretaste of his broadcast, Labour's transport spokesman
said the growing debate over how much should be learnt from the US election
vindicated his decision last month to counsel the party publicly against
modelling itself on the new Democrats.
'What people saw as a bit of sour grapes from me is clearly more substantial
than that,' he said. 'It is a matter of the heart and soul of the Labour
party.'
Mr Prescott used his campaign last summer for the deputy leadership to
champion Labour's traditional working-class values.
He attacked what he saw as an election strategy driven more by glitter and
show business techniques than policy in speeches clearly aimed at the
metropolitan middle class, personified by Mr Gould and Ms Hewitt.
He also vigorously defended Labour's trade union links, winning widespread
popularity in the party's blue-collar grass roots, becoming for many the de
facto leader of those who resisted the root-and-branch changes demanded by
so-called modernisers.
Mr Prescott insisted last night that he was ready to hear the conclusions
members of the Clinton team had drawn from their victory.
He went on, though, to counsel against allowing pollsters to act as the new
'high priests' of politics, saying such a development would consign the
politicians themselves to becoming mere actors. Evidence of the growing
intensity of Labour's debate over Mr Clinton's election campaign is abundant
this week. After a visit of Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader,
before Christmas, Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, and Mr Gordon
Brown, the shadow chancellor, are both in Washington this week, making
contact with the incoming US administration.
On Friday, two leading Clinton campaign strategists - Mr Stan Greenberg, a
policy director, and Mr Bob Boorstein, deputy communications director - will
address a private meeting of the leader's committee - Mr John Smith's top
advisory group on party strategy.
The two men are due at the weekend to discuss the president-elect's economic
plans at a London conference sponsored by the Transport and General Workers'
Union and expected to draw many senior Labour figures.
The moderniser faction in the Labour leadership, widely considered a
majority in the shadow cabinet, appear increasingly convinced that the party
must draw strongly on the Democrats' experience in 1992.
A senior official said last night that, while that need not influence
policy, the Clinton victory carried important lessons about how to project a
programme that will appeal to the widest possible constituency among
electors.

FT  05 JAN 93 / More fathers given time off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies offering men paid time off from work when their
wives or partners have babies has increased dramatically in the past five
years, according to the Confederation of British Industry.
In 1987, only about 32 per cent of companies surveyed by the CBI gave
paternity leave on either a contractual or a discretionary basis. By last
year, that had risen to 76 per cent.
Most companies give two or three days for paternity leave, with a small
minority giving new fathers one or two weeks off.
By last year, 36 per cent of companies surveyed by the CBI were giving
paternity leave by contract, with a further 40 per cent giving it on a
discretionary basis.
The CBI says the service sector is much more likely to offer paternity leave
than manufacturers, with about 60 per cent of service companies offering it
on a contractual basis compared with 27 per cent of manufacturers.
According to Mr Steve Palmer, the CBI's deputy director of employment
affairs, the increase is partly explained by the increased interest that
employers and unions have been showing in non-wage issues as wage increases
have been squeezed during the recession.
The granting of paternity leave had also became a trend among more
progressive employers at the end of the 1980s.
The survey of time off also finds that companies are still more likely to
offer paid leave for military training, mainly for the Territorial Army,
than for paternity leave. The most common reason for discretionary time off
is bereavement, with 81 per cent of manufacturing companies offering two,
three or five days leave.
Although the service sector is usually more generous with discretionary
leave, the manufacturing sector does better with standard holidays. The CBI
estimates that half of all employees in manufacturing now get 25 days or
more a year compared with only 20 per cent in the service sector.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Former Maxwell paper lifts sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN newspaper is about to enter its second year of non-Maxwell
ownership with sales of about 200,000.
The international newspaper, which many expected would not long survive the
death of its founder and patron Robert Maxwell, was relaunched under the
ownership of the brothers Mr David and Mr Frederick Barclay on January 6
last year.
'We have increased sales week after week since,' said Mr Charles Garside,
editor of the weekly, which was losing about Pounds 1m a month under
Maxwell.
The newspaper's period of crisis after Maxwell's death severely affected its
complex distribution system, and Mr Garside believes the paper has come from
80,000 to about 200,000 in the year, although official sales figures are not
available.
In May the paper was able to bring back Elan, its suspended third section,
and resume promotion.
The main growth in sales has come from France, Germany and Spain.
Sales in the UK account for about a third of the total, although that
proportion is declining.
Mr Garside would not disclose details of the newspaper's financial
performance but said that all newspapers take about four years to break into
profit. The European is now 2 1/2 years old.

FT  05 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Plan for free trade zone irks Israelis -
Bureaucrats scorn proposal by American-Jewish businessmen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE American-Jewish community has long been an economic and political
lifeline for Israel, but beneath the surface there have been tensions.
A proposal by a group of Jewish businessmen in the US that Israel establish
a free export processing zone (FEPZ) has now brought the tensions into the
open.
The battle pits backers of the Israel Export Corporation, set up to
establish an FEPZ, against an array of senior officials in Israel's key
economic ministries. In the middle are Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, and
Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, who have yet to decide whether to give
the scheme the go-ahead.
The FEPZ proposal appears an almost irresistible lure to a government
anxious to reverse negative net foreign investment and to cut unemployment
of more than 11 per cent.
The Israel Export Corporation's shareholders include Mr Sy Syms of Syms
Corp, a US clothing manufacturer, brothers Robert and Alan Tishman, both in
property, and Mr Jay Pomrenze of Bankers Trust in New York. Mr David
Yerushalmi, chief executive of Israel Export Corporation, says 14 potential
investors who met Mr Rabin last month pledged to create 36,000 jobs and
inject more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) into an FEPZ.
The government is being asked to establish a privately run free-trade zone
outside Israel's customs territory, foreign exchange controls and
bureaucracy. Apart from national security and environmental legislation, the
zone would be excluded from labour and trade union agreements.
There would be a 25-year tax holiday, but companies operating in the FEPZ
would have no access to Israel's industrial aid and tax incentives.
Israeli bureaucrats, however, are far from impressed. A report by a
committee set up by Mr Shochat to study the proposal, headed by Mr Yoram
Gabbai, head of the state revenue department, delivered an unequivocal
rejection. It saw 'legal and economic anarchy' and 'unbearable
discrimination' if the FEPZ legislation was enacted.
It said evidence of such zones' success in countries like South Korea and
Taiwan did not apply to a developed, high-wage economy such as Israel's. It
was worried about loss of tax revenue and possible breaches of Israel's free
trade agreements with the US and EC.
The report also doubted that investment would materialise.

CAPARO Industries of the UK has teamed with the state government of Orissa
to set up a 3m-tonne integrated steel plant at Duburi in Orissa. Mr
Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, will lay the foundation stone in
March.
The project is to be implemented in two or three phases, with the first
phase capacity fixed at 1m tonnes. Implementation of the first phase will
require an investment of about Rs50bn (Pounds 1.13bn), including a foreign
exchange component of at least Rs20bn.
Caparo plans to invest Rs2bn in the equity of Kalinga Steel and the Orissa
government Rs1bn. In the first phase, Kalinga will produce hot rolled coils.
While the plant will use imported coking coal, its requirement of iron ore
will be met by the state-owned mines at Daitari in Orissa. Steel will be
produced through the blast furnace route.
Kalinga Steel, according to Caparo chairman Mr Swraj Paul, will have to
export up to 20 per cent of production to pay for the import of coking coal.
Mr Biju Patnaik, chief minister of Orissa, who recently visited Germany to
meet the suppliers of technology and machinery and equipment, said on his
return: 'If everything goes well from now on, then the project work at
Duburi should start by early March. The gestation period of the first phase
of Kalinga Steel, according to Mr Paul, will be 3 1/2 years.
Indian companies are planning to more than triple the country's alumina
output to exploit large bauxite reserves in the eastern state of Orissa,
Reuter reports from Bombay.
At least three big export-oriented projects, all involving some form of
foreign collaboration or joint venture, are planned to produce 2.9m tonnes
of alumina a year eventually. Their total cost is estimated at Dollars 2.2bn
(Pounds 1.44bn).
'Orissa will be a major alumina producer by the turn of the century,' said
Mr GV Kasargod, general manager for planning and development with
engineering company Larsen &amp; Toubro.
The projects, expected to start production from 1997, will triple India's
output of alumina - or aluminium oxide, used to make aluminium  - from the
present level of 1.3m tonnes to at least 4.2m, industry sources said.

FT  05 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Import curbs may threaten EC harmony -
Single Market Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first six months of the new single European market could be marred by
legal disputes over national import restrictions, which are still in place
in many EC countries despite the lifting of internal barriers on January 1,
writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
EC foreign ministers have still not agreed whether to abolish or harmonise
national quotas on textiles, toys, footwear and a variety of goods from
'state trading countries' - China, North Korea and Vietnam. The European
Commission has also failed to devise a temporary solution to national
quotas.
In practice, importers say this could lead to a ban on the import of such
goods, as 1992 import licences have expired. Some are preparing to take
legal action against the Commission if trade is disrupted.
Meanwhile, Britain, France and Italy have asked to maintain controls on
imports of bananas from Latin America. Under a special clause of the EC
treaty, member states can request Brussels to allow them to keep or reimpose
controls to prevent 'economic difficulties' caused, for example, by cheap
imports across internal borders.
Commission officials said yesterday they were unsure how such restrictions
would be applied in the absence of internal controls on goods.
Bananas are still subject to different import regimes across the EC, as a
deal to harmonise the system will not become effective until the middle of
this year. Until then the three countries, which have treaty commitments to
Caribbean and African producers, fear a flood of cheaper Latin American
bananas imported illegally from Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries.
No member state has yet asked to maintain quotas on imports from state
trading countries. But some importers are already preparing to switch
imports to the most liberal EC countries.
For example, Reebok and Nike, the sports shoe manufacturers, may try to
import their Chinese-made training shoes through Ireland or Greece, the only
EC countries without quotas for Chinese footwear, if they find that other
member states are applying their restrictions.
The companies are also ready to claim damages from the Commission if
products are blocked at external frontiers.
The question of what to do about outstanding national quotas is linked to
controversial Commission proposals to streamline the procedure for imposing
anti-dumping duties on non-EC imports. This will be one of the first issues
which Sir Leon Brittan will consider when he takes over as EC trade
commissioner tomorrow.

FT  05 JAN 93 / World Trade News: South Carolina offers glimpse of Clinton
way - Investment attracted by a trained workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE modern office buildings and factories that dot the green landscape of
western South Carolina, once an agricultural backwater, are all the more
remarkable once the names of the companies come into view: Michelin, Robert
Bosch, Bayer, Rhone-Poulenc, Siemens, Unilever.
The latest foreign entrant to this unlikely international neighbourhood in
America's South is BMW, the German car maker, which recently began
construction of a Dollars 300m assembly plant in the Greenville-Spartanburg
area.
Greenville and Spartanburg, two small but plucky cities, have lured hundreds
of millions of dollars in investment from foreign companies over the last
five years. Together they have attracted more foreign investment per capita
than any equivalent area in the US.
Spartanburg alone has more than 80 foreign companies, half of them German.
In South Carolina overall, Germany has a 30 per cent share of the state's
cumulative foreign investment total of Dollars 9.3bn. Japan accounts for
16.9 per cent, Britain and France about 14 per cent each and Switzerland
11.4 per cent.
A survey of foreign companies in the state by the financial consultants KPMG
Peat Marwick says: 'Over the last five years, South Carolina has
consistently been a leader in attracting foreign investment, with the annual
growth in the number of foreign-owned companies establishing headquarters in
South Carolina ranging from 9 to 12 per cent.'
With keen competition among US states for foreign investment - in particular
for plants that create new jobs - South Carolina has composed a seductive
package of attractions, say executives of foreign manufacturing groups.
While low corporate income tax, excellent transportation and competitive
business costs are part of the package, the state's biggest enticement is
its labour.
Not only is it plentiful, largely ununionised and relatively cheap, as is
the case throughout the south-east, but South Carolina offers an innovative
scheme to custom-train an investor's workforce.
Through a network of 16 technical colleges, the state will recruit and train
employees at little or no cost to meet the specific needs of incoming or
expanding companies.
Although the state's overall educational achievements rank poorly within the
US, its technical training programme is considered one of America's more
far-sighted. The scheme is also in tune with the incoming Clinton
administration's thinking, underlined by the choice of former South Carolina
governor Mr Dick Riley as education secretary.
Germany's Robert Bosch, which has two automotive parts manufacturing plants
and a total of Dollars 348m worth of investment in South Carolina, says a
key reason it chose the state was the government's worker training
programme. It has even set up a German-style apprenticeship programme in
conjunction with some of the local technical colleges.
Lucas Industries of the UK, another automotive parts manufacturer, settled
on South Carolina largely for the same reason. At first, it invested for
just an engineering test facility, but has expanded to a manufacturing plant
employing more than 300. It already supplies fuel injectors for BMW in
Germany and hopes to earn business from the car maker's new plant nearby.
The state's success in attracting foreign business is getting attention in
economic development circles, especially since BMW's announcement. And while
South Carolina was relatively hard hit by the US recession during the last
two years, economists say it is poised to recover well, not least because of
BMW and the supplier network it is expected to spawn.
The level of job creation by foreign companies has helped steady the local
economy and has kept the state's unemployment rate running well behind the
national average. At the end of 1991, 73,000 people were employed by foreign
companies, responsible for more than 20 per cent of all new jobs in South
Carolina from 1987.
Moreover, the average annual wage for these new jobs was nearly Dollars
4,000 higher than the average state wage of Dollars 19,600.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Tokyo to relax tax rules for foreign importers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government is almost certain to approve a change in tax
regulations to provide increased incentives for foreign manufacturers
exporting to Japan.
After negotiations with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
(Miti), the Ministry of Finance has agreed to relax controls on a
controversial tax-break system introduced in 1990 to increase manufactured
imports and reduce Japan's trade surplus.
Under the present system, foreign manufacturers' distribution subsidiaries
in Japan are classified for tax purposes as 'non-manufacturers,' as they are
considered to be trading houses rather than producers.
This denies them tax credits on imports.
The EC and US lodged complaints about this classification system, which has
allowed Honda Motor and other Japanese manufacturers to claim the tax
credits, but has excluded European car and electronics makers which do not
have factories in Japan.
It is understood that the amendments will be presented to the parliament
next month, and the finance ministry will advise that the changes should
apply from April 1, the beginning of the 1993-94 fiscal year, and last for
at least two years.
A second important change is that the original legislation required foreign
manufacturers to increase exports to Japan by at least 10 per cent
year-on-year before becoming eligible for the tax credits, which are
equivalent to 5 per cent of the value of the increase in exports.
The finance ministry has agreed to lower the increase hurdle to 2 per cent,
above which a rising scale of credits will apply up to the same maximum of 5
per cent.
For non-manufacturers, the same scale will apply, allowing them to defer
payment of 20 per cent of the tax due on the increased exports.
Miti is pleased that the finance ministry has relented after three years of
negotiation, as the system, intended to help foreign manufacturers, has
instead created trade friction with Washington and Brussels.
'We have heard many complaints from companies like Philips and BMW, and we
understood why they were unhappy,' a Miti official said.
'When we introduced the original tax breaks, we did not intend to
discriminate against foreign companies, but it turned out that we needed to
change the way we looked at tax collection,' he added.
The ministry hopes that the reforms will be recognised by other governments
as a sign that Japan is attempting to reduce its large and growing current
account surplus, which was a record Dollars 106.2bn (Pounds 69bn) over the
first 11 months of 1992.
The previous record was Dollars 87bn during 1987.

KENYAN President Daniel arap Moi was yesterday sworn in for a further
five-year term as an opposition coalition promised a non-violent campaign
designed to overturn last week's election results.
At a hastily organised ceremony at State House, Nairobi, Mr Moi promised to
'serve all Kenyans, and I mean all Kenyans, with dedication and humility for
the development and prosperity of our people'.
Absent from the occasion was Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary
general, who arrived yesterday to begin efforts to end the political
impasse. Chief Anyaoku, who met the president in the afternoon, was said to
be resting after his journey.
Mr Moi faces his first test this week, when he is expected to announce his
cabinet. Without representatives of the Kikuyu and the Luo, the country's
two largest tribes, it will have little credibility, but the election showed
overwhelming opposition to the president from both ethnic groups.
The opposition alliance, comprising Mr Kenneth Matiba's FORD-Asili, Mr
Jaramogi Oginga Odinga's FORD-Kenya and the Democratic Party led by Mr Mwai
Kibaki, has come under criticism from some supporters for raising the
prospect of a boycott of parliament.
At a press conference Mr Kibaki renewed the opposition's claim that the poll
had been rigged, but declined to say how it would fulfil its threat to stop
Mr Moi exercising power. A non-violent anti-government campaign was being
planned, he said, but declined to give details. Most observers believe the
alliance has little option but to function as a parliamentary opposition.
Ghana's President-elect Jerry Rawlings's party won 189 of 200 parliamentary
seats after an opposition election boycott, Reuter reports from Accra.
Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida swore in a National Defence and
Security Council and a Transitional Council yesterday to help guide the
country towards civilian rule, Reuter reports from Abuja.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Value of Hamas expulsions in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI ministers are satisfied that the abrupt expulsion last month of 415
Palestinians to south Lebanon, in spite of damage to the country's
international standing, was widely accepted at home as a damaging blow to
Islamic extremist organisations bent on attacking Israel.
However, there are strong doubts among foreign observers, Palestinians in
the occupied territories and some Israeli commentators that the expulsions
have achieved the aim of dislocating Hamas, the most prominent
fundamentalist group in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Hamas seeks to disrupt Middle East peace talks and challenge the primacy of
the secular Palestine Liberation Organisation.
'Our analysis is that the Israelis have done much less damage than they
claim to have done,' said a western diplomat. 'If the security forces really
had a list of 400 core members of Hamas they wouldn't have been at large -
they would have been arrested a long time ago.'
In addition to the 415 men dumped across the Lebanese border, the
authorities rounded up hundreds more alleged activists of Hamas and Islamic
Jihad, a smaller fundamentalist group responsible for violent acts against
the Israeli occupation. This sudden removal from the streets of around 1,000
people undoubtedly stunned the organisations.
But those sceptical of the effectiveness of the mass round-up say the
subsequent lull in armed attacks on the security forces is almost certainly
temporary while the guerrillas lay low in the immediate aftermath. The
killing of a Shin Bet secret service officer on Sunday, and a non-fatal
stabbing of another Israeli the same day may have been the first signs of a
revival of the violence.
Government and military officials have acknowledged that the arrests and
deportations did not include the killers of six Israeli soldiers by Hamas
and Islamic Jihad in early December whose deaths prompted the expulsions.
Most of those rounded up were either prominent local figures known for their
advocacy of Islamic revivalism or people involved in little more than
low-level intifada street demonstrations against Israeli rule. Large numbers
of mosque officials, Islamic and other academics, physicians and
professionals were included in the expulsion.
'These people were well-known for their public support and sympathy for
Hamas. But they are not the real activists, who have to operate underground.
They work in small cells and do not have any public face,' said a
Palestinian journalist.
To some extent, the army does not dispute this. But the military insists
that by moving to remove the intellectual 'head' of Hamas it has paralysed
the organisation, at least temporarily. The action, military sources argue,
will dislocate the network of social and welfare support which Hamas
operates and which gives it its essential lifeblood of public support.
'We will still move against the terrorist element,' said one, referring to
the armed cells. 'We will get these people as well.'
But western governments have expressed concern to Israel that the expulsions
have increased sympathy for Hamas and its fellow Islamic groups at the
expense of the PLO at a time when public support for the PLO-backed peace
talks was vulnerable but was not perceived to be leaning towards the
extremists.
'We are worried about the longer term effect on Hamas - on the ability of
clandestine organisations to recruit. We think these developments will only
help them,' said a diplomat.
Western diplomats say they would prefer to see Israel act more clinically
against channels of financial and material support said to be flowing to
Hamas from Iran and, to a lesser extent, from Saudi Arabia.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Plutonium vessel docks in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JAPANESE vessel carrying a controversial shipment of plutonium docked
early today after a two-month voyage from France that has attracted severe
international criticism.
The Akatsuki Maru, carrying one ton of plutonium destined for a trial
fast-breeder reactor, entered a purpose-built port at Tokai, which is near
the nuclear research plant and is about 120km north-east of the Japanese
capital, after one of the longest non-stop voyages by a commercial ship.
It was ringed by a dozen coastguard vessels, and a boat chartered by
Greenpeace, the environmental group, trailed nearby.
On shore 2,000 police prepared for protests planned by anti-nuclear
activists who claim the voyage has been dangerous and unnecessary.
During the Akatsuki Maru's journey, about 10 countries warned Japan that the
vessel should not enter their territorial waters and complained about being
left in the dark about the cargo's potential dangers. The sustained
criticism prompted the government to hint that plans to import about 30 tons
of plutonium this decade would be reconsidered.
The high security on the voyage was in response to concerns that the load
could be a target for terrorists seeking to build nuclear weapons.
However, the voyage was incident-free, apart from a dispute with a vessel
owned by Greenpeace.
About 70 vessels from the Maritime Safety Agency will secure the port during
the unloading of the vessel. Unloading of the 15 containers holding the
plutonium is expected to last until tomorrow morning.

PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's head of state, delivered another blow to
the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) United Nations mission in Cambodia yesterday
with the announcement that he would no longer be co-operating with UN
peacekeepers in his country or with the Vietnamese-installed administration
in Phnom Penh.
In a letter to Mr Yasushi Akashi, the head of the UN Transitional Authority
in Cambodia (Untac), Prince Sihanouk said he had made his decision because
of Untac's failure to do anything about a series of attacks on the royalist
party Funcinpec led by his son, Prince Ranariddh.
'I am obliged to cease co-operation with Untac and the party administration
of the state of Cambodia,' the prince said in his letter, released in
Beijing, where he is now living.
Untac officials are organising elections in Cambodia scheduled for May and
have succeeded in registering about four-fifths of eligible voters. But the
UN has been unable to impose a ceasefire.
Fighting between the Phnom Penh administration and Khmer Rouge guerrillas
has continued, and several Funcinpec offices have been attacked - apparently
by Phnom Penh government forces afraid of losing power in the election.
Several Funcinpec party workers have been killed.
Prince Sihanouk, complaining of a variety of illnesses, retreated to Beijing
in November.
While he may have some genuine illness, many observers believe he is sulking
because of the lukewarm reception which was given to his suggestion that
Untac should arrange a presidential election - with himself as the prime
candidate - as well as the general election so that he could supervise
Cambodia while a new constitution is debated.
A spokesman for Prince Sihanouk in Beijing was careful to emphasise that the
prince would continue to have personal relations with Mr Akashi and other
parties in Cambodia and that the letter to Mr Akashi did not affect the
prince's standing as head of state.
But even if allowances are made for a certain amount of grandstanding by
Prince Sihanouk, the situation has changed markedly since he returned in
triumph to Phnom Penh in November 1991.
Then, there was optimistic talk of an alliance between Prince Ranariddh and
Mr Hun Sen, prime minister in the Cambodian administration.
Nowadays suggestions of an alliance are muted and the Supreme National
Council, which includes the four main factions - the Hun Sen government,
Funcinpec, the Khmer Rouge and the KPNLF - has ceased to meet on a regular
basis.

LEADERS of five former Soviet Asian republics, meeting in Tashkent,
yesterday gave backing to the fragile Commonwealth of Independent States, to
which they belong, saying they wanted to move towards a common market,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
Interfax news agency quoted Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev as saying
the five countries - Kazakhstan and the Central Asian states of Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - were taking steps to create a
common market. But the five should continue to work with other former Soviet

<TEXT>
THE TROUBLED Somalia peace mission of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United
Nations secretary general, took another turn for the worse yesterday as
Ethiopian forces fired on students protesting against UN policy on Eritrea.
Four Somali factions boycotted his opening remarks to the Somali peace
conference.
The incidents in the Ethiopian capital came a day after an angry mob of
demonstrators in Mogadishu prevented Mr Boutros Ghali from visiting the UN
headquarters in the Somali capital, pelted the building with rocks and
chanted 'Boutros Ghali go home'.
According to witnesses in Addis Ababa, Ethiopian security forces opened fire
directly into a large crowd of students trying to make their way to the
conference venue. At least one student was killed, at least a dozen suffered
serious gunshot wounds and scores more were later treated for minor
injuries. There were unconfirmed reports of a further six fatalities.
Student leaders later said they were trying to protest against the UN
chief's proposed visit to Eritrea, the northern secessionist province which
will vote on independence from Ethiopia in a referendum in April, and
petition him on the 'dictatorship' of the Ethiopian government.
The UN has sent a mission to Eritrea and agreed to send observers to the
referendum - a move deeply resented by some southerners who want to preserve
the territorial unity of their country.
The shootings occurred an hour before Mr Boutros Ghali opened the Somali
peace conference which brings together 14 factions. An alliance of four
groups from the southern Darod clans refused to take their seats to hear the
UN chief, in protest against the exclusion of three other allied groups.
'Boutros Ghali does not have the right to decide who shall take part in a
Somali peace conference,' said Mr Mohammed Hashi, an official of the United
Somali Party.
However Mr Yusuf Omar Al-Azhari, an official of the Somali Salvation
Democratic Front, which controls a large swathe of northern Somalia and also
joined the boycott, said the alliance was also protesting against the
participation of warlords who they allege have massacred their clansmen. The
SSDF, he said, was calling for the establishment of a human rights court to
try Somali war criminals.
'How could the UN allow people who have denied food and medicine to their
own people and perpetrated genocide sit down to talk about peace and decide
the future of Somalia?' he asked.
UN officials were yesterday playing down expectations of any big achievement
from the conference and said at best they hope for agreement on the agenda,
venue and list of participants in a future political reconciliation
conference.
In his conference address Mr Boutros Ghali said: 'The process of national
reconciliation will be long difficult. It will take months, and perhaps
years. . . We are here today to begin this process. What begins well can end
well.'
In a much tougher speech, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi castigated the
Somali leaders for allowing clan rivalries to destroy their country.
'Because your judgments have been clouded by. . . clan sentiments and
animosity you stand now before the Somali people, the international
community and history as the principal engineers of the tragedy in Somalia,'
he said.
The US will begin removing some troops from Somalia this month, but most
will remain beyond January, Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary, said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Saudi government to raise spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER and Our Middle East Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA yesterday projected a 9 per cent increase in government
spending to SR196.9bn (Pounds 34bn) in 1993 but gave no breakdown of revenue
sources, report Reuter and Our Middle East Staff.
Budget figures and other financial statements published by the official
Saudi Press Agency after the budget was approved by the cabinet put revenues
at the same SR196.9bn figure projected for spending.
This figure is more than Pounds 6.5bn above the optimistic revenue forecasts
of less than a year ago.
There was no mention of the kingdom's persistent budget deficit, which was
projected at Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in 1992.
It was largely financed last year by domestic borrowing and seems likely to
increase in the year ahead.
The finance ministry estimated Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product rose 5
per cent in 1992.
SPA quoted King Fahd, who chaired the cabinet meeting, as saying that his
govenment's priority was economic development and raising living standards
in the kingdom.
He said there were 7,000 government projects now under construction.
'We hope that stability will be maintained in this region to allow each
state to focus on building its economic and its people's prosperity,' he
added.
The budget set military and security spending at SR61.6bn, up 13.7 per cent.
Education was allocated SR34.1bn, the lion's share of civilian spending.
This was almost 10 per cent up on the previous year's allocations. The
government said 800 new schools would be opened in 1993 and six colleges of
further education started.
Health and social services were to receive SR14.1bn, a 15 per cent rise, and
transport and telecommunications SR9.1bn. The statement said government
subsidies for various economic and social activities were set at SR9.2bn.

<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA cut its trade deficit almost in half to Dollars 4.92bn (Pounds
3.23bn) in 1992 and officials predict the deficit will shrink to Dollars
3.5bn this year.
Exports last year rose by 6.8 per cent to Dollars 76.8bn on a customs
clearance basis, while imports were almost unchanged at Dollars 81.7bn,
according to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.
The ministry estimates that exports will rise by 8 per cent to Dollars 83bn,
while imports will grow by 6 per cent to Dollars 86.5bn.
The expected growth in imports this year is because of increased purchase of
foreign machinery for plant automation and building supplies for several big
infrastructure projects.
Export growth last year was led by petrochemicals, steel, vehicles, tyres
and containers, while shipments of textiles, toys and footwear were sluggish
as the country's light industry lost competitiveness through higher wage
costs.
The trade deficit in 1991 reached a record Dollars 9.7bn.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Jordan hit by sanctions on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JORDANIAN economy has suffered losses of at least Dollars 570m (Pounds
372m) in nearly 2 1/2 years of United Nations sanctions against Iraq because
of the reduced volume of transit cargo through the port of Aqaba and the
cost of ship inspections, according to the Jordan Shipping Agents'
Association.
The losses are a sizeable amount for a country with gross domestic product
last year of Dollars 3.98bn.
Transit imports to Iraq through Aqaba have collapsed by 66 per cent since
the onset of the Gulf crisis.
In 1989 some 5.6m tonnes of transit cargo for Iraq passed through Aqaba. In
the first 11 months of last year the total was just 1.9m tonnes, mainly food
and medicine.
Transit exports from Iraq, about 1.15m tonnes in 1989, have ceased.
The Jordan Shipping Agents' Association says the total loss of port revenues
from trade with Iraq since August 1990, when the sanctions were imposed,
amount to Dollars 500m.
In addition to this, operators shipping cargoes to Jordan, or other transit
destinations such as Syria, have increased their charges to account for
interference by naval inspectors policing sanctions in the Red Sea. Ships
for Aqaba are frequently subject to delays and the risk of being turned
away, and they are forced to carry lighter loads in order to make their
cargo accessible to inspection.
The authorities invested heavily in the Aqaba port in the 1980s.
A new oil terminal, seven additional berths, and a Dollars 3m communications
centre were built to handle the ballooning demand from Iraq when Baghdad's
Gulf outlets were blocked by war with Iran.
Aqaba is now operating at only 60 per cent of capacity compared with 1989.

FT  05 JAN 93 / End of barter leaves N Korea short of oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S decision last week to end barter trade with North Korea has
increased Pyongyang's problems in gaining badly-needed crude oil and grain
supplies from abroad.
North Korea, which lacks any appreciable foreign currency reserves, has
asked South Korean trading companies to serve as intermediaries in finding
new barter trade partners who would supply these goods.
Grain shortages have led to reports of malnutrition in some rural parts of
North Korea.
A lack of crude oil to supply power to factories has caused the North Korean
economy to contract since 1990, when the former Soviet Union ended its
barter trade with Pyongyang.
North Korea has since relied on China for oil supplies, while it has also
developed relations with Iran by shipping missiles in exchange for
petroleum.
China was North Korea's largest trade partner last year with total bilateral
shipments valued at Dollars 620m, followed by Japan, the former Soviet Union
and Iran.
In one sign of the seriousness of the energy problem, North Korean President
Kim Il-sung called for increased coal production in his New Year's address
to the nation.
'Only when the production of coal is sharply increased is it possible to
ease the strain on electricity and to put production. . . on a steady
basis,' he declared.
North Korean coal, however, is of low quality and would serve as a poor
substitute for imported petroleum, which is the country's main energy
source.
North Korea had expected an end of its barter trade relations with China,
which originally had planned to stop the arrangement last year but delayed
the move until last week to mollify Pyongyang over Beijing's establishment
of diplomatic ties with Seoul in August.
Pyongyang early last year requested South Korea's main trading companies to
arrange supplies of grains and crude oil from third countries in exchange
for zinc and steel from North Korea.
Demand for grain supplies has increased in the last two months with the
onset of winter. North Korea is seeking rice from Vietnam, Taiwan and
Ukraine as well as Chinese corn and North American wheat.
However, North Korea is refusing to purchase rice directly from South Korea
because of a dispute between the two countries over Pyongyang's nuclear
programme that has consequently frozen economic relations.
North Korea made its requests through the branch offices of South Korean
trading companies in Beijing and Hong Kong. It is uncertain whether the
Seoul government will give its approval for the trading companies to conduct
the deals.
Meanwhile, Pyongyang has asked Beijing for a loan for the purchase of
petroleum and grain from China.

MEXICAN President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has named a hardline state

cabinet reshuffle, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. He also appointed a
new energy minister and brought in a reform-minded lawyer and academic as
attorney-general, in charge of law and the federal police.
The president appointed Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, the governor of
Chiapas, as minister of the interior. While governor, Mr Gonzalez was
frequently criticised by human rights groups for excessive use of force, and
abusing indigenous peoples' rights.
As if to balance the appointment, the president named Mr Jorge Carpizo, head
of the government's Human Rights Commission, as attorney-general.
Mr Emilio Lozoya's appointment as minister of energy and mines makes him a

FT  05 JAN 93 / Argentines taxed by economic recovery: Reforms are under
pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the first time in years Argentines have a government strong enough to
make them pay their taxes.
The crackdown on tax evasion is a central feature in Argentina's
extraordinary economic recovery: by dragging hundreds of thousands of people
into the tax net, the government can finance itself without printing money
for the first time in a generation.
The political consequences are intriguing. Argentines are rediscovering that
tax payments also give them the right to decide how money is spent, that
government resources are limited and, thus, that they have a personal stake
in how they are governed.
The government forecasts that, by raising tax revenues by a third, it will
have a balanced budget this year. Virtual elimination of the budget deficit
has already cut inflation to less than 20 per cent a year - from a record
197 per cent a month in July 1989 - and, as a result, the economy is growing
rapidly.
Previous governments, both civilian and military, lacked either the power or
the legitimacy to collect taxes, so from the first military coup d'etat this
century, in 1930, they simply printed money. Few countries can match
Argentina's ensuing inflation and massive devaluations, its vicious juntas,
its Kafkaesque bureaucracy, its corruption, or its visceral aversion to
paying taxes.
Now Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, says inflation and devaluation are
no longer options. He has made the currency convertible and required the
central bank to hold reserves equivalent to the entire money supply. The
result may be an overvalued currency, but Mr Cavallo says convertibility is
'brutal, ultra-realist. It removes from all sectors (the ability) to evade
reality. All sectors used to believe there was always a rabbit in the top
hat.'
As well as raising taxes, President Carlos Menem is dismembering the corrupt
and inefficient state, eliminating the over-regulation that justified its
existence but suffocated the economy. Nearly all state companies are being
privatised this year and the civil service is being decimated.  This attack
is hugely popular.
However, Mr Menem has left little in its place. Mr Miguel Angel Broda, a
business consultant, warns: 'The state is as inefficient in providing
education as it was in making steel. We need a small but efficient state.'
The atrocious social services are especially worrying now that Mr Cavallo's
economic reforms are beginning to hurt. Real wages are falling and wealth is
becoming more concentrated. Mr Ricardo Gutierrez, Treasury secretary,
admits: 'Growth creates losers as well as winners. We need a safety net, an
efficient and rapid social service system.'
Failure to respond to social demands could threaten the future of economic
reform. Reform in Chile was imposed by a military junta and in Mexico by a
one-party state. In Latin America, only Bolivia has succeeded in combining
it with democracy.
The difficulty in Argentina is that the people's will - expressed in
regular, fair and free elections - may not coincide with Mr Cavallo's plans.
In last year's congressional and gubernatorial elections, voters
overwhelmingly endorsed Mr Cavallo's reforms. In elections in September this
year, it may be a different story.
The traditional option of appeasing public opinion by handing out wage
'increases' or providing public sector jobs is no longer valid. Already,
though, Mr Cavallo is under tremendous pressure from within the government
to ease his strict policies.
Worryingly, he has responded with a 17.4 per cent increase in spending this
year - which he must cover with tax revenues and privatisation receipts -
and in October restored some trade protection.
Although Argentina does not have much of a democratic tradition and is
having to reconstruct its shattered political and economic systems
simultaneously, democracy will probably withstand the stresses of reform.
The military is discredited, the trauma of hyperinflation has created a
consensus for change, and the examples of Chile and Mexico show that
sacrifice can be worthwhile.
The risk is that Mr Menem will shrink from reform in the face of public
hostility, as he is trying to amend the constitution to run for re-election
when his term ends in 1995. He makes little effort to hide his irritation
with Mr Cavallo, whose days in office are in consequence often rumoured to
be numbered.
But Mr Cavallo says that with every day his policies remain in place he is
winning new allies. As more individuals and companies pay taxes, repatriate
their savings or hold local currency they become stakeholders in stability.
Nobody likes paying taxes, but Argentines hate inflation and economic
instability even more.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Clinton team faces gentle Senate test: Most emollient
hearing may be for Lloyd Bentsen's Treasury posting

<TEXT>
SENATE confirmation of President-elect Bill Clinton's new cabinet begins
this week.
In spite of earlier threats by Republicans to subject the nominees to what
has become known as the 'Tower test', no one appears to face rejection - the
fate that befell Mr John Tower, President George Bush's choice as defence
secretary four years ago. He was undone mostly by revelations about his
private life.
The Democratic party's 57-43 edge in the Senate should provide sufficient
insulation against rejection, but it is three votes short of being
filibuster-proof and the elasticity of Senate rules makes procedural delays
possible.
Those likely to face the toughest questioning are Mr Ron Brown, the choice
for the Commerce Department, Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary-designate,
and Ms Donna Shalala, due to take over health and human services.
Mr Brown, who faces the Senate commerce committee tomorrow, is the
quintessential Washington lawyer-insider, which helped make him such an
effective national Democratic chairman.
Political lobbyists, however, are not too popular at the moment, as Mr
Clinton's tough new ethical standard for senior members of his
administration attests, and Mr Brown's law firm has represented a number of
foreign governments and corporations. These include Haiti when it was run by
President 'Baby Doc' Duvalier.
Mr Reich's voluminous writings over the last decade will provide critical
senators with plenty of ammunition for what could be entertaining hearings,
beginning on Thursday.
Ms Shalala may be a target of Republican conservatives concerned she will
push those policies favouring reproductive choice so vigorously opposed by
the Reagan and Bush administrations. She has also spent more time in the
field of education than in the areas covered by her new portfolio.
Hearings for the main foreign and security policy nominees will mostly take
place next week, although there is a chance that the Senate armed services
committee may begin its questioning of Mr Les Aspin, picked as defence
secretary, on Thursday.
The most emollient session is likely to be next week when the Senate finance
committee hears from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary-designate who
has chaired the committee for the last six years.
If the cabinet makes it through unscathed, history suggests that some
secondary-level appointments subject to Senate confirmation could face
rougher proceedings. The pro-life knives, for example, are out for Dr
Joycelyn Elders, head of the Arkansas Public Health Department, who has been
nominated to take over as surgeon general next summer and who is a leader of
the pro-choice movement.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Mulroney rejigs Canadian cabinet ahead of poll
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL veteran Canadian ministers are stepping down as part of a cabinet
shuffle designed to freshen the face of the Progressive Conservative
government ahead of the next general election.
Those stepping down include Mr Marcel Masse, the controversial defence
minister; Mr Jake Epp, energy minister; and Mr Robert de Cotret, secretary
of state.
Announcing the shuffle yesterday, Mr Brian Mulroney, who has been prime
minister since September 1984, gave no clue to his own intentions.
Speculation is rife that he will also step aside in the next few months. His
personal popularity remains at rock-bottom with only about one in five
voters approving of his performance. It is widely thought that a new leader
would greatly improve the Conservatives' chances in the election, likely to
be held in the summer or early autumn.
The latest shuffle will trim the cabinet from 39 to 35 ministers, in keeping
with efforts by the government to project an image of restraint and improved
efficiency.
Mr Masse will be succeeded as defence minister by Ms Kim Campbell, who
previously held the justice portfolio. Ms Campbell, a forceful and bilingual
British Columbian, is the favourite to take over as party leader if Mr
Mulroney quits.
Mr William McKnight, previously agriculture minister, takes over the energy
portfolio.
Mr Mulroney said another reshuffle was likely before the election. Several
other senior ministers are said to be contemplating their futures and may
announce their retirement from politics before the election. These include
Mr Michael Wilson, the trade and industry minister.

<TEXT>
Argentina's central bank yesterday allowed banks to offer clients dollar
current accounts and cheque books, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
The measure was first announced after a short currency crisis in November,
when markets sold pesos heavily, fearing that an impending devaluation would
end almost two years of exchange rate stability.
In 1991, the government pegged the peso to the dollar, recognising the
dollar's use as virtual legal tender.
In another message aimed at calming currency markets, Mr Cavallo has
forecast a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 657.8m) seasonal capital outflow over coming
months, which might otherwise have been seen as a sign of the pesos's
weakness.

SWEDEN'S nuclear inspection authority, SKI, yesterday allowed operations to
resume at two of the five nuclear reactors it closed last September for
emergency repairs, Reuter reports from Stockholm.
The two reactors at Barseback can operate until the middle of this year,
when service work and refuelling will be carried out.
SKI in September said an accident at one plant in July had revealed
shortcomings in the equipment and procedures at the five plants.
The remaining three - one at Ringhals in western Sweden and two at
Oskarshamn in the south - will probably be back up later this month, a
spokesman said.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Italian inflation rate shows further fall in December
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S consumer prices rose by an annualised 4.8 per cent in December,
continuing the year's steady decline in domestic inflation but remaining
well above the rises in many of the country's main trading partners.
The rate in December compares with a rise of 4.9 per cent in November. It is
down sharply from 6 per cent the previous December and reflects the success
of government policy in holding down price increases and the impact of
recession on the economy.
However, the favourable data were not enough to take pressure off the lira,
which fell to L1,512.33 against the dollar and L924.12 against the D-Mark,
according to the Bank of Italy's indicative quotations.
After heavy speculative attacks in afternoon trading, the lira fell even
further, hitting its lowest level against the dollar since 1986.
The outlook for Italian inflation in 1993 is mixed. Official policy to
freeze public-sector prices and limit bank lending should help to combat
inflation, but domestic prices will come under mounting upward pressure as
the effect of September's lira devaluation starts to feed through.
The lira is now floating against other European currencies in the exchange
rate mechanism. Although well above the low levels against the D-Mark after
devaluation, when the lira fell to almost L1,000, the currency is still more
than 20 per cent below its pre-devaluation parity.
The government has shown its determination to contain inflation by
restricting or freezing many public-sector price increases. The cabinet
committee responsible for state-sector prices last week approved a
long-awaited plan to reform telephone tariffs by letting the Stet
telecommunications holding company introduce a 'price cap' system for
tariffs.
The scheme allows for telephone tariffs to be increased automatically,
subject to meeting pre-set quality and productivity criteria.
However, ministers have yet to decide when the new system should be
introduced, surprising the many analysts who expected it to be inaugurated
from the beginning of this year.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Kinkel set to become vice-chancellor: Rise of former civil
servant given added boost by Mollemann's resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KLAUS KINKEL, the former top civil servant who shot into the political
limelight last year as German foreign minister, is set to become both
vice-chancellor in the ruling coalition and leader of the Free Democratic
Party.
He is confidently expected to declare himself as candidate for the FDP
leadership tomorrow, to succeed Mr Otto Lambsdorff, who retires later this
year. He will also be the party's candidate for the formal position of
vice-chancellor under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in the wake of the sudden
resignation of Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, on Sunday.
That was confirmed yesterday by Mr Hermann Otto Solms, parliamentary leader
of the FDP, as the junior partner in the coalition struggled to contain the
fall-out from the resignation. The party is fighting to hold on to the
economics portfolio in the government, in the face of calls from many parts
of German industry, and from other political parties, that the job should be
given to a serious expert.
Party officials insist that the ministry, which covers both industrial
policy, including most of the strategic planning for eastern Germany, and
external trade, should still go to a fully fledged politician, and not to an
outsider from the business community.
On the other hand, the main business lobbies want a competent expert who
also has the political influence necessary to put policies into action. They
also want a candidate who can work well with Mr Theo Waigel, the finance
minister, and not against him, as Mr Mollemann used to do.
Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman, suggested yesterday that Mr Kohl
would 'as a realistic politician' leave the choice of candidate up to the
FDP, which was given the portfolio in the coalition negotiations two years
ago.
The two names cited so far - Mr Gunter Rexrodt, who formerly held the
finance portfolio in Berlin, and Mr Walter Hirche, currently economics
minister in the state of Brandenburg - are both numerate, but no more than
provincial politicians. Both do, at least, have ample experience of the
problems of east Germany.
The whole upheaval leaves Mr Kinkel, who joined the FDP only two years ago,
as the one clear winner. For years a close associate and protege of Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister and honorary chairman of
the party, he has no grass-roots political experience, although he was
always a 'political' civil servant.
He had been agonising about whether to confirm his candidacy for the party
leadership, while remaining as foreign minister, but the demise of Mr
Mollemann leaves him little choice, and little opposition.
The only other alternative would be Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, the construction
minister, but she suffered a humiliating defeat last year in the contest
with Mr Kinkel to become foreign minister. Mr Kinkel is expected to announce
his candidacy tomorrow, at the traditional Epiphany rally of the party in
Stuttgart - appropriately enough in his home state of Baden-Wurttemberg.

FT  05 JAN 93 / French power group pledges cuts in tariffs and debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH power utility, Electricite de France, will today promise to cut
tariffs by 1.25 per cent a year up to 1996 and to reduce its indebtedness by
nearly a quarter over the next four years.
These commitments are contained in the latest EdF long-term contract with
its owner, the French state, which will be signed today.
EdF officials say they are the fruit of considerable productivity gains in
recent years which leave the French utility well-poised to make further
inroads into the electricity markets of its neighbours.
EdF already exports about 12 per cent (54bn kilowatt hours in 1991) of its
electrical output generated in France, chiefly to the UK, Italy and
Switzerland. It has contracts that will push these exports up to 70bn
kilowatt hours by 1997.
EdF said yesterday it had no plans to increase direct exports further, but
rather to expand into foreign joint ventures in Spain and the eastern states
of Germany. This is partly because of sensitivity over its exports,
particularly in Britain, with which EdF has a cross-Channel link.
The company stressed that its progressive 1993-96 price reductions would be
in its domestic market, and that it did not disclose what it charged for its
power exports. But the latter could be very competitively priced, given the
productivity gains EdF claims.
Edf will be taking advantage of a relative lull in its investment programme
to reduce its overall debt from FFr195bn (Pounds 23.69bn) last year to
FFr155bn by 1996. Such a reduction would make EdF a more attractive
privatisation prospect, though the utility is hardly on the priority list of
public companies for sale by the centre-right government that is expected to
take office after the March parliamentary election. Early in the next
century, EdF faces the task of renewing the nuclear power plants which
provide 75 per cent of its electricity.
French basic monthly salaries excluding bonuses and overtime rose by 0.7 per
cent in the third quarter of 1992, giving a year-on-year increase of 3.6 per
cent, the Labour Ministry said, Reuter reports from Paris.

In Italy, the death toll rose to four as wintry weather gripped the country,

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR unrest in Poland's coal mines abated yesterday, leaving the
government free to address mounting budget problems which threaten to delay
agreement on a crucial 14-month standby loan from the International Monetary
Fund.
The IMF has yet to approve a letter of intent predicated on a 1993 budget
deficit of not more than Zl 80,000bn (Pounds 3.3bn), or about 5 per cent of
GDP. This year's budget has yet to be accepted by parliament but several
votes last week on public sector pay and housing loans have already
increased outlays by Zl 10,000bn.
The continuing budget debate in parliament could push the deficit over Zl
100,000bn. 'The situation has put Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the finance minister,
in a difficult position and is becoming a serious test of the Polish
cabinet's commitment to tight money policies,' a western financier said
yesterday.
Poland needs the Dollars 660m (Pounds 434m) loan from the Fund to go ahead
with a further 20 per cent reduction in its western government debt agreed
in 1991, and to resume debt restructuring talks with western commercial
banks.
Miners at more than 60 of the 65 Silesian coal mines, who have been on
strike for three weeks, yesterday heeded a call by Solidarity trade union
leaders to return to work. But rival unions denounced Solidarity's new
year's eve deal with the government on restructuring the industry and easing
its financial burdens.
The agreement with Solidarity committed the government to doing little more
than it had already planned, unionists from the breakaway Solidarity 80
movement said at the Makoszowy mine, which, with three other pits, stayed
out on strike yesterday.
Meanwhile, in Lodz, an important textile centre where unemployment is over
20 per cent, Solidarity leaders yesterday called for a regional strike while
talks continued in Warsaw with Mr Jacek Kuron, labour minister, on the
region's problems.
Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's former deputy premier and finance minister
and a proponent of free market policies, has agreed to become a member of
President Lech Walesa's 49-strong Council of Economic Advisers which meets
for the first time today.
Mr Balcerowicz has held no public role since giving up his government post
at the end of 1991.

negotiations on a solution of the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina which would
enable them to blame each other for any breakdown.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Moslem president, who has come under heavy
pressure from Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the two international mediators
chairing the conference, to accept a plan for the territorial division of
the country into 10 largely autonomous provinces, yesterday succeeded in
shifting the emphasis on proposals which the Bosnian Serbs find difficult to
accept.
The spotlight suddenly switched from the proposed new provincial boundaries,
some of which the Moslems want to modify, to constitutional and military
proposals which Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, rejected, at
least in the first instance.
Helped by the pressure which the co-chairmen were suddenly putting on Mr
Karadzic, who only yesterday appeared to be cast in a much more conciliatory
role than the Bosnian Moslems, Mr Izetbegovic yesterday clearly laid down
his minimum two conditions for an agreement.
The conference would fail if the Bosnian Serbs did not accept the Vance-Owen
constitutional proposals under which Bosnia-Hercegovina would become an
independent sovereign state, based on democratic principles and a division
of the country into self-governing provinces.
His government would also refuse to sign any agreement which did not
specifically include the placing of all heavy weapons in Bosnia-Hercegovina,
such as tanks, artillery and missiles, under effective United Nations
control. Both demands were supported by the Bosnian Croats, Mr Izetbegovic
claimed.
Mr Izetbegovic, who hardly referred to the boundary alterations which his
delegation had demanded so persistently at the weekend to the co-chairmen's
provincial map, made it clear that, in the event of a breakdown in the
negotiations, his country was prepared to continue its combat against the
Bosnian Serbs.
Even in the absence of international military intervention, 'we have a lot
of our boys ready to fight for our freedom and the survival of the
Bosnia-Hercegovina people,' he said.
That does not mean that Mr Izetbegovic has suddenly dropped his demands for
territorial adjustments, set out on an alternative map which the Bosnian
Moslems have issued. But disputes over the boundaries affect only three of
the ten proposed provinces and the Bosnian Serbs and Croats have already
said that compromise deals are possible.
Whether Mr Karadzic was prepared to compromise on constitutional and
military matters remained an open question.
The co-chairmen's proposal for the creation of an independent and sovereign
Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose constituent provinces would not have the right to
forge any international relations of their own, directly contradicts the
Bosnian Serbs' demand for the creation of their own separate state. Such 'a
state within a state' could eventually link up with the Serbian motherland,
they firmly believe.
On the military issue, the Bosnian Serbs are clearly loth to withdraw their
heavy weapons from their present positions and to place them under
international control.
All the warring factions are acutely conscious of what they stand to gain or
lose in international support if they are held responsible for a failure of
the current negotiations. If the Bosnian Moslems succeed in their tactics of
pinning the blame on their Serb adversaries, the likelihood of international
action to enforce the air exclusion zone over Bosnia will have increased
substantially.
If, however, the Bosnian Moslems are seen as the main stumbling block to an
agreement, as they were during the first two days of the conference, they
will stand a much smaller chance of persuading the international community
to come to their military aid.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Complaints point to confusion over single market

A NUMBER of EC countries have been accused of failing to abolish controls on
people and goods only four days after the European Community formally
launched the barrier-free internal market.
Euro Citizen Action Service, a Brussels-based lobby group for citizens'
rights, said yesterday it had already received several 'substantial'
complaints about controls, via a fax and telephone hotline which was opened
yesterday and will run all this week.
In London, the Department of Trade and Industry's single market telephone
hotline received about 250 calls yesterday. Some callers appeared to have
woken up to the implications of the single market at the last moment, an
official said.
Popular requests were for information on the rules governing the
transferability of professional qualifications in Europe and for a guide to
sources of advice on the EC. Inquiry levels were about average for a Monday,
which was usually the busiest day of the week, the DTI said.
In recent months the DTI 1992 Helpline received an average of 1,000 calls a
week and an estimated total of 300,000 since it was set up four years ago.
The European Commission's London office also reported a high level of
inquiries but other business advice agencies reported a quiet start to the
single market.
Mr Tony Venables, director of Ecas, said that judging from the 70 calls
received, there was still confusion about the lifting of controls. He
managed to persuade British immigration officials at London's Gatwick
airport to allow him into the UK this weekend without presenting his
passport, but other travellers were forced to show documents.
Britain has said it will not abolish passport checks on travellers within
the EC, although it has promised to lighten controls on EC citizens. But Mr
Venables said: 'As far as we can gather at the moment, customs officials
have not been given any specific advice.'
Ecas is likely to pursue allegations about British immigration authorities
persisting with passport checks. It could well follow up complaints from
Gibraltar that Spain has tightened border controls. One Belgian woman has
also complained that Spanish customs officials made her list the contents of
her car at the French border. Greece is under fire for allegedly insisting
registered parcels sent from other EC countries should still be examined by
customs officials.
However, a number of EC citizens have called to complain that lifting border
controls would allow drug smugglers and terrorists to move freely.
Mr Venables said the hotline might be extended into next week. He said the
most substantial allegations would be put to the European Commission.

FT  05 JAN 93 / French franc under pressure: European central banks
intervene in support of parity with D-mark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK and the Bank of France yesterday intervened to support the
French franc, as weaker currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism
came under pressure after the holiday break.
The franc moved closer to its ERM floor against the D-Mark, as dealers
speculated on the possibility that the French currency could be devalued.
The French and German central banks have repeatedly said the current ERM
parity is unbreakable.
The punt also came under renewed pressure on the first full day of trading
after the Republic of Ireland's abolition of exchange controls on January 1.
The punt fell to its floor against the Belgian franc, one of the strongest
currencies in the ERM. Ireland's one-week interbank lending rate rose to 45
per cent from 15 per cent.
Yesterday's show of strength by the D-Mark against the franc came in spite
of a powerful rally by the dollar. Buoyed by very good US economic
indicators over Christmas and new year, the dollar hit DM1.6413 at one
point. It later closed at DM1.6365, its highest close in Europe since last
summer and finished New York trading at 1.63895.
Central bank intervention in support of the franc was estimated to be
modest. By the close of European trading, the franc was at FFr3.419 against
the D-Mark, still more than a centime above its ERM floor. In New York it
closed at FFr3.4127, and in early trading in the Far East levelled off at
FFr3.4138.
'There are relatively few strong sellers but no one is buying and anyone
holding francs has been anxious to cover their position,' said Mr
Christopher Potts, chief economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'Whenever
the franc recovers, investors switch to D-Marks.'
The franc's weakness was accompanied by a sharp rise in French money market
rates, with overnight rates going as high as 13 1/2 per cent yesterday
morning before falling back to 12 per cent.
Official French rates were not increased although further rises in money
market rates might make this unavoidable. Yesterday's intervention followed
weeks of currency speculation in which both central banks supported the
currency. The Bundesbank's decision not to lower official rates did not
relieve pressure on the franc.
In Ireland, the Central Bank apparently indicated to clearing banks that
'extremely punitive rates' would be imposed on banks left 'short' of funds,
having lent to borrowers for speculative purposes. Market analysts,
economists and business leaders broadly agree that the economy would be
damaged if current interest rate levels persist.

FT  05 JAN 93 / MacGregor pledges 'full speed ahead' for rail sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT signalled its determination last night to press ahead with
privatising Britain's railways, claiming the plans would create a better
service for passengers and freight customers.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, used a speech to his local
Conservative association in South Norfolk to hit back at recent suggestions
that the government's proposals were stalled and would have to be revised.
Rail privatisation was going 'full speed ahead', he told them.
As Labour called on the government to spell out 'how deep is their U-turn',
Mr MacGregor said recent criticism of plans for 'commercialising' British
Rail passenger services were based on 'complete misunderstandings'.
The government was aiming to 'inject into the railways more private sector
skills and resources', he said. 'Our proposals will make sure we get that
further improvement in service for passengers and freight which is so
necessary if we are to get the benefits of the record levels of capital
investment currently going into our railways.'
Speculation that the government was preparing to back down over its
proposals for BR intensified last week following prime minister John Major's
characterisation of them as a 'semi-privatisation'.
Last year's white paper proposed that only the freight operations would be
sold outright.
On the passenger side, the private sector would be asked to bid for
franchises to operate British Rail's trains, the contracts going to the
companies requiring the lowest subsidies. The infrastructure would remain in
state ownership, train operators being charged for the use of the tracks.
While acknowledging that BR was already carrying out 'important reforms' of
the railway system, Mr MacGregor criticised current service standards -
particularly in its freight operations.
'I don't find anyone who thinks that BR is providing a perfect service now
and does not need further change,' he said.
The transport secretary reiterated the government's pledge to continue
subsidies for 'socially necessary lines'.
He also emphasised that progress towards the planned franchising of BR's
passenger services would be gradual.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK buy-out deal with McDonnell Douglas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH-OWNED information technology company is to be created through a
buy-out of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems from the US aerospace
group. The deal is worth at least Pounds 200m, although the price is not
being disclosed.
McDonnell Douglas said yesterday it had agreed to sell the UK-based business
to investors led by Baring Capital Investors. The deal could be completed by
the end of this month.
Mr Jeremy Causley, MDIS chief executive, and the rest of the existing
British management team will stay with the company. Some 16 senior managers
will have a stake in the buy-out.
MDIS is one of the top 10 UK-based information technology groups. It sells
computer hardware and software for a range of industries and constructs and
manages integrated systems.
The company employs about 1,800 people, 1,300 of them in the UK. It is a
leading supplier to the National Health Service, central and local
government and the police.
Among its recent contracts was a deal worth Pounds 6m to supply St Mary's
Hospital, Paddington, London, with hardware, software and facilities
management.
McDonnell Douglas is selling the group as part of a strategy to concentrate
on its core aerospace business.
Only a handful of large corporations now maintain partial or total ownership
of information technology companies, once seen as a promising
diversification into a high growth sector. General Motors, for example,
retains ownership of Electronic Data Systems, one of the world's largest
computing services companies, which it bought from EDS's founder, Mr Ross
Perot.
McDonnell Douglas had been preparing MDIS for flotation on the London stock
exchange, but the offering had been postponed. The US company is understood
to have accepted it would get better value for MDIS through a private sale
rather than flotation, given present market conditions.
Last year, MDIS had revenues of about Pounds 180m although profits will not
be disclosed until the parent company publishes its results at the end of
this month. Some 30 per cent of MDIS sales are made outside the UK.
In 1991, MDIS made pre-tax profits in the UK of Pounds 14.2m on sales of
Pounds 139.8m. Mr Causley said profits in 1992 would be a substantial
advance.
Profitable British information technology companies, such as Istel and
Butler Cox, have changed hands in the past two years for up to 1 1/2 times
annual turnover.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK share indicies reach new highs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The main UK stock market indices reached new closing highs yesterday.
Mid-sized companies did especially well.
The FT-SE 100 index, which tracks the shares of the 100 largest UK
companies, rose 15 points to close at 2861.5, after touching a new trading
record of 2,867.9 in mid-afternoon.
The FT-SE 100 close was a rise of 0.5 per cent, less than half that achieved
by the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which covers the next largest 250 companies. It
jumped 33.5 points to close at 2896.4, a rise of 1.2 per cent. Mid-sized
companies are more reliant on the health of the UK economy than their larger
cousins.
The new FT-SE SmallCap index, which tracks the next-largest 450 companies,
rose 1.0 per cent to close at 1377.88 on its first day. The FT-Actuaries
All-Share, extended yesterday from 651 to 800 shares, rose 0.7 per cent to
1,373.20, also a record close.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Malaysian rail development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR WOODROW INTERNATIONAL and AEG WESTINGHOUSE TRANSPORT SYSTEME GmbH
have secured authority from the Malaysian government to proceed with a
project to promote a light rail transit system for Kuala Lumpur.
The project, running 12 kilometres between Ampang, on the eastern outskirts
of the city, and Jalan Sultan Ismail in the city centre, is to be privately
funded through a combination of equity and loans.
To raise the required finance for the Pounds 300m system, the two companies,
operating in consortium, have formed an operating company STAR (Sistem
Transit Aliran Ringan), which has entered a franchise agreement with the
Malaysian government to raise investment capital for developing Phase 1.
The consortium formed the STAR company around a year ago to own and operate
the LRT system within the terms of the franchise agreement.
The other principal organisation involved in the project is the Kuala Lumpur
Transit Group Sdn Bhd (KLTG), owned equally by TWI and AEG, which has
entered into contract with STAR to undertake the design, engineering,
construction, delivery, installation and testing of the LRT system.
Discussions are now taking place with various financial institutions in
Malaysia. Once funding is secured, work on the 34-month construction
programme is expected to start next spring.
About a quarter of the total project value is expected to come from
shareholdings and the remainder from loan facilities, including a Malaysian
government support loan.
The project represents the first phase of an integrated light rail network
for Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas, reflecting the urgent need for a
modern, reliable and convenient non-road based public transport system to
overcome the congestion caused by the rapid growth in motor traffic over
recent years.
The proposed route will serve the urban and suburban commuter Phase 1 areas
of Ampang, Cheras, Petaling Jaya and Kepong.
The total estimated project cost includes a fixed-price contract with KLTG
of some 950m ringgits (Pounds 245m), subject to final terms and conditions.

FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Wall Street double act goes solo
but the song remains the same - Stephen Friedman has lost his co-chairman at
Goldman Sachs but there will be no change in the firm's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rare Wall Street double act has just become a solo performance, though the
song seems likely to remain the same.
For the past two years Goldman Sachs, one of the leading and most profitable
New York investment banks, has been presided over by co-chairmen: Mr Stephen
Friedman and Mr Robert Rubin. It is a management structure unique among top
Wall Street firms, though it has been used twice by Goldman over the past
two decades.
However, last month Mr Rubin, one of the top Democratic party members on
Wall Street, left Goldman to become President-elect Bill Clinton's special
assistant on economic affairs, and Mr Friedman became sole chairman.
It is the end of an era for Goldman: the two men, whom colleagues say have a
remarkable rapport, had worked closely together in senior positions since
the mid-1980s.
They were appointed co-chief operating officers in 1987 and took over the
joint chairmanship at the end of 1990 when Mr John Weinberg, the previous
incumbent, stepped down from day-to-day management.
The change invites two questions: who is Mr Friedman, a man with a
reputation for shunning publicity? And will Mr Rubin's departure mean any
shift in Goldman's strategy?
On the latter point, Mr Friedman gives an emphatic no. In a memo to staff
when Mr Rubin's White House appointment was announced, he stressed that
'apart from normal evolution, you should not expect any departures from the
managerial or strategic courses we have been on'.
Central to that strategy is the continued expansion of Goldman as one of the
world's few strongly international investment banks, with important
operations in the US, Europe and Asia. 'We want to be a truly global firm,'
Mr Friedman says.
'That doesn't mean trying to imitate the local firms in each market we're
in, because unless we bring something different to the party, there's no
particular reason to use us.'
Aged 54, but looking younger, he is a slim, fit man who likes to run -
'exercise is the best relaxer I know' - and has a low-key manner but a
reputation for crisp yet thoughtful management.
With an ivy league education and a training in law - Cornell University and
the Columbia University Law School - he joined Goldman in 1966 and was
fortuitously thrust into the then small, but rapidly expanding world of the
takeover advisory work.
'When I joined the merger department we were primarily selling family-owned
or relatively small companies, but during the next few years we pioneered
many of the techniques now standard in the industry,' he recalls.
One of these was the defence of companies against bid raids, out of which
grew a reputation, which Goldman retains today, for not acting on behalf of
hostile takeovers.
Takeover work became a key feature of Goldman's growth in the 1970s and
1980s, allowing it to build up strong relationships with corporate clients:
there is nothing closer to the centre of power than advising a chief
executive on group strategy.
In the mid-1980s, the firm moved into the European take-over market with
considerable success, though its sometimes brash tactics in the British
market have irritated some local investment banking rivals.
Mr Friedman became co-head of Goldman's investment banking business in the
early 1980s and helped build up the firm's strength in equity underwriting,
where it now usually ranks first or second in the US league tables.
With Mr Rubin, he revamped the firm's fixed income department from 1985 to
1988, taking the un-Goldman-like step of bringing in fresh talent from
outside, including some from much brasher rival Salomon Brothers. After
that, he shook up the firm's information systems and operations areas.
All this has given him broad exposure to Goldman's businesses and firm views
on how to preserve the group's particular culture, with its strong emphasis
on collegial teamwork, at a time of rapid international growth.
'The business is becoming increasingly inter-departmental and intricate,' he
says. 'You must have very short lines of communication and you must avoid
debates about transfer pricing (between departments) and turf. An enormous
amount of our management efforts have been directed to maximising teamwork
in these areas.'
Roughly 30 per cent of Goldman's 7,000 employees work abroad and Mr Friedman
says he wants an increasing proportion of managerial staff to be local
nationals, though this will have to be achieved within the 'one-firm Goldman
Sachs culture'. It is a culture which has long placed great emphasis on the
primacy of relationships with corporate clients - and Mr Friedman's
conversation is peppered with references to this. However, some Wall Street
critics question whether in recent years Goldman has, like several
investment banking rivals, subtly shifted its focus towards greater trading
on the firm's own account.
Critics have accused Goldman of being slow to react to market changes.
Retorts Mr Friedman: 'I think historically that was a valid criticism, but
certainly not in recent years, since we have been at the forefront of
innovation. We're a dramatically different firm than we were then.'
He and Mr Rubin had no formal division of responsibilities, though they both
say the joint chairmanship worked well. 'It's an approach I would only
recommend for people who have extremely good chemistry and are secure in
themselves, so they are not keeping score about who won how many debates,'
says Mr Friedman.
Mr Rubin, with his work for the Democratic Party, tended to be seen as the
public face of Goldman and his partner as the private face.
However, Mr Friedman tended to spend the greater time of the two in
Washington lobbying on securities industry issues and he insists that 'in
terms of client relationships we criss-crossed the globe roughly equally'.
Nor will the departure of Mr Rubin mean any significant change in the way
the firm is run, with executive decisions bounced around its relatively
young, 11-member management committee.
'I will certainly miss Bob,' says Mr Friedman, 'but its not as if either of
us was the other person's only sounding board.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Scotland and Swabia lead the
crusade to a new life - Continental venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL GRACE is not an ambitious linguist. He admits that when he wants to
order two beers in Catalonia - where he has a house - he finds the easiest
way is to say una birra twice.
Yet the deputy chief executive of Scottish Equitable, the Edinburgh-based
life assurance company, is leading one of the bolder drives into the
continental European market.
Last month it founded a joint venture with a large German insurance group.
It also has a foothold in the Italian savings market and is working on a
project in France.
Scottish companies have done well out of the life assurance and pensions
market in England, but few have developed further afield. For Scottish
Equitable the impetus to move on to the Continent came in 1988 when the
Department of Trade and Industry started advertising the single European
market.
'Our non-executive directors started urging us to take Europe seriously,'
says Mr Grace. 'They thought our policy holders would benefit from the
economies of scale we would be able to exploit.'
The company first commissioned an audit of its strengths and weaknesses from
Mrs Odile Pilley, a French academic at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
She found its staff to be strong in developing insurance products and in
fund management, but weak in foreign languages and cultural awareness of
other countries.
Yet Scottish Equitable has remained in no doubt of the opportunity offered
on the Continent, particularly once the EC's third life assurance directive
comes into force in July 1994. This should lead to deregulation and greater
competition in closely controlled markets such as Germany, Italy and France.
Governments there are finding their state pension operations increasingly
expensive, while German companies are worried about funding their pension
schemes.
Mrs Pilley drew up what Mr Grace calls 'a CV of the company'. This was
translated into the main continental languages, plus Dutch and Swedish, and
mailed to 200 insurance companies and financial institutions.
One of the respondents was Stuttgart-based Wurttembergische, one of
Germany's largest composite insurers with a big life assurance arm. It
wanted to gain British expertise in developing new products to supplement
the highly standardised endowment policies that predominate in Germany.
The relationship, which began in July 1990, was handled by Mr John Waterton,
a fluent German speaker. Aged 58, he joined Scottish Equitable after a
career in industry and, being married to an Italian, passed the cultural
awareness test.
He says the Germans were prepared to overlook Mr Grace's lack of fluency in
their tongue. Even with this disadvantage, the reassuring actuary had made
them feel 'he could help them adapt quickly to the deregulated environment'.
The German company soon decreed that all relevant executives learn English.
A further factor helped. According to Mr Grace, the Wurttembergische
executives are very conscious of being Swabians, the people who inhabit the
state of Baden-Wurttemberg of which Stuttgart is capital.
'Just as Scottish Equitable has expanded all over Britain from Scotland,
they have done the same in Germany from Swabia. Like the Scots, the Swabians
enjoy a reputation for canniness and thrift,' says Mr Grace who, like Mr
Waterton, is English.
The two companies announced the joint venture in October 1991 and launched
it last month under the name Allgemeine Rentenanstalt. The venture still
needs authorisation and will not start operating until the second half of
1993.
Although the single market should in theory mean that British-designed life
policies can be sold in Germany, this is not practicable because of
different tax structures. Instead, the venture will design products for the
German market which will be sold through Wurttembergische's sales network.
Its first target will be the personal pensions market.

FT  04 JAN 93 / People: Lex headhunts NEDs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lex Service, the car-retailing and leasing group, has been taking the
Cadbury recommendations seriously, and for the first time employed a firm of
headhunters in its search for two non-executive directors who, in the words
of Lex chairman and chief executive Sir Trevor Chinn, possessed a 'practical
approach to making change occur in large organisations'.
Eight years after the last non-executive appointment, Lex has picked Bill
Cockburn, the 49-year-old chief executive of the Post Office, and Michael
Ost, 48, who is chief executive of industrial holding company McKechnie.
Neither had met Sir Trevor before the search began, and Ost says he knew
next to nothing about the company either. For both men it is their first
outside directorship of a public company.
'The game is changing,' says Cockburn. 'There used to be this notion that
the chairman would ring up his chums and people would appear like
ornaments.' Not fancying just being an ornament, Cockburn, who stepped into
the top seat at the Post Office two months ago to preside over a 200,000
strong workforce and annual sales in excess of Pounds 5bn, adds: 'Lex may
have fewer noughts on some of its numbers than we do, but in its field it is
one of the biggest, and the management challenge is just as great.'
Working hard to promote a committed service culture at the Post Office, he
explains how interested he is in Sir Trevor's ideas about taking Lex's own
service culture to new levels. 'This quality issue is not just smarm and
schmaltz. There is of course a strong commercial drive.'
He was also impressed with the six-month long search which was 'as thorough
as for a full-time appointment, as far as I could tell. This signalled to me
the company was taking it all seriously.'
Ost, who says his board had agreed it would be of benefit all round if he
took one - and only one - outside directorship in an entirely non-competing
area - has spent 18 years living and working outside the UK, for a variety
of companies including United Technologies Corporation and Singer.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Europe Today - Ready to invade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ready to invade: Massed ranks of cars at the Nissan plant in Sunderland.
The headache for European car producers like Peugeot is not January 1, but
the year 2000 when the EC is to end restrictions on Japanese car imports,
writes William Dawkins.
'Our real challenge is to get ready for the Japanese arrival,' says Mr
Tristan d'Albis, the former French diplomat who is external relations
director of Peugeot, Europe's third largest car producer.
Peugeot's chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, has won notoriety for his
denunciations of the EC's weakness in conceding to Japan without obtaining
equal market access in return.
Yet beneath the sound and fury, his company has been quietly improving its
productivity - by 50 per cent over the past five years - and renewing its
model line to face the Japanese onslaught which it expects in two years or
so.
January 1, however, did see the replacement of France's bilateral import
limit on Japanese cars, amounting to 3 per cent of the market, with an
annually negotiated EC-wide quota until 2000.
Mr d'Albis does not believe this will detonate an instant explosion in
Japanese car sales to Europe because Japanese manufacturers appear to be
restraining export volumes to protect margins during the recession.
In any any case, the old bilateral French-Japanese quota had become almost
redundant because it did not include sales from Japanese 'transplant'
factories in the UK, memorably condemned by Mr Calvet as a 'Japanese
aircraft carrier' off the coast of Europe.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: From barricades to new frontiers
as Shell ponders the extremes - Predicting the future / Jim Gordon explains
the purpose of the oil group's long-term planning methods to Tony Jackson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN it comes to long-range thinking on big issues such as the future of
Europe, you can be sure of Shell.
Like other big oil companies, Shell plans its investments on a massive scale
stretching over the next 10 or 15 years. But for the real long term, it
relies on its own system of hypothetical world models, or scenarios.
These are in no sense predictions, says Mr Jim Gordon, Shell's European
co-ordinator. They are simply possible worlds, against which the company's
investment plans can be tested.
It is currently working on two of these world models. At one extreme is the
scenario it calls 'barricades'. The other is 'new frontiers'.
Barricades envisages a world dominated by competing trade blocs, one of them
presumably being Fortress Europe. There is free trade within the blocs,
protectionism between them.
New frontiers is an opposite world of trade without barriers, dominated by
the Gatt philosophy. Growth is faster, competition is keener and developing
countries grow more quickly than developed ones.
Either scenario, Mr Gordon says, would fundamentally affect the competitive
situation in Europe. Neither offers a particularly comfortable environment
for business to work in.
'Under the barricades scenario, one would assume that the prospect for
significant growth in the world economy is less. The trading blocs are still
large, and within that there will be quite fierce competition: you'll still
be fighting for your own home patch.
'In the case of new frontiers, there is growth, and through growth there is
investment opportunity, which helps you to survive. But the breakdown of
trade barriers gives rise to very real competitive forces on existing
players.'
The main thing to grasp about these scenarios, Mr Gordon says, is that
neither will actually happen.
'The big seduction of scenarios is that you use them to predict things with.
But they're not prediction models.'
So what are they for? 'To open up the mind of managers, such as myself, to
the possibility of real and significant change from the situation you're in
at the moment.
'When you're looking at your major strategic decisions, whether on projects
or the development of your people, they require long lead times. You test
the robustness of your basic assumptions against those rather different
conditions. So you avoid nice, linear extrapolations from the status quo.'
Let us take an example. At one extreme, the EC market might eventually end
up as unified as the US.
At the other, it could look more like the Balkans. What does the model say?
'You can describe it as looking like either. The thing about a scenario is
that it's supposed to be internally consistent. You're trying to describe
plausible worlds which could exist. Is there a fundamental incompatibility
between the general environment of the scenario and that assumption about
the political structure?'
Plainly, Mr Gordon has no intention of giving away what Shell really thinks.
There is a sound business reason for this.
The Shell method, the company believes, gives it a commercial edge. If it
published its expectations and everyone else followed suit, the exercise
would be self-defeating.
But he is prepared to offer a few thoughts on how Europe might develop in
the nearer term.
'It's your customer that determines the competitive climate more than
anything else. The single market brings with it a considerable enhancement
of consumer choice. It also increases the efficiency of the industrial and
economic process within Europe, which again is of direct benefit to the
customer.
'The single market means less bureaucracy, but very few of us in industry
would see that being of direct benefit to ourselves. In the main, the cost
savings will be passed on to the customer and add to the efficiency of the
economic process, which I think is a good thing.
'It also enhances the competitive climate in which European industries will
have to operate. National barriers will break down, both formally and
informally, in the sense that consumers become much more receptive to brands
and influences outside their traditional boundaries. So competition will
increase, which will make life tougher for European industry. That's not
necessarily a bad thing either.'
Part of the competition, of course, consists of uneconomic capacity from
eastern Europe. How long will this remain a problem?
'That varies a lot from industry to industry, but it'll probably take longer
rather than shorter. As we've seen from the rationalisation of some
industries in western Europe, it takes a long, long time for the cash cow
represented by these plants to dry up. And these east European industries do
two things besides: they provide employment, which governments are quite
correctly anxious to protect, and they are a source of foreign exchange.'
There are two other worries. First, how fast the single market will settle
down in reality.
'In legal formality, it's in place now. But the processes and checks to
ensure compliance with the legislation have still got to be tested.'
There is also a large question in Mr Gordon's mind about the kind of profit
margins available in the newly competitive single market, and whether
companies - Shell, British Steel or BASF, for instance - have low enough
overheads to make those margins possible in any case.
But these are mere short-term matters. As to the long term, he says, one
must consider the Arab proverb often quoted by one of Shell's chief planners
in the 1970s: he who foretells the future lies, even when he is correct.

READING LIST
You've read all about it - now it's time to see if you can play the game. A
new Europe is open for business and there are advantages to be won. But

FT  04 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) Europe comes down to earth to look for common
ground - A new realism across the Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 5th January 1993) appended to this article.
'EUROPE is not a melting pot like the US', the Swiss professor said in
impeccable English at the office of a Californian multinational in
French-speaking Geneva. 'It is a salad - and we must learn to manage
diversity.'
But can the chefs in Brussels concoct a meal to satisfy the diverse palates
gathered at the feast?
In Switzerland, apparently not. Only days before Prof Stephane Garelli,
regional chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, spoke of the European salad,
Swiss voters had rejected entry into the European Economic Area - the
European Community's waiting room - despite his appeal for a Yes vote.
As commercial Europe opens its doors today for the first full day's business
in the single market, the big question is: will the Euro-diet prove too rich
for all its citizens' tastes?
A 12-day odyssey in unscientific pursuit of western European public opinion
confirmed that, in the very broadest terms, the EC and its amorphous goal of
'ever closer union' is still approved by a substantial majority - at least
on the continent of Europe.
A growing body of opinion says the pace being set by a remote EC leadership
is too fast and even, some say, too far. Germans speak of their fears for
the D-Mark. The French are openly concerned that Brus-sels is no longer
behaving like a fully owned subsidiary.
Yet from the deserted streets in Elsinore, Hamlet's Danish fortress of
Euro-doubt, through dithering Switzerland to the federalist heartlands of
Alsace and Baden-Wurttemberg down to Brussels-besotted Madrid and the
Anglo-Levantine bazaar of Gibraltar, one opinion was also shared: like it or
not, last month's Edinburgh summit has got the stalled European juggernaut
rolling again.
The new cement of European solidarity is worry that an overbearing
Eurocracy, daydreaming over expense account lunches, is unaware of the
recession being endured by taxpayers.
The Community's popularity was faltering long before Denmark's No and
France's much-derided petit oui in last summer's referendums. To Mr
Karlheinz Reif, head of the European Commission's opinion pollster,
Eurobarometer, changes in attitudes could be detected as far back as 1989,
even in such avowedly pro-EC countries as France and Italy.
A growing awareness of the imminent single market began to drag perceptions
of Europe down from the clouds. It would influence individual lives and,
hence, for the first time, became worthy of critical scrutiny.
Maastricht, Mr Reif says, brought something already lurking in the back of
the European psyche out into the open: 'Ordinary Europeans have stopped
seeing the EC as peace and security and have started looking at it more
closely.'
It is in the nature of views that the topography depends on the vantage
point of the spectator. Furthermore, few, if any, believe that they have any
chance of altering the landscape.
                        *      *      *
That sense of political impotence was tangible among Danes on the 17.44
stopping train from Elsinore to Copenhagen. With the ink on the Edinburgh
summit conclusions barely dry, Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, had
claimed with a politician's characteristic hyperbole 'a great day for
Denmark'.
Cradling a bouquet of treaty opt-outs, he warned his fellow citizens that
they must now choose between EC membership or leaving the Community. In one
carriage, however, his upbeat tone had fallen on cynical ears.
Sannah Jensen, a 24-year-old student, confessed many doubts but said she
would vote Yes again. Attributing anti-EC feeling largely to residual
anti-German nationalism from the 1864 war and the summer tide of tourists on
Denmark's beaches, she said: 'Every honest Dane says that now we have 11
countries that want to do something, we don't have a right to say you can't
do it.'
Yet only a few metres away, Brigitte, a nutrition student, fervently
disagreed. She pledged to vote No again to register her fury that her first
vote now appeared to have been arbitrarily invalidated. 'How many times are
we to vote? The government is trying to browbeat us with scare tactics - it
seems everything has been decided a long time ago.'
                        *      *      *
Similar fears of manipulation were shared, in altogether different
circumstances, some 700 miles away in Liechtenstein, the tiny principality
tucked up next to eastern Switzerland and linked to its neighbour by a
70-year-old customs union.
But was the Liechten-steiners' convincing vote to join the EEA a gesture of
independence from Berne after the Swiss's No vote a week previously? Or was
it a statement of dependence on the wider European market?
In a triumphant news conference, Prince Hans-Adam II praised his 30,000
subjects for following his persistent cable TV campaign to vote 'Yes to
Europe'. Yet both sides in Liechtenstein were united at least by agreeing
that their quest was not for Utopia but merely the least bad option.
                        *      *      *
It is a measure of the anxiety being generated by the combination of
recession and the European debate that Switzerland shuddered in self-doubt
after the referendum outcome in its tiny neighbour.
Much has been made of the schism in the Swiss poll on the EEA between the
German-speaking cantons' No and the French-speakers' Yes. Yet in the big
German-speaking cities, the Yes vote was also a majority. It was
conservative rural voters who bedecked their cars with appeals to 700 years
of neutrality and freedom.
With total Swiss unemployment up from 19,000 in August 1990 to 130,000
today, cold economic winds are playing their part in the debate, undermining
the nation's traditional view that it is safer out than in. 'Five years ago
we barely discussed EC membership,' one nationalist proclaimed. 'Now we
discuss nothing else.'
In urbane, metropolitan Geneva, the peasants' revolt is brushed aside by
executives at the US-based computer company Hewlett-Packard. Representing 35
nationalities and speaking a dozen languages, they earn in Swiss francs but
often enjoy the lower French cost of living across the border.
'The Swiss are naturally cautious,' said one. 'They have voted once. They
will vote again and again until they come round.'
                        *      *      *
Such sentiments are shared in the European Parliament in Strasbourg where
ideological differences nearly dissolve in the multi-partisan objective of a
deeper, wider Europe fit for Euro-politicians to play in. If absolute power
corrupts absolutely, then practically no power seems to do much the same.
On the day Mr John Major was greeted with boos and hisses and Mr Jacques
Delors declared 'time is on our side', it was hard not to conclude that
diversity of opinion is no more welcome in Europe's political capital than
it was in the Soviet Union.
In the words of Belgium's Mr Willy de Clercq, a one-time European
commissioner: 'We in the parliament believe Maastricht was too little, too
late.' And, indeed, that progress towards a united Europe was 'not fast
enough'.
But whose views do these people's representatives actually represent? In
more than 60 interviews across the continent, only one European voter argued
that the pace of union was too slow. Mr de Clercq now heads a committee
charged with explaining to the citizenry that 'those who want to stop in the
middle of the river are going to drown'.
But was that what Europeans really wanted? Mr de Clercq was dismissive. 'I
think it is more or less known what the European citizen wants', he said,
contradicting himself only minutes later when he agreed with Mr Delors'
statement that the Community was a good product that was proving hard to
sell.
                        *      *      *
What, in that case, can be sold to humble mortals on terra firma? At the
Mercedes-Benz plant in Stuttgart or the Citroen repair shop in Lyons, few
use such esoteric Euro-terminology as Mr Delors' 'variable geometry' to
describe their plans for the future.
From cities where memories of the second world war are still vivid, most
workers remain loyal to Monnet's and Schuman's vision of European unity. But
it is the recession, immigration and jobs - and Brussels' apparent
powerlessness to address these issues - that are canteen talk in the German
plant, now on an extended Christmas lay-off, and worry the redundancy-riven
workshop in Lyons.
Of the MEPs interviewed in Strasbourg, it was Mr Bruno Gollnisch of France's
widely despised, extreme-right National Front, who seemed to be addressing
many of these 'live', if unfashionable issues. But his nationalist solutions
appeared to have surprisingly little resonance in Stuttgart.
Only the Ossis - the former citizens of East Germany - proved decidedly
illiberal compared with their western compatriots. One of these, Steffen, a
maintenance worker, insisted the Community was 'all right as it is, and
should remain so', but he firmly rejected a single currency and demanded
immigration controls.
His colleagues from further east differed only over who should be allowed
in. 'We could come in more or less straight away,' said a Hungarian, 'and
maybe the Czech lands . . . but the rest should stay out.'
In Mr Gollnisch's home territory of Lyons, the most overt racism among
diners at Les Six Troyens restaurant appeared to be against the
foot-dragging British. But among the younger French clientele, a
'Maastricht, Non' psychology is growing.
'European unification means one government,' said a bearded travelling
salesman. 'That was Yugoslavia before, and look at it today. . . '
                        *      *      *
Only in Madrid was it possible to encounter levels of European rapture
capable of registering on the de Clercq scale. At the Fundacion March, a
group of post-graduate political scientists groped to explain why Spanish
public opinion was so universally uncritical towards the Community and its
works.
'It is a choice between Africa and Europe,' said one cynic with a sheepish
grin. Another more reflectively proposed: 'Only people - like the British
and Danes - who think the government of the Community is less responsible
than their own can afford the luxury of questioning it.'
                        *      *      *
Back in Switzerland, Prof Garelli, former director of the World Business
Forum at Davos, contends that the Single European Act was the catalyst for a
single market modelled on the business agenda for the so-called 'Bankers'
Europe' so detested by left and hard right alike. It was now the duty of the
politicians, he said, to make their programme relevant to popular demands.
A cursory rummage though continental public opinion suggests that the
Maastricht equation needs retuning if it is to achieve that end. If not,
there is a danger of creating a divided Community: a middle-class adventure
playground, full of opportunities for the multilingual executive with any
eye to the main chance, but for the less privileged, a bleaker place, prone
to destructive extremism.
Away from politics, however, it is not all bad news. Inch by inch, month by
month, human European bonds are strengthening. The transport network grows
yearly more remarkable, the frontiers less notice able.
British pub bores can now drone on about the roadworks on the Autoroutes,
but they do so over warm beer.
The Spanish still guard their eccentric working hours and the Greeks their
cheap cigarettes and affluent German tourists.
As yet, the bratwurst in a croissant has still to be invented.

MORE THAN 100 people were killed in a battle between forces of the Angolan
government and the former rebel movement Unita in the southern city of
Lubango yesterday, the Angolan government news agency Angop said, Reuter
reports from Lisbon.
Government forces now controlled Lubango, capital of Huila province, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted Angop as saying.
It added that Unita's military commander in the region, Brigadier Padrinho
Pilartes, had been captured.
Mr Jorge Valentim, spokesman for Unita, earlier accused government forces in
Lubango of attacking Unita positions in the city with armoured vehicles,
artillery and aircraft.
In its report from the Angolan capital Luanda, Lusa quoted Angop as saying
that nearly 100 Unita fighters were killed in one gunfight at the Hotel
Imperio in Lubango.
Mr Valentim, Unita's secretary for information, said earlier that the
fighting began yesterday morning and lasted about three hours before UN
peace-keeping forces brought about a truce. He said the battle had been
sparked off by a government attack on Unita positions, launched by the
city's military commander.
Angop said Unita forces tried unsuccessfully to capture the local television
station and they continued to shell Lubango airport, a key air force base,
after fighting in the city had ended.
Mr Valentim said Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita's leader, had told UN
representatives in Angola that senior officials from Unita and the ruling
MPLA should meet next week to put the peace process back on track. Mr
Savimbi lost presidential elections to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and
the MPLA in September
Mr Valentim said it was important that the MPLA and Unita meet so that the
UN would have grounds for renewing the mandate of its peace-keeping forces
in Angola. This expires at the end of January.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Diplomats take pragmatic view of Kenyan poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>

   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTION day was peaceful and there was a large turnout. And while the
incumbent president's victory over his three challengers was marred by
electoral 'irregularities', on balance it was a step forward, the senior US
official concluded, writes Michael Holman in Nairobi.
That seemingly pragmatic response to Mr Samuel Doe's victory in Liberia's
rigged elections of October 1985 is finding an echo in Kenya as western
governments take stock after President Daniel arap Moi's success last
Tuesday.
Liberia 1985 is not Kenya 1993. But as the US, Britain and other governments
endorse - with reservations - Mr Moi's disputed election success and
contemplate resuming aid, the rationale underlying western policy seems
similar.
Then, as now, the US had to deal with a determined leader, a long-standing
ally who was embarking on the path of reform, albeit slowly or imperfectly.
Then, as now, the analysis of the election outcome was open to question.
Accommodation rather than confrontation seems again to be the chosen tactic.
At the weekend one of Mr Moi's most forthright critics urged Kenya's
opposition leaders to accept the results of the poll. 'Democracy is not
always won in a day,' said Mr Smith Hempstone, US ambassador. 'A parliament
in which the opposition will hold a minimum of 75 seats out of 200 is one in
which the will of the people can at least be articulated.'
The British High Commission in Nairobi believed the results 'were largely in
line with what the people wanted', a view shared by the Commonwealth
observer group. Mr Justice Telford Georges, the group's chairman, said:
'However imperfectly, the results in many instances reflect. . . the will of
the people. It constitutes a giant step down the road to multiparty
democracy.'
Yet the conclusion that Mr Moi's victory indicates, albeit imperfectly,
'what the people wanted' is not self-evident.
The presidential tallies of 1.8m for Mr Moi, 1.3m for Mr Kenneth Matiba, 1m
for Mr Mwai Kibaki and 892,000 for Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga suggest most
voters wanted change. The constituency count - 96 for Kanu, 31 for
Ford-Kenya, 26 for Ford-Asili, 20 for DP and three for independents - gives
Mr Moi a narrow majority in the 188-seat assembly, which will increase when
he exercises his right to appoint 12 MPs. Yet limited and selective rigging
could have radically influenced the outcome.
In the presidential race, the winner must not only achieve a simple majority
but also secure 25 per cent of the votes cast in five of Kenya's eight
provinces. Failure to do so means a run-off.
Mr Moi fulfilled the second condition in the necessary five provinces; but
the key factor was the controversial North-Eastern province on the Somali
border, which has 10 constituencies and a registered electorate of 141,000.
Only 62,000 voted, 75 per cent of them for Mr Moi, while Kanu took eight
seats.
Yet this key province was all but inaccessible to opposition parties,
ostensibly on security grounds, a fact criticised by all observer groups.
Some Kenyan analysts argue that the level of support for Mr Moi and Kanu is
surprising given the government's record of heavy-handed administration of
the area.
Had Mr Moi not won 25 per cent of the vote, he would be facing a run-off
against Mr Matiba. And had Kanu faced competition for the seats it is
conceivable the opposition would have done better.
And had the results been different in only a handful of seats in other
provinces where the government is accused of rigging, Kanu would not have
won a parliamentary majority.
Even if Mr Moi won the presidential run-off, the opposition parties would
have been able to dominate the parliamentary arena. As it is, they are
having to debate the merits of participation as the minority bloc.
Consultations over the weekend will help decide the boycott-or-participate
debate. Either outcome will prove controversial; what the people want is not
quite as clear as diplomats maintain.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Kenya to decide on Fresh elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S three main opposition leaders were last night meeting to decide
whether to pursue their demand for fresh elections, writes Michael Holman.
Leaders of FORD Kenya, FORD Asili and the Democratic party came under
growing pressure during the weekend from western diplomats. They were urged
to reconsider their call, which western governments regard as unwise and
impractical.
Instead, the parties have been advised to function as a powerful
parliamentary opposition.
Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary-general, is due to arrive in
Nairobi today to help ease what has become a tense stand-off between
President Daniel arap Moi and the opposition.
'It is my earnest hope that government and political leaders will find ways
to work together for the peace, health, prosperity and unity of Kenya,'
Chief Anyaoku said in a statement.

FT  04 JAN 93 / People: Lex headhunts NEDs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lex Service, the car-retailing and leasing group, has been taking the
Cadbury recommendations seriously, and for the first time employed a firm of
headhunters in its search for two non-executive directors who, in the words
of Lex chairman and chief executive Sir Trevor Chinn, possessed a 'practical
approach to making change occur in large organisations'.
Eight years after the last non-executive appointment, Lex has picked Bill
Cockburn, the 49-year-old chief executive of the Post Office, and Michael
Ost, 48, who is chief executive of industrial holding company McKechnie.
Neither had met Sir Trevor before the search began, and Ost says he knew
next to nothing about the company either. For both men it is their first
outside directorship of a public company.
'The game is changing,' says Cockburn. 'There used to be this notion that
the chairman would ring up his chums and people would appear like
ornaments.' Not fancying just being an ornament, Cockburn, who stepped into
the top seat at the Post Office two months ago to preside over a 200,000
strong workforce and annual sales in excess of Pounds 5bn, adds: 'Lex may
have fewer noughts on some of its numbers than we do, but in its field it is
one of the biggest, and the management challenge is just as great.'
Working hard to promote a committed service culture at the Post Office, he
explains how interested he is in Sir Trevor's ideas about taking Lex's own
service culture to new levels. 'This quality issue is not just smarm and
schmaltz. There is of course a strong commercial drive.'
He was also impressed with the six-month long search which was 'as thorough
as for a full-time appointment, as far as I could tell. This signalled to me
the company was taking it all seriously.'
Ost, who says his board had agreed it would be of benefit all round if he
took one - and only one - outside directorship in an entirely non-competing
area - has spent 18 years living and working outside the UK, for a variety
of companies including United Technologies Corporation and Singer.

FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Maple Leaf doubles its estate
with Allied deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAPLE LEAF Inns, the joint venture created last year by Labatt, the Canadian
brewer, and Pubmaster, the Brent Walker subsidiary, has doubled the size of
its estate by acquiring the leases of 73 pubs from Allied Breweries.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Maple Leaf is acquiring the
pubs on 10-year leases, with an option to buy the freeholds after two years.
Mr John Brackenbury, chairman of Pubmaster and also of Maple Leaf, said: 'We
intend to continue the company's expansion throughout 1993 and are currently
considering a number of other acquisition opportunities from several
different parties.'
Maple Leaf was launched last June and bought its initial 77 pubs in two
deals with Bass Taverns, the most recent of which was signed in September.
It intends to expand its state to a total of 1,000 pubs nationally.
The company's first pubs were concentrated principally in the north-west of
England, the Midlands and in Wales. The new deal extends the estate's
geographical reach by adding a further concentration of pubs in the home
counties and London, as well as more outlets in the east Midlands.
Maple Leaf's pubs stock a range of national and regional ales and lagers,
including Labatt's. The Canadian brewer also has national distribution
throughout Pubmaster's 2,026-strong national estate following a distribution
deal signed by the two companies last year.
Pubmaster's estate doubled in size last year as a result of successive pub
acquisition deals with Allied-Lyons, Whitbread and Bass. Pubmaster intends
to continue its expansion to an estate extending to 3,500 pubs nationally.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Apocalypse, but not just now -
Business and politics / 'Where will all these people go? We won't need them
if we are going to utilise Europe as one market.' Percy Barnevik, head of
ABB, talks to Guy de Jonquieres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Mr Percy Barnevik, president of ABB, the world's largest power
engineering group, the advent of the single market marks the fulfilment of a
long-cherished dream.
Yet as he examines Europe's prospects, the picture he sees is tinged with
the shades of an incipient nightmare.
Since 1987, when Mr Barnevik master-minded the merger of Sweden's Asea with
Switzerland's Brown Boveri, he has acquired a reputation as a far-sighted
and decisive manager.
The merger - the first in a wave of big cross-border deals - has been
followed by about 70 further acquisitions on both sides of the Atlantic.
Driven by a vision of Europe without frontiers, ABB has been reshaped into a
decentralised transnational enterprise, equipped to operate freely across
borders. Mr Barnevik, a 51-year-old Swede, says it is at home in all the 140
countries in which it operates, yet owes fealty to none.
But while he remains convinced that the strategy is right, he is
increasingly worried that the leap forward represented by EC integration
will be jeopardised by long-term economic problems and by growing
instability on Europe's eastern borders. At worst, he fears, the fabric of
European cohesion will start to unravel.
His prime concern is not that the single market programme will prove
still-born. Indeed, he is confident that, despite some rearguard
protectionism, EC public procurement markets will steadily open up to
competition as purchasers seek better value for money.
ABB's pursuit of increased efficiency and faster decision-making has earned
it a reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter. In four years it has shed 50,000
jobs, while increasing turnover 60 per cent to Dollars 28.8bn in 1991. 'We
grow all the time, but we also shrink all the time,' says Mr Barnevik.
But the company still has more plants making more products than its main
competitors in the US and Japan. 'We have six production centres for bogies
and five design centres for traction motors, where only one or two of each
are needed. All that has to be standardised, Europeanised,' he says.
It is at this point that the doubts start to creep in. If economies are to
benefit fully from integration, he says, industry must continue to slim
down.
Yet by doing so, it risks creating a backlash which will thwart further
restructuring: 'All hell breaks loose when we want to close a plant because
half the workers walk into unemployment.'
He believes the problem is not rooted in recession, but in inexorable
advances in productivity. He forecasts that the proportion of Europe's
labour force employed in manufacturing and business services will fall from
about 35 per cent today to 25 per cent in 10 years' time - and to 15 per
cent a decade later.
'Where will all these people go? Out they will go, because we won't need
them if we really are going to utilise Europe as one market.'
In addition, public sector payrolls will fall sharply as governments are
compelled to curb spending and become more efficient. Mr Barnevik reckons
the result will be a shake-out comparable to that in agricultural employment
earlier this century. But this time, surplus labour will be much harder to
absorb because service industries are too sluggish to create enough well
paid jobs.
'If anybody tells me, wait two or three years and there will be a hell of a
demand for labour, I say, tell me where. What jobs? In what cities? Which
companies? When I add it all together, I find a clear risk that the 10 per
cent unemployed or underemployed today could easily become 20 to 25 per
cent.'
'If you look at service industries, there are highly paid people, like
lawyers and investment bankers, and then there are the cleaners and guest
workers who earn a third or half as much as skilled factory workers. So we
end up either with permanent unemployment or under-employment, or with two
classes of differently paid people. Both are social dynamite. That is
exactly what will create Fortress Europe. That is what will hamper
restructuring.'
The blame cannot, he says, be laid on government policies, nor does he see
any clear solution: 'If I knew the answer, I should probably win Nobel
prizes in several subjects.'
Yet, he insists, the problem pales into insignificance compared with the
threat to western Europe's future posed by economic disintegration in
eastern and central Europe.
'It is tragic to see what is happening. The desperation, the disappointment,
people feeling cheated. What is so terrible is to see these lost
opportunities, the political destabilisation and the threat to economic
development in all of Europe happening before our eyes.'
Yet the west's response so far has been supine and impassive, he says.
Without much more decisive action, it will pay a heavy price in the form of
a massive influx of refugees, which will strain social cohesion to breaking
point.
Here, he does have a solution to propose. Western governments should sharply
increase financial aid over three to five years and back it with generous
long-term soft loans, freer market access for exports from eastern Europe
and political insurance for western companies investing there.
'Today, nine out of ten western executives say, let's wait, this is too
unstable, I can't handle the inflation, I don't speak the language. So they
stay out. We must get people in there to introduce the market economy, to
organise, to bring computers in, to teach accounting and English, to tell
them how to export, purchase and calculate product costs.'
This may sound like special pleading by a company which has expanded rapidly
in eastern Europe and is seeking to limit its risks. Yet Mr Barnevik insists
ABB can look after itself. He cites its operations in Poland, where it has
taken only 18 months for ABB's 10,000 workers in eight factories to achieve
western quality and productivity levels.
'These people work like crazy. This isn't the third world. Take Russia. It
has 12m engineers and 1m PhDs. Russia's strength is not its oil, it is its
people. But you have to organise them, motivate them and get them into a
normal model of a market economy,' Mr Barnevik says.
'The positive side is that if you do these things right, they can be a major
force for stimulation because new markets open up with tremendous needs for
telecommunications, energy, transport, health care, you name it.'
The drawback is that few western politicians seem ready to contemplate a
programme which, Mr Barnevik concedes, would entail short-term sacrifices by
the west. 'They tell me it is politically impossible, not least in a time of
recession, to advocate more public expenditure.' My conclusion is that we
don't have a political system which rewards long-term thinking and looking
beyond your own borders.'
That will not prevent him from continuing to grab every opportunity to ram
home the message that it is in the west's self-interest to act, and that
there is not much time left.
'We have to tackle the problem immediately. We are too late already. If you
sacrifice a little now, you will get the benefits. If you just sit there and
sacrifice nothing, you will get the refugees and will have to maintain your
military forces. Then you sacrifice your future and a hell of a lot more. We
should not talk about sacrifice. We should talk about how to protect
ourselves.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / Plan for Bosnia stirs disputes: The Moslems object to
suggested boundaries but at least all sides are prepared to discuss the
EC-UN proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina has the merit of having been accepted
for the first time as a basis for negotiation by all the warring parties.
However, many of its detailed provisions are still hotly disputed.
At the heart of the disagreements about the plan - tabled in Geneva at the
weekend by the two co-chairmen of the international conference on the former
Yugoslavia, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen - lie Bosnian Moslem objections to
some of the boundaries of the proposed 10 essentially autonomous provinces
making up the new decentralised state, in which Serbian Moslems would
control nearly 50 per cent of the territory of the former Yugoslav republic
of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
What Mr Vance, the United Nations' special representative, and Lord Owen,
representing the European Community, have proposed is a constitution which
would recognise the three big ethnic groups - Moslems, Serbs and Croats - as
the constituent units of the new state, as well as a group of 'others'.
In spite of all their avowed efforts to eschew a purely ethnic division of
the country by taking other relevant factors - such as history, geography,
the economic situation and communications - fully into account, they have,
in the end, had to draw the provincial boundaries largely on the basis of
ethnic criteria.
Thus, each of the main ethnic groups will be dominant in three provinces,
with Sarajevo remaining a 'mixed' province. That will allow the Serbs to
retain extensive, but by no means all, areas they have 'ethnically
cleansed'. Though the Serbs have demanded a corridor linking two of their
assigned provinces, they feel they can do a territorial deal with the
Croats.
That is very different from the attitude of the Bosnian Moslems, who not
only feel they are being deprived of territory they consider their
birthright, but who fear that the Serb and Croat provinces will some day
organise referendums on whether to merge with their parent states, Serbia
and Croatia.
The central government, as well as all the new provinces, except the 'mixed'
province of Sarajevo, would have separate democratically elected
legislatures, democratically chosen chief executives and independent
judiciaries. The nine-member presidency of the new state would be composed
of three representatives each of the three main constituent ethnic groups.
The three main ethnic groups would also be equally represented in the
provincial government of Sarajevo, while the capital itself would become an
'open city', which should be demilitarised at the earliest possible date.
The state of Bosnia-Hercegovina should also be progressively demilitarised
under UN-EC supervision.
In keeping with the principle of freedom of movement throughout the new
state, laid down in the draft constitution, the co-chairmen have proposed
'throughways' between provinces, policed by UN or other international
forces, to ensure that the free flow of traffic is not obstructed and that
military forces or material do not move through these crossings.
Special 'blue routes' guaranteeing safe passage to humanitarian aid and
civilians to and from Sarajevo, which, after the cessation of hostilities,
would be extended to cover the whole country until normal freedom of
movement is established, have also been proposed.
The separation of the armed forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina would have to be
negotiated in the light of provincial boundaries and the co-chairmen have
proposed the areas to which the various forces should withdraw. It is
envisaged that there will be no military forces in Sarajevo province.
Once the new constitution is agreed and there is a return to normal civil
life, elections supervised by the UN and the EC would take place. But Lord
Owen said this was unlikely to happen for 'a considerable number of months'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Under the proposals tabled in Geneva at the weekend by Mr Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen, Bosnia-Hercegovina would become a decentralised state of 10
largely autonomous provinces.
It is proposed that the three main ethnic groups in Bosnia-Hercegovina -
Moslems, Serbs and Croats - should each be allocated three provinces in
which they will have a large majority. Sarajevo province would remain a
mixed community and Sarajevo should become a demilitarised 'open city'.
Under the proposals, the provinces marked with the numbers 1, 5 and 9 would
have a predominantly Moslem population; 2, 4 and 6 would be peopled largely
by Serbs, with a Moslem minority in 4; and 3, 8 and 10 would have a majority
of Croats, with a strong minority of Moslems, particularly in 10.

GERMAN unemployment is likely to surge by at least 400,000 this year,

The increase will be even higher if the government carries out its threat to
cut subsidies which currently support up to 800,000 jobs in the east, he
warned in a radio interview.
The number of people without jobs in the west, now approaching 2m, will
increase by 300,000, he said. Unemployment in the east, currently just over
1m, will go up by 100,000.
Mr Franke, who retires at the end of this month, claimed his office's DM88bn
(Pounds 36.2bn) budget for 1993 was far from sufficient. Bonn, which is
struggling to contain public spending, would have to find an extra DM10bn to
top up contributory schemes.
Although official figures put the jobless at 3m, there are a further 2.3m
'hidden' unemployed - 1.8m in the east and 500,000 in the west - who are not
registered. These include people in re-training, job creation and
educational schemes, for whom prospects look grim.
According to Mr Klaus Murmann, head of the BVA federal employers'
association, 5.5m people will be without a 'proper' job at the end of 1993.
The proportion of westerners currently unemployed is around 6 per cent, but
absolute numbers are threatening to reach records levels.
In the east, where full employment was the rule until unification, numbers
employed have fallen from 9.8m to 6.2m. According to Mr Franke, given
'normal economic development' and the injection over 10 years of DM1,300bn
in private and public investment, this should level off at around 7m.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Behind the window-dressing of the January sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW YEAR is, traditionally, a time to be upbeat about economic
prospects, as Mr John Major, the British prime minister, demonstrated last
Friday with his new year prediction that a recovery would finally arrive
sometime in 1993.
This year there is no shortage of possible reasons for optimism: Europe's
single market, America's new president, Britain's freedom to cut interest
rates, and the fact that 1993 could hardly be worse than 1992.
Stock market investors certainly seem to believe in the power of the
calendar to alter economic realities. Most of the world's main stock markets
experience a significant rally at the turn of the year, the so-called
January effect, as the chart shows. With the exception of Germany, every
country shown has a significantly higher monthly return in January than in
any other month of the year.
In the UK, for example, the FT All-Share index has risen in 23 of the 28
Januarys since 1965. Last year the FT All-Share index rose by 3.7 per cent
in January, three times the average monthly rise of 1.2 per cent in 1992, in
line with the historical January effect shown in the chart.
This January effect does not, in fact, tend to be restricted to January
itself. The US turn-of-the-year rally, like the January sales, normally
starts a week before the new year and fades after the first week. But
research by Mr Mushtaq Shah and Mr Paul Kong of Goldman Sachs shows that in
the UK, France and Italy, abnormal returns in January have tended, over the
past 20 years, to persist into February.
Timing is not the only difference between the US and European new year
rallies. The US January effect tends to be a small-company event, with
large-capitalisation stocks showing little evidence of a January bounce. But
Shah and Kong found no evidence to suggest that the same is true in Europe,
while, in the UK, the opposite is the case. The average January return on a
portfolio of large-capitalisation stocks, the FT-30 index, was 4 per cent in
the period 1980-91, compared to 2.9 per cent for the FT-500 index.
Will the US and European stock markets rally this January? That they have
tended to in the past may be sufficient to ensure that history will repeat
itself, so long as enough investors believe that the January effect exists
and feel more optimistic at the beginning of the year than towards the end.
A more rational explanation is tax-loss selling: taxable US investors tend
to sell stocks whose value has declined over the year, in December, to
realise the capital loss for tax purposes. But this cannot explain the
international evidence. Japan has a January effect even though it has no
capital gains tax, while the UK tax year ends in April.
New Year window-dressing by portfolio managers may provide a better
explanation. While fund managers are keen to hold undervalued stocks, Shah
and Kong hypothesise, they prefer to avoid poor performing stocks appearing
in their end-of-year reports. So stocks which have done badly over the year
tend to be sold in December and then repurchased in the New Year. The
evidence appears to support the window-dressing story. Among the countries
shown in the chart, the January rally tends to be larger when the market is
undervalued, that is when the average yield on bonds relative to equities is
lower than its historical average.
If the under-valuation thesis is correct, then investors can expect strong
January rallies this year in some big European markets. The ratio of bond
yields to those in equity markets is currently significantly lower in the
UK, France, Spain, Sweden and Norway than the average yield ratio over the
past 20 years.
The UK's relatively low yield ratio may suggest that any equity market
revival should persist beyond January now that sterling has left the
European exchange rate mechanism. UK share prices would have to rise by 10
per cent to restore the yield ratio to its historical average. But all
depends on whether Mr Major's predicted recovery proves to be more than
wishful new year thinking.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Arms treaty is a hostage to fortune - Potential dangers for
Start 2
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
START 2 is, as Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin stressed yesterday,
uniquely radical among arms treaties: it has sharply reduced armaments
rather than, as Mr Bush said, simply 'freezing the arms race in place'.
Its radicalism, and the speed with which it was signed ('a matter of a few
months', said Mr Yeltsin proudly yesterday, contrasting it with 15 years for
the first Start treaty) means that it faces three large potential dangers,
which there has been no time to defuse.
First, such large cuts will take time: all of 10 years, to 2003, for the two
countries to bring down their strategic weaponry to the 3,000-3,500 warheads
permitted (plus a maximum of 1,750 submarine-launched warheads). In that
period, relations between the two states could worsen - will worsen, if the
feared lurch to Russian authoritarianism happens.
This could mean a breaching of the treaties, a freezing of the missiles'
destruction (the more so since this is agreed to be done with US assistance)
and a return to arms build-up.
Second, the opposition to the treaties within the Russian parliament is
strong - though Mr Yeltsin confidently declared yesterday that it was 'not
the majority', being confined to those who 'are against everything positive
which occurs in Russia'.
Opponents have already latched on to what they say are unequal aspects in
the treaty, claiming that the provisions for inspection give US officials
carte blanche on Russian territory. The claim forced Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the
foreign minister, to tell parliament on December 10 that the arrangements
were predicated on Russia receiving Dollars 400m (Pounds 263.1m) to assist
the dismantling of the weapons and that they 'freed our citizens from an
additional burden of defence spending'.
However, the opposition deputies share, and seek to stimulate, a feeling of
shame in Russia that it is reduced to inequality by comparison with its
historic enemy, the US. Mr Iona Andronov, deputy chairman of the
parliament's international relations committee, said last month 'this
agreement. . . has brought a great nation to its knees'. Mr Yeltsin,
however, has made a point of involving Mr Yevgenny Ambartsumov, chairman of
the international relations committee, in the talks: Mr Ambartsumov, a
one-time radical who now takes a moderately nationalist position, will give
vital support in parliament.
Third, there remains the Ukrainian problem. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan
retain strategic nuclear arms (they have sent their more numerous tactical
weapons to Russia). All three states have twice mutually promised to
renounce nuclear weapons: once in Alma Ata in December 1991 and again in
Lisbon last May. All have committed themselves to ratifying Start and to
signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Only Kazakhstan, so far, has ratified Start. Ukraine, as the largest of the
non-Russian nuclear powers, is demonstrating what Mr Bohdan Kravchenko, an
adviser to the country's government, recently admitted was an 'ambivalent'
position. It has insisted on exercising sovereignty over all the 176 nuclear
missiles deployed on its territory (saying it was ensuring their 'non-use');
it is now seeking security guarantees in return for the pledge to destroy
warheads - a pledge which has anyway shifted from being executed by 1994 to
the end of this decade.
In a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, Mr Zalmay Khalilzad, former
US assistant deputy under-secretary of defence, claimed that 'the mood in
Kiev is shifting against disarmament' and forecast that the parliamentary
debate on Start and NPT scheduled for next month 'is. . . likely to demand
their renegotiation'. Were this to be Ukraine's position, it is likely that
neighbouring Belarus, at least, would follow suit.
After the triumphs of Moscow yesterday, Ukraine becomes the focus of
diplomatic efforts to address its fears about non-nuclear life next to a
nuclear Russia.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
START 2 at a glance:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation will be achieved in two stages up to the year 2003,
interim ceilings to be reached in the first seven years after the treaty
enters into force.
 -By January 1, 2003, total number of strategic nuclear warheads held by
  each side to have been reduced to 3,000-3,500 units. This means the
  elimination of 15,000 of the two sides' current combined arsenals of
  21,000 warheads.
 -Land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with multiple
  warheads to be eliminated.
 -Each side to cut the number of warheads on submarine-launched
  ballistic missiles (SLBMs) to a level of 1,700-1,750 units.
 -Limits to be imposed on number of warheads with which heavy bombers
  on each side can be equipped, varying from 750 to 1,250 units of any
  type.

FT  04 JAN 93 / VAT spreads as central Europe reforms taxes

CENTRAL Europe's determined effort to prepare for full membership of the
European Community by the turn of the century moved a step further at the
weekend as the new Czech Republic and Slovakia combined the achievement of
separate statehood with introduction of value added tax.
Harmonisation of tax systems among EC members was one requirement for
creating the European single market, whose present boundaries do not extend
beyond the eastern borders of Germany. But tax reform has posed special
problems for the former communist countries of east and central Europe which
had neither graduated personal income taxes, nor corporation taxes, nor
VAT-type consumption taxes.
Over the last two years task forces of western tax experts have been working
in central Europe under the auspices of the Centre for Co-operation with
European Economies in Transition, the main conduit for technical assistance
to the former communist states set up by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, the Paris-based economic think-tank.
Hungary has been the pace-setter in tax as in other key institutional
reforms, having introduced VAT and other tax reforms gradually over the last
few years. On January 1 the government introduced a modified three-tier VAT
system with zero rating only for drugs and household electricity, 6 per cent
on foodstuffs and a top 25 per cent rate on most other items.
The Czech and Slovak rates are 5 per cent for services and a few essential
items and 23 per cent on other goods. Poland is due to introduce VAT on July
1 and has decided on a zero rating for a restricted list of essential items,
7 per cent on some food and other items and a top rate of 22 per cent.
The collapse of the communist system and the drive to privatise the economy
and introduce market principles has simultaneously reduced tax revenues, due
to the collapse of many state industries, and raised demands for higher
spending, especially in new areas such as unemployment and retraining. The
result has been soaring budget deficits which made it difficult to conform
with International Monetary Fund-imposed performance criteria linked to IMF
loan agreements.
The introduction of VAT and other taxes is designed to widen the tax revenue
base and adequately tax higher incomes resulting from the emergence of new
players in the rapidly growing private sector.
More controversially, VAT revenue is also designed to offset the cost of tax
concessions designed to attract foreign investment.
As the recent IMF agreement with Poland shows, the Fund has recently
increased its temporary tolerance of high budget deficits pending the
introduction of VAT and other reforms. These are intended to ensure that the
new democratic states generate the revenues required to balance budgets over
a longer period and finance the social safety net needed to keep
unemployment associated with the transition to a market economy politically
manageable.
Poland is expected to cut its budget deficit from nearly 8 per cent last
year to around 5.5 per cent this year while the Hungarian budget plans to
reduce the deficit to 5.9 per cent from 7.5 per cent in 1992. In all cases,
however, higher VAT and other taxes are expected to boost inflation by at
least 5 per cent this year against the background of what promises to be
higher real incomes and export-led increases in output after three years of
steep recession.

<TEXT>
ALMOST no one who was not paid to do so greeted or celebrated Start 2 in
Moscow yesterday: at 21 degrees below, it was not the weather for it and,
after a year of economic reform, there was not the stomach for it.
A couple of Russian children waving the Stars and Stripes had stood outside
Spaso House, the US ambassador's residence, when President George Bush's
party arrived on Saturday: Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who keeps the banner of
fascist imperialism flying whenever he can, had earlier led 10 supporters to
picket the airport with signs saying: 'Hands off Iraq.'
Otherwise, Muscovites went about their holiday business: queueing for
petrol, looking for food and telling foreign television crews that they
didn't give two kopeks (0.5 cents at the current exchange rate) about what
was happening in the Kremlin.
In that chill fortress, Mr Bush looked weary as he commended the 'most
significant arms agreement ever' at the Saturday night banquet in the Hall
of Facets: Mr Boris Yeltsin, bouncy and at his most amiable, called the
agreement a 'Christmas present to the world', a phrase which Mr Bush's
speechwriters either could not match or thought too sugary for inclusion.
They were bested again yesterday, when Mr Yeltsin's scribes pulled an
'agreement of hope' out of the phrase bag, it sounding even more soothing in
Russian.
Sitting in St Vladimir's Hall before their officials and the press, the two
men assured each other of their historic importance: Mr Bush remembered that
Mr Yeltsin had saved democracy in August 1991 by climbing on top of a tank,
and Mr Yeltsin said that 'my friend George' possessed 'political and
personal qualities (which) had helped to make the change from the cold war
to warm relations between our countries'.

FT  04 JAN 93 / UN struggles for a role in Somalia: An inauspicious start to
today's peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE humiliation of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary
general, by 500 anti-UN protesters in Mogadishu yesterday was a
demonstration of the difficulties facing the UN chief in critical Somali
peace talks which open in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa today.
Demonstrators loyal to Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed, Somalia's most powerful
warlord, chanted 'Boutros Ghali go home' as they pelted the UN headquarters
in Mogadishu with rocks and grapefruit skins and tore down and stamped on UN
flags and signboards. The UN chief was forced to abandon plans to visit the
building and retreated to the airport by helicopter, leaving some of his
most senior aides besieged inside the headquarters.
It was an inauspicious start to the secretary-general's Somalia peace
mission. Fourteen Somali factions are due to meet in Addis Ababa this
morning under Mr Boutros Ghali's chairmanship in the first serious
round-table political conference aimed at beginning a process to end the
bitter clan warfare that has destroyed Somalia and created a famine which
has cost at least 300,000 lives.
Finding a political solution to Somalia's two-year conflict is fundamental
to ending the faction fighting and therefore the starvation created largely
by banditry. Without political reconciliation the cycle of violence and
death from starvation cannot be broken.
But for the UN the stakes are high. Its repeated efforts in the past 24
months to broker peace talks have failed, and many believe today's talks
have come about only because of the US military intervention in Somalia.
Several of the faction leaders invited to the informal talks are deeply
critical of the role the UN has played in Somalia. Some go as far as
accusing the UN of fuelling the fighting by exacerbating divisions among the
factions.
At best, UN officials are hoping to lay the groundwork for an agenda, venue
and list of delegates to a national reconciliation conference, probably in
Somalia within three months, which will pave the way for an interim assembly
and administration. At worst, the conference could collapse in acrimony with
the warlords accusing the UN of malicious meddling.
Failure in Addis Ababa could sink hopes for political reconciliation and
discredit the UN and Mr Boutros Ghali, already under pressure in Bosnia and
Cambodia.
Critics say the UN may have already sown the seeds of failure by convening a
conference without adequately preparing the groundwork. They also say that
by inviting only warlords and factions, and not intellectuals and elders,
the UN is legitimising those directly responsible for the violence and
famine who do not have popular support and cannot deliver genuine
reconciliation.
'All the conditions for failure are there,' says Mr Abdul Mohamed, a member
of the conference secretariat and a Horn of Africa expert. 'The UN has not
done its political homework in Somalia and this is going to haunt them and
further marginalise the UN at a time when it is critical for it to regain
the confidence of Somalis.'
Before any real work can be done resolving the differences between the
splintered clan-based factions, the UN must try to win over Gen Aideed, who
controls most of Mogadishu, and his ally in the Somalia National Alliance
(SNA), Col Omar Jess, who controls the southern port of Kismayu. It was here
that a British UN relief worker was shot dead on Saturday, prompting Unicef
to withdraw its international staff from the city yesterday.
Both men are hostile to the UN. They want to deal solely with the US and are
intent on exploiting divisions between the US and the UN over disarmament of
factions and the timetable for the handover from US forces in Somalia to UN
peacekeepers.
In a statement before leaving Mogadishu for Addis Ababa, Gen Aideed said
that the 'UN bureaucrats had failed time and time again to demonstrate any
understanding of the intricate political situation in Somalia'. He said he
agreed to take part in the conference only because it was 'informal and
preparatory'. He went on to attack the UN role in Somalia as 'too ad hoc,
meddling, secretive, divisive and partial' to produce any positive results
for the good of the country.
His blunt criticism of the UN intensified doubts about the chances of
success at the Addis Ababa conference.
In private, senior US officials also voice criticism about the UN role in
Somalia and say it was the organisation's failure to resolve the crisis and
mount a serious humanitarian relief operation which prompted US military
intervention. US officials also say they have had greater success in
political reconciliation than the UN, brokering the first face-to-face talks
between Gen Aideed and his arch rival, Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, last month.
Washington, however, is reluctant to get drawn in too far. Mr Bush has
continued to insist that US troops are on a limited humanitarian mission and
must pull out within weeks and hand over to UN peacekeepers.
Mr Boutros Ghali has tried unsuccessfully to put pressure on the US to
disarm the factions and is believed to be stalling on talks about the
transition from the US-led operation to a UN force until Washington gives in
to his request. He does not want to inherit the problems of disarmament.
For better or for worse the UN is going to be the key player in Somalia. The
challenge in Addis Ababa today will be to impress that reality on the
faction leaders and start building the framework for a broad-based national
political reconciliation.

NIGERIA'S plan to build a Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.82bn) liquefied natural
gas (LNG) export plant has been put at risk after failure to win cash
support before a deadline for awarding the main contract, Reuter reports
from Lagos.
The inability to attract foreign investment totalling about Dollars 2bn by
December 22 means that construction bids by two international consortiums
are likely to be revised upwards.
A senior operator involved in the project said it would 'take a minor
miracle to keep it going. I believe the government might want to stop it, at
least for now.'
Policy shifts and bickering over which foreign companies should win the
construction contract threaten to deprive Nigeria of a big revenue earner.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Recession bites for Japanese office workers: How the high
life has gone sour in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEPT along by a 'boom town' mood, Tokyo office workers once crowded into
dance clubs, reached for their credit cards at fashionable Italian
restaurants and queued for taxis at 3am on a Saturday morning, oblivious to
cost and unaware that the 'bubble' economy was soon to burst.
Those heady days of the late-1980s are over. Now, as office workers return
to their desks today after the new year break, they have more on their mind
than the usual party hangover. This year's celebrations produced long queues
of taxis waiting for customers, some of the fashionable restaurants are up
for sale and the dance clubs offer extended happy hours to keep their
numbers up.
The self-confidence has gone. There are worries about jobs and frugality is
in fashion.
Mr Kunio Yamamoto, a 42-year-old commercial banker, is typical. He has
turned from the boutique to the supermarket for his white shirts, and he
wears cheaper shoes. He used to have Y200,000 (Pounds 1,000) suits tailor
made, but now wears ready-to-wear suits from ROC, a local discount clothing
chain, at a quarter of the price.
Companies are cutting entertainment budgets, which is a blow for office
workers like Mr Yamamoto. Their salaries would usually go straight to their
families but, in the bubble days, handsome company allowances would
subsidise an expensive lunch at an eel restaurant or a night out amid the
neon of the Ginza district.
The decline of business lunches has affected even the Imperial Hotel,
Tokyo's most prestigious. A hush has fallen over the lobby which used to
buzz with businessmen ahead of their midday meetings.
The rows of exclusive nightclubs and hostess bars in Ginza are also feeling
the pinch. Miss Mariko Sugihara, a manageress of Olive, a small hostess club
lined with plush red sofas, says that, even with important clients,
businessmen are keeping entertaining in the evenings simple, going straight
home after a dinner.
The Olive is not alone. According to Teikoku Data Bank, a credit research
agency, entertainment spending at 1,000 leading Japanese companies fell 15.3
per cent in the 1991-92 fiscal year from 1987-88.
Companies are also cutting back on taxi vouchers distributed to employees,
depriving them of the late night company-paid drives back to their cramped
flats in the suburbs. Revenue for taxi drivers has fallen about 13 per cent
from last year. 'Expensive places like Ginza and Akasaka are the worst,'
sighs one driver, who complains it is the worst recession he can remember.
The once popular Italian brand names such as Versace, Armani, and Ferre are
now out, dubbed the 'bubble' designers. At Sabatini di Firenze, once one of
the most popular Italian restaurants in central Tokyo, reservations are no
longer needed three weeks in advance.
Mituskoshi, Japan's oldest department store, is suffering.
'People are even buying cheaper wedding rings,' confides an executive as he
walks around the almost deserted jewellery department.
However, the slowdown has brought its benefits. More office workers are
going home earlier and eating meals with their families. This is pushing up
food sales at local supermarket and convenience store chains. Tokyu Store, a
supermarket chain, says its food sales have risen sharply thanks to an
increase in purchases of staples such as rice and soy sauce.
A series of vicious price wars have broken out as hard-pressed companies
compete to win back reluctant consumers.
Discount coffee chains Pronto and Doutor are matching one another's price
cuts. Akihabara, the shopping area famous for the discount electronics shops
which line its streets, is losing customers to even cheaper areas of Tokyo,
which offer heavier discounts on fridges and televisions.
The gathering recession is forcing people such as Mr Yamamoto to be clear
about priorities. Although Mr Yamamoto has swapped his oil paints for water
colours, he says spending on his two children, especially education costs,
will not be cut.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Israeli agent dies in stabbing: Palestinian shot dead in
Gaza

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN ISRAELI secret service officer was stabbed to death in Jerusalem
yesterday and a Palestinian shot dead in the Gaza Strip as tensions
persisted over deportation to Lebanon last month of 415 Palestinians accused
of being Moslem militants from the occupied territories.
Police said Mr Chaim Nachmani, a 25-year-old man stabbed and bludgeoned to
death at an apartment in a wealthy inner suburb of Jerusalem, was an officer
of the General Security Service, or Shin Bet, who was involved in an
operation at the time. It said his killer, apparently an Arab, was known to
the authorities, but gave no further details.
Mr Nachmani was the first member of the security forces to be killed since
Israeli carried out the controversial deportations on December 17. It was
understood to be the first killing for 10 years of an officer of the Shin
Bet. The service is responsible for much of the intelligence and undercover
work carried out by Israeli forces in the occupied territories and is feared
and hated by most Palestinians.
Earlier in the Gaza Strip, an 18-year-old Palestinian was shot dead and 11
others were wounded in clashes with Israeli troops following the lifting of
a four-day curfew on the heavily populated territory.
Yesterday, Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, flew to Cairo to
discuss the deportations, which threaten Middle East peace talks. Later Mr
Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, said it would be 'really helpful to
the peace process' if Israel would heed UN security council resolution 799
and reverse the deportations.
But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told students before news of yesterday's
killings the move had curbed Gaza and West Bank violence: 'It served as a
real blow to the Islamic fundamentalist terror groups.' Israeli police fired
rubber bullets and tear gas at thousands of ultra-orthodox Jews
demonstrating in Jerusalem against the uncovering during building work of
ancient graves.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton will hold talks with President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari of Mexico in Texas on Friday in his only meeting with a foreign
leader during the transition period between the November election and his
inauguration on January 20.
Heading the agenda for what Clinton assistants called 'wide-ranging'
discussions will be the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US,
Canada and Mexico. Although the treaty text has been signed by President
George Bush, it still needs ratification by the US Senate.
Mr Clinton shaded his views on Nafta during last year's election campaign,
offering general support for the three-nation free trade zone but expressing
reservations about some of its aspects. He may seek to negotiate side
agreements strengthening some environmental and job protection measures
embodied in the treaty.
Mr Clinton has said that free trade with Mexico was desirable only if it was
accompanied by a national economic strategy. But he has been under pressure
from labour unions to preserve jobs and from Mr Richard Gephardt, Democratic
leader, on both environmental and job protection. Mr Gephardt has said the
Nafta treaty faces rejection in Congress this year unless parts are returned
to the negotiating table.
For Mr Salinas, who has committed his government to fiscal austerity in the
coming year, much depends on the successful ratification of the treaty,
which is a critical element in his economic reform programme.
The president-elect completed the selection of his cabinet just before
Christmas, but is expected to make a additional appointments, mostly to the
White House staff, this week.
Mr Clinton was due to return to Little Rock, Arkansas, yesterday afternoon
after new year on the island of Hilton Head, off the South Carolina coast.

<TEXT>
China will allow coal producers to sell most of their output at market-set
prices in 1993 in an effort to dig the country's beleaguered coal industry
out of debt, the official China Daily said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Beijing.
Officials from the China National Coal Corp (CNCC) told the newspaper that
in 1993, prices for 190m tonnes of coal, or 57 per cent of the year's
production total, would be allowed to float with the market against about 20
per cent in 1992.
Coal is China's main energy source and has long been subject to strict
government price controls, meaning huge losses for the industry as
inefficient mines swallow up government subsidies.
CNCC, a state monopoly, was able to cut losses by about 500m yuan (Pounds
56m) in 1992 thanks to the government's first effort at de-controlling
prices, the newspaper said.

Singapore's economy grew by 5.6 per cent last year and growth of between 5.5

island republic's prime minister, Kieran Cooke reports.
'Given the slowdown in developed countries and a more mature Singapore
economy, this is a good performance,' said Mr Goh in a new year message. He
said that a big push by Singapore companies overseas, particularly into
China and other south-east Asia countries, should provide the basis for
further economic growth.
Mr Goh said his government planned to reduce personal and corporate taxes in
order to attract more investments while a goods and services tax will be
introduced to make up for any revenue shortfalls. Investment commitments in
1992 were a record SDollars 3.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn), he said.

install an optical fibre submarine cable linking Malaysia and Thailand.
The cable will be more than 1,300km long and have a capacity of 560 Mbps,
equivalent to 7,560 telephone circuits. Called the M-T cable project, the
link is part of an optical fibre submarine cable network linking the
countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
The M-T project is due for completion in mid-1994 and will be the last part
of the Asean network. Links between Malaysia and Singapore and Singapore and

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Whither the cross-border
cornflake? - Euro-brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE Euro-consumer remains little more than a gleam in a marketing
executive's eye, one reason may be that for all the manufacturers' talk
about single-market strategies there are still few branded everyday products
which are the same in every country.
And often the prices of those which are identical vary widely across
borders.
Of course Sony electronics, Levi-Strauss jeans, Marlboro cigarettes and
Coca-Cola are the same everywhere. But a recent survey conducted for the FT
found that of the tens of thousands of products commonly sold in European
supermarkets only 45 'Euro-brands' were widely on sale in identical format
in at least the four largest countries.
Nielsen, the market research company, found that Euro-brands were
particularly common in personal-care products where multinational companies
such as Colgate-Palmolive, Gillette, L'Oreal and Unilever have done much to
standardise their products and packaging sizes across borders.
Snacks and some alcoholic drinks are also acquiring a more European flavour.
Brands which span most countries include Kit-Kat, Toblerone and Twix
chocolate bars, Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky, Bailey's Irish Cream,
Heineken lager and Guinness.
In other types of food, Kelloggs cereals, Uncle Ben's Rice, Heinz ketchup
and Danone yogurt are sold Europe-wide. So are Whiskas, Sheeba and Pedigree
petfoods made by Mars, which has been harmonising its European range.
Yet if the tastes of European consumers are converging on these products,
the prices still vary widely.
The biggest price differences found by Nielsen in the 45 products that it
surveyed frequently amount to 100 per cent between the cheapest and dearest
country. In two cases - Kellogg's cornflakes and Palmolive hand wash liquid
 -the differences are much higher.
These variations are large, even considering differing value-added tax
rates, sales volumes and the impact of sterling's devaluation.
Will prices converge as the single market develops? In theory they should
since large differentials would be likely to encourage cross-border shopping
and parallel import flows.
However, the theory only applies if there are enough similar products.

cross-border shopping

THESE days the vikings invade Newcastle not to loot and pillage but to drink
and shop. More than 100,000 Norwegians, Danes, and Swedes brave the North
Sea crossing every year.
After an overnight stay at the local County Hotel, John Martinsen, a
catering manager from Stavanger, his wife Wenche, and a friend carry out an
early morning raid on a costume jewellery store and a women's lingerie shop.
They buy a pair of imitation crystal rings at Pounds 6.50 each, and several
pairs of pink satin bras and panties.
The Martinsen group plans to spend at least Pounds 1,800, including drink,
during the three-day stay in north-east England. They believe everything is
a bargain - at least half the price they would pay in Norway.
PORN BROKER
Sunday trading has a special meaning for Heiga Holmsteen. While the majority
of retailers in Copenhagen take the day off, Mr Holmsteen is open for
business as usual from an early hour. His clientele includes Danes, but is
mostly Japanese, English and German. Visiting Swedes, even on a Sunday,
concentrate on drinking.
Mr Holmsteen works as an accountant for a leading Danish company three days
a week. But for the remaining four his Dana-Expo does a brisk trade in
hardcore pornography of a kind that is not freely available elsewhere in
Europe.
'My clients take things away in suitcases or else I send selective items by
mail order,' says Mr Holmsteen. The magazines he sells are mainly produced
in Denmark where VAT is high. But he keeps his costs down by exporting the
magazines to Germany and then re-importing them - after having paid a lower
German duty.
DRUG STORE COWBOY
Soft drugs in Amsterdam have relatively the same status as beer. In cafes
and coffee houses they are listed on menus and can be consumed on the
premises as long as customers do not buy above a certain limit. As borders
come down, therefore, police forces will need to be on the ball.
Driving from Germany into Holland the frontier post is empty. When a clerk
in a bank nearby is asked 'Where's the border?' she replies: 'It's 1993
already. Don't you realise we are all in Europe now. Perhaps in England you
feel differently.'
Well, maybe the Germans feel differently too. Returning across the same
border from Amsterdam, and crossing the same frontier post from Holland into
Germany, the German border guard barks: 'You come from Amsterdam, you smoke
hash, you bring shit no?' He then orders a complete search of the hired
Volkswagen Golf GTI.
FILL 'ER UP
In a petrol station on the French A-7 autoroute a Spanish long-distance
lorry driver fills up on fuel and then asks for four receipts. Who's
counting?
DOUBLE TROUBLE
Robert Blasco, the owner and cook of a fine restaurant in the spectacular
fortress town of Carcassone in southern France, is pinning his hopes on a
Europe sans frontieres and modern police computers.
Robert has often been detained at the Franco-Spanish border because he
shares the same age, name and surname as one of the most wanted Basque
terrorists. 'All they had to do was check on my stomach. It was full of good
food, much fatter than my alleged double,' he says.
SNOOZE AND BOOZE
Across the border in Spain he has a great chance of getting a good drink
too. Latest statistics show the land of the siesta and fiesta boasts 133,000
tapas bars, giving it more watering holes per capita than any other country
in Europe.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Global shopper takes a step out
from the shadows - Consumer convergence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SALAMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARVARD professor Ted Levitt electrified the marketing community in the
early 1970s with his belief in the existence of a global consumer.
According to Levitt, technology was driving markets in such a way as to make
'different cultural preferences, national tastes and standards vestiges of
the past'.
But it was not until the late 1980s, when plans for the single market were
launched and acted as a catalyst for new thinking, that the degree of
consumer convergence across countries became a live issue for the mass of
companies.
Today it is commonplace to hear companies as diverse as Shell and Suchard
justifying their strategies in terms of common consumer trends, the
internationalisation of the media and the growing irrelevance of national
boundaries.
But to what extent are these beliefs valid? And what are the implications
for companies?
There is no doubt that there are powerful common trends operating across
Europe.
For example, all the major European countries are experiencing a significant
decline in their youth population. This will affect both the personnel
policy of all companies as well as the strategies of individual companies,
such as Heineken and Nike which have traditionally relied heavily on this
group for their sales.
Equally, the incomes of Europeans in work continue to increase - albeit at a
different pace, but with the same kind of consequences. It is helping to
raise consumer expectations, lessening deference towards companies and
reducing the willingness to accept inferior products and services.
At a sector level, common needs can also be seen to be emerging.
The growing inability of all governments to finance welfare state systems is
raising fears among consumers, especially older ones, about their ability to
fund their retirement. Some governments, such as in Italy, have reacted by
raising the retirement age and tightening eligibility criteria, rather than
by privatising pension provision in the way that the UK has done. Yet there
is some common ground in pension and saving product opportunities across
Europe.
But in spite of a background of increasing uniformity, the evidence of
continued differences across Europe is overwhelming. In each case, these
differences can be traced back to variations in factors such as legislation,
government policy, corporate marketing strategies, retail environments and
product availability.
Two examples are:
A higher proportion of people in Germany and the Netherlands place the
environment at the top of their list of concerns and there is no reason to
suppose this situation will change. Legislation which applies to packaging
in Germany, together with the pro-active policies of national retailers,
have been critical in shaping consumer attitudes and are unlikely to be
copied with anything like the same force in other countries. Throughout
Europe, higher levels of education, reduced deference towards the medical
establishment and the desire of governments to contain health spending have
combined to provide a boost to over-the-counter drugs sales. But the
tendency for consumers to consult their doctor or pharmacist for an ailment
such as a cough varies considerably. Again, continued differences in payment
systems and in the relationship between doctors and pharmacists will
perpetuate this situation.
It is to be expected that some of the differences between countries will be
eroded by some powerful forces. In particular, the consumer's desire to be
different and to experience new things cannot be underestimated. For each
Englishman who starts eating croissants for breakfast and drinking wine,
there is a Frenchman who is taking up cereals in the morning and drinking
beer with his evening meal.
To this extent, cross-country European niches will develop.
At the same time, companies are playing a key role in stimulating
convergence. The growth of international brands such as McDonald's, Ikea,
Nike and Toys R Us and the increased co-ordination of company marketing
policy - think of the way in which Unilever has rolled out brands such as
Radion across Europe - are raising the number of common experiences. These
factors could prove the most important in promoting convergence.
Others are not quite as important as they might at first appear. After all,
when taking into account factors such as holiday taking, it must be
recognised that for most Europeans this is still a domestic phenomenon.
The relaxation of protectionist legislation has not significantly changed
behaviour. Germany's removal of beer purity laws did not lead to an
avalanche of imported beers.
European niches are emerging but national and regional differences still
need to be considered. Co-ordinating activities while being sensitive to
local market conditions is a difficult task - and one at which few companies
have excelled.
Eric Salama is joint managing director of the Henley Centre, the business
consultancy.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Only Ronald strides the frontiers
 -McDonald's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDONALD'S customers might expect the same menu at any branch of the
ubiquitous restaurant chain.
But while Big Macs, quarter pounders with cheese and hot apple pies can be
found everywhere, the chain does make concessions to cultural differences.
Diners in Norway are served with MacLaks - a salmon sandwich invented to
suit Norwegian tastes.
In Italy, where the demand for fresh foods is strong, there are salad bars -
the only place in Europe where McDonald's operates this service.
Such differences mean that even in 1993 McDonald's does not believe in a
'European consumer'.
Mr Martin Campiche, a Swiss now in London as McDonald's European
communications director, says: 'For us, there is no such thing as the single
European market.'
This is reflected in the way the company is managed. McDonald's selects
local business people to be its franchise holders in each country, and its
products are manufactured by local suppliers. There is little cross-border
movement of products. So, Mr Campiche says the removal of tariffs and
customs controls will have limited impact for the company.
'We are an international company operating across Europe and we do business
regardless of whether there is a single market or not.'
One element common to all European promotions is Ronald McDonald, the
company's clown mascot. Other than Ronald, advertising and marketing is
organised on a local basis.
'Our marketing approach is always local. There is no single advertising
campaign across Europe,' adds Mr Campiche.
This is determined not only by cultural differences, but by operational
ones. 'It depends on the media available. In France there are not so many
billboards as there are in the UK, for example, so the focus of our
advertising is different.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Europe Today - The two faces of
contemporary France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French enter the single market as a nation of extremes. The political
agenda is dominated by divisions - between the old and the new, the rural
and the urban, the disadvantaged and the advantaged - and also by the
struggle of the old, centralised institutions that run the country to
resolve these divisions. One face of the country is the chic, educated
Parisian, who has prospered after almost a decade of socialism de lux. But
there is also France of the underclass - the under-privileged immigrants who
are struggling to eke out a living in the suburbs of Marseilles.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Knowing when to drop the fat
operatic soprano - Carmakers' strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN may be preparing a VW Golf Europa special edition to celebrate
the single market, but the company remains adamant that it will continue
specific strategies market by market.
According to Mr Philip Holliday, account manager for VW at the carmaker's UK
advertising agency BMP DDB Needham, the group follows a common overall
advertising strategy for Europe. This is built around the perceived virtues
of reliability and quality but the interpretation of these features is left
to national markets.
'German television ads tend to be rather literal, they assert something and
give a very factual demonstration of reliability. In the UK it is much less
direct. We show reliability as an emotional quality. In the face of
adversity the car is there as a consistent, reliable friend.'
In the UK the angry girlfriend may throw away her diamonds and her fur coat,
but never the keys to her VW Golf.
Mr Holliday insists that many advertising approaches do not translate to
another country because of the humour or the dialogue.
Fiat presented its Tipo small family car in the UK with a television
campaign including an overweight operatic soprano appearing through the sun
roof, but the approach has to be rather different in Italy.
On the other hand some Volkswagen markets elsewhere in Europe did pick up
the British VW Golf advert, in which the only squeak was in the lady
driver's earring. Filmed in Spain the only dialogue was a few words and
grunts spoken in Italian.
Strategies towards the consumer also depend crucially on the relative
strength of the individual car brand in a particular market.
Gradually shares of individual markets are being evened out, but the
carmakers' fortunes still vary widely. The Fiat group has a share of 12 per
cent across Europe, but in Italy it takes 44 per cent of all new car sales
and only 2 per cent in the UK.
This relative market strength crucially affects pricing policies, and goes
some way to explaining often widely divergent new car prices across Europe.
Car prices will continue to differ from market to market driven not least by
currency fluctuations and different tax regimes. But there is growing
evidence that they will tend to converge as the borders between national
markets become less distinct, and market shares become more equal.
Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault, says: 'At the
moment where you have a bigger market share and more loyalty, you can charge
more, but these opportunities will become more limited. Prices are
converging in different markets and carmakers will have less flexibility in
marketing techniques.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: The Polish dealer feeding the EC
market - Chris Bobinski meets a businessman whose gaze stretches from the
Atlantic to the Urals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE revolution which swept communism out of eastern Europe helped make Jan
Kulczyk rich. The single market is likely to make him richer.
This 42-year-old Polish millionaire, clad soberly in grey slacks and a blue
blazer, has moved with apparent ease from the old world of communist rule to
the new one where capitalism holds sway - and where the whole of Europe now
appears a place to make money.
Controlling 36 companies with sales approaching 3,000bn zloty (Pounds 124m),
Mr Kulczyk's interests include banking, Volkswagen vehicle distribution in
Poland and, above all, agribusiness. A mild-mannered cosmopolitan - he pays
taxes in Germany and has homes in Berlin, Lugano, Poznan and Warsaw - he
uses his spare cash to sponsor classical music festivals.
Mr Kulczyk made his fortune selling fruit, vegetables and meat to the EC.
Now, in addition, he buys western food processing machinery to sell in the
east. He says the single market will act as a powerful spur to this form of
two-way trade with the Community - a process which should eventually benefit
east and west.
Frontier-free trading will give Poland particular benefits by easing access
to western technology, he believes. But some of his preoccupations are more
mundane.
Musing on the new opportunities for cross-border trading of livestock as a
result of the ending of EC customs controls, he enthuses: 'I will no longer
have to send sheep specifically to one country.'
Prospects for increased EC commerce depend crucially on improving transport
links. Mr Kulczyk and other businessmen want to build a 270km toll motorway
linking Berlin to his native Poznan and beyond. A feasibility study on the
project is to be ready next month and Mr Kulczyk says western road building
consortia have promised Dollars 800m (Pounds 526.3m) of credits once the
plan gets the green light from the authorities.
A further landmark in 1993 is another sign of Poland's changing business
times. He is on the board of the state owned bank, Wielkopolski Bank
Kredytowy, which is to be privatised in 1993. The bank, like the PZU state
insurance company, is a shareholder in the motorway development company.
Mr Kulczyk, whose corporate career started in 1975, believes Polish
businessmen will link the new capitalist markets in the east and the
extended free trade area of the west. Business associates say the gift of
getting quickly to the point is just one of his talents. 'He combines a
romantic Slav nature with Germanic ability to organise,' says one admiring
colleague.
His family business, started by his father in 1956, has had plenty of
practice at building economic bridges. Mr Kulczyk senior set up a West
Berlin-based food trading company which entered co-operation with several
Polish state agricultural exporters. Some of these have now been privatised
 -and are now controlled by Mr Kulczyk.
The original Berlin company has now been transformed into Kulczyk
Aussenhandel, importing food processing plant into Poland and the former
Soviet republics.
In another example of his activities, Mr Kulczyk has teamed up with Krupp to
help build near Poznan a Dollars 100m 150,000 tonnes per year processing
plant, a venture which will increase Poland's rapeseed processing capacity
by a quarter.
Such deals have brought Mr Kulczyk profits - and a distaste for publicity.
'Too much exposure at home tends to bring trouble,' he says.
As for the future, Mr Kulczyk says Poland should live in 'symbiosis' with
its more highly industrialised neighbours to the west.
'Workers in the European Community shouldn't feel that low wage employees in
Poland are a threat to their jobs,' he declares, displaying what appears to
be somewhat exaggerated belief in EC workers' espousal of the vision of
international capitalism.
'Rather, this offers a chance to expand their companies' business.'
Mr Kulczyk's European horizons stretch east as well as west. Last year he
helped set up Euro Agro Centrum, a company which aims to sell food
processing equipment from western Europe to countries like Ukraine.
'There, the possibilities are boundless,' he says. Mr Kulczyk clearly
believes the single market has a lot further to go; and the direction will
be predominantly eastwards. 'Ukraine,' he adds, 'is the future.'
Poland, Mr Kulczyk says, should make the best of its natural advantages,
here and now, and that does not mean high tech products but simpler things -
such as roads for transit traffic and food production.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Corporate America takes a long
view on EC - On the outside looking in, recession in the Community worries
its trade rivals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEANS may be going through collective jitters about the future, but
American businesses with interests in Europe have no such doubts.
That, at least, is the message from a straw poll of leading US executives on
their outlook for investment in Europe.
Last autumn's currency crisis and the difficulties over the Maastricht
treaty may be shaking the EC to its core but it does not appear to daunt US
corporate investors. They take the long view.
What really worries them is the recession gripping several European
economies. But even this gloomy outlook is not making them alter their
capital spending plans dramatically. The recession, and the recovery, have
already been factored into a long-term view of a market which is larger than
the United States and remains extremely attractive.
Mr John Hunter, president of Coca-Cola's international division, says his
company is heavily committed to both western and eastern Europe. It has
invested Dollars 3bn in western Europe, including Dollars 450m alone in the
now unified eastern regions of Germany and a further Dollars 1bn of capital
in central and eastern Europe.
'We are bullish on Europe. I think that whatever doubts there might be about
the future of the EC, these are things that will be handled in due course
and will not cause us any worry. We are in any case handling things on a
country-by-country basis,' Mr Hunter said.
Coca-Cola, in line with many other US companies, is not daunted by the
prospect of a two-speed Europe dominated by Germany and France. 'Regardless
of what happens we still go to market day in and day out,' Mr Hunter added.
Mr Richard Braddock, who resigned recently as president of Citicorp, the
biggest US bank, said Europe's appeal as an investment destination remains.
'To me the core fact is that Europe, in aggregate, is a marketplace some 50
per cent larger than the US. Anyone who had the simplistic view that Europe
would come quickly together without the need to differentiate by market or
culture was mistaken.'
At American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), which has an estimated Dollars 2bn
invested in Europe, there were fewer than 50 employees in Europe a decade
ago. Today there are 25,000.
Mr Randall Tobias, AT&amp;T's vice chairman, dismissed any notion of changing
his company's plans because of the difficulties over Maastricht. 'Quite
frankly my view really has not changed at all.
'We have taken a very long term view and I think what is happening now is an
almost inevitable set of very difficult issues that can be expected -
monetary issues, nationalism, defence and security. I think it is inevitable
that there should be some bumps in the road along the way. It won't be easy,
but I am as optimistic as I was two years ago.'
Mr Jack Quindlen, chief financial officer of Du Pont, the leading US
chemicals company currently awaiting final approval for a deal to swap nylon
and acrylic assets with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), said he never
thought unification would be easy.
'I am not surprised at the difficulty Europe has had in getting Maastricht
approved - given what they are trying to accomplish.'
Mr Quindlen advises his European counterparts to examine the early federal
history of the US. 'When you think of the first 50 or 100 years of the
Supreme Court, it was spent deciding cases about who owned the rivers and
who controlled commerce between the states.
'Why should European unification be easier? We still see Europe as a very
large and attractive market and nothing has changed.'
Mr J. Dennis Bonney, vice chairman of Chevron, the fourth biggest US energy
group, said his company had major UK investments in the North Sea, totalling
several hundred million dollars.
But the stalled unification process had not had any significant effect on
investment. 'We continue to view all of Western Europe as a favourable
environment for investing.'
Mr Art Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, said the recent setbacks to
unification had modified his view of Europe, but not dramatically.
'Certainly we are looking at a weak economic environment and a slowdown in
unification. That means tactical things have changed, but the outlook has
not. Chase has more than Dollars 5bn of assets in Europe and we will be
looking at Europe as a crucial part of our global strategy,' Mr Ryan said.
Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, says
there is more caution about investment but this is due to worry about the
economic outlook rather than the problems of unification.
'Our own view is that the fundamental trend is still very much in place,' he
said. 'We will see important steps toward integrating Europe and we have not
changed our long-term view.'
Some on Wall Street even see Europe's problems as an opportunity. Mr James
Harmon, chairman of Wertheim Schroder, the investment bank, said the next
few years would be 'a window of opportunity for American corporate and
individual investors because there will be significant restructuring of
European businesses, plus privatisation'. These will depend upon capital
infusion from external sources and US capital is clearly both perceived and
in substance available for playing a major role in this process.'

surprising considering the country's diet of political intrigue, its
gathering recession and the fact that the youngest sumo star is marrying a
popular young model.
Yet the last few months of currency turmoil and political confusion in
Europe have brought to the surface the ambivalence in Japan's attitude
towards the EC.
The Japanese prefer to see the EC in purely economic terms. Japanese
companies are attracted by the commercial opportunities of the single market
but concerned that Europe could become an inward-looking, regional trading
fortress.
The more the European project veers away from economics towards grand
designs for political integration the more uncomfortable the Japanese
become.
Japanese complain that it is often difficult to establish who has the power
to make decisions within the Brussels bureaucracy and how power is
distributed between Brussels and the national governments.
They are mystified by the theory of pooling sovereignty and sceptical about
whether the goal can be achieved given cultural differences.
To the Japanese it seems that European integration rests upon the premise
that ideas of nation, culture and race can be moulded by public policy. Yet
for the Japanese, national consciousness is rarely debated since it is the
deeply rooted foundation for much of the country's social and economic
organisation.
The autumn turmoil in European currency markets, combined with potential
delays to the process of political integration has been met with a quiet
sense of relief in Tokyo.
Mr Hajime Ohta, head of international economics at Keidanren, the employers'
organisation, said: 'Japanese companies' attitudes towards the single market
have not been affected by events this autumn. Most manufacturing investment
has been done. There is no sign of a change of strategy. People believe the
single market will happen.'
However, there are concerns about how the market will work. The most
immediate anxiety is the outlook for growth. Mr Jack Schmuckly, president of
Sony Europe, explained: 'Our approach will not change, Europe should be
treated as a single market. Clearly the European monetary system may not
hold the promise it did of paving the way for a single currency, so that may
force us to reconsider some of the ways we do business. But our main concern
is about the economic condition of Europe which is rapidly turning for the
worse.'
Most Japanese analysts believe European policy makers are facing the
inevitable need to rethink the role of monetary union. A senior finance
ministry adviser remarked: 'The Europeans have found out they cannot have
fixed exchange rates, free capital movements and a single monetary authority
all at the same time. A deceleration of monetary union is probably no bad
thing.'
Even if integration proceeds, many Japanese companies believe their approach
to Europe will be heavily influenced by remaining differences between
national economies. Mr Hisao Kobayashi, in charge of international
operations at DKB, one of Japan's largest banks, said: 'We are still
considering how best to organise ourselves within the single market. We may
be headquartered in Luxembourg, Frankfurt may be the most powerful financial
market but London will be the most profitable to do our business in.'
Economic questions are manageable for Japan. Political complexities of
dealing with the EC, less so. The Hague declaration last year was meant to
underpin the relationship between Japan and the EC based on the democratic
principles they share.
According to Mr Toshio Tanaka, professor of European studies at Tokyo's Kieo
University, the declaration is largely hollow. He said: 'No one knows how to
use it. Meetings between Japanese and EC ministers are always on the fringes
of other international gatherings, they have no substance of their own.'
That stands in stark contrast to the intensity of Japan's relationship with
the US. Indeed the EC's importance to Japan in part depends upon the US
approach to Europe.
Japanese politicians took quiet pleasure as bystanders watching the
agricultural trade friction this autumn between the US and the EC. The
converse is also true: any sign that the EC is forming a more co-operative
closer relationship with the US creates concern in Tokyo that Japan may face
a western alliance. Mr Tanaka said: 'Two against one - that is what we
fear.'
The other relationship which could be increasingly exposed by European
integration is Japan's complex attitude towards Germany. Mr Kazuo Chiba,
former envoy to Britain and now at Mitsui, the trading company, explained:
'We have strong historic relationships with Britain, politically and
economically, and France, through its cultural influence upon Japan.
'But there is an unease about Germany. There is an aura about German
strength but also a worry about what Germany will do with its power.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Don't bank on a brave new world
for investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BENEFITS of the single European market for the personal investor remain
elusive. In theory, he or she should be able to get a bank account,
mortgage, insurance policy or equity investment from the best company
anywhere from Athens to Zaragosa.
In practice, there is little point in, say, a British depositor seeking a
bank account from Credit Agricole, unless he is a regular visitor to France.
Most depositors are attracted by the convenience of domestic branch
networks; it would be too expensive for a foreign bank to build its own.
Similarly, when the Third Life Directive takes effect in July 1994,
consumers should be able to buy life insurance from the cheapest source
available in the Community. But the chances of many people shopping round
the continent are practically nil.
This disappointing prospect stems partly from investors' innate
conservatism. Many are used to buying financial products such as insurance
or equity funds via their local bank; they have built-in resistance to
buying products from an unfamiliar name. Indeed, most people who sell
financial products are tied to a particular company, and so are unable and
unwilling to offer investors a European-wide choice.
Different tax regimes also make it difficult for companies to devise
products to appeal to all European investors.
There is some pan-European selling; for example, to the growing expatriate
community, or to those buying holiday homes in other member states. But it
remains a niche market.
The Undertaking on Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (Ucits)
directive allows collective funds which had been authorised in one state to
be marketable throughout the Community. Some companies have set up Ucits
using Luxembourg and Dublin as a base and have modest success in attracting
investors. But there is little tax incentive for, say, a UK investor to
prefer Ucits to UK-based unit trusts and incidents like the Barlow Clowes
scandal have made many shy away from an 'offshore' label.
Life insurance companies can set up branches in other countries post-July
1994. But it will not be a truly competitive market; consumers will not be
able to use a financial adviser or broker in their own country to buy
insurance from a company in another member state. Brokers and advisers will
not have an agreed pan-European regulatory system until 1996.

Four Marketeers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ARCHITECT
IT WAS a job well done, even if his part in it finished before he would have
liked.
'Broadly speaking, it's been completed in time,' intones Lord Cockfield, the
man who, as a European Commissioner, was responsible for shaping plans for
the single market between 1984 and 1988.
He would have loved to have stayed on in Brussels but was withdrawn four
years ago when Margaret Thatcher decided he had 'gone native'.
With the air of a stern Dickensian parson, the 76-year-old Cockfield says
the 5 per cent of his single market recommendations not implemented are
'minor compared with the vast panorama of the programme'.
But the now part-time accountancy adviser still betrays more than a whiff of
acrimony towards the Tory government. 'It had very little understanding of
what the single market meant,' he sniffs. 'It was thinking of areas like
transport - it never thought it had to take fiscal matters into account as
well.'
He is predictably dismissive of the UK's efforts to bring the European
central bank to London and is a believer in a single European currency but
does not think it will be the Ecu. His money is on the D-Mark.
HIS SUCCESSOR
Italy, bottom of the EC league for transferring single market legislation
into its national law, had been piqued into rapid action just ahead of the
January 1 deadline.
In an 11th-hour effort, the Italian parliament authorised a fast-track
procedure for implementing 33 directives covering everything from the
labelling of medicines to the trade in fresh meat.
The move should spare the blushes of Italy's new commissioner, Mr Raniero
Vanni d'Archirafi, when he arrives in Brussels on Wednesday. For at least
the next two years he will be responsible for making the internal market
work.
The appointment raised a few eyebrows within the Commission when it was
announced a fortnight ago, given Italy's poor track record on
implementation.
GONE FISHING
Come New Year's Eve, most of the Brussels architects of the single market
appeared to have folded up their blueprints and disappeared instead of
sticking around for the launch of their masterplan. The headquarters of the
European Commission was almost deserted as officials, true to form, took the
week between Christmas and New Year off.
PRIVATE FUNCTION
Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, was said to have celebrated
privately somewhere in France. His spokesman said a public display of
enthusiasm would have been inappropriate given the economic and political
background. In any case, he added, Mr Delors had always made it clear that
establishment of the single market would not be 'un big bang' but a gradual
process.
MIND GAMES
Contacted on New Year's Eve, advisers to Mr Martin Bangemann, the internal
market commissioner, were unable to say where he intended to celebrate the
New Year.
'He keeps changing his mind,' said one.
THOSE AGAINST
One group unlikely to be celebrating arrival of the single market is the
anti-federalist Campaign for an Independent Britain. Its Christmas card, in
stark red and white, featured an accusatory Kitchener-like Santa Claus on
the cover posing the question: 'Will 1992 be your LAST British Christmas
before European Union?'
'Britain's future is in OUR hands this Christmas', it reads inside, urging
recipients to help the campaign to oppose the Maastricht treaty.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: A question of carts and horses -
Monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL the existence of separate national currencies undermine Europe's single
market? And what will happen to the ideal of a level European playing field
if a group of EC member countries decide to form a monetary union?
In principle there is no reason why a single market or customs union, with
no barriers to internal trade, should need a single currency, or somehow be
'incomplete' without one. There has been no suggestion the recently
negotiated North American Free Trade Agreement would require a single North
American currency. Instead, a monetary union implies a trade-off between the
gains from no exchange risk or transactions costs and the costs from losing
the flexibility to change currency and interest rates.
Separate currencies in the single market mean a degree of uncertainty and
transactions costs. Inefficiencies caused by short-term fluctuations in
exchange rates are likely to be small and largely avoidable for businesses.
The Commission estimates that elimination of foreign exchange transaction
costs would add about 0.5 per cent to the Community's GDP.
More serious is the risk that sudden speculative attacks on currencies,
unrelated to underlying economic realities, will unfairly reward or penalise
companies in different countries. But the UK had a much higher inflow of
Japanese direct investment in the late 1980s than any other European
country, even though sterling was not a member of the European exchange rate
mechanism.
But single currencies have costs too. If all countries suffered the same
economic calamity at the same time, giving up the power to vary the exchange
rate would be no great loss. But if countries are affected differently by an
economic event - such as an oil shock or German unification - the desired
response may not be the same and therefore the costs of tying monetary
policies together high.
What does the evidence suggest about the costs and benefits of this
trade-off? The US is not free from regional swings in the fortunes of
individual states. But US state unemployment rates do not stay high for long
 -the US does not have persistent high or low unemployment regions. The main
reason is the very high level of migration between US states, much higher
than between British regions, let alone between European countries.
Region-specific economic shocks are more common in Europe than in the US.
Research co-ordinated by Mr Barry Eichengreen at the University of
California at Berkeley finds there tends to be more variation in economic
growth rates across European countries than US states.
This pattern does not hold for different combinations of European countries.
The European 'core' (Germany, France, Denmark and the Benelux countries)
looks much more like the US.
The risk - especially for the poorer southern European countries - is that
monetary union would carry with it a high political cost: high unemployment
and slow growth.
To argue that the single market requires a single currency in order to work
may be putting the cart before the horse. The single market may, in fact, be
a necessary forerunner of any monetary union because it would encourage the
greater economic integration, labour mobility and convergence of living
standards without which a single currency would prove too painful for some.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Crash programme on VAT software -
The panic as exporters prepare to meet EC statistical demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Mirams, marketing director at International Software Marketing,
found time to answer the telephone, but with difficulty. 'The world seems to
have gone mad,' he said. 'People are panicking at the last moment.'
The panic had been widely expected. Mr Mirams' company, a subsidiary of
software group JBA, is one of a clutch of software houses across Europe
doing hectic business as companies come belatedly to terms with the new VAT
regulations with which they are now compelled to comply.
The list includes major multinationals including the US-owned Dun &amp;
Bradstreet Software, private companies with an international presence such
as the UK's Coda, and fast expanding national champions like SAP of Germany.
The threat of legal action against companies failing to meet the new
reporting requirements seems to be concentrating minds wonderfully. The
regulations are designed to do away with the paperwork that causes delays at
border crossings.
But they demand new and comprehensive statistical records of the movements
of goods and lists of sales to companies in the Community.
The most important new documents are the European Sales List (ESL), which
details exports to people registered for VAT in other member states, and the
Supplementary Statistical Declaration (SSD) which provides data for the
Community's new trade statistics system.
The most effective way of providing the new statistics is to extract them
automatically from a company's comp-uterised accounting system; detailed
changes to the software which are neither quick nor easy to carry out are
required, however.
A survey late last year by Andersen Consulting showed that UK companies
believed their most serious challenge to be adapting their computer systems
to generate the required information.
The difficulties are exacerbated by lack of appreciation of the difficulties
and a traditional reluctance among managers to deal with export issues.
'It has all been left to Fred in the Portacabin with his typewriter,' says
Mr Mirams. Andersen's survey showed that across Europe 40 per cent of
companies are still unready for the new regime.
Software packages are one answer; among the dozen or so UK companies
providing software which meet some or all of the new requirements are
Albacore Systems, Computer Traffic, Fraser Williams Logistics, Langdon
Systems, Telesmart and Vistec.
ISM's product was developed by Sitpro, the UK organis-ation concerned with
the simplification of international trade procedures. It runs on a personal
computer. At a cost of about Pounds 4,600 for a single user it will generate
all the necessary documentation. Mr Mirams is unwilling to quote sales
figures but says the company has more than doubled its turnover this year.
But estimating the size of the market for the new VAT software across Europe
is complicated. Some 30,000 UK companies will have to submit detailed VAT
returns but many of these will have modular accounting systems to which the
new software can be linked without substantial mod-ifications.
The new regulations are not necessarily a source of windfall profits for
software houses, however. Those supplying mainframe accounting packages will
have to spend rather than make money.
The terms of their maintenance contracts with customers stipulates that new
software to meet legal requirements has to be provided free.
Mr Steve Lenehan, brand manager at Tetra, a leading accounting software
supplier, points out that the company has spent Pounds 350,000 in copying
new software for distribution to its customers and sent out 110,000 sheets
of documentation.
Mr David Turner of Coda says the company has spent more on modifications
than it will recoup in fees. 'It is the first time in the recent history of
accounting software that changes have had to be made because of legal
requirements.'
The software suppliers now have a brief breathing space. Entirely new
software will be needed before 1997, when a Community-wide, harmonised VAT
system is planned.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Pet ideas on rabies leave Brits
foaming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOGS may be man's best friend in the UK but continental ones should be kept
at arm's length - or so the British believe. This has made rabies and the
movement of pets across Europe one of the most emotive of the single-market
issues.
The notion that Europe is foaming with rabid wildlife and that only the
channel stands in its way has led to turbulent ministerial negotiations.
The UK is to be allowed to retain tough anti-rabies laws and European
Commission plans to encourage free movement and substitute a Community-wide
animal vaccination 'passport' in place of quarantine have been thwarted.
Under the deal agreed between farm ministers in June, border controls
involving domestic pets were left up to the member states, so pets coming
into Britain with their owners will still have to undergo the expensive six
months' quarantine, as they have for the past 25 years. Future legislation
will have to involve controls at least as effective as the current ones.
However, dogs and cats imported into member states by recognised dealers for
sale will be able to enter without undergoing quarantine under strict
conditions similar to those already imposed on farm livestock.
These regulations come into force in Britain in January 1994.
Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, said the ability to keep quarantine
regulations in Britain once other customs barriers come down would lay to
rest all fears of rabies spreading from the Continent.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Why it is cheaper to fly to New
York than Rome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S new single aviation market has produced no sudden miracle of lower
fares and is unlikely to do so for many months.
Although Lufthansa of Germany started selling on January 1 cut-price tickets
between a dozen German cities and other EC destinations, a cheap round-trip
economy ticket from London to New York still costs less than the cheapest
economy return fare on a scheduled airline from London to Rome. If you flew
business or standard economy class to Rome, you would have had to pay more
than double the New York fare of Pounds 240.
'Anyone who believes that 1993 heralds a golden new era for the
long-suffering European air traveller is living in a fool's paradise,' says
Sir Michael Bishop, head of British Midland Airways, the UK airline
campaigning for more competition in European air transport.
In theory at least, European airlines are now free to set their own fares
and create a more competitive environment for consumers. Governments retain
the power to prevent airlines from overcharging or setting cut-price
predatory fares, although new price freedoms and 'open skies' are supposed
to put pressure on airlines to bring down fares, especially for business
travellers.
Lufthansa has been the first to take advantage of the single market price
freedoms by launching a new year cut-price ticket offer, prompting some
other carriers to follow suit. But it is unclear whether the move will lead
to a sustained US-style fares war in Europe.
European business class fares are still among the highest in the world in
terms of cost per mile: as much as 73p a mile from London to Paris against a
club class fare of 17p a mile from London to Sydney. Even in the single
market, financially strapped European carriers are likely to continue to
rely on business travellers to subsidise economy seats.
A recent study commissioned by British Midland suggests that European
business travellers are spending Pounds 600m a year too much on air travel
on the 15 busiest routes because of excessive club class fares.
The depressed state of the airline industry is also expected to discourage
carriers from engaging in fare wars, which have rocked the US airline
industry since deregulation 12 years ago and are now raging on the
transatlantic market.
Competition will also be undermined by obstacles including the lack of
take-off and landing slots at busy airports, such as London Heathrow or
Frankfurt, and congestion in the air.
The big European flag carriers, most still under state control, have also
moved quickly to try to stifle competition by absorbing smaller carriers or
forging partnerships and equity links with other larger airlines.

Europe to work harder
</HEADLINE>

Drug-sniffing dogs at Dover and other international borders will have to
work harder in a frontier-free Europe as illegal traders look for a boom in
single market crime. Security officials say there will be no let-up in the
fight against drug smugglers. They will also be watching for the illegal
movement of explosives, high technology goods of military potential,
pornography, artworks, and endangered species. Border law-enforcers carrying
out spot checks on vehicles and people are now mobile, and - if governments
can agree on a headquarters for Europol organisation - police co-operation
on terrorism and drugs should improve.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: How the British lined up a common
European railway - UK engineers put the continent on the right track, but
are now fast being left behind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AT LAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the single European railway is here. And it's all thanks to the British. If
their engineers hadn't built the early continental railways in the image of
their own, they might all have had different track widths, and joining them
together a century later would have been that much harder.
As it is, a new era has dawned for rail travellers. There will be no more
changing trains at the borders: from now on, passengers will whizz from one
side of the EC to the other almost as easily as they do from London to
Birmingham (though, given the vicissitudes of travelling by British Rail,
that is possibly not the best measure of convenience).
Actually, things will not be quite like that: or at least, not for a while.
As in so many other areas, the arrival of the single European market is the
first step in a long process of change for the railways, the fruits of which
will only very slowly become visible.
It is worth noting first that international rail travel is nothing new
within the Community. While Britain's railways remain physically isolated
from those of the continent, hundreds of trains cross other EC borders
daily: indeed, international traffic accounts for an estimated 21 per cent
of EC rail passenger mileage.
Even so, the more telling statistic is that only 0.5 per cent of
cross-border EC travellers go by rail rather than road or air. The reason is
that Europe's railways were built to serve national needs, not international
ones, so links between the different countries' systems are poor. And even
where they exist, crossing the border can take time: quite apart from
frontier controls, most of which should be phased out this year, it is often
necessary to change locomotives or trains because one country's rolling
stock will not work with another's power and signalling systems.
The EC aims to change all this with a three-pronged plan to speed up
international rail travel. One prong is to work towards technical
harmonisation; another, to improve international rail links, using the funds
for trans-European networks agreed under the Maastricht treaty; and the
third, to work towards a European high-speed rail network, building on the
high-speed lines already in France, Germany and Spain.
But those are goals that stretch into the next decade. For now, the only
immediate difference to EC rail operation is a directive requiring all
countries to open their railways to trains being operated between two other
countries, charging a set rate for use of their tracks. Previously, railways
have often refused transit traffic where they have not considered the
returns worthwhile.
The result could be a rise in number of the newly emergent 'hotel' trains
such as the Pablo Casals running between Spain and Switzerland. These are
luxurious trains travelling long distances between European capitals and
offering a comfortable, relaxing alternative to the increasingly congested
airports and airways.
Britain, of course, will remain on the periphery of all this. Separated from
the continent in the Ice Age, it is still waiting to be reconnected by the
tunnel, and seems unlikely to see its first continental rail services until
at least mid-1994.
The only consolation is that, thanks to the common track gauge set by its
pioneering engineers, it will at least be possible to travel between Britain
and the rest of Europe without having to change trains under the Channel.

Jacques Delors is not the first European leader with grand ambitons. Uniting
Europe economically, as well as politically, has been a goal of the powerful
for centuries.
Charlemagne, Barbarossa, Charles V, Napoleon and Hitler all belong on the
list of continental European rulers who have tried to build and maintain a
trans-European empire, although using more coercive methods than today's
politicians.
Yet few have managed to translate their conquests into an integrated economy
within which trade flows freely. And, so far, nobody has succeeded as well
as the Romans.
Octavian, heir of Julius Caesar, the conqueror of Gaul, is the true father
of Europe's single market. After his victory over Antony and Cleopatra at
Actium in 31 BC, it was Octavian, as the Emperor Augustus, who consolidated
Rome's vast European empire. Stretching from Egypt in the south-east to
Britain in the north-west, the empire of Augustus and his successors was an
economic, as well as a military, triumph.
'The Roman Empire created a vast area, with a single currency and low
customs barriers, in which commerce was hindered by neither pirates nor
frontiers and was aided by an elaborate network of roads and protected
harbours', the Times Atlas of World History declares.
Yet no single market can be trans-European without the Germans. Only
following the barbarian invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries, which
brought the Roman empire to an end, could modern Europe emerge.
Many subsequent conquerors have tried to create an integrated European
economy along Roman lines. None has succeeded. Only the second half of this
century, after ruinous conflicts among the European Great Powers, have
aspirations to build a new Roman Empire begun to look realisable.
Jean Monnet was the French architect of this new Europe. He was the
inspiration behind the Schuman Plan, which led to the European Coal and
Steel Community, formed in 1952 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
West Germany, France and Italy. This laid the foundations for the Treaty of
Rome, ratified in 1957, and the European Economic Community.
The EC has grown in memberhsip, scope and ambition over the last 40 years.
It is still some distance from creating a politically integrated community.
The Maastricht treaty's plans for a monetary union and greater defence
co-operation envisage a united Europe.
Yet the goals of Maastricht are still aspirations. The EC's greatest
tangible achievement to date is the Single European Act. Nurtured by EC
Commission President Jacques Delors, it forms the legislative basis for
Europe's second single market.

Spreading your professional wings abroad should be easier in Europe's open
market where qualifications gained at home are recognised across the
Community. In principle, a British teacher like the one above working in
Torremolinos, Spain, has been able to do so since 1990 when early single
market legislation fell into place. Most professional qualifications are now
recognised throughout the EC and additional measures enable free movement
for everyone from architects to hairdressers. However, in practice, many
professionals still face national and linguistic barriers, and find
transporting home-grown skills across borders less than straightforward.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Europe 1993: The single market and you - All you ever wanted
to know about a frontier-free Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the single market?
A market without borders allowing free movement of people, goods, capital
and services for the 344m people in the EC's 12 nations. It also aims to
harmonise technical standards, regulations and enforcement procedures.
First agreed in 1985 under Single European Act, it is to be extended later
in 1993 to another 24m people in Austria, Finland, Norway, Iceland,
Liechtenstein, Sweden.
What language should I speak to master it?
In the EC, 23 per cent speak German as their first language, 18 per cent
English and French, 17 per cent Italian. Man sollte Deutsch lernen.
How will it affect the European economy?
Could be a recession-beater - but don't count on it. Optimistic EC report in
1988 claimed market would add 4.5 per cent to EC's GNP in medium-term.
Because of anticipatory surge in investment during last few years, Brussels
officials say 30 per cent of that has already worked its way through.
Will it make me better off?
Yes, if you or your company can profitably reach extra customers. No, if you
fail to adjust to extra competition. If you are among the EC's 16m
unemployed, don't expect miracles.
Why are some companies complaining?
Scrapping of customs posts means new value added tax and statistics
collection system, increasing the workload for thousands of EC companies.
More changes may come in 1997.
Will my life be ruled by bureaucrats in Brussels?
They initiate legislation, but the counter-blast of public discontent during
1992 means they are now shy about pushing member states around. Remember:
governments agreed the directives and must implement and enforce them. So
watch out for bureaucrats in national capitals as well.
Which country will fare best?
Could be the Netherlands. It already has the largest proportion of exports
going to other EC countries (76.5 per cent). And it registered the largest
intra-EC trade surplus in 1991 (Dollars 21bn).
Will big companies or little ones be the main winners?
Many big companies have already adapted through mergers, rationalisation,
distribution shake-ups. Small flexible companies with keen eye for
buying/selling opportunities on niche markets likely to fare best.
Will I still need a passport to travel around Europe?
Yes. Britain, Denmark and Ireland retain internal border controls on people.
The nine others won't end passport checks before mid-1993 at earliest. If
you want to complain about barriers, ring the Euro Citizen Action Service
frontier control hotline in Brussels (this week only): 322-5348325; Fax:
5345275.
Can I vote in the French national elections next spring?
Under the Maastricht treaty, EC citizens living in other EC countries can
vote in local elections. But, even after Maastricht ratification, you will
be able to vote in French legislative elections only if you have French
citizenship.
How much beer and how many cigarettes can I now carry across internal EC
borders. How much can I spend on gifts to take home?
Reinforce the estate car's axles: you can bring home as much as you like,
tax-paid, as long as you can make out a good case that it's for personal
consumption. National customs authorities have set certain limits,
representing quantities estimated for personal use, but these are
non-binding. Customs may make spot checks and may seek proof you're going to
drink those 200 cases of champagne yourself - or at least serve them at your
daughter's wedding.
How much can I buy in duty-free shops?
Limits unchanged, but duty-frees for travellers within EC to be abolished
from July 1999. No more border checks so harassed duty-free shop assistants
will have to enforce the rules themselves.
Will the Community be swamped with immigrants?
In theory, external frontiers will be strengthened, tougher rules applied to
asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants.
What about the Mafia? Are cross-border crime and drugs smuggling bound to
increase?
Drugs, criminals, stolen property, pornography may circulate more freely,
and there may be a boom in single market crimes, such as bootlegging cheap
cigarettes. But border law-enforcers are now mobile, and - if governments
can agree on HQ for Europol organisation - co-operation on terrorism and
drugs will improve.
Will food become more or less hygienic?
More, says Brussels. Less, say consumer groups, fearing that strict national
measures will be dropped. In fact, zealous national officials have tightened
up EC requirements in some states, but that has prompted complaints that
granny will have to install an expensive new kitchen if she wants to go on
selling home-made scones.
Will tax authorities in EC countries pool information, catching up on my
undisclosed foreign income stashed in a Luxembourg bank account?
Beware] Tax authorities are stepping up information exchanges, although no
routine swapping of computerised data. But exchange of income tax data is
excluded from some bilateral tax agreements, and Luxembourg retains its
jealously guarded banking secrecy laws.
Will I be able to buy a second home anywhere within the EC without any
controls?
No. Single market legislation does not extend to property, so you will still
have to comply with local legislation. For instance, Denmark has maintained
its right to prevent non-resident foreigners buying holiday homes - and this
is being specifically upheld in the Maastricht treaty.
Can I get my bad back treated in Heidelberg under the German health service?
Will the NHS be obliged to treat any EC national?
Reciprocal arrangements already in place allow any EC citizen basic health
care in a member country. Doctors unlikely, however, to carry out more than
emergency treatment.
Will my qualifications as an accountant be recognised in Rotterdam?
Yes. Most professional qualifications have been acceptable throughout the EC
since 1990, with additional measures opening up free movement of everyone
from architects to hairdressers. In practice, 'foreign' professionals are
still said to face national and linguistic barriers.
Will I be able to buy my car in the cheapest country in the Community and
drive it home without paying more tax?
Buy a new car abroad - free of VAT, unlike other products - and you should
be able to drive it home without further formalities. When you register it
at home you'll pay VAT on the price at the local rate. From May,
manufacturers will publish comparative price lists to help you decide which
country is cheapest.
Where can I find information on where to buy the best-value video-recorders
and CD players?
Beuc, the European consumers' organisation, has published EC-wide price
surveys - covering CD players, CDs, car tyres, toys, camcorders, compact
cameras, stereo radio cassettes, loudspeakers, and electronic pianos.
Contact Beuc at Avenue de Tervuren, Bte 4, 1040 Brussels (telephone:
322-7353110), but note that they won't advise you on best buys.
Can I use my stockbroker to buy shares anywhere in the EC?
Yes, free movement of capital was one of the objectives of the single market
programme.
Will I be able to take out an insurance policy or pension plan offering
benefits in any EC currency?
Insurance policies should be sold across borders from July 1994, increasing
choice and reducing prices. Pension plans are more difficult  - you should
be able to buy one anywhere, but you may not be able to take it with you
when you move across borders.
Will I be able to take my dog all over Europe without controls?
Attempts to make Britain and Ireland scrap tough quarantine rules have
failed. You can take your pets to the continent, but they face a long stay
in kennels if you try to bring them back.
Will I be able to use my portable phone anywhere in the EC? What about
electrical gadgets - hairdriers, TV, stereo?
You should be able to link to cellular phone networks anywhere in the EC,
but Europe may never see a single phone or electrical socket. Don't throw
away that universal adaptor.

Banks free to set up branches anywhere in the Community
Exchange controls to end, but Greece given extension
Later: Single market extended to six Efta states in second half of 1993
Passport checks for internal EC flights should end in December, but UK,
Denmark and Ireland may resist.
PENDING

FT  04 JAN 93 / 'Treaty of hope' signed by Bush and Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUMANITY'S largest step back from the nuclear arms race was formally agreed
in Moscow yesterday by presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and George Bush of
the US.
The Start 2 treaty promises, over the next decade, to cut the two countries'
arsenals of strategic missiles to one-third of their present levels.
'I would call this treaty a treaty of hope,' said Mr Yeltsin, speaking in
the Kremlin after signing the agreement. Mr Bush matched his rhetoric by
speaking of standing 'at the threshold of a new world of hope'. Like the
Russian president, he said it represented the fulfilment of dreams which had
until recently seemed unrealisable.
Mr Yeltsin appeared vigorous and genial throughout the public parts of the
two-day event. He said Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the new prime minister, would
continue economic reforms with 'the same cabinet' as had served Mr Yegor
Gaidar, his predecessor. He also promised to continue to back the US-United
Nations line of sanctions on Yugoslavia, in spite of dissent within his
parliament on both issues.
He said he was 'absolutely confident' that the Supreme Soviet would ratify
the treaty (as it had ratified Start 1 last November). However, Ukraine,
which with Belarus and Kazakhstan still holds strategic weapons, has not yet
ratified Start 1 - necessary before Start 2 can be implemented.
It is seen by the US as dragging its feet dangerously on the issue, although
yesterday Ukraine's president Leonid Kravchuk predicted that his parliament
would ratify Start 1.
Both Ukraine and neighbouring Belarus have bases housing bombers capable of
delivering nuclear missiles. Ukraine has been adamant that these bases,
though nominally controlled by the Commonwealth of Indepen-dent States, are
under its control.
Mr Bush assured Mr Yeltsin that Mr Bill Clinton, to whom he cedes office in
two weeks, backed the treaty and was committed to 'keeping relations with
Russia on the same high plane they are already on'.
Mr Yeltsin said he wanted to meet Mr Clinton soon after the President-elect
takes office on January 20. But Mr Clinton, flying home to Little Rock from
a holiday in South Carolina, said no date had yet been set for a meeting
with the Russian leader.
The treaty, codifying the agreement reached between the two presidents in
June last year in Washington, lays down a series of reductions over two
phases - the first ending seven years after Start 1 comes into force, the
second ending at the latest in 2003.
The number of strategic nuclear missile warheads held by either side will
not exceed 4,250 at the end of the first phase and 3,500 by the year 2003,
while intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads will be cut
entirely - signalling the end of the SS-18s deployed in the former Soviet
Union, a long-standing US goal. Submarine-launched ballistic missiles,
counted separately, will not exceed 1,750 warheads on either side.
One US official said yesterday that the cutting of the SS-18s and partial
destruction of their silos 'removes once and for all that dreaded thing, the
first strike'. In addition, 100 bombers will be 're-oriented' to
conventional roles, and transferred to conventional bases. New verification
procedures have been agreed, including a limited inspection right for
Russian officials of America's B2 'Stealth' bomber.
George Graham adds from Washington: In the US, senior senators from both
parties said they expected the Start 2 agreement to win ratification in
Congress.
Senator Joseph Biden, the Democratic chairman of the Senate judiciary
committee - which has jurisdiction over treaty ratifications - said his
concern was not with the treaty, but with the prospect that it might not be
implemented if the US did not do more to help the Russian government with
its economic reforms. 'I think we have been almost derelict in doing the
things we could be doing,' Mr Biden said.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Kohl warns of nationalist revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE is facing a revival of nationalist thinking, intolerance and even
chauvinism, in the west as well as the east, according to Mr Helmut Kohl,
the German chancellor.
The threat makes ever closer European integration, leading to ultimate
European union, all the more essential, he argues in an article written for
today's Financial Times.
In an urgent plea for continuing progress towards political as well as
economic union, beyond the 'interim step' of the Maastricht treaty, Mr Kohl
rejects the idea of a 'two-speed or three-speed Europe'. At the same time,
he says Germany 'cannot accept a Europe, the speed of which is dictated by
the slowest ship in the convoy'.
'We have more neighbours than any other country in Europe,' he says, 'so we
have a fundamental national interest in creating a European union to which,
one day, all our neighbours will belong.'
While praising the 'decisive role' of the European Community in helping to
overcome 'traditional rivalries and policies of national egoism', he warns
of the dangers of new nationalism.
'I doubt whether the evil spirits of the past . . . have really been
banished for good. No one should be under the illusion that the spectre of
European nationalism has finally been laid to rest, nor that this ugly
apparition is confined only to the Balkans . . . Even western Europe is not
immune to such temptations.'
He warns against 'people stirring up public sentiment with the argument that
Germany has become too large and too powerful, and therefore needs to be
'contained' by means of coalitions. It is a cruel irony that this kind of
talk plays into the hands of precisely those forces, not least in Germany,
which propagate old-style nationalism'.
To those who fear that the pace of integration is too fast and that
Maastricht is too ambitious, he asks: 'Can we afford to go more slowly?'

FT  04 JAN 93 / Major rules out UK return to ERM this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has ruled out sterling's re-entry into the European exchange
rate mechanism this year. He also raised the prospect of extending
international monetary co-operation beyond Europe to other currencies if
Britain returned to managed exchange rates.
The prime minister said one of the causes of tension within the system over
recent months had been the 'disequilibrium' between exchange rates and
interest rates in Europe, compared with those in the US and Japan.
The fall in the value of the dollar, in particular, made Europe relatively
uncompetitive, he said in an interview yesterday on BBC television's
Breakfast with Frost programme.
'Now we may need to look also - if we go back into the ERM and if the ERM is
reconstituted in anything like its old form - at some form of relationship
between the European currencies and the dollar and the yen.'
Mr Major suggested that it could be done informally, and Downing Street
later emphasised that the prime minister was not proposing a whole new
system of inter-related currencies.
It was made clear, however, that the UK believed this point would be
addressed in the work on the 'faultlines' in the ERM set in hand after the
October EC summit in Birmingham.
Although ministers have previously signalled that sterling would not return
immediately to the ERM, Mr Major's statement should make it easier for the
government to deal with the issue when MPs resume the debate on the
Maastricht bill, even though he will have disappointed the more
Euro-enthusiastic Tories.
Mr Major contrasted present circumstances with the downturn of the early
1980s, when unemployment continued to rise until 1986, even though the
recovery had begun.
This time around, he said, employers had shed staff earlier than in the
previous recession, leading to 'reasonable expectations' that unemployment
would not carry on rising for so long after growth had returned.
He repeated his upbeat message that 1993 would see economic growth, but his
tone was more cautious as he renewed warnings against taking any risks with
inflation.
His comments failed to satisfy his critics. Euro-sceptic Tory MPs said he
should have ruled out any return to the ERM.

A hundred years ago, the Financial Times appeared for the first time on pink
newsprint.  The colour has become an integral part of our character,
instantly recognised and regularly copied on newsstands around the world.
To mark the anniversary, the newspaper appears today dressed nearly all in
white.  A special third section includes a replica of the first pink FT
alongside a little local history, a snapshot of life in the City in the
early 1890s.
Today also marks the first full working day of the European single market.
In addition to our usual coverage, this issue examines how business and
economies are adapting to the changes, and how the EC as a whole may develop
in the years ahead.  Tomorrow, and for the next 100 years, we are back in
the pink.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Management: Tomorrow's leaders need to get up and go - Paul
Evans says that experience of working abroad is vital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A question companies frequently ask is: 'How can we develop the
Euro-manager?' I answer that the idea of a supra-national polyglot is as
illusory as that of a supra-national European union.
But what the single European market will do is to make it easier for
executives to develop the qualities that any business leader needs to cope
in a world where things have to be done better, cheaper and faster. And the
experience of managing in a different culture may be the best way of
developing global leadership talent.
The internationalisation of management is not simply a matter of ensuring
broad national representation on management teams, though that may be a
by-product. Languages help, but that is not the central issue. Nor is it a
question of developing some mythical international superperson.
The leaders I admire all tell me that they had a stretching assignment at an
early age. The time-tested formula is to find good people and then put them
in a position where they have to get results through people who think
differently from them, and who have more expertise - in other words, a
position where they have to lead.
Today the emphasis has shifted from cross-functional experience to
international experience. Dupont is a good example. Its norm for high
potential executives is: 'International experience is obligatory;
cross-functional experience is desirable and cross-divisional experience may
sometimes be necessary.' That would apply to companies of the calibre of
Shell, Unilever, Nestle, Ciba-Geigy and ABB.
A study by Kevin Barham and his colleagues at Ashridge Management College in
the UK showed that executives who successfully completed international
assignments excelled in a number of managerial competences: championing
international strategy (visioning the future), cross-border co-ordination
(handling international teams) and acting as cultural change agents (digging
below the surface and dealing with critical dilemmas).
Internationalisation is also a question of ensuring that managers have what
my colleague Yves Doz calls 'perspective'. Shell, IBM and Unilever want
local managers to run local businesses. But these companies would not trust
a local until that person had proven him or herself in a headquarters or
regional staff role.
But international management development is not just a tool to cultivate
individual managers. It can also give a company what Shell calls 'glue' or
'cohesion'.
Shell's organisational philosophy is to give autonomy to local operating
companies while acting as a tightly co-ordinated group. As Lo Van Wachem,
the former chairman of the group, said: 'There are three things that hold
these autonomous companies together. The first is the common logo. The
second is common financial systems. And the third and most important source
of cohesion is management development - close attention to career
development.'
Most corporations give at least token acknowledgement to internationalising
management. However, a 1989 survey of leading US corporations by Korn, Ferry
with Columbia Business School found only 6 per cent reporting that foreign
assignments were essential for senior executives, with 49 per cent believing
foreign assignments to be immaterial.
So why the disparity? The answer in part is that few such companies are
global and few have understood the connection between international
experience and leadership.
Another part of the problem lies with today's generation of CEOs, many of
whose international experience is patchy.
If I and my colleagues read the signals correctly, CEOs will be the next
rank in the hierarchy to come under fire. During the 1980s the
responsibility for strategy was largely devolved to business units. And in
today's flatter organisations, leaders in the middle are assuming ever
greater responsibilities.
I see a lot of disquiet among CEOs who are confronting issues such as the
role of top management in an age of global competition. And how does top
management add value to the corporation?
Many will be replaced by the new generation of leaders who can answer these
questions; whether they are German or British, Bangladeshi or Chinese
doesn't matter.
These coming top managers will be better leaders, with depth of perspective,
breadth of vision and an ability to thrive on complexity, all nurtured and
put to the test by their international experiences.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Management: Innocents abroad - Rethinking Europe /
Christopher Lorenz begins a series on changing single market strategies with
a look at the Phileas Fogg snack food group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Phileas Fogg is supposed to be a seasoned traveller. He certainly trades on
that reputation with great success on his British home ground.
But the truth is that, while he has a smattering of knowledge about such
exotic places as India, China and Mexico, he has almost always stumbled
whenever he has crossed the Channel to continental Europe.
Fogg laughs about his misadventures, even a recent nightmare in Germany.
Behind his genial facade, however, he has grown so fed up with his track
record that he has at last employed a proper guide.
That, in a nutshell, is the story of how Phileas Fogg - not the man, but the
brand of upmarket, exotic snack foods for adults - has failed to achieve its
potential in continental Europe over the past decade. It is also why, after
rethinking its approach, it is now making up for lost time.
The medium-sized company behind the brand, Derwent Valley Foods, is run by a
remarkably frank bunch of managers from Medomsley Road, Consett - an address
which features, tongue-in-cheek, in their TV advertising. Consett is a
former steel-making town on a windy ridge deep in the countryside of
north-east England.
Derwent Valley has developed impressively at home since its foundation in
1982, especially in its core market of south-east England. It expects total
revenue for 1992-93 of Pounds 24m, and profits of above Pounds 2m. Yet
barely Pounds lm of its sales are to continental Europe.
When, just over four years ago, the Financial Times last examined how
Derwent Valley was preparing Fogg for Europe's single market, the company's
top managers were open about their past failings.
One of them described their then desultory export efforts as 'a Mickey Mouse
operation'. This disarming self-disparagement is typical of the company's
style, but was not entirely fair for two reasons.
First, its explosive growth in Britain left little management time to cope
with the tricky problem of steering Fogg into continental Europe.
Second, the company had encountered the same problems which beset most
medium-sized would-be exporters of consumer products within Europe:
fragmented and sometimes impenetrable national distribution patterns. In
most industries these represent a far greater barrier to the creation of a
single market than do national and regional differences in consumer
preferences.
Even when national retail patterns seem superficially similar, the reality
is often otherwise. France has a growing number of large chains, but their
buying patterns contrast sharply with those in Britain. They are not only
more fragmented, but buying groups purchase on behalf of odd combinations of
retailers.
Even then, says Ray McGhee, Derwent Valley's marketing director, you still
have to sell to individual shops, each of which levies a one-off charge for
putting your product on its shelves. The company and its new French partner
are spending Pounds 200,000 on this in 1992-93.
In Germany there is a complex mixture of delicatessens and specialist
stores, plus large retail chains. The latter, unlike their British
equivalents, have numerous buying points.
Under Roger McKechnie, the chairman and managing director, Derwent Valley
decided in late-1988 to pause, lick its wounds, and start a thorough
research and planning exercise in order to prepare a real attack on the
continent. 'We've decided the time has come to do things properly,' he said
at the time.
It commissioned a consultancy study which, instead of proposing a marketing
plan, as expected, 'concluded that we had a lot more preparatory work to
do', McKechnie says.
Throughout 1989 and 1990 the company and its consultants carried out
consumer research. This demonstrated great potential interest in the Phileas
Fogg brand. But it also showed that the range of flavours would have to be
tailored to each of them.
It uncovered, too, a need not just to do each country's packaging in its own
language - at an initial cost of Pounds 10,000 a product per country - but
also to design a distinctive shape of package to stand out on continental
shelves.
By this time a decision had been made to concentrate on four markets, with
France and Spain the first two main ones. The export drive was still in the
hands of McGhee and another of the company's founders, but both were still
preoccupied with the UK.
Hence the move in 1990 to recruit a 'Mr Europe': Kim Fletcher, an ex-Heinz
manager who was operating across western Europe as international marketing
manager for a flavours and essences company.
His new brief involved two key tasks: fine-tuning Derwent Valley's products,
packaging, pricing and presentation for each main market; and finding strong
local partners which, unlike many of the company's previous ones, really
knew the country and had expertise and muscle in sales and distribution.
They also had to be committed to the brand concept, 'rather than just
wanting an interesting addition to their product range', says McGhee.
This strategy contrasted sharply with the company's previous approach of
selling the product wherever and through whomever it could.
Fletcher's groundwork bore fruit in 1992 with a quick succession of new
deals - each with hand-picked but different types of partner - in the
Netherlands, France and Spain. These are doing well and have boosted Derwent
Valley's exports to the continental Europe by half in 1992-93.
And then there is Germany. Back in late 1988, Derwent Valley thought it had
broken its long run of bad experiences with German distributors, and had
just signed up a local tobacco manufacturer moving into food brokerage.
But, as with other tobacco companies, its sales force failed to break into
the food side of supermarkets. The market opportunities in tobacco which
arose from the opening of East Germany also distracted it in the midst of a
Phileas Fogg test marketing exercise, and Pounds 200,000 of Derwent Valley's
investment went down the drain in 1989-90.
'We really had our underpants scorched,' grins McKechnie. 'After that, we
weren't in too much of a hurry to go back in.' Last October Derwent Valley
finally appointed a new distributor - an experienced operator which sells to
delicatessens.
On the company's current projections, exports to European countries
(including Ireland) will grow from Pounds 1.5m to at least Pounds 13m over
the next three years. At best, they could go to almost double that.
Whatever the actual outcome, Phileas Fogg does seem at last to be getting
into his continental stride.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Hospitals shrink from coming under the knife: Alan Pike
studies arguments about the Tomlinson proposals for London healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAQUE in the entrance to the Royal Brompton national heart and lung
hospital in Chelsea, London, commemorates a visit by the Queen in February
1991 to open a Pounds 45m redevelopment.
In recent weeks the wall displaying the plaque has carried posters reading:
'Don't Let Them Bulldoze the Brompton'.
There is a real possibility that, within two years of the royal opening, the
government will this month decide to close the Royal Brompton and its
neighbour, the Royal Marsden cancer hospital, which has also just undergone
an extensive rebuilding programme.
Many London hospitals are in a state of uncertainly as they await the
government decisions on the recommendations of the Tomlinson report, aimed
at reducing hospital beds in the capital. But the fate of the Royal Brompton
and Royal Marsden has raised wider questions about the quality of National
Health Service planning, the financial basis of the recommendations and the
future shape of medical research in London.
Near the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden looms the new Chelsea and
Westminster hospital. It is, with 665 beds, the largest single hospital
development in Britain. With its naturally ventilated atrium the size of
Wembley stadium, containing trees, plants and specially commissioned works
of art, it makes a striking flagship for the NHS.
Yet during the Tomlinson inquiry some witnesses seriously suggested that the
Chelsea and Westminster was never needed. It will open next month - but the
Tomlinson report concedes that it will add to the vulnerability of Charing
Cross teaching hospital, relatively nearby in Hammersmith.
Tomlinson recommends moving the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden to the
Charing Cross site to help form a 'major specialist centre' for treatment,
teaching and research.
Managers of the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden are opposed to the move.
They believe one reason for the recommendation is to find a use for the
1970s Charing Cross building now that the Chelsea and Westminster will
weaken its position in the NHS internal market.
Ms Phyllis Cunningham, chief executive of the Royal Marsden, said: 'I do not
think the Chelsea and Westminster was ever needed, and I am not only saying
that with the judgment of hindsight.'
Mr Ian Donnachie, chief executive of Riverside district health authority,
which runs the Charing Cross and the Chelsea and Westminster, emphasised
that the new hospital was planned before the government's health reforms. He
added that since its construction was accompanied by the closure of other
hospitals, the Chelsea and Westminster represented substantial
rationalisation of capacity.
'The fact is that both hospitals exist and the Charing Cross was built to a
very high standard. We believe the best policy is to house specialist and
research services at the Charing Cross and local services at the Chelsea and
Westminster, but with a strong overlap between the two centres,' he said.
Even before Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, announces her
decisions on the Tomlinson recommendations, however, the plan has run into
difficulties.
The Institute of Cancer Research and the Thrombosis Research Institute -
which work closely with the Royal Marsden and Royal Brompton and are located
near them - have decided that they would not follow the hospitals to the
Charing Cross site. They favour instead a proposal to link the Royal
Brompton and Royal Marsden, the research institutes and nearby Imperial
College - part of of London University - into a Chelsea health sciences
centre on the style of a US medical and research campus.
Mr Bill Bain, a health manager in the US and Canada before becoming chief
executive of the Royal Brompton, believes the scheme could, at low cost,
enhance the international standing of all the institutions involved.
He said: 'US experience has shown that such centres do not have to be
located on a single site. A move to Charing Cross to put us on one site
would detach us from Imperial College and undermine academic links.'
The Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden have presented a list of objections to
the proposed move to the Charing Cross site. They fear disruption of
services, and loss of identity and managerial freedom in the NHS internal
market. Much of the Royal Marsden's redevelopment was financed by a Pounds
25m charitable appeal rather than NHS funds, raising legal and moral
questions about any government decision to abandon the new facilities.
While North West Thames regional health authority told the Tomlinson inquiry
that moving the two hospitals would be more cost-effective than closing
Charing Cross, a study commissioned by the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden
from Ernst &amp; Young, management consultants, drew the opposite conclusion.
The Department of Health has commissioned more consultants, from Capita and
Touche Ross, to review the position and 'identify any other feasible
worthwhile options'.
The work has to be completed by January 18. Whatever decision Mrs Bottomley
then makes is likely to lead to the closure of some modern hospital
buildings.
In a buoyant economy, the cost of abandoning recently opened facilities
might be recouped by land sales. But critics argue that there is little hope
of that today.

FT  04 JAN 93 / State blamed for snags in training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has given insufficient weight to social and economic needs in
some old industrial towns and cities, a report by Salford University
Business Services says.
The authors say that this has affected funding to Training and Enterprise
Councils (Tecs) - one of which commissioned the report - and made it harder
to restructure a local economy and improve training. Tecs deliver government
training schemes in England and Wales.
Subs, an independent consultancy attached to the university, has produced an
indexed league table of quality-of-life indicators allowing Tec funding to
be weighted for special difficulties. The work has been done by two
economists, Mr Jim Twomey and Professor Neville Topham.
They have not been allowed to disclose which Tec commissioned the work, but
their indexing system has impressed other Tecs in tough areas which are now
seeking similar advice to argue for more public funds.
Taking greater account of economic and social deprivation ought to mean more
funds for enterprise training and local initiatives in areas with the
greatest difficulties. Tecs using the Subs indices will have objective
criteria to argue their case.
Topping the league table for best quality of life are the Tec areas covering
Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Milton Keynes, Surrey and the Thames Valley.
The bottom five of 75 in England are City and Inner London North,
Merseyside, Birmingham, East Lancashire and Bradford.
There is a cluster of blackspots involving seven Tecs in Merseyside, Greater
Manchester and Lancashire. Birmingham and Greater Nottingham are also among
the most difficult Tec areas, while there is another cluster of four
blackspots in Greater London.
The Salford analysis of how things are changing presents an even bleaker
picture. Quality of life appears to be improving most rapidly in the Tec
areas of Milton Keynes, the Thames Valley, Surrey, Hertfordshire and the
Heart of England; and falling fastest in City and Inner London North,
Tyneside, Wearside, Teesside and Merseyside - all of them with old,
inner-urban areas with narrow economic bases and high unemployment.
Prof Topham said: 'Future resource allocations should take account of the
backdrop against which individual Tecs have to work.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / Auditing rules welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE QUARTERS of accountants believe the new self-regulatory mechanisms for
auditors have improved the quality of their auditing, an academic survey
reports.
Only 5 per cent of their clients have noticed any change, though, except for
an increase in fees, since audit regulation was introduced by the
professional accountancy bodies in October.
The findings come in an analysis of the experiences of 160 practitioners by
Ms Stella Fearnley of Southampton University and Mr Michael Page of
Portsmouth University.
Accountancy firms said audit regulation had helped them enhance standards of
work with more systematic recording of work performed, changes in audit
methods, better planning and more staff training.
They said audit regulation was costing a significant amount. Set-up costs
for firms with three or fewer partners were Pounds 4,900 on average and
recurring fixed costs were estimated at Pounds 3,400, most of which
represented lost time. They said little had been recovered through fees to
clients.
Four fifths called for the abolition of the statutory audit for smaller
companies but most wanted some remaining safeguards to preserve the quality
of the financial information presented.
The study reflects the conclusions published last month in the official
report to the Department of Trade and Industry from the three chartered
accountancy bodies covering the UK.
It shows that only 11 of the 158 randomly chosen auditors visited in the
first year met all 13 quality control tests drawn up and emphasised that
there were 'procedural shortfalls' in many firms.
There are an estimated 10,200 auditors registered with the three chartered
accountancy institutes and a further 1,000 with the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants. But 160 firms between them audit all listed
companies, with eight firms auditing three quarters of them. Only 20 firms
each audit more than five listed companies. Two thirds of auditors are sole
practitioners and 90 per cent have four or fewer partners.

<TEXT>
BRITISH STATE pensions are among the least generous in the European
Community according to Labour Research, the independent trade union and
labour movement magazine.
A study by the organisation says arrangements in the UK are worse than in
any EC state except Ireland.
Labour Research says there are two main types of scheme in the EC - one
linked to earnings and the other flat-rate. The UK operates a mixture of the
two.
It says countries operating fully earnings-related schemes include Belgium,
with a top-rate entitlement of 60 per cent of earnings, France (50 per
cent), and Germany (60 per cent). Occupational pensions may face 'disaster'
unless reforms are made to the law in the wake of the Maxwell scandal, the
TUC warns today.
Its submission to the Goode Committee, which is reviewing pension law,
includes proposals for replacement of trust law with a single pensions act
and the separation of scheme assets from those of the employer.

LAUTRO, the chief self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, is
taking measures against the Life Association of Scotland, the
Edinburgh-based life company, that might lead to disciplinary action,
Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
LAS, which sells personal pensions, was told by Lautro to withdraw its
'pensions time bomb' advertising campaign last month. The campaign alluded
to the Maxwell pensions scandal, which occurred in an occupational scheme
and had no relevance to the field of personal pensions.
LAS was not available for comment yesterday.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Boardrooms look to their honours: The prime minister's
changes to the awards system could upset the expectations of many business
people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a fin de siecle feeling in Whitehall last week at the ending of
automatic honours for civil servants, career diplomats and politicians.
It should perhaps have been echoed in boardrooms across the country because
Mr John Major's overhaul of the honours system, which will affect the next
list in June, will have an impact well beyond officialdom.
Awards to figures in industry are not quite as routine and hierarchical as
honours for mandarins, but the government still looks after the business
establishment. More than half of the chairmen of the UK's top 100 companies
are knights or peers, and many other senior figures in those organisations
have received honours related to their status and length of service.
A statement on the results of the honours system review is expected in the
next three months. Downing Street has cautioned against expecting dramatic
alterations in the way awards are given, saying that changes will be
incremental. Over time, however, even the gradual shift envisaged will have
a striking effect. In 20 years' time the House of Lords might look very
different from its present appearance.
For a start, it might contain fewer business representatives. Mr Major has
created only two life peers from industry, and one of them, Lord Cooke, was
at the request of the Ulster Unionists.
The contrast in that respect with Mrs Thatcher's practice was heightened by
the awarding of three life peerages to businessmen in her resignation
honours list in 1991.
A further change from the Thatcher years may well be the expansion of the
list of those deemed acceptable for honours. Just as Mr Major gave political
awards to some Tory MPs snubbed by Mrs Thatcher, so he may be willing to
look beyond an inner circle of business leaders that was favoured by his
predecessor and included figures such as Lord Hanson; Lord Sterling, the
chairman of P&amp;O; and Lord King, the chairman of British Airways.
There are also signs that political activity might not be what it once was
as a way through the honours system. Although senior figures in generous
corporate donors to Tory party funds, such as United Biscuits, will probably
continue to receive awards, linkage may well be less immediate.
Mr Stanley Kalms, the chairman of Dixons, who was a cheerleader in one of Mr
Major's election campaign extravaganzas, has not yet received what many
might regard as his reward, while Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, the chairman and
chief executive of Kingfisher, the retail group, was knighted in last week's
list.
Although Kingfisher has given money to the Tories, it has also supported
Labour events, and the award seems to owe more to Sir Geoffrey's involvement
in initiatives such as Business in the Community.
If the honours system does tilt further towards recognition of the business
community's contribution to the government's rather than the Tory party's
activities, in a few years' time Mr Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin
Group, might well be celebrating a knighthood or life peerage for assisting
the franchising of British Rail passenger services.
Downing Street has given a strong hint that the honours review will lead to
closer links between an award and someone's broader role in the community.
There may be more awards such as the knighthood for Mr Paul Nicholson, the
chairman of Vaux group, the Sunderland-based brewer and hotels operator,
specifically for services to industry and to the public.
One aide said: 'The prime minister is keen to make the system reflect areas
where individuals make a contribution, rather than necessarily just do a
job. The contribution can be within the job, which may go beyond the job
specification, but equally may be beyond that in charity or voluntary work.'
He added that in the case of someone running an organisation, the
contribution might be in being flexible enough to enable their employees to
play an active part in the local community.
If the criteria for business honours shift in that direction, one likely
candidate might be Ms Anita Roddick, the managing director of the Body Shop
group, for her involvement with the homeless through the newspaper The Big
Issue.
Whether revamping the honours system makes it better at recognising
individual merit will not be clear for some time. But if the prime minister
is seeking to send an early signal that the worst aspects of politicking and
Buggins' turnery have been removed, he could do worse than ponder a life
peerage for Sir Bob Reid, the chairman of British Rail, whose concern for
BR's social role has led him to be both publicly and privately critical of
the privatisation plans.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Strong growth at Lloyd's continues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE rates and premium income continued to move strongly upwards at
Lloyd's of London during the final quarter of last year, the latest survey
of trends in the insurance market reports.
The increases are expected to continue over the next three months, according
to the quarterly survey of a sample of 25 leading underwriters.
Over the past quarter, 85 per cent of the sample recorded a rise in rates,
and none said rates fell. There were also no falls in premium income among
the sample - 83 per cent said income rose over the quarter and 17 per cent
said it stayed the same.
Looking forward to the first quarter of this year, 87 per cent of the
underwriters expected rates to continue to increase, while the other 13 per
cent predicted that they would remain stable. A total of 89 per cent
expected income to rise, and 11 per cent said it would stay the same. None
of those surveyed expected a fall to the end of the year.
However, syndicate expenses also rose in the final quarter of 1992. Forty
per cent of the underwriters recorded increases, 49 per cent no change and
only 11 per cent a fall. Some 43 per cent expected the rise to continue into
the first quarter of 1993.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Companies 'open to option claims'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of companies may be vulnerable to compensation claims over
share-option schemes from dismissed employees, Mr David Cohen, of City
lawyers Paisner &amp; Co, a leading adviser on share option schemes, says.
Since 1980 more than 2m employees, mainly managers and executives, have
received share options, and with the recent growth in executive unemployment
they are becoming an increasingly important part of a dismissed employee's
compensation.
When employees are unfairly dismissed, it has been held that they would not
be entitled to extra compensation for loss of share options. That belief, Mr
Cohen says, has been overturned by a recent verdict of the Employment Appeal
Tribunal in a case involving Texas Homecare, the DIY chain.
Mr Cohen says: 'That decision appears to indicate that even an option which
has only recently been issued - in the Texas case the option was only six
months old - will give rise to a compensation entitlement.'
Option valuation, he adds, is an imprecise exercise and one that few, if
any, tribunals are equipped to tackle.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Fall in output predicted to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTPUT BY manufacturers will continue to decline over the next few months,
the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply forecasts.
A survey published today by the institute, which represents purchasing
managers in manufacturing, shows that prices of imported raw materials
increased sharply in December for the third successive month, as a result of
the fall in the pound since Britain left the European exchange rate
mechanism on September 16.
Another report published today, by Infolink, a business information company,
indicates that the outlook for the consumer sector may be brighter. It says
demand for credit by consumers for purchases of cars and retail goods rose
in November for the second successive month.
An index published by the purchasing institute showing levels of economic
activity among member companies fell slightly to 49.2 in December from 49.5
in November. This indicates that an imminent upturn in manufacturing is
unlikely.
Companies last month reported a slight increase in new orders, with export
orders in particular benefiting from sterling's devaluation. Much of the
rise in orders was seasonal, related to an expansion in demand ahead of
Christmas.
Companies continued to run down stocks in December. The number of companies
sacking employees 'continues to substantially outweigh those recruiting',
the institute says.
The weak state of the European economy may hold back a significant upturn in
the UK, according to the latest world economic forecasts from Oxford
Economic Forecasting, an economic consultancy.

<TEXT>
THE NEXT four weeks are expected to be crucial for the building industry as
potential homebuyers decide whether they feel confident enough about the the
economy to enter the market.
A cut of least 1 percentage point in interest rates would make an immediate
difference, according to Mr John Bagnall, chairman of the Building Employers
Confederation, and the last thing the industry wanted to see was tax
increases in the Budget.
He warned in a new-year message that the industry was still in the grip of
the worst recession since the 1930s and that worse was to come.
'The BEC will shortly be analysing the results of its winter state-of-trade
inquiry and I expect them to show a continuing decline in output and
employment which will take the construction jobless past the 450,000 mark,'
he said.
However, the latest forecast by the National Council of Building Material
Producers showed a marked lessening in the decline in the industry's output
 -expected to fall by 1.5 per cent during the year.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Major stance on sterling is applauded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POSSIBILITY that Britain's separation from the European exchange rate
mechanism will end in divorce may have increased yesterday after Mr John
Major appeared to attach new conditions for sterling's re-entry and said
that that would not happen for at least another year.
The prime minister's reference to linking sterling in a modified form of the
ERM to the yen and the dollar was seen by several commentators as
impractical, on the ground that it would require an implausibly large
stepping up of co-operation on economic matters between Japan, the US and
Europe.
Mr Major's ruling out of sterling rejoining the ERM this year was applauded
as realistic by several members of the Treasury's new economic advisory
panel and by industry representatives. They said it improved the prospect of
a UK recovery.
One view was that if Britain proposed as a condition of ERM re-entry even an
informal method of linking European currencies with the yen and dollar, the
result might be a permanent block on the UK's re-joining the mechanism. The
UK left the ERM in mid September after widespread selling of the pound.
Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research and a member of the Treasury's seven-strong economic panel, which
meets for the first time this month, said: 'Mr Major's remark makes him
appear not to be all that keen on a European monetary policy. It throws
doubt as to whether he really wants Britain back in the ERM.'
Mr David Currie, head of economic forecasting at the London Business School
and another panel member, said: 'In view of the marked disagreements (on
economic policy) between Japan, the US and Germany, it would be extremely
difficult to adapt the ERM to introduce a link with the yen and the dollar.'
But there was a general welcome for the idea of Britain putting off re-entry
to the ERM for at least another year. Such a move would appear to rule out
during 1993 any government-inspired effort to engineer a higher sterling
exchange rate, in a development that would permit a relatively relaxed
policy on interest rates and so strengthen recovery prospects. Since Britain
left the ERM, sterling has depreciated by about 12 per cent against other
main currencies and the government has cut base rates by 3 percentage points
to 7 per cent.
Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, a long-time critic of UK
economic policy and a member of the Treasury advisory panel, said: 'I
welcome Mr Major's comments. We are seeing an enormous outbreak of good
sense.'
Others warned that in the long term industry would require a way to limit
changes in the value of sterling, irrespective of the future for the ERM and
whether Britain was a member.
Mr Andrew Sentance, head of economics at the Confederation of British
Industry and another member of the Treasury's economic panel, said:
'Industry has not lost interest in exchange rate stability.'
Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of Lucas, the engineering
components group, said: 'Industry has managed to live with currency
fluctuations in the past and will do so again, even if Britain stays out of
the ERM. I'm not too concerned about the UK failing to rejoin over the next
year, but longer-term it would be very useful to see greater stability in
currency rates.'
Mr Major's comments are unlikely to end the broader debate about whether
Britain's rejoining the ERM - possibly after enough time has elapsed to
permit a UK recovery and for the German Bundesbank to cut its interest rates
and so reduce some of the general strains within the mechanism - is in the
UK's best interests.
Mr Tim Congdon, head of economic consultancy Lombard Street Research and a
fierce ERM opponent who is another member of the Treasury's economic panel,
said: 'I am pleased that Britain is not going back (to the ERM) this year.
But I am disappointed that the government is even contemplating rejoining
later on.'
As far as much of industry is concerned, whatever the longer-term aspects of
possible ERM re-entry, there is widespread welcome for the benefits of a
lower sterling exchange rate.
PRIME MINISTER'S MAIN POINTS
In his interview with Sir David Frost, Mr John Major said:
The UK would not return to the European exchange rate mechanism in 1993
There might be a need for international co-operation to create a
relationship between European currencies, the US dollar and the yen, if
sterling returned to a managed exchange rate system
He expected 'gentle' growth of 1 per cent in 1993, accelerating in 1994
Unemployment might not lag so far behind recovery as it did after the
recession of the early 1980s
About two thirds of the public-sector borrowing requirement was cyclical and
there would be a 'benevolent change' once the economy recovered
The UK could not afford to take risks with inflation.  Low inflation and low
interest rates were needed to stimulate investment
The government's aim was to have the minimum level of taxation, particularly
direct taxation
The government was not retreating on British Rail privatisation but was
following through the proposals published last summer.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Bucking the trend: Eternal optimist plans expansion - A
specialist that has thrived since it was bought by its management on the eve
of the truck market collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR was the third in a row that the UK's commercial vehicle industry
would rather forget. For much of the year, UK truck sales continued a
headlong plunge to market levels rarely experienced since the second world
war.
There are at last tentative signs of recovery, though: sales of trucks over
3.5 tonnes have risen slightly, on a year-on-year basis, in each of the past
five months, and the trend is expected to strengthen this year.
It is, nevertheless, an extraordinarily gloomy background, but one against
which one manufacturer expects to announce sharply increased profits and
expanded sales and production for last year.
No less remarkable is that the company concerned floated itself successfully
on the London Stock Exchange little more than two months ago and has seen
barely more than three years elapse since becoming the subject of a Pounds
27.3m management buy-out almost on the eve of the collapse of the truck
market.
That Trinity Holdings - the maker of Dennis fire engines, dustcarts and
other specialised trucks and buses, as well as of Duple (Metsec) bus body
kits - has defied recession so strongly is a source of considerable
satisfaction to Mr Geoffrey Hollyhead, its chairman and chief executive, who
led the 1989 buy-out.
Market analysts expect that in a few weeks' time he will report that Trinity
achieved an operating profit of more than Pounds 8m in the financial year to
the end of this month. That compares with the previous year's figure of
Pounds 5.6m, and Pounds 4.8m in the first year after the buy-out from its
previous owner, Hestair.
Turnover has also risen steadily from Pounds 66m in the first year after the
buy-out to Pounds 82m the following year, with 1992's results expected to
exceed Pounds 100m. Only last month, Trinity won a Pounds 38m order from Sri
Lanka for its Duple (Metsec) subsidiary to supply 2,500 bus bodies.
That has provided a further boost for the investors who took up Trinity's
offer of 25m 10p shares at 120p a share in October.
Given that the Stock Market at the time was in recession-battered disarray,
both the flotation itself and the take-up - the issue was 2.3 times
oversubscribed - looked like a brave decision, particularly as the
engineering sector generally has been among the worst-hit by the recession.
But with Trinity's shares trading at 166p at the close last week, and
growing bullishness from the government and industry about this year's
economic prospects, the company's concerns are now very much with the future
and growth, particularly in exports.
In spite of the depressed conditions in some of the many market niches in
which Trinity specialises, the group's total vehicle production has
continued to rise.
Production at Trinity, which is based at Warwick and has plants at
Worcester, Halifax, Tipton and Guildford. reached 914 in the first three
quarters of last year, up from 690 in the comparable 1991 period, and output
continued to accel-erate in the final quarter.
With the order from Sri Lanka, Trinity expects to build further on export
activities, which already account for a third of its turnover. In that
regard, Trinity is building on the long-established presence of Dennis - one
of the UK's oldest vehicle makers through a succession of ownerships - in
Third World and other overseas markets outside Europe.
Some of Trinity's growth has come from acquisition, notably Reliance
Mercury, which specialises in dockyard and airport towing vehicles, and
Carmichael, the producer of airfield crash tenders and rapid-intervention
vehicles.
But a significant amount is expected to come from heavy investments in new
products. Among them are a new generation of chassis for the Dart, the UK's
best-selling bus, and a new range of refuse disposal vehicles.
Some Pounds 10m has gone into new manufacturing facilities at Guildford,
Surrey. Not content with traditional export markets such as Hong Kong,
Trinity has also begun a sales push into continental Europe, starting with
the Benelux countries.
At the same time, tighter inventory and other management controls are
attributed by Trinity's management team to the sharply improved financial
performance of the company. They are seen by Mr Hollyhead - a self-professed
'eternal optimist' - as putting the company in good shape for what is
expected to be a strong recovery in two of its main UK market sectors:
refuse vehicles, and buses and coaches.
Both have been affected not so much by recession as by the the government's
policies on privatisation and deregulation. Local-authority tendering and
the deregulation of bus and coach services - initiated in the 1980s - have
had knock-on effects in terms of the abolition of grants to bus buyers and a
reluctance to invest in new local-authority equipment.
Trinity believes that such disincentives - which have reduced demand for
such vehicles by up to a half - are now disappearing rapidly, with all that
that entails for growth this year.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Howard to meet leasehold lobby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Howard, the environment secretary, is to meet Tory backbenchers
urging greater rights for tenants in the government's proposals on leasehold
reforms.
Ministers are conscious that an alliance between Labour and the tenants'
lobby in the Tory party could defeat the government when the housing bill
comes before the Commons as a whole for detailed consideration, probably
early next month.
The bill, which gives tenants on long leaseholds the right to buy the
freehold of their block of flats or the right to extend their leases, and
extends the right to buy for public-sector tenants, has had a troubled
passage so far.
Ministers have already had to agree to consider extending tenants' rights.
The government knows that to avoid defeat it must satisfy its backbench
'pro-tenant' critics by abolishing the low-rent test, which is one of the
criteria for whether leaseholders qualify for the right to buy the freehold
of the property.
At the same time, ministers fear that if the lobby on behalf of the
landlords feels very hard hit, a few Tory MPs might abstain or vote against
the bill's final Commons stage.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Spens sues Bank of England governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Spens, the merchant banker who was acquitted of fraud charges after his
involvement in the Guinness affair, yesterday confirmed that he is suing Mr
Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, for damages.
Writs against Mr Leigh-Pemberton and Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank  -
Lord Spens' former employer - were obtained by Lord Spens on December 31.
They will be served once his solicitors have prepared a statement of claims,
which must be done within four months. Lord Spens is suing Mr
Leigh-Pemberton and Ansbacher over the loss of his job as head of corporate
finance at the merchant bank.
'The Bank of England forced me to resign by threatening Henry Ansbacher with
the loss of their licence,' Lord Spens said yesterday. He is claiming
aggravated damages from the Bank of England for inducing breach of contract
and damages for breach of contract from Ansbacher. Lord Spens received a
Pounds 75,000 payoff when he was dismissed by Ansbacher in 1987.
He says he hopes that the litigation will result in an examination of the
methods by which the Bank of England reaches its decisions. 'The Bank's own
minutes showed that they threatened Ansbacher. They forced me to resign
without bothering to inquire into the facts,' Lord Spens said. Many other
people had been pushed out of jobs as a result of similar actions by the
Bank, he added. 'The power and patronage that the Bank of England has is
frightening. It is sufficient to note that Mr Leigh Pemberton is still there
after BCCI.'
Mr Richard Fenhalls, chief executive of Henry Ansbacher, said yesterday that
he knew about the action only from newspaper reports. He said he could not
comment until he saw a writ. The Bank of England said yesterday it had not
received a writ and could not recall any occasion in which it had been sued
over its powers to remove individuals.
The Bank has statutory powers under the 1987 Banking Act to force banks to
remove managers deemed not to be 'fit and proper'.
Lord Spens left Ansbacher before the 1987 Banking Act took effect. The Bank
used its powers under the 1979 Banking Act, which said that all banks must
be prudently managed.
Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank, has been made a short-odds
favourite to replace Mr Leigh-Pemberton in July. Ladbrokes has offered odds
of 5-4, ahead of Sir David Walker (2-1), former chairman of the Securities
and Investments Board and deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Matrix affair still casts its shadow: The outlook for BSA
Tools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS another gloomy year ended for the machine-tool industry, Mr Keith Bailey
had more reason than most in the sector to want to put the year behind him.
The chairman of BSA Tools, owned by his holding company Automation
Investments, was cleared at the Old Bailey last November, when Customs and
Excise dropped a charge against him of evading export controls in selling
machine tools to Iraq.
Now Mr Bailey, a key figure in the Matrix Churchill affair, is trying to
rebuild his businesses. But as the new year gets under way, the affair is
still casting its shadow.
For Mr Bailey, meanwhile, a five-year nightmare that began with a lathe
order from Iraq has transformed him into the owner of the UK's widest, and
among the most sophisticated, range of machines for turning metal
components.
In between have come the controversial purchase by Mr Bailey's Automation
Investments of Matrix Churchill from its Iraqi owners; the visit from
Customs and Excise in April 1991 that led to the charge against him; and the
receivership of Matrix Churchill last summer, followed by its purchase by
Automation Investments from the receivers.
Mr Bailey bought the BSA Tools product line in 1986 when its owner, White
Consolidated Industries of the US, was taken over by Electrolux. He began
operations in Birmingham, producing multi-spindle and single-spindle
automatic lathes ('automatics') - fast but relatively inflexible machines
for dedicated volume production of turned parts.
In April 1987 Mr Bailey had a telephone call from a sales director, asking
whether BSA was interested in supplying Iraq. 'I asked him who had phoned
and he said he didn't know,' Mr Bailey recalls.
He wrote to the trade commission at the Iraqi Embassy, saying BSA was
interested. Subsequently he had a call from Meed International, the company
that helped Iraqi officials buy Matrix Churchill in 1987. 'They said, 'Come
down to talk to us.' '
It soon became clear that the Iraqis were not interested in single or
multi-spindle autos. 'They were quite adamant that they wanted flexible
machines. Their (Meed's) understanding was that Iraq wanted to be the Japan
of the Middle East,' he says.
In July 1987, BSA received the Pounds 7m order from the Iraqis for 50
computer numerically controlled (CNC) lathes.
He says he was told by Meed in 1987 that the equipment would probably be
tested on the production of shell casings, but he did not attach
significance to this as the Iraqis had wanted flexible machinery. 'I always
anticipated that the ultimate use of the machines would be on civil
components,' he says.
That, he says, was borne out by the facts. In 1990, when Mr Bailey was
visiting Iraq to sell some add-on equipment, he found the majority of the
lathes were producing car spares and pipeline fittings.
In autumn 1990 the Iraqi owners of Matrix Churchill, which also produced CNC
lathes, wanted to know if Mr Bailey was interested in buying the company.
The offer presented a dilemma. The risks were heavy. The Bank of England had
frozen Matrix Churchill's assets, there were fears that Customs and Excise
would prosecute the company as well as its former executives, and concerns
that the Export Credits Guarantee Department would not pay a claim against
Matrix's machine-tool contract with Industrias Cardoen of Chile, one of the
leading arms suppliers to Baghdad in the 1980s. On the other hand, Mr Bailey
needed additional product lines.
According to some, Mr Bailey was really interested in acquiring Matrix's
assets cheaply. He disputes that, saying the company had net assets of only
Pounds 3m-Pounds 5m, excluding potential redundancy costs.
The deal took four months and was completed in February 1991. AI gave a
Pounds 1.8m promissory note and agreed to pay a further sum based on the
value of the company at a later date.
Two months later, things began to go wrong for Mr Bailey. After the Customs
and Excise visit in April, Mr Bailey was charged.
The charges may since have been dropped but Mr Bailey and AI are not yet out
of the woods. A feud with Matrix's bank pushed Matrix into receivership in
July and, two months later, Mr Bailey put Pounds 500,000 of his own money
into a complex deal to buy the company back from the receiver and sell on
virtually everything apart from the Churchill lathe range.
In the short term, AI's machine-tool businesses - BSA and the Churchill
lathe range - and its 150 employees are cushioned by an order book worth
just over Pounds 1m, Mr Bailey says.
The affair has left some big financial question marks. The ECGD claim -
which is due to the Matrix receivers - has not been paid, and AI is still
due to pay the Iraqis a promissory note whose legal status is being
examined. There have been no takers yet for Matrix's Coventry site, now
closed but worth perhaps Pounds 2m.
Meanwhile, fallout from the affair is still worrying UK machine-tool
producers, whose prospects this year are uncertain at best. In the wake of
the dropped charges, the industry believes export deals to important but
sensitive machine-tool markets such as Iran are being thwarted by
export-licence and customs delays.
'You just can't get an answer when you apply for an export licence for sales
to countries such as Iran,' says the head of another big UK producer. 'It's
frustrating when substantial amounts of business are available, but you just
have to forget it because it's not worth the effort.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / Groups lift share in care homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE profit-making groups of care-home owners increased their share of the
long-stay residential home market last year, according to figures published
today by Laing &amp; Buisson, the healthcare publisher.
A study of private home provision for elderly and physically disabled people
shows that large groups provided 13.6 per cent of places last year, compared
with 12.1 in 1991. That represents continuing penetration by large corporate
and charitable operators in a market once dominated by single-owner homes.
The Laing &amp; Buisson study shows that Takare, with 29 homes and 3,607 beds,
is the largest corporate provider, followed by Westminster Health Care with
38 homes and 2,478 beds.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Lord Young voices doubts on sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD YOUNG of Graffham, chairman of Cable and Wireless and new president of
the Institute of Directors, believes that the establishment of a true single
market in Europe may take 20 years, that privatisation in the UK might be
going too far and that politics, the Civil Service and business would
benefit from easier career interchange.
He presents his views in an interview in the January issue of Director
magazine.
The single market will work in time even if the situation in
telecommunications, for example, is 'appalling', he says. 'There are
monopolies all over Europe, except in the UK, where we have . . .
liberalised.'
He says: 'In France and Germany there is no competition. The European
Commission has been trying hard to get competition going, and surprise,
surprise, it's been the French that have been stopping it.
'At the moment it can cost three times as much to telephone across Europe
than it would to telephone across a similar distance in the US.'
Lord Young approves of the privatisation of Cable and Wireless, British
Aerospace, British Airways, British Leyland and British Telecom, 'solid
commercial companies which for some bizarre reason were owned by the
government'. But he has doubts about more recent candidates such as coal or
the railways. 'We may be reaching a bit too far and it may just be there are
some things which are quasi-commercial and should be left in the public
sector,' he says.
He is sad that few people have followed his varied career path and would
encourage short-term commissions in the Civil Service for graduates.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PLANS for an ITV 2 channel on satellite television have been shelved,
Raymond Snoddy writes.
ITV started researching the project last year when the BBC and Thames
Television announced plans to launch UK Gold, a satellite service, based
mainly on the programme libraries of both organisations.
UK Gold, which started at the beginning of November, has performed better
than expected, although the number of viewers is still modest compared with
conventional television.
ITV's research suggested that ITV 2 might cost up to Pounds 60m in its first
year. One ITV chief executive said the project is 'on the back burner'.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Overspend by BBC may rise to Pounds 90m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS ARE growing that the potential overspend at the BBC is substantially
more than previously admitted publicly.
The BBC has conceded that because of 'a series of reporting and control
failures' there had been an overspend of Pounds 38m in 1991-92 at BBC
Television. The overall BBC budget was, however, balanced by the end of that
financial year. In addition, BBC Television has ordered Pounds 20m cuts to
deal with a potential overspend in this financial year but admitted that the
total would be higher. A further Pounds 12m in savings has already been
asked for.
Senior BBC staff believe the total involved over the two years might be more
than Pounds 90m, although the figure is not confirmed. There are concerns
that no one knows precisely the state of BBC Television finances and whether
all the 'reporting and control failures' have been dealt with.
A governors' audit committee chaired by Lord Barnett, vice-chairman of the
BBC governors and a former chief secretary to the Treasury, found there was
no evidence of fraud.
As a result of the overspend, the BBC is believed to be approaching its
Pounds 200m borrowing limit.
The issue will mean a difficult debut for Mr John Birt, the new BBC
director-general who has taken over from Sir Michael Checkland. Mr Birt is
looking for a Pounds 50m contingency fund, partly in case there are any
unexpected recurrences of financial difficulties in the 1993-94 financial
year.
The atmosphere of cuts and savings at BBC Television will make it more
difficult for Mr Birt to realise his vision of a BBC which offers a more
distinctive service which is less reliant on cheap, imported programmes.
Distinctive UK-made programmes will cost more than imported programmes. Mr
Birt hopes to make substantial savings through Producer Choice. The scheme
gives producers the right to buy services in the external market if they are
more cost-effective.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Distance learning MBA launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW TYPE of distance-learning master of business administration degree for
financial specialists is to be offered worldwide by a company set up by the
University of Wales at Bangor and Manchester Business School.
The degree - which the two institutions say is unique - has been designed
for English-speaking managers in sectors such as banking, insurance,
accountancy, building societies or corporate financial control.
The MBA will be awarded by the University of Wales but be run by the
company, which is called the Institute of Financial Management. The course
has been designed by Manchester's Centre for Banking and Financial Services
and Bangor's School of Accounting, Banking and Economics.
A network of study support centres around the world will enable students to
take the degree from anywhere in Australia, Africa, India, South America,
the Caribbean, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia or the Far
East.
The course, which is spread over 30 months, will contain several short
periods of full-time study, but most work will be done part-time in parallel
with a normal job. It is open to graduates or people with equivalent
banking, insurance or building society qualifications, or relevant
management experience.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Business leaders warn of effects of EMS unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN currency instability could significantly reduce benefits of the
single market, business leaders have warned.
In an FT survey of European business opinion, chief executives say unrest in
the European Monetary System has diminished prospects for economic and
monetary union (Emu) taking place by the Maastricht target date of 1999.
Most remain convinced, however, that a common European currency will be
necessary to boost Europe's competitiveness.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, the UK chemicals group, said: 'If the
Community wants to have a fully effective single market, Emu with a single
currency is desirable.' But the Maastricht timetable will probably be
delayed.
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, the French electrical and
engineering group, said: 'Currency instability is hampering Emu prospects.
If this is not cured in the near future, it will slow down the cross border
rationalisation process.'
The need for Emu to be based on greater European economic convergence is,
however, underlined by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of Germany's Siemens
electrical group.
Asked what measures governments should take to improve the business outlook,
several chief executives called for lower German interest rates and a
successful outcome to the Gatt talks.
Sir Owen Green, chairman of British industrial conglomerate BTR and a
sceptic on Emu, said: 'The most important action for EC governments would be
to achieve lower interest rates.'
Many of the companies have already shaken up their operation to benefit from
the single market. In the short term, chief executives expect the gains to
be moderated by the current downturn across Europe.
'The single market coincides with recession,' said Mr Daniel Janssen,
chairman of the Belgian chemicals group Solvay. 'We will see a lot of
restructuring and closures. We will emerge from all this with greater
productivity and lower prices, above all for services.'
Mr Fabiano Fabiani, chairman of the Italian engineering company
Finmeccanica, welcomes the single market's impact in opening up previously
closed sectors in foreign countries. But he adds a note of caution: 'We will
also face more competition.'
Respondents voice scepticism about prospects in central and eastern Europe.
Sir Denys Henderson said his company does not expect any single investment
there to exceed Pounds 5m this year.
Mr Sixto Jimenez of Spain's Viscofan said: 'I believe we will rapidly see
economic normalisation in Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics and,
maybe, Poland. The great unknown is Russia.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / GRE issues writ against Coopers &amp; Lybrand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the composite insurance company, is suing Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, its former auditors.
Mr James Morley, finance director of GRE, said yesterday that the company
had issued a writ last week against Coopers &amp; Lybrand in relation to their
audit and other services in 1986, 1987 and 1988.
The writ does not make clear the specific charge against Coopers &amp; Lybrand
but Mr Morley said the move related to the commercial mortgage lending
operations of Guardian Assurance, its wholly-owned subsidiary.
In its last financial statement for the six months to June 30 1992, GRE
reported that investment income fell from Pounds 142m to Pounds 133m because
of property write-downs.
In 1991 GRE dropped Coopers &amp; Lybrand in favour of Price Waterhouse as its
accountants, citing the need for a single auditor for its worldwide
operations. Mr Morley said that at the time it had considered a number of
auditors for the job, including Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
A spokesman for Coopers &amp; Lybrand said yesterday that the company had
received a draft writ. He expressed surprise at the move, given that in its
1990 Report and Accounts, GRE said: 'The Board is greatly appreciative of
the services the Company has received from Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte over
many years.' The spokesman said on the basis of the draft writ, Coopers
would vigorously contest any claim.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Economics Notebook: Time to discuss a Europe-wide monetary
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT has been done more by accident than design.
But the European Community today is more to the taste of the UK government
than at any time since June 1988 when EC leaders in Hanover launched the
community down the road to economic and monetary union.
The single market, although incomplete and imperfect, has been brought
closer than many sceptics thought possible when it was launched in 1985.
The recent upheavals in the European exchange rate mechanism have dimmed the
prospects of Emu by the end of the century.
Indeed, if the ERM falls prey to continuing strains, resulting in the break
of the D-Mark-French franc link, the outlook for Emu would be so bleak that
the EC might turn with greater vigour to completing the single market.
But there is another scenario, which could threaten the position of the City
of London as an international financial centre and demands serious thinking
about the future of the Bank of England.
Suppose that the ERM, against the expectations of many commentators and
operators in the foreign exchange markets, survives the coming months with
the D-Mark-French franc relationship intact, or even strengthened.
Then the French government and other EC countries such as Belgium would want
to push ahead as quickly as possible with Emu. The German Bundesbank,
although doubtful about Emu, would be keen to finalise details of a future
European monetary policy, just as in the months before the December 1991
Maastricht summit, it pushed for - and secured - agreement on statutes for
the proposed European central bank that are largely modelled on its own
Bundesbank law.
The possible shape of a future Europe-wide monetary policy is hardly
discussed in Britain. This may be understandable given the likelihood that
the UK will be outside the ERM for a lengthy period. But it is being
discussed in the remaining ERM countries as well as among EC central
bankers.
Already the Bundesbank is staking out positions that, if eventually
accepted, would put the City in a far less favourable monetary policy
environment than today. On December 17 last year, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, gave a lecture at Frankfurt university in which he
outlined his vision of a European monetary policy.
It would include:
money supply targets for Europe as part of a stringent counter-inflationary
policy. These targets would be similar to those used by the Bundesbank to
guide and justify its high interest rates during the past three years.
minimum reserve requirements - the absence of which has been one of London's
attractions as an international financial centre.
Germany's minimum reserve requirements help give the Bundesbank tight
control over the provision of liquidity to the banking system and have
helped slow down the process of financial innovation in Germany.
The Bundesbank wants minimum reserves in a Europe-wide monetary policy
because it fears that the lack of such an instrument would cause too much
emphasis to be placed on fine-tuning monetary policy: a criticism its
officials make privately of UK monetary policy.
One of Mr Schlesinger's goals is to safeguard any future European central
bank from having to worry about interest rates on a daily basis instead of
focusing on medium-term objectives such as money supply growth and the
ultimate goal of defeating inflation.
The Bundesbank also disapproves of the prominence given to
lender-of-last-resort responsibilities in Anglo-Saxon central bank policies.
If Mr Schlesinger and his successors have their way, any future European
central bank will be biased strongly against bailing out financial
institutions.
The interests of individual financial centres would be subordinated to the
European bank's paramount policy goal of price stability. If the German
vision of a European monetary policy is realised, a future financial crisis
could see banks or financial institutions in the City being allowed to go
under rather than being rescued to safeguard London's position as an
international financial centre.
These ramifications of a future EC monetary policy should be a matter of
debate in Britain. Also important is how much influence the Bank of England
can bring to bear in the discussions with Britain's EC partners on such
matters.
The Bank would hope to muster some allies - including perhaps France - to
help limit the Bundesbank's ambitions. But the UK is outside the ERM, a
factor that reduces the Bank's influence in EC affairs. The Bank also lacks
the clout that the Bundesbank has from independence. Unlike other EC central
banks, it has no grounds to believe that the government wants to give it
more freedom.
The Bank's court meets later this month for a preliminary, internal
discussion over the future of the Bank. The question of independence, or at
least greater operational freedom from the Treasury, is certain to be on the
agenda.
Last week, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, fired a shot across the court's
bows by again rejecting the idea that UK monetary policy should be
transferred to an independent Bank of England.
But the government is committed to ratifying the Maastricht treaty. If (and
they are admittedly big ifs) the ERM survives, Emu stays on the EC's agenda
and the UK parliament eventually accepts stage three of Emu, Britain will
have to accept an independent central bank at some time - and one which will
most likely be in Bonn rather than in London.
As the future of the City may be influenced by the Bank of England's status,
the debate about its future should be brought more into the open.
This should be possible now that the Treasury has a new policy of openness
and greater accountability. In the circumstances, the least Mr Lamont could
do would be to explain why he is so strongly opposed to an independent
central bank for Britain and detail the benefits that Britons gain from
keeping the Bank of England under his thumb.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Stock markets slow down on road to convergence / A look at
the impact of instability in Europe during the past year on equity
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN investors no longer care where a company is based, Europe's stock
markets will finally have converged.
A year ago, that process looked well under way. Everything argued for
convergence: the imminence of the EC's single market; the steady progress
towards European monetary union, the increasing firmness of the exchange
rate mechanism; the negotiations to create a European Economic Area linking
Sweden, Switzerland and Austria to the 12. Big brokerage houses had
reorganised their research departments to carry out pan-European sectoral
analysis; equity strategists were wondering how to allocate pension fund
assets under Emu.
It seemed to be a question of when, not whether, European equity markets
would converge.
In the bond markets, many investors were already convinced. Arguing that Emu
would lead to equalisation of interest rates at around the German level,
convergence enthusiasts saw bargains in high-yielding European bond markets
such as the UK, Spain and Italy. Equity markets would follow the same path,
it seemed.
True, doubts persisted about how long convergence would take. The
institutional plumbing necessary for an integrated European stock market was
lacking. Substantial national differences in accounting and tax practices
remained.
On the other hand, there was solid factual underpinning for stock market
convergence, as the chart shows. In 1987, for example, all but two markets
showed double-digit divergences from the European mean. Spain out-performed
the European average by 35 per cent; Germany under-performed it by 27 per
cent.
By 1991, the markets were moving more closely together. Only one diverged by
more than 10 per cent from the average - Italy, which under-performed by 13
per cent. The others were clustered closely together, rarely out- or
under-performing by more than 5 per cent. Convergence seemed on its way.
A year later, these hopes have been badly damaged. Currency stability has
been undermined by devaluations by Britain, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal,
Finland and Norway.
Equity markets have reacted to the devaluations by marking up shares sharply
in most of those countries, leading to noticeable differences of
performance. In 1992 as a whole, five out of eight big European equity
markets diverged from the average by more than 10 per cent, the largest such
group since 1987.
The devaluations were not the only forces at work. Switzerland said 'No' to
membership of the EEA; Denmark joined Britain in obtaining an escape route
from Emu; the once-smooth road from an ever-harder ERM to full-scale
monetary union looked strewn with obstacles.
None the less, some powerful trends continue to push in the direction of
convergence:
Company earnings. Diversification and the single European market are likely
to bring the earnings cycle among big European companies closer together. By
buying into the US, German and French companies have reduced their heavy
dependence on European markets. British companies have bought more heavily
into continental Europe, reducing their past emphasis on English-speaking
markets.
The progressive reduction of barriers to trade within the EC and the wider
EEA will also make European companies look more like each other. By managing
production and pricing on a pan-European basis, big companies are likely to
compete away each others' home market advantages. When every big business is
Europe-wide, all are likely to show similar results.
Valuation. European bourses are already starting to value those earnings
flows in a consistent way. 'Roughly comparable companies tend to be valued
pretty similarly,' says Mr Nick Stevenson, European equity strategies at
Warburg Securities. 'For example, Italian companies seem to be valued
roughly in line with northern European companies, and thus to look expensive
compared with local interest rates.'
Using valuation measures that minimise the differences between national
accounting and tax policies - such as the ratio of a company's share price
to its net cash flow - throws up striking similarities of valuation. Of the
30 European engineering companies covered by Warburg's analysts, for
instance, the prices of most lie between 3.8 and 5.8 times cash flow. In the
car industry, the big European makers are mostly valued at around 2.5 to 3
times cash flow. 'You can't actually say that certain markets value certain
companies in different ways,' says Mr Stevenson.
Investor attitudes. The growth of funded pensions schemes - until recently
largely an Anglo-Dutch phenomenon but now an increasingly important factor
in Switzerland and likely to prove so in France - is a powerful spur to
institutional investor power.
So is privatisation of state-owned financial institutions, already promised
in Italy and possible in France if a non-socialist government comes into
power in the spring elections.
A debate on corporate govern- ance is also under way in Germany. Though the
process will vary from country to country, fund managers are likely to press
for a similar agenda: transparent accounting, equal treatment for all
shareholders, proper takeover rules, a greater emphasis on shareholders'
interests and attention to profits rather than size.
Taken together, these forces will ensure that convergence continues despite
1992's setbacks. Mr Gordon Anderson, senior vice- president in charge of
global equity trading at Commerzbank in Frankfurt argues that the process
will take a long time, and it will probably not result, as some visionaries
believed a year or so ago, in a focus on pan-European sectors to the
exclusion of country or currency considerations.
'The country allocation comes first' for international investors, Mr
Anderson says. 'But they are already very interested in comparing Barclays,
for example, and Commerzbank.'
In time, he says, the relative weight given to the two axes of analysis,
country and sector, will shift - slowly, almost imperceptibly. But the
country decision will remain important.
Mr Reinhard Fischer - who covers German stocks from London for Paribas, the
French bank - says that convergence will be made longer and more arduous by
the effects of German re-unification. German managers will reverse their
progress towards more transparent accounting by dumping the bad news brought
about by re-unification into the 1992 financial year. Harmonising EC
corporate taxation will be harder because the bill for re-unification makes
cutting Germany's high corporate taxes much more difficult.
Perhaps the most important effect of 1992's upsets, however, is that it will
confirm investors in their habit of looking first at currencies and
countries, and only secondly at sectors and companies.
Commerzbank's Mr Anderson says: 'I've been in the business for 30 years  -
and it's as true as it's always been that if you get the currency judgment
right, you're likely to make money.' As long as investors profit from taking
that view, Europe's equity markets will not truly have converged.

FT  04 JAN 93 / German economics minister quits: Mollemann's departure comes
as fresh blow to coalition cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jurgen Mollemann resigned yesterday as German economics minister and
vice-chancellor, in a fresh blow to the stability of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's three-party coalition.
His sudden and emotional departure followed his admission that he had
personally sanctioned and signed letters promoting a product manufactured by
a relation.
The decision opens a big gap in Mr Kohl's cabinet, already hurt by the
premature resignation of four other ministers in the past nine months,
including that of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister and
vice-chancellor, who was Mr Mollemann's mentor in the minority Free
Democratic party (FDP).
Mr Kohl had already promised to shuffle his cabinet in the last week of
January.
Mr Mollemann, who had hoped to become the next leader of the FDP, was not
particularly popular with his colleagues, not only in the opposition Social
Democrats (SPD) but also among Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), for his
outspoken free-market views. However, his departure after 10 years in the
government was greeted officially with regret.
His demise follows press revelations that his ministerial notepaper had been
used to promote a security device for supermarket trolleys made in Cologne
by a company called Pro Invention, part-owned by a cousin of his wife,
Carola.
In a statement issued before Christmas, Mr Mollemann had claimed that blank
notepaper carrying his signature, intended for use when he was away from the
office, had been used without his knowledge for letters to leading
supermarket operators, urging them to look at the plastic token produced by
Pro Invention.
Yesterday, he admitted that he had been consulted about the letters by his
personal assistant, had agreed to their distribution on the grounds that
handicapped workers would be involved in the manufacture and had failed to
notice that the final letters made no mention of the handicapped.
'I did not lie,' he said yesterday after cutting short a holiday in the
Caribbean and consulting his colleagues in the leadership of the FDP. 'I
authorised the original statement in good conscience, and to the best of my
knowledge. But that does not lessen my self-reproach for having failed
adequately to ascertain the facts.'
Mr Mollemann, a former teacher who had risen to the top of the FDP largely
as a result of skilful public relations, turned on the German media for
exposing the affair and for hounding his wife and children in recent days.
He said he no longer intended to stand for leadership of the FDP when Mr
Otto Lambsdorff steps down this year, leaving the way open for his
colleague, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, to take over.
There has been speculation that Mr Kohl will try to appoint Ms Birgit
Breuel, head of the Treuhand privatisation agency in east Germany, as
economics minister in the coalition cabinet, although she is a member of his
own CDU.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Bosnian Serb and Moslem leaders hold first meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of Bosnia's two main warring factions, the Serbs and Moslems,
yesterday held face-to-face talks for the first time since the outbreak of
the conflict last April, in what appeared to be an unusually constructive
effort to overcome disagreements on new international peace proposals.
The meeting in Geneva between Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of
Bosnia, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, took place on
the margin of a conference between the political and military leaders of all
three of the main communities. The conference is chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance
and Lord Owen, international mediators on former Yugoslavia.
It came as US president George Bush promised French president Francois
Mitterrand that the US would take no unilateral action that could endanger
French or other foreign troops in Bosnia, during a two-hour talk in Paris in
which the two men agreed to await the conclusion of the peace talks in
Geneva.
'We are very sensitive to the fact that other countries have troops on the
ground and we would not precipitously on a unilateral basis do anything that
would put these troops in danger,' Mr Bush told a press conference. France
has nearly 5,000 peacekeeping troops serving under United Nations auspices
in Bosnia.
Mr Bush's reassurance followed a warning yesterday by Mr John Major, the UK
prime minister, that the 2,400 British troops in Bosnia would either be
given greater protection or be withdrawn from the region if they were at
serious risk.
The two presidents said they were 'very close' in agreeing that the recent
UN resolution banning military flights by Serb aircraft over Bosnia must be
enforced, but they would await the outcome of the peace talks before taking
further diplomatic action in the UN Security Council.
Arriving from Moscow yesterday, Mr Bush reported that Security Council
action to enforce its no-fly resolution had the backing of Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Major said in an interview on BBC television that the British forces 'are
not there as fighting troops and if I thought they were in danger I would
have to protect them or have to bring them home'. He said he thought there
would be some limited success in the peace talks in Geneva.
Billed as a last-ditch effort to avert international military intervention
in Bosnia, the Geneva meeting has been taking place in an unexpectedly
restrained and positive atmosphere, according to the two co-chairmen.
Mr Vance, who has been chairing a working group of political leaders,
described the discussions over the past two days as 'very serious and very
thoughtful'.
Lord Owen, who has been overseeing a working group of military chiefs to
work out ceasefire and troop withdrawal arrangements, said: 'The tone has
been good and the substance important.' That was a remarkable development,
given that only a few days ago the participants 'were still knocking hell
out of each other'.
But Mr Izetbegovic has sharply criticised the co-chairmen's plan, which
proposes the creation of 10 largely autonomous provinces within
Bosnia-Hercegovina. The plan ensures that the three main groups (the third
being the Croats) would each dominate three of the new provinces, while
Sarajevo would remain a 'mixed' province and its capital city would become
an 'open city' and be completely demilitarised.
However, the three provinces assigned to the Serbs would represent nearly
half the territory of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.

FT  04 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Equities exposed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That leaves the equity market exposed. German shares have been valued above
their long-term trend for the last couple of years. Yet the impact of
falling profits only started to affect the stock market towards the end of
1992. With more unpleasant earnings shocks likely, any delay in interest
rate cuts could badly affect sentiment. This notion is reinforced by the
fact that bond yields have already fallen sharply in the expectation of
short-term rate reductions. So, even if the rate cuts come through, further
rallies in the bond market may be limited and thus would offer little
additional impetus to equities.
France, however, offers a nice contrast. Inflation is subdued and industry
is competitive, yet economic growth is being held back by the ERM-inspired
high interest rates. Both equities and bonds would benefit from a loosening
of monetary policy, and one way or another that is likely to happen in the
course of the year.
If the Bundesbank lowers rates in response to domestic German recession,
then pressure within the ERM will ease and French rates can fall. But if the
Bundesbank drags its heels, the mismatch between the monetary needs of
different continental economies will revive ERM pressures and either break
the ERM or force a significant rate cut. In either event France would get
the lower interest rates justified by domestic conditions. And that might
just make France the market to watch in 1993.

From an external investor's point of view, the good prospects in US Treasury
bonds, and to some extent shares, are gilded by the likely rise of the
dollar. By purchasing power measures the dollar is still cheap against
European currencies, and improving US growth is likely to increase the
dollar's attractions. With a strengthening currency and rising asset prices,
the US still looks fairly attractive.
The German economy is a much less pretty picture. High interest rates have
finally tipped the economy into recession, and the risks are that the
contraction will accelerate. Estimates of the cost of unification are still
rising and the policy stalemate between the fiscal and monetary authorities
seems likely to continue. At the same time there is a world surplus of
capital goods which form the backbone of Germany's exports. Inflation
pressures at home and devaluations by some of Germany's trading partners
have also made German goods less competitive.
What makes the German bind so tight is that inflation and strong monetary
growth have proved persistent. As a result monetary policy has been kept
tight by the Bundesbank, despite the deepening recession. The key to German
 -and indeed European - investment performance this year will be the timing
of eventual German interest rate cuts. And in the absence of tax increases
or a sudden slowing in the growth of the money supply, the risk is that the
Bundesbank will move more slowly than the market currently hopes.

<TEXT>
Fears of a large fiscal package from a Democratic administration weighed on
the US Treasury bond market in the run up to the presidential election. But
following President-elect Bill Clinton's victory the bond market rallied as
growth became more robust. The need for a large reflationary package has
thus been reduced. As a bonus, economic growth curbs the deficit directly by
increasing tax revenues and cutting social security spending.
Yet despite this improved supply picture real bond yields remain
historically high. The bond market may thus be expressing fears about future
inflation prospects, but for the foreseeable future US inflation is likely
to remain subdued. Monetary aggregates are under control, commodity prices
are weak, and with much of the expansion coming from productivity gains wage
pressures are unlikely to become a problem.
Indeed, although the burden of servicing debt has fallen for consumers,
unemployment may fall only slowly, and the relatively high level of
outstanding debt is likely to mute any consumer spending spree. While the
balance of probability favours US growth proving stronger than currently
expected, there is little chance of an outright inflationary boom.
Once that positive message begins to sink in, bond yields may well start to
fall. Which may in turn spark further modest gains in the equity market. The
performance of shares was disappointing in 1992, despite the market hitting
all-time highs. Valuations already discounted a substantial earnings
recovery, and rising money market rates late in the year raised fears that
the funds which had flowed out of deposits to support shares might start to
flow back.
If, however, the inflation outlook remains satisfactory and bond yields
continue to fall, the rise in money market rates may be partly reversed. And
unless growth proves much stronger than expected, official rates are
unlikely to rise before the tail end of 1993. Somewhat higher growth may
also lead to the earnings rebound being better than expected. Having cut
costs, the US corporate sector is strongly geared to economic recovery: an
additional 1 per cent on growth would add 10 per cent to earnings.

<TEXT>
It is no small irony that much of Europe hovers in or near recession at the
start of 1993. In the minds of consumers and businessmen the much-heralded
single market adventure, which was to promote prosperity and trade, has been
overshadowed by falling demand and rising unemployment. In part that is due
to the world recession, which began in the Anglo-Saxon economies. But high
German interest rates are now the main drag on European growth. And while
the UK can now pursue an expansionary monetary policy free of its ERM
chains, most of continental Europe faces a bleak prospect until German rates
fall substantially.
By contrast the huge single market on the other side of the Atlantic is
faring much better. Low interest rates, a competitive dollar and wholesale
rationalisation of industries have finally combined to spark economic growth
in the US - much of it coming from increasing industrial investment. This
decoupling of economic prospects between the US and Europe suggests that
investment performance on either side of the Atlantic is likely to differ
widely in 1993.

FT  04 JAN 93 / China seeks to reassure Hong Kong investors
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA sought to reassure international and local Hong Kong investors
yesterday, saying that it would honour contracts which span the transfer of
Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997.
Mr Lu Ping, Beijing's senior official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, said
in a television interview last night that although China no longer trusted
Britain 'we accept our obligations' in respect of commercial contracts.
Mr Lu maintained China's uncompromising opposition to Hong Kong's political
development unveiled last October by Mr Chris Patten, the governor. He said
Mr Patten would have to withdraw his proposals before China and the UK could
talk about the colony's political development.
Mr Lu warned that if Britain went ahead with the governor's proposals China
would 'start afresh' in 1997 and hold elections which conformed to the Basic
Law - the Beijing-drafted constitution for the colony after its reversion to
Chinese sovereignty.
He said China did not want 'a diplomatic war' with Britain. He blamed the UK
for the deterioration in relations, reiterating China's claim that Britain
had reneged on past agreements concerning Hong Kong's political development.
In general, however, Mr Lu's comments were conciliatory and appeared to mark
a change in stance by Beijing by separating the economic aspects of the
transfer of sovereignty from the political aspects. 'I think we've got to
come back with something friendly after this,' said one Foreign Office
official.
Last month Beijing's warning that it would not honour contracts made by the
Hong Kong government with other parties which had not been approved by China
sent the local stock market into steep decline. But its attempt to unsettle
Hong Kong's economy had an unintended consequence, when the questions
Beijing raised about contracts also promoted fears in international bankers'
minds about the reliability of China as a borrower.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's new year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has spent much of the Christmas and new year holiday thinking
about domestic policy. With the time-consuming difficulties of the European
presidency behind him, the prime minister now wishes to assert himself on
the home stage. This is a sound instinct. But it will be difficult to build
momentum, for Mr Major's party is still split over Maastricht and
dangerously aimless on many other issues.
Those who read the Conservative election manifesto carefully eight months
ago could see that this was likely to be the case. It was a document which
sprayed out specific proposals, but which lacked a firm and coherent
foundation.
It is true that since the election Mr Major has been quite clear on one
issue. He has shown that he is prepared to stake his premiership upon his
version of the Maastricht accommodation: a community continuing to grow and
extend its range, but at an uneven pace and without enhancement of the
powers of Community institutions.
Since Britain may yet be six months from final ratification of Maastricht,
there is plenty of scope for party in-fighting over this matter to continue.
Meanwhile, Mr Major's record on domestic policy is not impressive. His
emphasis upon improved accountability of public services is welcome, but on
the whole the Citizen's Charter still looks a feeble counterweight to the
hollowing of local government and the quango-isation of large swathes of
British public life.
Pit problems
On privatisation, plans to sell off the railways have been modified so
frequently that few people now know what the prime minister thinks is
achievable. The pit closure programme needed to prepare for the sale of
British Coal has thrown the government into trouble on every front of its
energy policy, and its intentions for the post office remain obscure.
In social policy, the government is hemmed in by its manifesto promises on
benefits. Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, and one of the
cabinet's manifest Thatcherites, has scarcely broken cover since April.
Perhaps this will be the pattern for Mr Major's period as prime minister: a
continuing search for the centre ground in his party, in which he manages
his way around events with the aid of his patently strong negotiating
skills.
A managerial premiership of this kind might be viable were Britain's economy
and public finances stronger than they are. Yet the reality is of an economy
sputtering out of recession, and faced with fearsome levels of public
borrowing and balance of payments difficulties.
New direction
So Mr Major must urgently establish a sense of direction, starting with a
plausible medium term framework for the economy. The possibility of
continuing with a relatively unradical approach to the functions of the
state depends on an early return to sustainable economic growth. Should such
growth not be forthcoming, fundamental aspects of economic policy will have
to be reconsidered.
The principles of market economics are going to be challenged this year in
any case, with growing pressure at home for an unspecific form of industrial
strategy and what could look like a tempting agenda from the new US
administration. But these ideas are largely a distraction. The main issues
are how to lock in the real depreciation of the exchange rate, while
avoiding permanently higher inflation, and how to redefine the role of the
public sector and make it more efficient.
The more doubtful economic prospects seem, the more important it will be to
redirect government spending and reconsider levels of taxation as well. The
government's low levels of indebtedness will allow it to run large fiscal
deficits for several years. But adjustments to long-term spending plans will
have to be made now if they are to bear fruit even several years hence.
Mr Major's instincts are conservative, but circumstances may force him to be
more radical than he would wish. Luckily for him, the Labour party, under
the leadership of Mr John Smith, appears intellectually dormant. Such luck
may not last. This is the year in which Mr Major must shape the character of
his administration. The weaker the pace of economic recovery, the bolder the
policies that will be required.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Germany's enfant terrible bows out: Mollemann's departure
leaves Kohl at the mercy of coalition compromises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl may well be breathing a sigh of relief.
Yesterday's resignation of Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister and
vice-chancellor, removes from the ranks of Mr Kohl's coalition government a
thoroughly disruptive influence, an enfant terrible and notorious
self-publicist cordially disliked by most of his colleagues.
The fact that Mr Mollemann was vice-chancellor was due entirely to the logic
of coalition politics, and not at all to the choosing of Mr Kohl: the job
belonged, as does the economics portfolio, to the Free Democratic Party
(FDP) in the three-party coalition.
Following the abrupt resignation last year of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher from
the government, after 18 years as foreign minister, Mr Mollemann became the
most senior FDP member of the cabinet.
The irony of Mr Mollemann's departure, for the apparent use of ministerial
notepaper to promote a new product invented by one of his wife's relations,
was that he finally fell victim to his inability to distinguish, in the
words of Der Spiegel magazine, 'between public affairs and public
relations'.
Mr Mollemann's every new excuse brought fresh embarrassment, and from his
own FDP party colleagues and Mr Kohl came only an echoing silence in his
defence.
Thus far, the chancellor would seem to be well rid of him. Yet Mr Mollemann
is the seventh member of the current Kohl administration to leave office
prematurely, the fifth in barely nine months, and the fourth to leave
because of what might be called a 'silly scandal'.
It all makes the Kohl administration appear fractious and adrift - just when
the German economy is slipping into recession, and a clear lead from the
government is needed more than ever.
Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, the former defence minister, was forced to quit last
March, accused of allowing the illegal exports of tanks to Turkey, a Nato
ally. Ms Gerda Hasselfeldt, the health minister, went in April, after one of
her closest aides was accused of espionage. Two days later, Mr Genscher
announced his plan to resign, rocking the stability of the entire coalition.
In December, Mr Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the minister of posts and
telecommunications, said he was pulling out, allegedly because of the
government's inability to act more firmly over Yugoslavia. As one of Mr
Kohl's longest-serving cabinet ministers, Mr Schwarz-Schilling's exit was a
personal gesture of bitterness.
Mr Mollemann, a former teacher, public relations man and part-time
parachutist, was regarded by many, not least in German industry, as having
been promoted beyond his capacities; as economics minister he was in a job
at the very interface between the government and industry. Moreover, the
economics ministry is arguably the most important ministry in the task of
reviving the collapsed economy of east Germany.
One of the weakest areas of the Kohl coalition has been its inability to
forge a working relationship of mutual respect with industry in the
challenge of German unification. The chancellor himself is notoriously
uninterested in the economy - although he has belatedly realised its
critical importance at this juncture.
Mr Theo Waigel, his finance minister, is a much more shrewd political
operator than many would believe, but he is also no expert in his field,
relying instead on his senior civil servants.
As for Mr Mollemann, he sometimes chose the right issue (the need to
dismantle state subsidies, and reduce the high costs of industry were
favourite themes), but he never enjoyed the respect needed to put his words
into action.
Thus his resignation is both an embarrassment and an opportunity for the
chancellor. If Mr Kohl can find an alternative candidate who would enjoy the
respect of the business community, Mr Mollemann's resignation would be a
positive blessing. One name being widely mentioned is that of Ms Birgit
Breuel, the tough-minded head of the Treuhand privatisation agency.
But she is a Christian Democrat, and the job remains in the say of the FDP,
which leaves Mr Kohl at the mercy of coalition compromises. The chancellor's
promised cabinet reshuffle by the end of January will therefore challenge
his leadership capacity to the full.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Community at a crossroads: The single market is a
significant achievement for the EC, but structural problems loom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The inauguration of the single European market is a huge achievement for the
European Community, the culmination of four decades of steady trade
liberalisation and going far beyond the original targets of the first member
states. What started in 1951 as a limited system for managing the coal and
steel industries of the original Six, has now reached the impressive
conclusion of a single market with freedom of movement for goods, services,
people and capital throughout the 12. This single market will no doubt bring
important improvements to the competitiveness of Europe's economy, to the
welfare of its consumers, and to the conditions for long-term economic
growth.
And yet the celebrations of the free-market achievement of 1993 are
overshadowed by a series of political setbacks in 1992, as well as by more
general doubts over the direction of the European Community. Since the
conclusion of the Treaty of European Union at Maastricht a year ago, many of
the premises and programmes of the treaty have been shaken to their
foundations, and the course of Europe's future development is now a matter
of real uncertainty.
The first of the 1992 setbacks was the rejection of the Maastricht agreement
in the Danish referendum last June, which immediately raised doubts whether
the treaty could ever be implemented. At last month's Edinburgh summit,
Denmark and the other 11 governments hammered out a form of words which they
hoped would make it possible to have a second referendum in Denmark, and
with luck this time get a Yes vote. If that happens, there should be a
reasonable prospect that the treaty would also be ratified in Britain, and
therefore formally come into force.
Unfortunately, it is not clear that the Danish problem can be rectified as
easily as that. The 12 have claimed that their Edinburgh decision is
acceptable because it is consistent with the terms of the Maastricht treaty.
The treaty itself would allow Denmark to opt out of monetary union at some
stage; but the Edinburgh deal would allow Denmark to opt out of monetary
union even before the treaty is ratified. The new decision may be consistent
with the treaty; but an ordinary person can see it is really a cunning
device for voiding the treaty of much of its significance.
This points to the heart of the Maastricht problem. The treaty mainly
consists of plans and programmes for future action; but some of the member
states do not really subscribe to their new undertakings. The single most
important element in Maastricht is the programme for monetary union; but the
controversy has highlighted the fact that the Danes do not want monetary
union, nor indeed do they much care for any of the treaty. Mutatis mutandis,
the same is true of the British. The Community is therefore in a serious
dilemma, not just over whether Maastricht can be ratified, but over how much
political credibility it will retain even after ratification.
Three months after the Danish referendum, the Community suffered a second
body-blow, in the September currency turmoil which drove sterling and the
Italian lira out of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), and forced
the devaluation of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo. The
upheaval delivered a heavy blow to the stability of the ERM, and seriously
undermined the plausibility of the programme for Economic and Monetary Union
as laid out in the Maastricht treaty.
The development of a common foreign policy is the second main policy target
in the treaty, and it too suffered a serious setback in 1992, as a result of
the comprehensive inadequacy of the European Community's response to the war
in the former Yugoslavia.
This failure does not prove anything conclusive about the long term; it
certainly does not exonerate the Community countries from continuing to work
on the development of a more common foreign policy; but at the very least
the Yugoslav tragedy indicates the sheer difficulty of this part of the
Community's Maastricht agenda, and the yawning gap between treaty promise
and practical performance.
The question which is not yet resolved is whether the specific setbacks
suffered by the Community in 1992 are just temporary difficulties, resulting
from the difficult circumstances of the time; or whether they are symptoms
of a deeper and more durable structural problem.
Undoubtedly, these are difficult times. The collapse of the cold war has
released forces of instability and violence at many points in the former
Soviet empire. The international recession is both deeper and longer than
anyone expected, high-lighting potential stresses in the ERM. And the
colossal costs of Germany's unification have created additional political
and economic difficulties, first for Germany, but also for the rest of the
Community.
And yet the Community may be facing a double structural problem, in the
sense that it has come to the end of the road which it has been travelling
for the past 40 years. With the single market it has more or less fulfilled
the common market objectives laid down by the original six 35 years ago; as
a result of the end of the cold war, it is facing a massive pent-up demand
for membership from countries which used to be either neutral or Communist.
The Maastricht treaty now sets an entirely new order of objectives, which
are much more demanding. Each extra step in the development of European
integration will become increasingly difficult, because the tensions between
the historic systems of the nation states and the emerging Community system
will become increasingly politically stressful. It is in any case unlikely
that the member states can attain the new policy objectives through the old
institutional arrangements.
The Community has now effectively exhausted those items on the integration
agenda which are relatively innocuous in political terms, such as trade
liberation. The next phase inevitably includes issues more heavily loaded
with nationalist connotations, such as a single currency or a common
defence, and implies a degree of political integration which will meet
serious reservations on the part of national electorates.
These politically sensitive issues can neither be side-stepped nor ignored.
If there is an ERM, and a single market with free movement of capital, the
members cannot easily have independent monetary policies. Yet the lesson of
1992 is that the ERM is unlikely to work well unless it is coupled with
collective constraints on fiscal policies as well. Parliaments may accept
that national politicians cannot be trusted with monetary policy; they will
resist the matching idea that politicians cannot be trusted with fiscal
policy either.
European orthodoxy usually argues that this dilemma of democracy can best be
solved by giving more powers to the European Parliament. But this is still
essentially a Community with very little real power delegated to a
supranational authority at the centre; for the time being, political
legitimacy in a more politically integrated Community has to be exercised by
the nation states and in national parliaments.
These inherent policy dilemmas will be multiplied many times by large
increases in the size of the Community; and yet the Community is almost
bound to take in many new members in the next few years, first from the
European Free Trade Association (EFTA), then from the Mediterranean, and
finally from eastern Europe. The Edinburgh summit agreed to open membership
negotiations with the EFTA applicants right away, even before Maastricht
ratification is complete.
If all the potential candidates do in fact join, the total size of the
Community could expand to 25 members or even more. Manifestly, this would
change the character of the Community. It could not easily take any
decisions; it certainly could not take decisions by current institutional
arrangements. Moreover, these procedural difficulties must be multiplied by
the political consequences of enlargement; a large and geographically
dispersed Community is likely to exhibit a corresponding dispersal of
political interests. If Belgium has more in common with Luxembourg than
Poland has with Greece, this is not surprising; they have much more shared
history, and much more shared geography. In a large Community, it is only
too easy to imagine various geographic caucuses systematically voting
against each other: the rich Nordics against poor Mediterraneans, or the
west against the east.
If the Community is to go further, in the general direction charted by
Maastricht, it will almost certainly have to find new ways of doing so, and
most likely re-think the traditional Community system. This need will be
even more imperative if it takes in significant numbers of new member
states. With the single market, the European Community has reached the end
of a particular stretch of road; today, it stands at a crossroads of
history.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Next steps in Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MILITARY intervention in Somalia was a necessary first step, but it was also
the easiest. Now the hard part begins: finding a political solution that
will restore peace to a country where violence seems endemic, and which has
been without a government since January 1991.
The United Nations chaired conference that opens in Addis Ababa today is a
belated start to what will be a long and arduous process. But it is far from
certain that the UN, deeply discredited in Somalia by the inept handling
initially of the relief operation, has either the organisational capacity or
the political credibility to play the role it has assumed.
The conference opens under inauspicious circumstances. President George
Bush's new year visit to Mogadishu left fundamental questions about US
policy unresolved. The hostile reception accorded Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary-general, in Mogadishu yesterday illustrated some of the
difficulties he faces when presiding over today's conference, where he will
be seeking to establish himself as a trusted mediator.
From the beginning of the military intervention in Somalia, it has been
clear that getting food to the starving citizens was not in itself enough.
Food warehouses have to be guarded, convoys protected, distribution centres
kept secure, the safety of aid workers assured and  - most difficult of all
 -the warlords and their gangs either disarmed or disciplined.
US role
Only the US has the resources to mount and sustain an operation on the scale
required, yet Washington's view of its role falls short of UN expectations,
and the timetable and the full extent of its commitment is uncertain.
Washington has refused to respond to Mr Boutros Ghali's call to intervene in
the conflict by disarming the gangs of gunmen responsible for the pillaging
of food. The sole function of the troops so far has been to ensure that food
reaches its destination.
All too often this has been a hollow achievement, for no sooner have the
troops departed than gunmen move in. And the need to make conditions safer
for aid workers was tragically underlined over the weekend with the murder
of Mr Sean Devereux, while working for Unicef in the southern Somali port of
Kismayu.
Regrettably during his two-day visit Mr Bush gave uncertain signals about US
intentions. At one meeting the president told aid workers that the US would
not leave Somalia 'in the lurch'. A few hours later Mr Bush was reassuring
US troops that Washington did not have an open-ended commitment to the
country. That is not expected of him: but a clearer indication of US policy
is overdue.
As it is, his comments are incompatible, and reflect the ambivalence that
has marked Operation Restore Hope from the start. No one now expects the
outgoing US administration to clarify its position; but it must urgently be
addressed when Mr Clinton take office later this month.
Military commitment
Only a firm long-term US military commitment to Somalia will concentrate the
minds of the dozen political parties attending today's conference. Nothing
in the record of the two dominating figures, Somalia's self-styled president
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, and Mohamed Farah Aideed, suggests they genuinely have
their country's interests at heart. Their fratricidal dispute has destroyed
Mogadishu, and few Somalis have any faith that their handshake of
reconciliation last month will be binding.
When the warlords are controlled, the negotiating process set in train at
Addis Ababa can become more representative. The existing participants
represent too narrow a range of interests. A broader cross-section is
needed, ranging from exiles to elders, academics and former politicians,
many of whom are unable to leave Somalia or are reluctant to take part in
politics while the gunmen hold sway.
Only when legitimate political and community leaders gather round the
conference table can reconciliation and recovery get under way. Unless
Washington helps the UN rein in the warlords, the peace process will not get
off the ground.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The only glitch in the first of the Breakfast With Frost programmes on BBC
yesterday morning was that it ended with Britain's prime minister being cut
off while he was trying to answer the final question.
Surely the 9.15 start of the next children's programme could have been
delayed by a few seconds so that the PM could have been thanked for getting
up so early to give Sir David Frost's flagship show its first exclusive? The
Beeb, whose time keeping on its own news bulletins is hardly perfect, says
that the PM was in 'such good form' that he just carried on talking too
long. As for Sir David, dubbed by some snooty BBC types as their answer to
CNN's unctuous Larry King, he blames the music, or rather the lack of it.
Normally, the playing of the final signature tune is a cue for the
interviewee to shut up. Unfortunately, it was barely audible. Sir David
promises louder music in future.

Who gets what in the new year honours list has always been a bit of a
mystery especially when it comes to honouring Britain's captains of finance
and commerce. Indeed, this year's crop of Ks will have done little to
disabuse those who feel that contributions to Tory party coffers remain far
more important than success on the business pitch.
Admittedly, the latest bunch seemed more deserving than some. TI's
Christopher Lewinton, Kingfisher's Geoffrey Mulcahy, HSBC's Willie Purves
and LWT's Christopher Bland are above average business leaders. Meanwhile,
Harry Djanogly and Raymond Johnstone, are of the old school of successful
businessmen who regard charity and public service just as important as
making money.
However, if 'Chips' Keswick of Hambros deserves a knighthood for 'services
to banking', surely Brian Pitman, the long serving chief executive of Lloyds
Bank - Britain's most successful big bank - also deserves the same sort of
recognition. He has done more than most to revolutionise the efficiency of
British banking.

<TEXT>
If you have tried booking one of the 56 seats at The Gate Theatre in
London's Notting Hill, then you will know that it needs expanding. The
theatre, housed on the first floor above the Prince Albert pub, has won a
string of theatrical prizes - most recently London Weekend TV's Live Plays
award - and is run on such a small budget that even its actors don't get
paid.
The theatre is keen to enlarge its seating capacity to 126 by using spare
space in the pub, owned by Allied-Lyons. The hope is that Allied will put up
Pounds 55,000 and private donors contribute a further Pounds 34,000.
Is this an offer that Allied can afford to turn down? It would be sponsoring
the most prestigious small theatre in London. There would be a plaque in the
theatre to say so, a note of acknowledgement in all future programmes and
perhaps an Allied-Lyons opening season.
And if Allied's accountants won't wear this, then they might be persuaded by
the promise of increased supping by thirsty theatregoers in the downstairs
pub. The man behind the bar says they already spend Pounds 1,000 on drinks
before, during and after the show.

Ever since Bob Heller gave up running Management Today, the flagship
magazine in Michael Heseltine's Haymarket Publishing Group, Britain's top
management magazine has been turning over its editors faster than most
companies change finance directors.
However, Tom Lloyd's tenure in the editorial chair - a mere 10 weeks - must
set some sort of record for short service. Lloyd, who has written several
management books and edited the now defunct Financial Weekly, told the UK
Press Gazette that he didn't feel that he 'had a mandate to edit'.
Admittedly, the recession has taken a heavy toll on business magazines, but
Lloyd's departure doesn't seem to have been linked to poor financial
performance. Rather it sounds as if he was slow in making the sort of
changes that his new masters wanted.
Dennis Hackett, the new editor, is a veteran magazine man rather than
management guru. He has edited Queen and Nova, and relaunched several
well-known magazines including Tatler, where Tina Brown first made her name.
Indeed, he tells me that he was the one who hired her.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fellows of University College, Oxford, Bill Clinton's old alma mater,
are in a right tizzy. After months of successfully stonewalling questions
from President Bush's agents and the world's media on just what young Bill
did, or did not do, during his carefree Oxford days, they had been expecting
a fistful of invites to his inauguration.
It is not as if invites are in short supply and the college has just awarded
Clinton an honorary fellowship. So imagine the consternation at high table
when it was learned that the only person to receive an invite was the head
porter in whose lodge young Clinton spent many a happy hour.
Unfortunately the porter is now far too old to go. No doubt, the jealous
fellows will now draw straws but another porter might be more suitable.
After all, Clinton's folksie inauguration party is expected to be
reminiscent of Andrew Jackson's in 1828 and therefore much more fun for a
college servant than a crusty don.

FT  04 JAN 93 / A year of reckoning: Germany's economy will improve in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORBERT WALTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This will be a year of turnround for German economic policy. The economy
will begin to improve, though in a way which may escape the eye of the
beholder. Next year will see clear recovery in production and the beginning
of improvement in the labour market.
Such predictions are in stark contrast to present trends and perceptions.
Recent months have confirmed the end of the nearly decade-long German
upswing. Only a few can claim to have identified the onset of stagnation in
the summer of 1991. Yet everyone identifies the past half year or so with
the onset of recession.
Production declined significantly, employment began to fall, orders dropped
precipitously, investment plans were scaled back and proposals for large job
losses were unveiled. In 1992 German business confidence registered a
greater decline than in any other postwar recession.
Keynes wrote in his General Theory: 'It would be foolish, in forming our
expectations, to attach great weight to matters which are very uncertain . .
. For this reason the facts of the existing situation enter, in a sense
disproportionately, into the formation of our long-term expectations.'
This 'Keynesian wisdom' clearly shapes prevailing views about 1993-94 in
business and, to a degree, among professional forecasters. Extrapolation of
the recent past seems the best guide to the future. There is some
justification for this approach when looking at the very near term - the two
quarters of winter 1992-93. But the gloomiest predictions that Germany's
economy is going down the drain as a result of unification are probably
wrong and certainly premature.
In support of their claims, pessimists cite several factors. Is it not true
that Germans have the highest labour costs, the shortest working hours, the
longest holidays, almost the highest business and income taxes, and extreme
regulation in labour markets and on the environment? And have they not added
to this list of disadvantages a large budget deficit and a highly
restrictive monetary policy? The switch away from Germany in recent years in
flows of foreign investment underlines just how problematic all these
developments have become.
But all is not gloom. The most obvious factor which will improve the German
economy during the next year or so is the recovery of the world economy - in
particular the improvement in the US. There are counter-arguments to this
relative optimism. The international recovery will be only modest; it will
be concentrated in areas that are not as closely tied to the German market
as the EC; and the benefits to Germany will be diminished by the
appreciation of the D-Mark, which has reduced export competitiveness. While
all these arguments carry some weight, experience has shown that German
exports perform best when world trade accelerates.
Identifying the reasons for a turnround in German domestic demand is more
difficult. Monetary or fiscal stimuli both seem unlikely. In view of the
high fiscal deficit, a fiscal stimulus is neither probable nor desirable. In
fact, the 1 percentage point increase in VAT which came into effect on
January 1 will reduce real disposable income.
Monetary policy is still restrictive if judged by the yield curve. This is
inverted to a larger degree than ever, with short-term interest rates well
above long-term rates.
When can the Bundesbank be expected to start significantly easing monetary
policy? The central bank will opt for caution in preserving the D-Mark's
strength. Therefore it will wait for evidence of wage moderation and fiscal
soundness before it takes steps to reduce interest rates.
If such evidence takes a long time to emerge, currency speculation could
drive the D-Mark unreasonably high, damping business prospects still
further. Under such circumstances, inflationary expectations in Germany
would collapse, and the traded goods sector would be threatened by
structural decline. Such an outcome would be chaotic. It would lead to a
rapid fall of German short-term interest rates - but at the expense of a
severe European recession.
There is, however, a more hopeful scenario. A window of opportunity exists
for an organised correction of German economic policy. By now it seems clear
that, because of the economic slowdown, wage settlements in 1993 and 1994
will be about half as high as in 1991 and 1992. Real wages will thus be
roughly unchanged this year, and show only a modest increase next year.
Correcting fiscal policy will be more difficult. A number of steps would
satisfy the Bundesbank and also support investment in industry. Among these
are a reduction of subsidies to smokestack industries, action to streamline
social legislation, and vigorous privatisation.
However, political circumstances make these solutions difficult to achieve.
The trade unions and the Social Democrat opposition favour tax increases for
those in higher income brackets. Ultimately, in view of the budgetary
pressures, we are likely to see a rise in either indirect taxes or in
general income tax. The former option would have direct inflationary
implications; the latter would lower people's motivation to work hard.
A reasonable fiscal policy shift will be hard to accomplish, but is not out
of reach. A bold government could come up with tough budgetary legislation
around the time of the publication of the annual economic report at the end
of this month. Emergency action would hold down this year's spending to last
year's levels.
Under such circumstances the Bundesbank would be in a position to reduce
interest rates early in the new year. Germany's European partners would be
able to follow suit. This would calm foreign exchange markets.
If Germany could organise such a switch in economic policy, 1993 could
become a year of hope rather than of frustration. Since lags are huge,
however, improvement in the course of the year is likely to be no more than
modest.
For 1993 as a whole, average GNP is likely to remain at the 1992 level. This
could, however, presage a return to reasonably dynamic growth in 1994. At
least on the supply-side, the right conditions for such growth are in place.
Germany has a well-educated and motivated young labour force.
As to investment in Germany, there is reason to rely on the positive impact
of Keynes's 'animal spirits'. German unification and the single European
market provide, after all, plenty of opportunity for reigniting the
imagination and enterprise of German business. But much depends on the right
policies in Bonn - and the correct responses in Frankfurt.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Letter: Energy strategy can be environmentally realistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof IAN FELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The result of trade and industry secretary Michael Heseltine's energy
policy review could prove a setback for the environment as David Lascelles
states ('The grimy face of coal, December 29).
That certainly will be the case if a fudged, short-term fix is provided to
placate the mining lobby in an attempt to restore government credibility.
What is now clear is that 'market forces' are a poor guide to energy policy
if environment protection is to be achieved.
Burning more coal to accommodate the output of, say, a dozen saved pits
means burning less 'clean' gas or switching out of nuclear power. This could
lead to failure both to meet the European directive on acid gas release from
power stations (which would be illegal), and to stabilise carbon dioxide
production at the 1990 level by 2000, a commitment made by Mr John Major at
the Rio Earth summit.
A polluting sector equal in size to the electricity generation sector is
transport, where any sort of energy/environment strategy is unpalatable, as
public and politicians alike fear that the freedom to drive anywhere at any
time is being infringed. A strategy of fiscal encouragement using market
forces to achieve desired ends, such as a reduced tax on diesel fuel to
encourage further penetration of highly fuel-efficient and clean diesel
cars, would be a start. A move to efficient public transport systems is the
next move.
It is not difficult to map out a flexible energy strategy which will go a
long way to meeting environmental imperatives. But this is possible only if
the government abandons its dogmatic stance to privatise everything and
instead harnesses market forces to achieve a realistic strategy rather than
letting them take control.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Little hope of recovery: UK unemployment is set to rise
further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WYNNE GODLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every postwar recession so far has been followed by a recovery during which
unemployment fell. But history may not be repeated on the present occasion.
All previous recoveries were initiated by the removal of credit controls
which caused a spurt in lending for expenditure on durables and housing.
This cannot happen now because there are no credit controls to remove, and
because the balance sheets of banks and other lending institutions have been
severely weakened by bad debts incurred during the Lawson boom. Consumption
will also be checked because house prices have fallen so much and because an
exceptionally high burden of household debt persists despite a sharp fall in
net lending. And non-housing investment is unlikely to rise much because of
excess capacity in the distributive, financial and other service industries
 -another legacy of the boom.
For all these reasons, I think hopes of any real recovery in demand are
going to be continuously disappointed in 1993, rather as happened in the US
in 1992. There may be some rise in economic activity but not enough to stop
unemployment from increasing further and certainly not enough to bring it
down. Unemployment will probably soon pass its previous postwar peak,
reaching 3m to 4m this year - an incredible 4m to 5m measured on the
pre-Thatcher scale.
I expect price inflation to breach the chancellor's target of 1 to 4 per
cent (although 'headline' inflation will be damped by the reduction in
mortgage rates), because the recent devaluation of sterling will soon lead
to import prices 10 per cent or more higher than a year earlier. The effect
of this on retail prices will be compounded by the ending of the 'green
currency' arrangements which will raise prices paid to British farmers. It
remains to be seen whether or not an accelerated rise in retail prices has a
knock-on effect on wages, thereby starting a new inflationary spiral. But I
am hopeful that, with such high and rising unemployment, wage inflation will
continue to decelerate and therefore that any acceleration of price
inflation will, for once, be a 'blip'.
One of the most disappointing features of last year was the enormous rise,
which may turn out to be as large as 6 per cent, in the volume of imports of
goods and services. This was at once a cause of the stagnation of output
last year and a consequence of the erosion of Britain's industrial base over
several years. This year, with recession in Europe aggravated by the pursuit
of tight monetary policies by some of our EC partners, Germany in
particular, the deficit in the UK's current balance of payments will
probably rise further despite the devaluation. If the growth of import
penetration seen in 1992 were repeated this year, it is doubtful whether any
expansion in activity at all would occur, while the deterioration in the
external balance would be even worse.
While it is understandable that people should scour the economic statistics
for 'green shoots', it is vital that more attention be paid to Britain's
strategic predicament. The scale of any recovery in the next 12 months has
an importance which is subsidiary to the structural, medium-term problems
that dog the British economy.
The position now is far worse than at the trough of the previous recession.
Unemployment is about  3/4 m higher than it was in 1982. Yet the balance of
payments was 2 per cent of gross domestic product in deficit last year,
compared with a surplus of 2 1/2 per cent in 1981 - so we start with a
balance some Pounds 25bn worse at today's prices than 11 years ago despite
lower pressure of demand for labour. The underlying trend in Britain's trade
remains so adverse and the prospects for world trade so poor that an
expansion of activity based on domestic demand alone could not be permitted
for more than a very short time. After a year or two Britain would have
finally used up all the foreign wealth which was accumulated at the
beginning of the 1980s (all that remains to show for the oil bonanza), and
after only three or four more years its overseas indebtedness would be
exploding.
To convey some feel for the magnitudes involved, I calculate that, to keep
the external deficit within tolerable bounds (given present prospects and
policies), the expansion of output will have to be so slow as to cause a
further rise in unemployment of at least  3/4 m by 1997. Alternatively, if
output were allowed, or made, to rise enough to cause unemployment to fall
below 3m, the current account deficit would exceed 4 per cent of GDP in 1997
and explode thereafter.
It follows that a conventional recovery generated by an expansion of
domestic demand, while not (in my opinion) to be expected, is also the last
thing to be desired. Ministers have sometimes expressed satisfaction if
indicators relating to personal consumption - for instance, retail sales -
show signs of expansion. But a consumption-led expansion would only be a
frustrating tramp back down the dead end from which we are just emerging. It
is a blessing in disguise that consumption is likely to remain so subdued -
for if consumption, against the odds, were now to rise substantially, the
right policy would be to knock it on the head with an increase in taxation.
Sustained growth will now only be possible if it is matched, and preferably
led, by an expansion of exports net of import demand. But such expansion
will only be possible if we greatly improve the performance of those sectors
of the economy which produce internationally tradeable goods and services.
This requires large-scale investment, above all in the manufacturing sector,
and a sustained improvement in the competitive power of UK industry. The
position is made much harder because Europe appears to be locked into
recession: great efforts should be made to persuade the UK's EC partners to
pursue more expansionary policies.
Although a further cut in interest rates and more devaluation might help, it
is unrealistic to suppose that the necessary transformation in national
performance could be brought about just by manipulating a few macroeconomic
instruments. The government needs a new role, not so much interventionist as
helpful and healing; and the nation needs inspiring leadership. While the
main thrust of policy should be directed towards solving the country's
strategic economic problems, urgent consideration should also now be given
to the alleviation of unemployment which, apart from costing a great deal in
social security benefits and lost tax revenue, is fast becoming a social
problem of frightening proportions.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Letter: Long-term savings in danger of tax discrimination
within EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID R F SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although the EC single market has now arrived and regulatory barriers
to trade in financial services between member states have disappeared, it
seems that trade in long-term retail savings will continue to be restricted
by discriminatory tax. Thus the benefits of the single market will not
extend to the long-term savings of the Community's households.
Long-term savings are a big part of the financial services sector. It has
been estimated that there may be Ecu700bn of assets in the balance sheets of
pension funds within the EC, and a further Ecu850bn in the funds of life
assurance companies. According to the Cecchini Report, about one third of
benefits arising from the single market were expected to come from the
liberalisation of financial services.
When the single market was launched in 1986 the retail savings industry was
tightly enclosed within each state's own markets. In rare cases where
cross-border trade was not explicitly prohibited by statute or by exchange
control, it was ruled out by discriminatory tax provisions. For example, in
the UK the benefits of long-term savings contracts issued to UK residents by
non-resident insurance companies are more heavily taxed than are the
benefits of similar policies issued by UK insurance companies.
Most member states of the Community have similar discriminatory taxation.
While differences in tax rates between countries do not create barriers to
trade, discriminatory rates do. Yet, while the single market programme has
removed regulatory barriers, nothing has been done to tackle the continuing
existence of the discriminatory tax barriers to trade in long-term retail
savings.
Indeed, a European Court decision in February (Bachmann decision) appears to
uphold the right of member states to discriminate against foreign savings
contracts.
Worse, an amendment to the Treaty of Rome - article 73D - introduced at
Maastricht appears further to legitimise such discrimination.
Unless the Council of Ministers is prepared to act, the Community will be
seen to have failed to complete an important part of the single market
programme. Such a failure will not be marginal: it was precisely from the
liberalisation of the long-term retail savings sector that a large part of
the benefit of the single market was expected to arise.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Letter: Poland in the EC essential for European peace and
unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JULIAN ROCHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the aftermath of the Edinburgh summit and enthusiasm over the
timetable of accession of western countries such as Austria and Norway to
the EC, another subject slipped off the agenda - a firm timetable for the
accession of Poland, and indeed then Hungary and the Czech and Slovak
republics to the EC. This is now a matter for Copenhagen.
Economists at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have
already made the important point that if the EC's governments made the
decision, these countries could be admitted right away. Poland's democracy
is no more fragile than that of some existing EC members. Moreover, it is a
rapidly maturing one - as well as being an economy that will actually grow
this year. Convergence criteria are in the eye of the beholder; to insist
that these countries meet necessary economic and political pre-conditions
before they accede could prove to be the most awful short-sightedness.
Britain's prime minister, Mr John Major, has said that nothing would give
him greater pleasure than to see Poland become a member of the EC. There is
no recession so severe, no problem of economic integration so serious, that
cannot be overcome to achieve a degree of European unity that may prove
essential for the peace, the development, and, eventually, the prosperity
also of Europe as a whole.
Ask not what Poland must do for the EC, but instead what all in the EC must
do for Poland.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Arts: Opera's daring annus mirabilis / A look back at a year
of adventurous productions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The operatic talking point of 1992 was, strictly speaking, a non-artistic
one: the prominence given to the Royal Opera House and its general director,
Jeremy Isaacs, in a run of sensationalised media stories in the middle of
the year. These were variants on the theme of 'Opera House deficit scandal:
Isaacs blamed for chaos', which had been developed on the basis of leaks of
supposed excerpts from the Arts Council report into the house, chaired by
Baroness Warnock.
Who did the leaking has never been established. The excerpts came wrapped in
unattributed comment and fake-impartial tones of delivery. Their purpose
seemed designed to stir public outcry prior to the Covent Garden board's
re-examination of Mr Isaacs's contract. (In the end, he got it renewed until
1995.)
At one point, indeed, it was 'widely rumoured that David Mellor is looking
round for a replacement', according to a Times Diary item; that it was not
his job to do so left the rumour-mongers unruffled. All of this unfolded
during the summer of David Mellor's brief occupancy of the heritage
ministry. His eventual resignation, on September 24, was of course one of
the bigger national news items of the year, and its effects and implications
were felt far more widely than in the opera world alone.
Mellor constantly denied that he was in any way responsible for the
Isaacs-destabilisation campaign. It does seem, then, an extraordinary
coincidence that since his departure a blanket of silence should have
descended so completely on the whole subject. (In the event, what little of
the report was eventually disclosed offered no opinion of Isaacs's
managerial skills; its main criticisms - ridiculously short-sighted, in my
view - were directed at the ROH redevelopment scheme.)
To Royal Opera House-watchers the irony in all this was that a distasteful
brouhaha should have been stirred up in the year that was, by general
consent, artistically the most rewarding for a very long time. Of the eight
new productions already unveiled (I write prior to the opening night of the
ninth, Alcina), only one elicited a wide range of critical catcalls. This
was the house's tribute to the Rossini bicentenary in the form of a
hideously over-designed, feebly farcical, vocally underpowered Viaggio a
Reims.
But it is worth recalling the others, not only for the happy memories they
summon but because they added up to so richly varied and balanced a
repertory. For me the peak of excitement was reached by the first house
production of Prokofiev's Fiery Angel, an uneven opera made enthralling by
Edward Downes's lucidly controlled conducting, the singing of the Russians
Galina Gorchakova (a young soprano of thrilling potential) and Sergey
Leiferkus, and the 'nave' theatrical vision of the producer, David Freeman,
in which weird, beautiful flesh was given to the demons haunting the opera.
But the triumphant London re-creation of Glyndebourne's epoch-making 1986
Porgy and Bess, with Andrew Litton its inspired conductor, came near it. So
did Death in Venice in Colin Graham's shimmering, liquidly unfolded staging,
with Philip Langridge its masterly Aschenbach. The manifold musical
pleasures of a Bellini Puritani sung with beauty of tone and style and
potent dramatic feeling by June Anderson and Giuseppe Sabbatini were
complemented by a handsome, intelligent production.
Don Giovanni, with Thomas Allen at the head of a uniformly fine cast, was
given a dark, complex, violent-spirited reading by Johannes Schaaf that
argued its case with impressive clarity. Bernard Haitink's rapturously warm,
unforced conducting of Die Frau ohne Schatten and Anna Tomova-Sintov's
noble, heartfelt Empress were the notable features of the colourful but
somewhat limited Cox-Hockney production. In a Flying Dutchman (staged by Ian
Judge) more notable for splashy stage effects than deep re-examination of
Wagner's themes and characters, overall standards were high, and there was
the inestimable bonus of Julia Varady's gloriously impulsive, vocally
italianate Senta.
The improvement of the chorus continued apace. On the whole, revivals were
carefully considered. The return of the 1990 Guillaume Tell, enriched with
previously missing authority, gave this Rossini appassionato particular
satisfaction; the polished bel canto of Alfredo Kraus and Sumi Jo in
L'elisir d'amore afforded a collector's item; and while I found the
ballyhooed Otello - it marked Georg Solti's 80th birthday, brought back
Placido Domingo and Kiri Te Kanawa, and featured Leiferkus's first Iago -
coolly calculated and unmoving, it was plainly the product of a front-rank
opera-theatre.
A further irony of this splendid year is that it directly bears out one of
the subsidiary Warnock criticisms: that the company has been favouring
artistic adventurousness over economically prudent planning (which would
give us Carmen, Boheme, Tosca and Barber wall to wall). In the words of the
November editorial of Opera magazine, 'In effect the ROH is being castigated
for doing its job - staging world-class performances of opera and dance - in
open defiance of an Arts Council that is plainly not doing its job ie
funding it.'
But with the Royal Opera now committed to putting into practice several of
Warnock's recommendations; with one cancellation - La Juive - already
announced and perhaps others to follow; and with the Arts Council's 2.5 per
cent rise in funding allocation just settled, there is every depressing
chance that 1992 will have been the last such annus mirabilis of Royal Opera
achievement for some while to come.
The big news from the English National Opera this year was that the
government produced Pounds 12.8m to enable the company to buy the Coliseum
from Stoll Moss. Security of tenure is undoubtedly a boon. I trust it will
enable the new team poised to succeed Messrs Jonas, Elder and Pountney at
the end of the 1992-93 season to take a long view of planning - opera
invariably suffers from its lack.
I am not sure whether it was this, or the need for programming caution after
the bold, risky 1990-91 season of 20th-century opera, that seemed to leave
in its wake great tranches of 'safe' Mikado, Rigoletto and Magic Flute
revivals; but 1992 felt like a year of ENO batteries running down. There
were fewer new productions than in the past; their choice may have been
imaginative - Humperdinck's Konigskinder (an underrated, beautiful
late-Romantic fairy-tale which I particularly welcomed), Don Carlos, The
Force of Destiny, Princess Ida, and Janacek's Broucek - but all were to a
greater or lesser extent flawed by their production conceits or execution.
In the matter of Ken Russell's grotesquely vulgar, wretchedly incompetent
account of the Gilbert and Sullivan, the phrase 'greater extent' counts as
the most timorous of understatements.
Nicholas Hytner's eagerly awaited return to the house with The Force of
Destiny elicited a curiously muted Verdi encounter: fine performances from
Josephine Barstow and Jonathan Summers, serious Verdi conducting from Elder,
excessive reliance on the stage revolve. From the evidence of Pountney's
Konigskinder, Don Carlos and Broucek stagings, all replete with 'house
mannerisms', I suspect that he has reached something of an artistic
watershed, and that his forthcoming departure from Coliseum management will
occur not a moment too soon in his own artistic development.
The world premiere of John Buller's Bakxai - musically fascinating,
dramatically inert - was a duty conscientiously discharged. In the end it
was left to the vital, purposeful revivals of Xerxes (pure Hytner delight),
Street Scene, the Monteverdi Orfeo and Wozzeck to remind us of ENO's past
form when operating on full engine-power.
Opera North's choice of repertory seemed to me an ideal mixture of adventure
and intelligent renewal: Schreker's Ferne Klang, The Thieving Magpie (apart
from the London Tell, the only really worthwhile Rossini centenary tribute
in all our opera theatres), a Boris Godunov revival, the first British
staging of Gerhard's 1949 Duenna (which followed hard on the first-ever
staging, in Madrid), Orpheus in the Underworld, Billy Budd. The success rate
varied, but the excitement of visiting this admirable company was never
seriously confounded; and, in the case of the shattering Budd, reality far
surpassed expectation.
Welsh National Opera put on what many people seem to consider the operatic
highlight of the year: the Pelleas collaboration between Pierre Boulez and
Peter Stein. On this page Andrew Clements pronounced the Cardiff opening a
'landmark'; I had the misfortune to hit upon a later performance dogged by
technical mishap; but over Boulez's Debussy conducting there could be no
grounds for dispute: it was magnificent tout court.
WNO's Elektra, in a David Alden production that with its panoply of stale
surrealist gestures looked like a David Alden parody, had the benefit of
Felicity Palmer's star-quality Clytemnestra; Gluck's Iphigenie en Tauride
was also done in a modish, arty way but with intensity, urgency and
commitment.
Scottish Opera dipped a toe into the waters of
modern-production-with-a-vengeance with a Handel Julius Caesar styled (and
musically re-written) after the model of Viz comics. I thought it beneath
contempt. In general, hopes for a revival of this company's artistic
fortunes were greatly increased by the appointment of Richard Armstrong to
succeed John Mauceri as music director. If anyone still needed evidence of
Armstrong's mature mastery, the spellbinding Edinburgh Festival concert
performance of Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron came usefully to hand.
In the domain of new opera it was not a significant year for Britain. Bakxai
apart, the most notable premiere was the Women's Theatre Trust staging of
Nicola Lefanu's Blood Wedding - notable, that is, for the startling
disproportion between staging (classy) and work itself (thin gruel). I went
to Chicago for Bolcom's McTeague, a mixture of 'modern' and 'popular' idioms
imperfectly coalesced but with beguiling moments; and to Los Angeles, where
the Finnish National Opera gave the premiere of Aulis Sallinen's fourth
opera Kullervo. My admiration for this composer's theatrical vision,
unremittingly stark yet 'approachable', was not unanimously shared; but for
the great Finnish baritone Jorma Hynninen in the title role, superlatives
were unleashed on every side. When - we ask again - is he to receive an
invitation from Covent Garden?
The last word must go to Glyndebourne. This was its final season in the 'old
house'; already during the festival a huge excavation was visible where the
walled garden used to be. This year there is no festival; the year after,
there is the promise of a new theatre larger than the old (but not
un-intimately so), and with warmer acoustics and greater audience comfort as
its goals.
The final summer series before the break was one of tremendous achievement.
Revivals of Cos fan tutte, Jenufa (altogether triumphant) and Death in
Venice offered examples of the Glyndebourne 'work ethic' at its most
elevated. The new Peter Grimes, conducted by Andrew Davis and produced by
Trevor Nunn in carefully researched naturalistic vein, may not have pulled
its component parts exactly into balance - and those Suffolk accents were
definitely an error of judgment - but there were many musical and dramatic
illuminations to compensate.
The new Queen of Spades, conducted by Davis and produced by Graham Vick, was
a revelation. It was at once contemporary in dramatic idiom and capable of
richly affectionate spectacle, turbulent and colourful; and it was sung -
by, among others, Nancy Gustafson, Felicity Palmer, Sergey Leiferkus, Dmitry
Kharitonov, and the alarmingly unsparing Yury Maruzin as Hermann - with a
truly Tchaikovskyan blend of poetry and passion.
It formed one of the peaks of Glyndebourne achievement, and an inspired
climax to one of the most impressive festivals in Glyndebourne history. If I
had a prize to award for 'event of the year', this Queen of Spades would
unquestionably be its recipient.

If you missed Tornado Down the first time around, this thought-provoking
documentary is back tonight on C4 at 9.00. Flight Lieutenants John Peters
and John Nichol were shot down on the first day of Operation Desert Storm
and subsequently paraded on Iraqi TV - not perhaps one of Saddam Hussein's
more astute propaganda moves. The two airmen describe their captivity at the
hands of the secret police and the experience of breaking down under
torture.
The Name of the Room on BBC2 at 7.20, sets out to trace the evolution of the
British dwelling from the mead-halls of Beowulf's era to the modern semi. A
good idea, although a mere four programmes looks a little short for such a
complex subject and one so rich in social snobbery. Tonight's programme
starts with rooms intended for public show - parlour, lounge, drawing-room,
depending who you are . . .
Horizon's Awakening of the Frozen Addicts (BBC2 at 8.00) looks at Swedish
research into a cure for Parkinson's Disease using transplants of foetal
tissue. It follows scientists along a complicated research trail opened up a
decade ago.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Arts: RSC looks for corporate friends - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an ominous start to what could be a difficult year for arts sponsorship,
Royal Insurance has announced that it will not be renewing its support for
the Royal Shakespeare Company worth Pounds 2.1m over three years when the
contract expires at the end of 1993.
The decision surprises nobody. Royal Insurance has been with the RSC for six
years, investing Pounds 3.5m in the Company. It renewed the connection once,
increasing its annual aid from Pounds 465,000 to Pounds 700,000 a year. This
length of support is quite impressive in arts sponsorship: if there is such
a thing as an average relationship, it would be for three years with a
year's grace to enable the arts organisation to find a replacement. The RSC
has this 12 months' leeway.
Heralded at the time as the biggest arts sponsorship ever, the link has
undoubtedly helped both parties, but especially RI, which has raised its
profile and had marvellous entertainment opportunities. It promoted Ian
Rushton, group chief executive of RI when the deal was sealed and its main
internal supporter, to the role of spokesman for all UK corporate sponsors.
He warned the government that business would not pick up the cheque if arts
subsidy was cut.
The RSC benefited from an assured extra income during some seasons when box
office revenue failed to meet its target.
The recession, and its impact on profits, is the main factor behind RI's
decision to withdraw, but the difficulty in injecting new excitement into a
sponsorship after six years is as important.
The RSC is well aware of the difficulties in making good the Pounds 700,000
in the current climate. It may well settle for a number of smaller
sponsorships. It has been successful in recent months in finding companies
willing to pay up to Pounds 10,000 to be associated with certain
performances.
It has also forged an imaginative link with Unilever which, through its
brands Persil, Comfort and Flora, is backing the current productions at the
Barbican to the tune of Pounds 50,000.
Fortunately for the RSC its new Hamlet at the Barbican is a box office
winner, with advance bookings of Pounds 1.2m. Box office takings in London
and Stratford in November and December were above target. A good critical
reputation will be the RSC's best advertisement in its search for new
corporate friends.
                           *      *      *
It is a sad irony for the RSC that the UK's biggest arts sponsor, British
Telecom, with a Pounds 1.6m budget, has been looking for an important
theatre company to back, to add a third prong to its substantial
sponsorships of dance, through Northern Ballet Theatre, and art, through the
National Touring Exhibition. Its choice has fallen on the English
Shakespeare Company and a deal will be announced this week.
The RSC was never in the frame. BT had supported its annual tour to small
venues but the relationship ended, with some acrimony, a year ago.
                           *      *      *
RI's six years with the RSC is as nothing compared with Texaco's support for
the Metropolitan Opera in New York. This is now starting its 53rd year and
in that time Texaco has contributed Dollars 100m to the Met. The oil company
has concentrated its help on underwriting the Met's Saturday afternoon
matinee performances which are transmitted to over 300 radio stations
throughout North America. It is generally agreed that the sponsorship has
done more to popularise opera in North America than any other project. Since
1990 the UK has been covered by the broadcasts and every Saturday until
April the Met opera can be heard live on Radio 3, with a complete Ring cycle
scheduled for March.
                           *      *      *
Fashion houses are not famous for their sponsorship of the arts but on
January 24 an exhibition of structures by the American minimalist artist Sol
Lewitt opens at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, thanks to Nina Ricci.
As is so often the case the impetus behind the link comes from the fact that
the president of Nina Ricci, Gilles Fuchs, is an important collector of
modern art, including the work of Lewitt. He recently commissioned the
artist to design the packaging for its new fragrance for men, Ricci-Club.
                           *      *      *
It seems extraordinary that, given the recession and the announced cuts in
sponsorship by leading banks, oil firms, and insurance companies, Colin
Tweedy, director general of the Association for Business Sponsorship of the
Arts, can still forecast a rise in arts sponsorship, albeit a small one, in
1993.
His optimism is based on the potential expenditure of new sponsors,
especially small- and medium-sized companies. As administrator of the
Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, ABSA is well placed to monitor the
emergence of such sponsors. The Government funds the BSIS with Pounds 4.5m
(the sum remains unchanged for 1993-94), which is geared to draw in new arts
sponsors with matching grants. There has been no falling away in demand for
this top-up money in recent months, suggesting that the sponsorship
bandwagon is still rolling.
The BSIS also throws light on changes in sponsorship fashions. A feature of
the past year has been the growth of interest in supporting film - there has
been a threefold increase in BSIS grants in this field, from six to 19. Film
received Pounds 444,600 in sponsorship and top-up grants, as against Pounds
121,000 in the previous year.
Sponsors have at last woken up to the fact that film is enjoying a revival
of interest, with cinema admissions booming. Film is flexible,
international, and appeals to young audiences. Perhaps not surprisingly
Piper Heidseick's sponsorship of the British Film Institute's Classic Film
Collection won it the best first-time sponsor award at last month's ABSA
prize giving.
Other successful film sponsorships in recent months have included the
IRN-BRU backing for the pop video exhibition at the Museum of the Moving
Image; MacPherson Paints support for the Film Foundation's educational pack
of the film Macbeth; and Panavision's sponsorship of the First Film
Foundation New European Filmmaker's Short Film Festival. The attraction of
film is that helping it can be very cheap, which appeals to small
businesses. A local restaurant, The Ubiquitous Chip, sponsors the Glasgow
Film Theatre.

FT  04 JAN 93 / People: Olympian challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Napier, corporate affairs director of Ford of Europe, is taking on
the formidable task of improving the public relations of the International
Olympic Committee.
Napier, 45, plays down the difficulty of his new job and says that in some
ways it is more of a homecoming. Before joining Ford's European headquarters
in Essex eight years ago, he had been public affairs manager for Philip
Morris' European head office in Lausanne, only a few minutes away from the
IOC's headquarters.
Napier will be in charge of a new department covering media relations,
information and publications and will report direct to Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the IOC's 72-year-old president.
Although the last couple of Olympic games, in Seoul and Barcelona, have been
great commercial successes, the Olympic movement, and in particular its
president, have often been the subject of controversy.
A recent book, The Lord of the Rings, alleged that there had been
manipulation of the Olympic ideals for financial gain.
However, Napier says he has no qualms about working for such a powerful
figure as Samaranch who has dominated the Olympic movement for the past 12
years and comes up for re-election next year. He believes that Samaranch's
critics fail to give the president sufficient credit for the positive
contribution he has made in areas such as ridding sport of apartheid and
negotiating with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin to ensure that former
Soviet athletes were able to participate fully in this year's Barcelona
Olympics.

FT  04 JAN 93 / People: Hongkong Bank's new era
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when being a Scot sometimes seemed to be almost a condition
of promotion to the upper echelons of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation. However, the appointment of Indian-born Aman Mehta (above) as
the top man in the Americas for HSBC Holdings, the new London-based holding
company for Midland Bank as well as Marine Midland in the US and Hongkong
Bank, is a sign that those days are long gone.
Mehta, 46, trained in the HongKong Bank's London office, but started his
career in its Bombay office. After a stint in charge of the bank's corporate
planning in Hong Kong he moved to Riyadh in 1988 as managing director of the
group's Saudi British Bank affiliate.
Last February he was made a group general manager and has been responsible
for helping sort out the problems of the group's troubled Concord Leasing
business.
Mehta's new job is the most senior of a string of announcements of the
management team which will run Britain's biggest banking group from the
beginning of this month. David Beath, 54, has been made general manager and
group audit controller, and Richard Hennessy, 39, group chief accountant.
HSBC, which will be headquartered in Midland Montagu's old offices in Lower
Thames Street, is keen to maintain its reputation for having a lean top
management team. In addition to John Bond, 51, the new group chief executive
who has just been appointed to the Midland board, HSBC will have three
executive directors - Bernard Asher, 56, (investment banking), John
Strickland, 53, (services), and Richard Delbridge, 50, (finance). Asher will
report direct to Sir William Purves, HSBC's chairman, while Strickland and
Delbridge will report to Bond.
Mehta, who will be based in New York, is one of three group general managers
of HSBC. Tim O'Brien, 45, in charge of private banking and trustee work,
will be based in Geneva, and John French, responsible for credit and risk
management for the whole group, will be based in London.

FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: 20 things you didn't know
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
20 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Infamous newspaper hoaxer Rocky Ryan (catchphrase 'Look, trust
    me') claims to have pulled the wool over the eyes of every national
    newspaper in Britain except the FT.
2.  In 1991 the FT reported the sensational discovery of the earliest
    surviving text of sayings ascribed to Jesus. Source of the story
    was the previously unknown Egyptologist Batson D. Sealing.
3.  The mystery of how the FT's Lex column got its name died with
    Hargreaves Parkinson, the man who started it. But some believe it
    comes from the Latin De minimus non curat lex ('The law is not
    concerned with trifles).
4.  The FT normally gets 80 per cent of its revenues from advertising,
    with only 20 per cent coming from the 60p cover price.
5.  The price of a full-page advertisment in the FT ranges from pounds
    28,224 to pounds 32,500, depending on position. For full colour, the
    range is pounds 35,500 to pounds 41,000
6.  Famous people who have worked for the FT include Lord (once, plain
    Nigel) Lawson, a former Chancellor, who was a Lex columnist and
    features editor; and Lord (once, plain Norman) Tebbit, a former Tory
    party chairman. He worked in the prices room, as did pop star turned
    actor Gary Kemp.
7.  One former FT chairman, Horatio Bottomley, was imprisoned for fraud
    in 1922. A visitor who found him stitching mail-bags in the prison
    workshop exclaimed: 'Sewing, Bottomley?' 'No, reaping,' he replied.
8.  The FT moved its editorial offices to a new building on the south
    side of Southwark Bridge in 1989 after selling Bracken House, its
    old home in the City, for pounds 143 million at the height of the
    property boom.
9.  The FT's new printing plant at East India Dock in London's
    Docklands, winner of a string of architectural awards, also prints
    the Observer and the European edition of Nihon Keizei Shimbun - the
    latter in Japanese.
10. The FT is printed in four other countries as well as Britain. The
    other places are Frankfurt in Germany, Roubaix in France, New
    Jersey in the US and Tokyo, Japan.
11. The FT now sells in 150 countries, and its rapidly-rising overseas
    circulation accounts for 40 per cent of the total.
12. Because of the international time difference, FT subscribers in
    Tokyo get their papers at 9am local time while it is still midnight
    the night before in Britain.
13. Contrary to popular misconception, there are no links between the
    FT and the Times, nor have there ever been - though the two held
    merger talks in 1966, when the troubled Times was looking for a
    suitor.
14. Once-a-week readers dipping into the FT at weekends make the
    Saturday paper immensley popular; it outsells the Monday-Friday
    edition by about 15 per cent.
15. The FT share price indices, a valuable promotional tool for the
    newspaper, date back to 1935 when the first of them was created
    to monitor the rate of recovery from the slump of the early 1930s.
16. The FT has more foreign correspondents than almost any newspaper in
    the world, with 35 full-time staff correspondents, nine more
    correspondents working mainly for the FT and about 80 other
    stringers.
17. The FT was named Newspaper of the Year last year. Readers agreed,
    saying it made excellent cat litter. Homes and Gardens magazine
    recommended using it as gift wrap.
18. Of respondents to a recent UK readership questionnaire in the FT:
    89 per cent were male, the average age was 45 and the average
    salary pounds 68,000 a year.
19. The white parts of colour pictures in the FT are an optical
    illusion. What readers really see is the absence of any other
    colour - in other words, the pinkness of the paper underneath.
20. The FT's pink paper used to be cheaper than ordinary newsprint
    because it cost less to dye poor-quality paper than it did to
    bleach it. Now, the pink paper costs more - but old traditions die
    hard.

FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: Lies, damn lies and financial
reporting - The business press's steps beyond the City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JANUARY 2 1893, when the Financial Times first blushed pink, marked the
newspaper's arrival at the second great milestone in the evolution of
Britain's financial press.
The first had been the transition from papers which consisted purely of
price lists towards those that also supplied the news behind the markets.
The earliest financial papers were those such as Lloyd's News, created in
1696 by Edward Lloyd, a coffee house owner, to serve the growing anthill of
London's financial district.
In the US these early business papers were known as price currents and
formed the basis of today's trade press - providing specialist services to
tightly defined business groups from tobacco growers to railroad men. In
1869 George Houghton, successful editor of the The Hub, a carriage business
paper, published a list of do's and don'ts, of which the cornerstone was:
'Stick to your speciality] You will want soon to publish a story that has no
connection with carriage-making, or will be tempted to use some reading
matter of a general character. Don't do it. If you do you will kill your
paper.'
The FT was able to outgrow this stern advice because the growth of financial
markets in the 19th century and the emergence of a substantial investor
class created an appetite for information about all sectors of business.
This information boom underpinned the maturing of a modern economy based on
international trade.
It also created opportunities for unscrupulous stock promoters and
fraudsters. Even as early as 1720 The South Sea Bubble could not have
happened on the scale it did without a rudimentary and nationwide financial
news system to pump it up. By 1893 it could not be claimed that the press
had developed robust ethical standards to chart them through these turbulent
waters.
Horatio Bottomley, who became chairman of the FT in 1888 at the age of 28,
had a taste for champagne, chorus girls and horseracing. He went on to run
the viciously rightwing John Bull newspaper, which printed details from
Ramsay MacDonald's birth certificate and so revealed something of which the
Labour party leader was himself ignorant, namely his illegit-imacy.
In the 1890s Bottomley floated a string of suspect companies but it was not
until 1922 that he was convicted of fraud for his leading role in the sale
of wartime Victory Bonds.
In the ensuing years several more sober and enduring figures in the FT's
history were to be exposed as recipients of substantial payments from
dubious City figures whose stocks the paper had pushed. This may have been
normal for financial journalists of the time, who attacked enemies and
defended friends with fulminating vigour. The FT had yet to discover that
honesty and impartiality could provide a sound base for its business.
If the honesty of some of the early leading figures in financial journalism
was questionable there was, however, hard work in evidence.
An early history of the Financial News, with which the FT was to merge in
1945, records the following day in the life of one FA Hanson who 'was
reputed to return home for sleep only at the weekends'. He 'would call at
the office at eleven each morning to be assigned to a company meeting. This
engagement fulfilled, and his copy transcribed, he would write up the
produce markets - no light task in those days of easy space - before going
down to his real night's duty at five in the afternoon. Having seen the
paper to bed in the small hours of the morning, he would snatch a few hours'
sleep in a chair, take breakfast at a restaurant in which he was wickedly
reputed to have some financial interest, and begin the routine again.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: FT salmon livery synonymous with
quality financial reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH there are pink sections in newspapers of a general and sporting
nature the FT salmon livery has become synonymous with quality financial
reporting, Raymond Snoddy writes.
When Al Alam Al Youm, the Arab world's first financial daily was
established, most of its pages were pink. The Economic Times, 'India's
Business Newspaper' is not only pink but even looks a lot like the FT.
It is not easy to find newsprint mills making pink paper. The New
Delhi-based newspaper had to go to Tamil Nadu in the far south to find a
supplier of the right quality of paper.
The only English mill producing paper for the FT is Bridgewater's plant at
Ellesmere Port although pink paper is also imported from Finland and Sweden.
Pink paper is made from standard newspaper pulp. Samples of the pulp are
chemically tested to determine the concentration of dye that is needed to
achieve the right colour and an even consistancy. Monitored amounts of
colouring are then pumped into the pulp.
Adding pink to the newsprint for the FT costs about Pounds 25 extra a tonne
out of a price of about Pounds 400 a tonne.
Tinted papers seemed to be fading away but are now on the increase
particularly to make special sections stand out.
The pink legions also include the Finanza &amp; Mercato section of 24 ORE in
Italy and Le Fig-Eco, the economic section of Le Figaro. Then there are
papers in which the FT has an interest such as Expansion and Izvestia's new
financial section.

FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: A penny not so dreadful
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
READERS of the Financial Times only got six pages back in 1893 but they did
pay a lot less than they would have done for today's paper.
The FT cost just one penny in 1893. That is the equivalent of 18.6 pence
today after decimalisation of the pound in the 1970s and a century of
inflation.
Put another way, today's 60 pence issue would have cost 3.22 pennies if it
had been put on the news stands in 1893.

FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: Oh what a difference a century makes
/ A look back to a time when the world was Britain's trading oyster.  But
that was 100 years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE HUNDRED years ago, Britain had its own single market. It was called the
world.
Accounting for 35 per cent of international trade in manufactured goods, the
UK in 1893 ruled the waves of global commerce. A large deficit in
merchandise trade was habitually more than offset by a healthy surplus in
'invisibles' - exports of services, and remittances from assets abroad.
Between the battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the outbreak of the first world
war, it chalked up a current account surplus - normally of the order of
Pounds 50m to Pounds 100m - in every year except 1827, 1840 and 1847.
In 1892, when Britain registered a visible trade deficit of Pounds 95m (and
a current account surplus of Pounds 57m), roughly 40 per cent of British
exports and imports represented transactions with the rest of Europe.
During the last 100 years (particularly since EC membership in 1973), trade
has shifted strongly towards Europe. In the first nine months of 1992,
Britain ran a trade deficit of Pounds 14.5bn. Last year 56 per cent of
British exports, and 52 per cent of imports, were transacted with the rest
of the EC. Counting countries outside the EC, western Europe accounted for
about 63 per cent of both imports and exports last year.
What a difference a century makes] In 1892 Britain's trade with India
exceeded that with Germany by about 10 per cent. Last year, British exports
to Germany were 15 times those to India, while imports from Germany were 23
times larger than Indian ones.
Nearly half of all Britain's imports in 1892 were foodstuffs and livestock.
The trade returns for that year read like a colonial warehouse catalogue:
grain and flour, sugar, tea, meat, butter and margarine were among the main
items purchased from abroad. Britain bought 4.4m cwt of wheat from Russia,
worth Pounds 1.47m; 392,679 cwt of oxen from the US, worth Pounds 7.5m, and
671,882 cwt of bacon from Denmark, costing Pounds 1.9m.
Australia had already started its marketing campaign for wines: the UK
bought 461,007 gallons, valued at Pounds 80,551. But the 1892 drinks trade
was then, as now, dominated by the Continent. The British purchased 4.2m
gallons of French red wines (Pounds 989,859) and 1.6m gallons of
higher-value French whites (Pounds 1.9m).
Raw materials and non-manufactured goods made up most remaining imports.
Apart from raw cotton, timber, wool, tobacco and hides, Britain bought in
large quantities of more exotic items. On the import list for 1892 were 11.5
cwt of ivory, worth Pounds 559,073, and 27.8 tonnes of guano manure, setting
back the nation Pounds 189,433.
Victorian industrial power is summed up in the figure for imports of
machinery in the 1892 trade figures: nil. On the export side, cotton goods
made up about one quarter of all sales, followed by woollen goods, iron and
steel, coal, machinery and chemicals.
At the beginning of 1893, Britain's trading performance looked strong. Yet
there were still complaints. 'There is not very much that can be called
satisfactory in a review of the trade of the past year,' moaned The
Economist in its issue of January 14 1893, recording that in many categories
exports and imports had shown declines in the year just passed. If not
exactly an annus horribilis, 1892 turned out to have been a year of
recession, with modern estimates putting the decline in gross domestic
product at about 2.6 per cent.
Britain was the world's sole mercantile superpower. Hindsight has confirmed
what should, even then, have been obvious. The UK faced only one direction:
gradually, though remorselessly, towards 100 years of relative economic
decline.

FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: Colour that drove Elvis's mum wild -
The fickle love affairs between the commercial world and an often shocking
pink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a scene in Funny Face, Stanley Donen's 1950s musical, where Miss
Prescott, the indomitable editor of Quality magazine, is searching for a new
theme. Suddenly she finds it. 'Here it is,' she exclaims. 'Here's our theme.
Here's our answer - pink.'
Pink according to Miss Prescott, is a panacea, not only for the editorial
problems of Quality magazine but for 'women everywhere'. 'Banish the black,'
she trills. 'Burn the blue and bury the beige. From now on girls, think
pink.'
And she is not alone in her Panglossian view of pink. It almost always
conjures up positive images. Anyone who is 'in the pink', is at the peak of
health. A 'rose-tinted' view is invariably optimistic. The French call
happiness la vie en rose. 'Pink is a joyful colour,' says Christian Lacroix,
the Paris fashion designer who has used it in several collections.
It is these connotations that some companies have tried to harness. Lacroix
packaged his perfume C'Est La Vie] in pink to evoke 'a zest for life'.
Ten years ago James Dyson, the British industrial designer plumped for pink
as the colour of his new product - a vacuum cleaner. 'Pink had shock value,'
he says. 'At the time no one had used pastel shades or Hollywood colours for
electronic products. My vacuum cleaner was a heavy piece of technology. I
liked the idea of juxtaposing the serious aspects of the machine with a
friendly, feminine colour.'
Cadillac adopted the same strategy when marketing its pink models as symbols
of all-American success in the 1950s. The pink Cadillac became the essential
accessory for blue-collar boys-made-good. Elvis Presley even gave a 1955
pink Cadillac Sedan de Ville to his mother, Gladys. Sugar Ray Robinson
travelled across the country in his favourite flamingo pink Cadillac
complete with his valet, barber, golf partner, midget jester and at least 50
pieces of luggage.
But, as even its devotees agree, pink is not a serious shade. It is the
colour of the baby doll nighties that Hollywood starlets wore in the 1950s.
In cartoons it is often used to convey frivolity. Although Lady Penelope and
FAB 1, her pink Rolls-Royce, rode to the rescue of the Thunderbirds pilots,
they often had to wait nail-biting minutes while she fumbled with her
lipstick, or her pink powder-puff although the elegant and urbane Pink
Panther did give a certain coolness to his colour.
Pink has, after all, always been embroiled in the louche side of life. The
chorus girls in fin de siecle music halls sipped pink champagne from their
satin slippers. The cads in 1930s detective novels often downed pink gin.
Pink also has links with the sex industry from the 'pink films' that swamped
Japan's pornographic cinemas in the 1970s, to the Minitel-Rose sex-lines on
France's interactive computer network today.
Even the fickle fashion industry sees pink in a frivolous light. The
designer who is most closely associated with pink, Elsa Schiaparelli, is
also renowned for her gift for gimmicks. Schiaparelli was an Italian
couturier working in Paris during the 1930s who invented the wide-shouldered
look that dominated women's wear until the late 1940s and peppered her
collections with a string of oddities including a shoe-shaped hat, edible
cinnamon buttons and fabric woven with cellophane and straw.
Schiaparelli also pioneered the use of shocking pink, which became her
signature shade. She even called her perfume, Shocking, and asked Salvador
Dali to design the bottle for it. He produced a body-shaped bottle modelled
on a dress Schiaparelli made for Mae West.
Perhaps it is this ephemeral air which means that pink never seems to last
for long in the business world. Schiaparelli closed her fashion house in
1954, after her square shouldered pinks had been ousted by the softer shapes
and sober tones of Christian Dior's New Look. Cadillac stopped producing
pink cars.
Gladys Presley's Sedan de Ville is now on display at the motor museum in
Gracelands, her son's old home. Even the pink film has perished, killed off
by the adurato, adult videos now popular among those who used to flock to
Japanese porn cinemas.
C'est La Vie], the pink-packaged perfume, never took off and has lost Pounds
18m in the three years since its launch. Lacroix's latest collections have
moved from pink to more muted colours. 'I still love pinks, particularly
fuchsia and very pale pastels, but it's less important in my work,' he says.
'It doesn't feel right any more.'
James Dyson has also changed his choice of colour. His pink vacuum cleaner
is still available in Japan, where it sells as a collector's item for Pounds
1,200. 'But I wouldn't work in pink today,' he says. 'It would be too roue.'
This month he is introducing another new vacuum cleaner - in silver and
yellow.
Perhaps the most sobering story of all is that of pink champagne. Originally
all champagnes were pink. Most of the grapes growing in the Champagne region
are red, after all. But in 1682 the cellar master at Hautvillers Abbey, one
of the largest in the area, invented a gentler form of pressing which
produced white champagne from the local crop.
The cellar master was Dom Perignon. His white champagnes were so successful
that he transformed the finances of the Champagne region and laid the
foundations for the champagne industry of today. Moet &amp; Chandon, one of the
largest champagne houses, celebrated the 250th anniversary of his invention
in 1932 by naming a new and exclusive champagne after him.
White champagne easily outsells pink, with the latter representing less than
3 per cent of champagne sales in France and 4 per cent in the UK, although
some pinks are still sought after by champagne buffs. One of the most
coveted is Dom Perignon Rose, which is made in very small quantities and
sells for FFr1,000 (Pounds 119) a bottle, more than twice as much as the
white champagne with which the cellar master made his name.
Pink champagne, like so many other pink products, has floundered in the
business world. The Financial Times is an exception in having stuck
successfully to pink for so long. The Sporting Times, the original 'Pink
'un', has disappeared from the news stands.
Miss Prescott got it right in Funny Face. As soon as she starts singing
'Think Pink', all the other characters in the movie change into carefully
co-ordinated pink clothes. But Miss Prescott has much too much sense to
swallow her own editorial advice. She stays in a sedate grey and white.

FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: A Guinness for Pounds 339 - Different
times, same names. Jane Fuller on 1893's stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KIDNAPPED by time bandits and transported back 100 years, an FT reader would
at least find a little comfort and some reminders of home in the pages of
the newspaper.
Familiar names such as Lloyds Bank, Guinness, Coats and Vickers were listed
companies, although they and their sectors tended to be buried by
information about the money, foreign, rails and mining markets.
In some ways, the FT turned pink in a calm news period. Caution reigned
after such alarms as the near demise of Barings merchant bank; the bursting
of foreign mining bubbles; and the premature excitement over electricity
which led to another collapse.
Even the good news was less exciting than in the late 1880s when several
brewers took heart from the debut of Guinness and came to the market to
raise money to build and buy public houses. 'It was very expensive to build
a gin palace in those days,' according to one market analyst.
Guinness, it should be noted, was an exception as its expansion was already
linked to the worldwide distribution of its brand - lubricated by the demand
of Irish emigrees.
Then, as now, a cautious mood among investors was good news for some
sectors: 'The public has preferred sound stocks to speculative or gambling
counters.'
Not surprisingly it was a good year for gilts or 'consols'. After some
year-end profit-taking, they ended close to their 12-month high.
Home rails had settled down as nice little yielders and stock prices had
shown stability, if not excitement.
Several of the banks offered a very good return. As the table shows,
dividend rates were running at 9 to 20 per cent. Investors were benefiting
indirectly from industrial expansion, which had so far been funded largely
without recourse to the stock market.
The role played by the stock market in funding British industrial growth has
provoked some debate among scholars, providing an academic equivalent of
current arguments about the relationship between the City and industry.
The paucity of quoted industrial stocks is taken by some as evidence of
laggardliness on the part of the City. But later in the 1890s and early
1900s, there was a wave of corporate activity.
One aspect was a number of mega-mergers. Another was company flotations.
But before that, the market was to be awoken from its deep sleep by a more
familiar round of speculation: gold mining in South Africa.

FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: Police hot on the heels of Jabez
Balfour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT, London January 1893
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND YARD detectives this week extended their search for Jabez Spencer
Balfour, the disgraced financier who disappeared on December 18 following
the arrest of two of his associates. Sources in the Square Mile suggest that
he may have fled to South America.
The downfall of Balfour and his business enterprises must rank as one of the
great financial scandals of the nineteenth century. The Liberator Building
Society, which collapsed in the autumn, was easily the biggest such society
in Britain. Preliminary indications suggest the total loss to shareholders
and depositors of the Liberator and seven associated companies may exceed
the extraordinary sum of Pounds 8m.
What makes the news all the more shocking is that Mr Balfour has long been
regarded as a pillar of the business establishment. Only last summer, he was
re-elected as Liberal member of parliament for Burnley. He has served on the
board of many sound City companies, and has been associated with the
construction of such magnificent London landmarks as Whitehall Court, the
Hyde Park Hotel, the Liberal Club and the Hotel Cecil. He is regarded as a
benefactor by the tenants of his Oxfordshire estate.
Moreover, he is a man who has made much of non-conformist and Temperance
Society connections.
The early success of the Liberator under his leadership owed much to these
associations. The society advertised that loans were available not only for
homes but also for the building of chapels. Mr Balfour established a large
agency organisation among ministers and laymen, who in return for a small
commission encouraged their flock to deposit savings with the Liberator.
The broad outlines of the disaster are clear. Founded in 1868, the
Liberator's early years were distinguished by rapid growth, but the society
appears to have first operated along conventional lines. In the past decade
or so, however, its character seems to have changed markedly.
Over that period, Mr Balfour established or acquired a number of
construction, property development and surveying businesses - in effect, an
integrated property investment group, for which the Liberator became the
main source of finance. At the time of its collapse, nearly all the
society's assets had been advanced to Mr Balfour's companies, on what turns
out to have been very questionable security. A favourite device appears to
have been for Mr Balfour to obtain an option on an estate, and then sell it
on at an inflated price to one of the four connected property companies with
the full purchase money being borrowed from the Liberator. He would then
pocket the profit.
An obvious question is why such enterprises were not checked by Mr Balfour's
respectable colleagues. Part of the answer lies in his forceful personality.
His style is described as 'very aggressive; it was all done at red hot speed
and he talked all the time.' What this meant in practice is shown in a board
resolution at one of his companies which gave him unlimited powers to invest
in any company he thought fit. Had the directors not allowed themselves to
be bemused by the overwhelming magnetism, optimism and energy of their
leader - who took no more than four hours sleep a night - the outcome might
have been very different.
Three public policy issues follow from this affair. First, urgent steps must
be taken to provide compensation for the thousands of depositors who now
face a bleak new year. Second, legislation is required to establish a sound
framework for the nation's building societies.
Third, and perhaps most important, serious consideration must be given to
the governance of important business enterprises. Never again must a single
dominating individual have the power to shift the savings of ordinary
citizens into his private business activities, thereby causing ruin and
despair.
Balfour was extradited from Argentina in 1895 and sentenced to a total of 14
years imprisonment. He was a model prisoner at Parkhurst, where he served
both as librarian and organist, and was released with full remission for
good conduct in 1906. He died in 1916.
The Liberator collapse led to the Building Societies Act of 1894. A relief
fund was established which helped more than 3,000 depositors over the
following two decades. The problem of corporate governance remains
unresolved.

FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: Stop press - Maxwell saved from the
sea / A look at the world which greeted the first pink FT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and DAVID KYNASTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIS NAME was Maxwell and he was dragged out of the sea after deciding to
commit suicide. The date was January 2 1893, the report a tiny item in the
Financial Times. Why Joseph Maxwell threw himself into what the FT described
as Glasgow harbour is not clear, but in the event it availed his rescuers
little, for the report ends: 'He afterwards jumped from a bedroom window and
was killed.'
Indeed, it is not just this tale, in the autumn of Queen Victoria's reign,
that provokes a feeling of deja vu. There was also recession, endemic
unemployment, home rule demands for Ireland, a Channel tunnel plan and
Uruguay talks on trade. The issue's review of the year strikes a familiar
note. 'It has been a year of death in life for the moneyed classes who have
suffered very severely from the paralysis of commercial confidence, and from
the general depression in trade.'
Familiar too was the note that 'the Uruguay settlement' on trade with
Argentina 'has pursued its course quietly in spite of all sinister
prognostications'.
But the first Monday in 1893 was memorable for another reason: it was when,
overnight, a white newspaper transformed itself into a pink-tinted one -
though not yet the bold salmon pink of modern times.
Why the change? The brief answer is the fledgling FT, five years old, was
struggling in the shadow of its older rival, the Financial News: and that it
was almost certainly a last desperate gamble, an attempt to stand out on all
those railway station news stands of late-Victorian London.
No more than a line recognised the colour change in that first pink copy but
there was a column entitled 'ourselves' which acknowledged that the paper
had discovered a world outside the City of London.
It said: 'A City man cannot afford to ignore political events when he
attempts to gauge the markets, and even such apparently trifling matters
such as a snowstorm or landslip are often of high significance to particular
stocks.'
The intention was to give 'all the news which can be of interest financially
or otherwise to the intelligent business man.' But it insisted: 'We shall
not attempt to compete with the ordinary newspaper in tales of sea serpents,
or in discovering what to do with our girls. That sort of old maid's gossip
has nothing of interest for business men.'
Prurient Victorian interest in death and disaster proved irresistible
however. On page three a one-line story said: 'Mrs (Lilly) Langtry is
reported to be out of danger.'
Another report said: 'In cleaning his revolver a journalist on the staff of
an Edinburgh newspaper pulled the trigger, not thinking any of the chambers
were loaded and shot his mother, who died from her injuries.'
It was not a buoyant City that now abandoned dreary monochrome. Barely two
years earlier, in November 1890, the Baring Crisis had all but seen the
demise of its most august merchant bank, following over-involvement in the
Argentine, and since then the foreign loans market had virtually dried up.
Financial crises were brewing in Australia and the US, and there was not
even help at hand from the volatile, highly speculative world of South
African gold mining. which had hit technical problems not overcome until the
development in the mid-1890s of deep-level mining.
The City knew who was to blame: namely, the Liberal government headed by the
octogenarian Gladstone, with the rumbustious, uncompromising Sir William
Harcourt at his side as chancellor.
The 'GOM' (Grand Old Man) had long enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the
ever more rightwards-inclining City; but by now, in his fourth term of
office, he was positively reviled, not least because of his plan to
introduce Home Rule for Ireland. At one point, when Gladstone's resignation
was rumoured, business came to a halt on the Stock Exchange as members
cheered loudly. In fact, the City's darkest hour was before the dawn. In
1894 there began the 20-year period that is now viewed as the Square Mile's
golden age, until its complacent assumptions were shattered in 1914 by the
guns of August.
These were the years in which the volume of world trade increased rapidly,
the City was to the fore in servicing that trade, sterling reigned supreme,
and a host of foreign banks, entrepreneures and outright adventurers all
made their way to the undisputed international financial centre of the
world.
Inhabiting the City on the day the FT went pink were about a quarter of a
million male clerks. The lady typist was still a fabled creature awaiting
the new century. One young clerk at the Bank of England, was Herbert de
Fraine, and years later he pictured the army of clerkdom to which he was
proud to belong: 'What did we look like, outside the walls of the Old Lady?
We wore the inevitable silk hat, with a strip of dull cloth, three inches
wide, covering the silk band.'
De Fraine's ultimate boss in January 1893, an acknowledged head of the City
as a whole, was David Powell, governor of the Bank of England. Powell was a
merchant, a reminder of the City's strongly commercial as well as financial
character - and was one of five governors in the course of the 1890s, the
office passing strictly by rota among the Bank's directors. The Bank was
dictator of British monetary policy, with little or no interference from the
government, but it was still run in an amateurish way.
It was perhaps a shock rather than a surprise when the chief cashier, Frank
May, was found guilty later in the year of having, in Powell's regretful
words, 'engaged in Stock Exchange speculations which had placed him in
serious pecuniary difficulties'.
No-one denied the importance of the Old Lady, but increasingly the true City
elite was to be found in the parlours of the best merchant banks Rothschilds
was still a name to be reckoned with under the capable if overly cautious
leadership of Lord 'Natty' Rothschild, Barings was bravely re-emerging from
its trauma, and JS Morgan &amp; Co (soon to become Morgan Grenfell) was the top
Anglo-American house.
One merchant bank moving up rapidly on the outside was J. Henry Schroder &amp;
Co, whose white hope for the future was Bruno Schroder, a 25-year-old from
Hamburg, and nephew of the senior partner.
The City was a world of its own, a Victorian public school writ large, with
of nicknames, practical jokes and inviolable but unspoken codes. 'Beetles'
were Colorado United Mining shares.
'Cream-jugs' were Charkov-Krementschug Railway bonds, 'Pots' were North
Staffordshire Railway ordinary stock, and 'Sarah's Boots' were (of course)
Sierra Buttes Gold Mine shares. A 'squirt' was someone who hung about the
market with a paltry order, not dealing fairly, while to 'shoot' was to make
a man a close price in a stock without knowing if there would be a profit or
loss on the bargain; and to hear the cry 'Fourteen hundred' was to know that
a stranger had been spotted in the House, invariable leading to a vigorous,
even bruising 'rat-hunt'.
By 1893 there were over 3,000 members of the Stock Exchange, or 'Gorgonzola
Hall' as it was known to its inhabitants, on account of its distinctly
veined walls and pillars.
The markets were driven by rumours and counter-rumours creating a febrile
atmosphere. One piece of news that darkened the mood was when King Alexander
of Servia seized power in April though he was only 17. Markets slumped, and
one member was quoted as saying 'when the bit burst comes for the European
war, it will begin in just such a pottering way'.
That eastern storm lay ahead but for the workaday brokers and jobbers of the
Stock Exchange, the immediate problem was how to keep afloat until
confidence was restored and, above all, prosperity returned to the 'Kaffir
Circus' the name usually given to the South African mining market.
One such member was Hugh E M Stutfield, author at about this time of an
article entitled 'Celibacy and the Struggle to get on'.
Temperamentally, though, the City has always been a bull rather than a bear;
and at the end of 1893 the Financial News ran an anecdote attesting to that
incorrigibly optimistic streak, a story that might even have prompted a
smile from the editor of the FN's upstart pink rival: 'Overheard outside the
Stock Exchange. Hungry Broker (scenting a possible Pounds 12 10s): 'Do you
want to make a bit over the new year? Buy yourself 500 Milwaukees.' Client:
'But I was just thinking of selling 500'. Hungry Broker (eagerly): 'Well,
not so bad either]'.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: The Lex Column - Infallible guide to
the 20th century
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At this time of year, we normally offer our readers a selection of stocks
which might prosper in the next 12 months. This year, prompted by a period
of holiday reflection, we hazard some general thoughts on how the markets
might develop in the longer run. Peering into the 20th century, we believe
that as methods of manufacture improve and market activity increases, the
joint stock company is bound to occupy a larger place in the nation's
economy. It also seems to us that the fashion for amalgamation, which has
already swept together some of the most venerable names in British commerce,
has further to run.
Thus, it is difficult to believe that the brewing industry will long remain
in so many hands. The most celebrated, such as Guinness, Bass and Whitbread,
have a long history. But the nation can scarcely support them all. It would
seem sensible for the two Scotch brewers, McEwan and Younger, to form common
cause. They could even combine with their southern neighbour, Newcastle
Breweries. As for local brewers such as Boddingtons, their continued
independence is scarcely to be hoped for.
Among the banks, there seems less scope for combination. It is hard to
imagine proud institutions like London &amp; Midland or London &amp; Westminster
submitting to a change of name. As with the brewers, though, there might be
a case for Scotch banks combining. There seems little point in the small
Caledonian population maintaining a Bank of Scotland and a Royal Bank of
Scotland.
This brings us to most daring of our speculations: that there might be
amalgamation among railway stocks. Such is their importance to the markets
that it is hard to conceive of losing famous names like the Hull &amp; Barnsley
or the North Staffordshire. But a degree of merger may prove advantageous.
It might even be possible to merge the Brighton with the Chatham &amp; Dover, or
the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire with the Sheffield.
But one prediction may be ventured with some confidence. Great industrial
enterprises such as Babcock or Vickers, J &amp; P Coats or Nettlefold may come
and go. One can even picture life without P &amp; O Navigation or the Savoy
Hotel. But whatever happens, the railways will remain the commercial
backbone of the country and the safest repository for the prudent investor's
savings. With that thought, a happy and prosperous New Year to all our
readers.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Letter From Moscow: Russia's 'loadsaroubles'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At one of Russia's first private primary schools, children sing in English
and receive miniature dollar bills as a reward for good behaviour. At the
state kindergarten from which it leases its premises, teachers provide
no-frills education for a fifth of the salary paid their 'capitalist'
counterparts.
As Russia has lurched towards a market economy over the past year, open
inequality has begun replacing the hidden privileges of the old elite. Some
of the trappings of capitalism - as depicted by Communist propaganda - have
also been introduced. Half-naked women dance in cages at one of Moscow's new
nightclubs, while old people impoverished by price liberalisation can be
seen fishing through rubbish bins.
The main beneficiaries of the reforms, which have made goods and services
available to anybody who can afford them, are Russia's new rich. Their
hallmarks are expensive foreign cars, frequent foreign travel and several
garishly furnished homes. Thanks to legislation and a change in public
attitudes towards private business, members of this exclusive club, who have
made fortunes over the past few years trading everything from raw materials
to consumer goods, are now in the public eye.
Despite the advantages of wealth, the new rich say life remains tough. Mr
Kakha Bendukidze, a roly-poly Georgian who runs everything from an oil
investment fund to the largest private merchant fleet in the former Soviet
Union, admits he is still embarrassed by his wealth - and loath to spend it
on himself.
'When I spend one dollar on myself, it is just one dollar. When I invest it,
it becomes two dollars,' says this former molecular biologist, sitting in a
chaotic office graced only by a small bronze sculpture. Wearing a
light-green cashmere sweater, beige trousers and Hush-Puppies, he resembles
his wealthy peers in the west.
Another member of Russia's new rich is Mr Pavel Dudnikov, a 'child of the
street' who made his fortune from a sprawling network of slot machines and
video games and now has the General Motors distributorship to sell Cadillacs
across the country. He says he has not even had time to move his family out
of a two-room apartment.
'All my life is work because of the circumstances we are doing everything
in. There's no normal legislation, no normal infrastructure and no banks
worthy of the name,' says this gold-toothed former worker as he toys with a
lighter and puffs American cigarettes.
He is delighted, however, by Russia's appetite for Cadillacs. He claims
hundreds of cars, including a few Dollars 300,000 limousines of the variety
which ferry around US presidents, have been sold since he started up Trinity
Motors with a US partner last May.
Other new rich, who also plead a taxing schedule, have less trouble spending
their money. When his wife gave birth at an exclusive London hospital, Mr
Vladimir Gusinsky, head of the Most (Bridge) Group which makes most of its
money from Moscow real estate deals, booked airline tickets every weekend
for five months so that he could visit her. Now he faces the dilemma of
deciding whether or not to send his eldest son to school abroad, perhaps in
England.
While his favourite car is a BMW, he has a dozen cars to choose from, a flat
in Chelsea, a house in Portugal, and a few homes scattered around Russia
(like most Russian rich seeking to minimise their tax bill, all the property
he has access to is registered as belonging to his company). The family
doctor is in Harley Street.
But what he fears most are 'hooligans': a team of 18 bodyguards takes turns
protecting him and his family around the clock. A private security force of
450 men guards the building site and offices of his company, whose annual
turnover he puts at Rbs100bn (Pounds 155m).
Nobody knows how many rich there are in Russia or where the dividing line
between crime and business lies. Mr Bendukidze breaks them into three
categories: 'Bureaucrats who live off their jobs by taking bribes,
entrepreneurs who live off their wits, and criminals who live off violence.'
He has no doubts his own entrepreneurial category is the most worthwhile.
'I would not hire most directors of state-owned enterprises to wipe the
floor,' he says. He says the only solution to the country's economic woes is
the total privatisation of the state-owned economy to make room for new
managers - in short 'the Georgian money-bags' so feared by the old-style
'bureaucrats' who run most Russian businesses.
Although they felt insulted by the new prime minister, Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, when he announced that Russia should have a market and not a
bazaar, the new rich believe they are now strong enough to withstand any
attempt to crush Russia's nascent capitalism. (In case of a state backlash,
most have money in foreign bank accounts.)
'Being wealthy gives you the power to say no to bureaucrats,' says the
40-year-old Gusinsky, who graduated as a theatre director but whose only
production has been a dazzling financial empire which, like most Russian
businesses, is closed to the scrutiny of outsiders.
Mr Konstantin Borovoi, who spearheaded the development of Russia's commodity
exchanges, has set up his own Economic Freedom party to defend
entrepreneurial interests. 'I don't get pleasure out of this party. I set it
up because we need it,' says this former mathematician who, with typical
extravagance, says he would shoot himself if the Communists returned to
power.
Others, like Gusinsky, prefer to influence events from behind the scenes. He
suggested, for instance, that he would be providing cash to finance support
for President Boris Yeltsin's April 11 referendum on a new constitution -
including the crucial issue of private land ownership.
But his greatest concern is the number of his colleagues who have no trust
in the future. Many of them are taking their money and settling abroad.
'Every time a man who can make money leaves Russia, it is a tragedy for the
country.'

FT  04 JAN 93 / Citizens corps to the rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President-elect Bill Clinton is an unswerving advocate of voluntary national
service. He says he feels 'passionate' about the idea and recently told
congressional leaders it would rank alongside deficit reduction and
healthcare reform as one of the top legislative priorities of his first
term.
The phrase national service may cause confusion in Britain. Rest assured, Mr
Clinton is not a soulmate of the blimpish retired colonels who favour
conscription as a means of 'knocking sense' into unruly teenagers. The
service Mr Clinton has in mind would be civilian and voluntary. He wants to
give young people an opportunity to finance higher education by doing
community work.
As such, national service would be an amalgam of two of the US's most
admired social programmes: the GI bill which put a generation of second
world war veterans through college, in the process creating one of the
world's best-educated workforces; and John F Kennedy's Peace Corps, which
fired the idealism of a subsequent generation of college graduates by
encouraging many to do voluntary service in the third world.
The scheme is appealing because it offers some hope of alleviating several
intractable problems. The financial strain of putting children through
college is one of the biggest anxieties of the middle-income families who
supported Mr Clinton in November. Few students from such families qualify
for federal subsidies which anyway now fall well short of the spiralling
cost of college tuition. National service offers a novel means of paying for
college - or vocational training - without getting horribly into debt. And,
like the original GI bill, such an easing of access to post-secondary
education would raise the quality of the future workforce and hence improve
US competitiveness.
Equally important for enthusiasts, it is a way of fighting urban decay and
tackling acute social problems. Imagine the effect of mobilising hundreds of
thousands of energetic school leavers to rebuild slums, clear refuse, feed
and house the homeless, provide care for the elderly, serve as assistants to
nurses, police officers and social workers and so forth. If 500,000
youngsters a year enrolled in this kind of 'citizens corps' - a not
unreasonable number - a transformation of inner-city life might become
feasible. The young could literally help rebuild America.
But the potential benefits do not stop here. In its recent book Mandate for
Change, the Progressive Policy Institute (a thinktank close to Mr Clinton)
advocates national service as a 'democratising and integrating force in an
increasingly Balkanised nation'. It envisages a citizens corps as a 'common
civic endeavour for youths of all backgrounds, who would meet on terms of
strict civic equality'. It would be a way of emphasising that the rights of
citizenship carry reciprocal responsibilities and thus of forging a new and
more productive relationship between government and the individual. It would
also allow youngsters to mature physically and emotionally and thus derive
greater benefits from higher or technical education.
Finally a citizens corps could serve a useful role in cushioning the
military 'downsizing' following the end of the cold war. It is widely
recognised that the US armed services have done a better job of training
young people and overcoming racial tensions than most private employers. Yet
military recruitment is set to fall by more than a third in coming years.
Why allow all this expertise to go to waste? Much of the talent in the armed
forces could surely be redirected to train youngsters to tackle US domestic
problems.
As with any innovative idea, there are potential snags. The most obvious is
the cost. Enrollees would receive a subsistence income (say Dollars 5,000 a
year) plus vouchers towards the cost of college. To be worthwhile, the
vouchers would have to cover most of the tuition costs at a public
university, which is currently about Dollars 20,000 over four years. If
enrollees earned Dollars 10,000 in vouchers for each year of national
service, the per capita cost would be Dollars 15,000 a year without allowing
for the costs of running the projects. The annual cost of a 500,000-strong
citizens corps could easily run to Dollars 15bn, three times the Dollars 5bn
annual cost of the current loan programme which caters for 3.7m borrowers.
However, this would still be just 5 per cent of the annual defence budget.
It would not be easy to design demanding national service programmes for
talented school leavers nor to ensure that enrollees came from all social
classes. Indeed unless colleges were given a financial incentive to seek
national service graduates, the poor and minorities would be
over-represented, as they are in the armed forces. The entry into the labour
force of large numbers of young volunteers on subsistence wages could also
be disruptive, upsetting established workers who might feel their worth had
been diminished. There are also philosophical doubts: should the young be
made to feel they have an obligation to 'serve' the state?
Such objections have to be taken seriously and will probably ensure that a
national service corps is built up far more slowly than Mr Clinton would
wish. But national service seems to be an idea whose time has come. It could
prove one of the defining achievements of Mr Clinton's presidency.

We Germans have particular reason to be thankful for European integration.
Our experience provides us with a powerful incentive for the future. After
the ending of the cold war and the reunification of Germany, we remain
resolutely committed to continuing the process of European unification.
We have more neighbours than any other country in Europe. So we have a
fundamental national interest in creating a European Union to which, one
day, all our neighbours will belong.
Within western Europe, the European Community has played a decisive role in
helping overcome traditional rivalries and policies of national egoism.
In this part of the continent, war has become impossible. We are now
enjoying the longest period of peace since the mid-19th century. The second
world war broke out 21 years after the first; and this came 43 years after
the Franco-Prussian war and the foundation of the German Reich. We are now
in the 48th continuous year of peace, in the certain knowledge that this
state of affairs will continue. We share with all Europeans the fundamental
concern that national interests should never again spark off armed conflict.
Despite all these reasons for optimism, I doubt whether the evil spirits of
the past, which have brought us Europeans so much suffering this century,
have really been banished for good.
No one should be under the illusion that the spectre of European nationalism
has been finally laid to rest, or that this ugly apparition is confined only
to the Balkans. In many parts of the east of our continent, we are starting
to see a return of nationalist thinking, of intolerance and even chauvinism.
Even western Europe is not immune to such temptations. I feel myself carried
back to an ill-fated past when I hear some people stirring up public
sentiment with the argument that Germany has become too large and too
powerful, and therefore needs to be 'contained' by means of coalitions. It
is a cruel irony that this kind of talk plays into the hands of precisely
those forces, not least in Germany, which propagate old-style nationalism.
However, the lessons of the past, and Germany's particular geographical
position, represent simply one side of the story. We all need European Union
to master the great challenges of today and tomorrow.
Only if Europe pools its energies and speaks with one voice can it bring its
weight to bear in a fitting manner. Europe can hold its own in worldwide
competition with Japan and North America only if it acts as one.
Particularly for great export nations like Germany and Britain, this is of
the utmost importance.
Following the end of the east-west conflict, Germany and the rest of Europe
are facing fresh challenges. The upheaval in central, eastern and
south-eastern Europe has brought great risks and uncertainties.
Because of this, Europe as a whole, more than ever before, needs a firm and
secure anchor. Only a strong European Community can fulfil this role. The
Maastricht treaty represents, not least, our combined answer to the new
situation in Europe. With it, we are facing up to our responsibilities for
the future of the entire continent.
I know that the far-reaching changes in Europe during the past few years
have unsettled many people, in Germany and elsewhere. They wonder whether
the pace of change has been too fast; whether the Maastricht treaty came too
soon, and in too ambitious a form.
My answer to these doubters is this: can we afford to go more slowly? We
Germans have already seen, in reunifying our country, the crucial importance
of seizing a unique opportunity with energy and enterprise. The same spirit
must guide us now in the task of achieving European unity.
That was why it was so important that at the recent Edinburgh summit, under
the presidency of UK Prime Minister John Major, the leaders of the European
Community expressed their sympathy for Denmark's special reservations, but
decided not to change the Maastricht treaty. Reopening negotiations was not,
and is not, on our agenda.
In Edinburgh we therefore could go no further than to clarify the relevant
treaty clauses to respond to the main Danish concerns. This purely
declaratory 'decision' neither changes nor complements the treaty, and
therefore does not require ratification by member states.
I believe that, as a result, the way is now clear for the Danes to hold a
new referendum this spring. We all want the EC to develop further as a
Community of the 12. I am against the idea of a two- or three-speed Europe.
But I would add just as clearly that, in view of the importance of European
Union for us Germans, we cannot accept that the speed of European
integration will be dictated by the slowest ship in the convoy.
From time to time, we hear objections that the Maastricht treaty does not
give a clear enough picture of what tomorrow's Europe should actually look
like.
This was not, however, the aim of the treaty, nor could it be. Maastricht
was an interim step, albeit an important one, on the road to European Union.
The parts of the treaty dealing with political union are just as important
as those concerning economic and monetary union. Everyone in Europe must
realise that we can preserve all our economic achievements only if we also
secure them politically. An economic union will survive only if it is based
on a political union.
The Maastricht treaty is not only fundamentally important for the EC itself.
It also sends a signal of hope beyond the borders of today's Community. On
the basis of Maastricht, the EC at Edinburgh decided to start entry
negotiations with Austria, Sweden and Finland at the beginning of this year.
With Norway, talks are expected to get under way in March. Our aim is to
complete these talks as quickly as possible, so that these countries can
join the EC in 1995.
However, the Poles and Hungarians, the Czechs and Slovaks, and many other
peoples and nations in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe, place
their hopes in the European Community. We must not disappoint them. Beyond
this, another important task is to forge close and trusting relations
between the European Community and the states of the former Soviet Union.
We must do all we can to shape European policy in such a manner that people
can identify with it more easily. They must be able to sense that we are
building a Europe not of bureaucrats and technocrats, removed from the
people, but one which is working in the people's interests.
This must also be a key principle for the single market, which took effect
on January 1. In Edinburgh we adopted guidelines and criteria for applying
the principle of subsidiarity - making decisions as close as possible to the
people. And we also took concrete steps to review existing regulations, and
to revoke those which clearly contradict the subsidiarity principle.
For this purpose the Commission has drawn up an initial list, by no means
exhaustive, which is included in the European Council's conclusions. Dealing
with this list will be a prime task for the Commission and Council in the
first half of 1993.
We have thus made a start in reversing what is popularly seen as the EC's
'regulatory mania'. Of course, the fault does not lie only with 'Brussels'.
National governments and authorities must accept their duty to become more
responsive to their citizens' needs, and not simply to pass on unpleasant
matters to the Community. Much public irritation is caused by European
regulations which are really the result of national initiatives - often for
economic reasons, to protect national interests.
Here we must recognise that errors have been made in the past, and make the
necessary adjustments. Cases such as these, where in accord with the
principle of subsidiarity Community action is not necessary, can offer some
overall lessons for our journey towards a Europe which will be stronger,
more prosperous and more stable for all of us - in the east and the west.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Watching the franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN EXCHANGE and money market dealing will pick up today after the
Christmas and New Year break, and many dealers are wondering whether the
much-heralded speculative attack on the Irish punt and French franc will
take place, writes James Blitz.
The pressure on both currencies comes mainly from the D-Mark's high
short-term interest rates. Compounding this are fears that both currencies
must be devalued if French and Irish exporters are not to lose out from the
competitive devaluations last year of sterling, the lira, the peseta and
escudo.
Political difficulties in both Paris and Dublin add to the pressures.
However, over the Christmas period, the slide of both currencies inside the
Exchange Rate Mechanism was checked, because of renewed expectations that
the Bundesbank might cut interest rates soon.
The franc has spent much of the last 10 days above the FFr3.40 level against
the D-Mark. Cash rates in the Irish punt market dropped down to around 14
per cent on New Year's eve, although the currency remained near the bottom
of its ERM band against the Belgian franc.
The market's main focus this week will therefore be on the Bundesbank's
weekly securities repurchase tender on Wednesday, and the council meeting
the following day.
Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Global Markets in London,
believes that any expectations of an easing in money market or official
rates this week are sure to be dashed. German call money ended the year well
above the 8.75 percent repo rate, making an easing unlikely there.
She also believes that the Bundesbank will await the outcome of the German
public sector wage talks in which public sector employers will aim to keep
wage rises to between 3.0 and 3.25 per cent.
Miss Cottrell believes that the Bundesbank meeting of February 18th is the
one to watch.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Malaysian rail development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR WOODROW INTERNATIONAL and AEG WESTINGHOUSE TRANSPORT SYSTEME GmbH
have secured authority from the Malaysian government to proceed with a
project to promote a light rail transit system for Kuala Lumpur.
The project, running 12 kilometres between Ampang, on the eastern outskirts
of the city, and Jalan Sultan Ismail in the city centre, is to be privately
funded through a combination of equity and loans.
To raise the required finance for the Pounds 300m system, the two companies,
operating in consortium, have formed an operating company STAR (Sistem
Transit Aliran Ringan), which has entered a franchise agreement with the
Malaysian government to raise investment capital for developing Phase 1.
The consortium formed the STAR company around a year ago to own and operate
the LRT system within the terms of the franchise agreement.
The other principal organisation involved in the project is the Kuala Lumpur
Transit Group Sdn Bhd (KLTG), owned equally by TWI and AEG, which has
entered into contract with STAR to undertake the design, engineering,
construction, delivery, installation and testing of the LRT system.
Discussions are now taking place with various financial institutions in
Malaysia. Once funding is secured, work on the 34-month construction
programme is expected to start next spring.
About a quarter of the total project value is expected to come from
shareholdings and the remainder from loan facilities, including a Malaysian
government support loan.
The project represents the first phase of an integrated light rail network
for Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas, reflecting the urgent need for a
modern, reliable and convenient non-road based public transport system to
overcome the congestion caused by the rapid growth in motor traffic over
recent years.
The proposed route will serve the urban and suburban commuter Phase 1 areas
of Ampang, Cheras, Petaling Jaya and Kepong.
The total estimated project cost includes a fixed-price contract with KLTG
of some 950m ringgits (Pounds 245m), subject to final terms and conditions.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Japanese Government Bonds: Fiscal packages likely to deliver
moderate recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the Japanese economy in a weak state, the Bank of Japan is expected to
allow a further easing in interest rates early in 1993.
However, with the government's Y10,700bn fiscal package and the possibility
of a package later in the year, economists expect a moderate recovery during
1993. The combination of renewed growth and heavy corporate bond issuance
could help to drive Japanese government bond yields higher by the year-end.
Many economic forecasters expect a steepening of the Japanese yield curve,
with the shorter end of the market out-performing the long end.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew warns that the rally in long-dated Japanese government
bonds is ending, and that the time has arrived to take profits and
concentrate holdings at the short end of the market.
'Ten-year yields are at their cyclical bottom and will now trend upwards,'
said the firm. It is forecasting an annual rate of return of 3.2 per cent
for two-year bonds to June 1993, whereas it predicts a decline in return of
4.3 per cent for 10-year bonds.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew ranks as one of the more bearish securities houses when
it comes to the prospects for the Japanese government bond market. At the
opposite
The bond yield curves for France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US have
been compiled from several sources.
The existing bond yields curves were supplied by S. G. Warburg Securities.
The forecast yield curves are based on the average of forecasts supplied by
the following houses: BZW, Deutsche Bank, DKB International, Goldman Sachs,
Midland Montagu, Nomura Research Institute, S. G. Warburg Securities and UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
extreme is DKB International, which expects further falls in Japanese rates
and in bond yields over the next year.
The combination of concern about the weak state of the economy, the fragile
stock market, falling inflation and the decline in confidence, has prompted
a steady easing in interest rates by the Bank of Japan over the last 18
months.
Since the middle of 1991, the overnight call rate has dropped from 8.25 per
cent to 3.9 per cent, while the official discount rate has been steadily cut
from 6 per cent to its current level of 3.25 per cent.
Although the bond market has discounted a lot of the poor economic news, as
well as another interest rate cut, some economists point out that the
domestic background remains favourable for bonds, given the weak growth
prospects and continued fall in inflation. Consumer demand remains weak and
the stock market continues to look vulnerable.
DKB International expects the overnight call rate to fall even lower -
reaching 3.5 per cent in the first quarter and 3.0 per cent in the second
quarter. It forecasts two more cuts in the official discount rate - to 2.75
per cent in the first quarter and to 2.25 per cent in the second quarter,
the level at which it is expected to remain in the second half of the year.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said this scenario
favours the shorter end but added that long bond yields should continue to
fall, reaching their low point in the middle of 1993.

FT  04 JAN 93 / UK Gilts: Consensus points to increased inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION will be the key indicator for the gilt market over the next 12
months.
While there is a range of views about how prices will change in the UK
economy during 1993, the consensus is that inflation will emerge as a bigger
problem than last year and may push up gilt yields.
Another worry for gilt investors will be the large volume of issues from the
Bank of England in the 1993-94 financial year, a factor likely to hold back
price rises. The prospects for gilts are tied to the degree to which the UK
economy picks up from its longest recession since the 1930s.
Any expansion which is more than languid would re-ignite inflationary
pressures - which are subdued - reducing the prospects for further cuts in
interest rates, and depressing gilt prices.
Most economists envisage a slow upturn in 1993, with growth of about 1 per
cent. However, this judgment is clouded by uncertainty, especially as this
time last year many expected a sharp recovery in 1992, not the fall in GDP
that took place.
During 1992, many gilt investors saw substantial gains. Price rises were
particularly marked at the short end of the yield curve, partly due to weak
inflation. Another factor was the 3 percentage point cut in base rates
between sterling's devaluation on September 16 and the end of November.
From nearly 10 per cent at the start of the year, yields for five-year gilts
fell to just over 7 per cent by the end of December. This fall of nearly 300
basis points brought a corresponding increase in prices. But it was only
partly replicated at the long end of the yield curve. Here yields for
20-year bonds fell from about 9.5 per cent to under 9 per cent.
The overall rise in gilt prices during the year - which saw the yield curve
change dramatically from being downward sloping in January to upward sloping
in December - was helped by investors switching more funds away from
recession-hit equities and into government bonds.
Price changes in the economy, as measured by the year-on-year change in the
retail prices index, stood at just 3 per cent in November, the lowest figure
for six years. According to a Financial Times survey of 38 forecasting
groups published just before Christmas, inflationary forces are likely to
grow significantly by the end of 1993. The consensus was that RPI inflation
by the final quarter would work out at 4.1 per cent.
However, there remains considerable disagreement about the outlook for
inflation. Mr John Shepperd, of S. G. Warburg Securities, is among the
pessimists. He predicts that rising inflationary forces will limit
reductions in base rates to just one further cut of 1 percentage point -
bringing base rates to 6 per cent - by the time of the March Budget.
Mr Shepperd believes that as a result long-dated gilt yields will climb
during the year to about 9.75 per cent, with little change in yields for
short-dated securities.
Mr Roger Bootle of Greenwell Montagu is much more sanguine. He forecasts
that RPI inflation will be just 1.75 per cent by the end of the year.
Consequently, he believes long-dated gilt yields will continue to come down,
to below 8 per cent by December, while yields for short-maturing bonds will
drop below 6 per cent.
Whatever happens to the economy during 1993, the PSBR is almost certain to
increase. That will happen as growth in tax income remains subdued, and
social security and unemployment payments stay high. According to the FT
survey of forecasts, the PSBR in 1993-94 is likely to reach Pounds 46.9bn,
up from an expected Pounds 38.2bn in 1992-93. This would require about
Pounds 50bn of gilt issues during 1993-94 - or some Pounds 1bn a week.

FT  04 JAN 93 / US Money and Credit: Economists look in vain for the
spectacular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it, 1993 looks as though it could be a tough year for the US
bond market, a year of rising interest rates, revived inflation and a
widening federal budget deficit.
This is the pessimists' view. Recent figures suggest that the anaemic
economic recovery may finally be picking up pace, something which could
quickly feed through into higher interest rates and higher inflation.
Moreover, a Democrat is heading for the White House, a Democrat who has
promised to cut middle-class taxes and increase government spending, while
offering little in the way of a credible policy to reduce the government
deficit.
If all this is true, then why are some of Wall Street's most respected
economists predicting that bond market prices will rise and long-term yields
fall this year?
Although there is no real consensus among economists about what will happen
to the economy in 1993, on balance economists seem more confident predicting
that long rates will stay at or drop lower than their current levels of 7.3
per cent, than they do about warning of higher rates.
Those forecasting lower rates - the most bullish predicts the yield on the
long bond will drop to 6.5 per cent by the middle of next year - are pinning
their hopes on sluggish economic growth in the first half.
They believe the rise in economic activity seen since the third quarter of
1992 will be a bout of unsustainable post-election euphoria. They point out
that incomes remain depressed, that the labour market has shown few signs of
recovering from the recession, and that consumers remain debt-averse, all of
which should act as a drag on economic growth. Recessionary conditions in
overseas economies are expected to hold back US growth.
The optimists believe that inflation, the long bond's greatest enemy, looks
soundly beaten, for now. Nothing in the most recent prices data suggested
that the long-established disinflationary trend would be reversed soon.
Commodity and oil prices are likely to remain low. Productivity will
continue to improve, which with the lack of real job and income growth, will
depress the rate of price rises.
The final piece in the puzzle is politics. In the latter stages of last
year's election campaign, bond prices dropped sharply and yields jumped on
fears that President Clinton would introduce an aggressive fiscal stimulus
package that would widen the deficit and lead to an overheated,
inflation-plagued economy.
However, since his victory, Mr Clinton has softened the tone of his
growth-oriented campaign policy pledges, partly because he has faced up to
the political realities of a large budget deficit, and partly because he has
been encouraged by the improvement in economic conditions.
If growth does remain weak, inflation and domestic interest rates low, and
President Clinton introduces only modestly stimulative fiscal policies, and
especially if German interest rates finally begin to come down, then the
forecast of long-term bond yields at or below 7 per cent does not look
overly optimistic.
However, for every bull, there is a bear, and economists do not have to be
especially bearish to warn that rates could begin to pick up in the second
half of this year. On the economic front, growth could improve if the labour
market responds to fiscal stimuli aimed at creating jobs - which Mr Clinton
insists remains his biggest priority.
As Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities in New York,
said: 'Somehow, somewhere there's going to be stronger growth, and that
flies in the face of expectations that interest rates will go down a lot
more.'
Whoever is right or wrong, the bond market is unlikely to do anything
spectacular this year. Economic growth in 1992 will probably end at about 3
per cent, and a recent survey of Wall Street forecasts for 1993 showed that
economists expect growth this year to be between 2.7 per cent and 3.2 per
cent. Hardly the recipe for bond market madness.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Ecu Bonds: Hopes for European monetary union fail to live up
to their promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN champions of the European currency unit are sounding a diffident note
in their claims for the Ecu bond market in 1993.
Above all, the market needs some proof that the process of European monetary
union is back on track, according to Mr David Ovenden, Ecu product manager
at J. P. Morgan Securities in London.
While most traders are expecting an improvement on last year, few are
nursing hopes that the market will regain the impetus of recent years, when
its potential status as Europe's main bond market and the promise of
seemingly limitless liquidity, attracted a large flow of institutional
investment.
It is widely agreed that the sweeping assumptions made about the likelihood
of European monetary union pushed the market too far ahead of events, while
competition for market share among financial intermediaries created an
artificially high level of liquidity.
The market's adjustment to Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty last
June and the subsequent turmoil within the exchange rate mechanism, caused
heavy losses for investors and market participants, and a decline in
liquidity, from which the market has not recovered.
There are a number of issues of political concern to be settled, chief among
them the need to accommodate Denmark following its rejection of the treaty
and the failure of Denmark and the UK to ratify the treaty. If the treaty
had been ratified by all 12 countries, the Ecu would have been frozen.
Without that, there is a risk of recomposition in September 1994. Without
ratification, many analysts believe that some form of monetary union will go
ahead. 'I would still hang on to the belief that a group of currencies will
move closer together . . . and that will require a currency other than the
D-Mark,' said Mr Kit Juckes, an international economist at S. G. Warburg.
Given this outlook, the Ecu market does offer 'an option on European unity,
but it's not yet a desperately cheap one'.
Other analysts take a more positive view. According to Credit Lyonnais, at
current yield levels, 'Ecu bonds do not discount the possibility of the Ecu
becoming the single European currency in any future monetary union. A
problematic, delayed ratification process for the UK and Denmark is already
discounted'. While the probability of two-speed monetary union has
increased, this need not be negative for the Ecu, says Credit Lyonnais.
While the crux of the market's problems lies on the demand side, the supply
side is a cause for concern. The market's success in attracting
institutional investors has been due in large part to the enthusiastic
sponsorship of a number of European governments, which have set up
programmes for issuing Ecu paper, even when terms were not always
favourable.
Last year's political problems over the ratification of the Maastricht
treaty have caused a number of European governments to tone down their
commitment to the Ecu. However, with many European governments facing
growing financing needs as a result of the economic slowdown, they could
welcome the chance to return to the Ecu market.
Dealers are hoping that medium-sized deals for the likes of the UK, France,
the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development in the early part of the year may help to stir investor
interest.
The change in the structure of the market is unlikely to be reversed, at
least in the short-term. The market was vaunted as offering similar or
better liquidity than Europe's largest government bond markets. The largest
Ecu bonds were among the most actively traded bonds, and the commissions
charged were lower than in many other markets.
However, after the market's meltdown it became evident that much of that
liquidity had been created not by investors but by traders.
Mr Ovenden argues that investors in the large, high-quality bonds are still
being serviced, although liquidity in smaller bonds for weaker credits has
suffered. However, without the aggressive speculative activity by investment
banks and securities houses trading on their own accounts, which is believed
to have made up as much as 70 per cent of the market's turnover, the level
of liquidity is likely to remain poor.
At a meeting last month of ISMA's Ecu sub-committee, it was decided that it
was too early to revert to a traditional style of marketmaking with
compulsory bid/offer spreads.
Without more confidence in the market's long-term liquidity, institutional
investors, having been badly burnt, are unlikely to rush back to the market.
Dealers say there are signs that some institutional investors are returning
to the market, but Ecu bonds are viewed as a specialised investment, rather
than an alternative to government bonds.

FT  04 JAN 93 / European Government Bonds: Traders look for cuts in German
rates to restore optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year promises to be a relatively favourable one for world bond markets,
given the likelihood that it will see continued weak economic growth,
subdued inflationary pressures and the prospect of low or falling interest
rates in many of the world economies.
Last year saw a continued fall in interest rates in the US, Japan, and the
UK - particularly once sterling broke free of the constraints of the
European exchange rate mechanism - while German interest rates remained
stubbornly high, forcing other European economies to keep their domestic
interest rates at relatively high levels.
However, most economists expect to see an easing in German interest rates
this year once its inflation shows some sign of coming under control, and
this should pave the way for rate cuts across much of continental Europe.
The D-Mark bloc bond markets were among the top performers in 1992 in local
currency terms. With Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty in its
referendum on June 2 1992, investors feared the No vote had spelt an end to
European economic and monetary union and to the convergence of inflation
rates and interest rates across Europe.
The weaker members of the ERM came under intense speculative pressure. Some
buckled under the strain, with Spain choosing to devalue within the
mechanism. Others were forced to float freely - namely sterling and the
Italian lira, both of which remain outside the ERM. On the outskirts of
Europe, countries such as Finland, Sweden and Norway - which are not ERM
members but had pegged their currencies to the Ecu - found the strain too
severe and were forced to sever the links.
Investors stampeded out of the higher-yielding bond markets such as Spain
and Italy, and into the safe haven of the D-Mark bloc where they hoped to
benefit eventually from falling interest rates. As a result of strong buying
of the D-Mark bloc, returns from these bond markets were high in local
currency terms. Dutch government bonds gave a return of 15.7 per cent,
according to J. P. Morgan, while Belgian bonds gained 13.87 per cent and
German bunds rose 13.01 per cent in 1992.
Following the reunification of Germany, the Bundesbank was forced to tighten
monetary policy to try to curb rising inflation. German rates have reached
historically high levels: the discount rate peaked at 8.75 per cent while
the Lombard rate reached 9.75 per cent.
However, while the Bundesbank allowed a small easing - with the discount
rate cut half a point to 8.25 per cent and the Lombard rate snipped 25 basis
points to 9.50 per cent in September 1992 - the German central bank has
repeatedly stressed its commitment to conquering inflation before further
cuts can be allowed.
'Despite clear evidence of a recession, the Bundesbank remains concerned
about domestic inflationary pressures,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief
economist at DKB International. He forecast a 0.9 per cent fall in German
GNP in 1993. 'Although west German inflation is stubbornly high, the
Bundesbank has been remarkably successful at containing the inflationary
cost of unification. The Bundesbank is unlikely to lower rates prematurely;
instead it will remain cautious and lower rates only when it believes
inflation has fallen,' he said.
As a result, the prospects for the long end of the bund market remain
attractive, 'primarily because the anti-inflationary credibility of the
Bundesbank more than offsets any negative impact from the persistent budget
deficit and stubbornly high consumer prices,' claims DKB International.
The Bundesbank raised its money supply target for 1993 to 4.5 per cent to
6.5 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in 1992, at the end
of last year. Money supply growth has overshot the bank's target range with
the speculative attacks within the ERM helping to distort M3 growth towards
the end of 1992.
Mr Stefan Schneider, an economist with Nomura Research Institute, pointed
out that 'although the 1992 M3 target (of 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent) will
offer it some additional leeway, the Bundesbank will wait for further
moderation in the growth of bank lending which could materialise in the
first quarter as a result of weaker activity'.
Most of the economists polled by the Financial Times expect to see a fall in
German government bond yields by the end of 1993 as the Bundesbank allows an
easing in interest rates during the year. However, they do not all agree.
Goldman Sachs provides the most bearish forecasts, predicting two-year and
five-year bond yields of 7.2 per cent, and 10-year bund yields of 7.5 per
cent, while Nomura expects bund yields to be at the 7 per cent level in the
five-year and 10-year maturities.
Among the more optimistic forecasters are DKB International, Midland Montagu
and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Midland Montagu sees two-year yields at 6 per cent
by year-end, but forecasts 10-year yields of 7 per cent - just above the
average of the forecasts. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew predicts that German yields
will be 6.2 per cent for two-year notes, 6.3 per cent for five-year paper,
and 6.4 per cent for 10-year bonds.
Any easing by the Bundesbank should relieve some of the tensions within the
ERM and allow members to cut their domestic interest rates. Attention is
likely to focus on the French government bond market in particular. The
French franc managed to survive the intense speculative pressure seen during
the second half of 1992, and the government has repeatedly stressed its
commitment to closer monetary ties with Germany.
Many economists expect the franc to come under renewed pressure at the start
of this year, and views appear mixed on whether it can survive as a member
of the ERM without a devaluation. Some economists point out that France
enjoys such favourable economic fundamentals, with low inflation and a trade
surplus, that it could cut interest rates independently of the Bundesbank.
'However, fears of a devaluation suggest that investors will continue to
demand a premium on the franc. As a result, the Bank of France is unlikely
to act prematurely as it could undermine credibility and weaken the franc,'
said DKB International.
Nevertheless, economists do expect to see a drop in French government bond
yields by the end of 1993, with two-year bond yields ranging between 6.5 per
cent (according to Midland Montagu) and 7.4 per cent (Nomura Research
Institute), while 30-year yields are expected to be between 7.2 per cent
(UBS Phillips &amp; Drew) and 8.05 per cent (Deutsche Bank).

FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Wall Street double act goes solo
but the song remains the same - Stephen Friedman has lost his co-chairman at
Goldman Sachs but there will be no change in the firm's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rare Wall Street double act has just become a solo performance, though the
song seems likely to remain the same.
For the past two years Goldman Sachs, one of the leading and most profitable
New York investment banks, has been presided over by co-chairmen: Mr Stephen
Friedman and Mr Robert Rubin. It is a management structure unique among top
Wall Street firms, though it has been used twice by Goldman over the past
two decades.
However, last month Mr Rubin, one of the top Democratic party members on
Wall Street, left Goldman to become President-elect Bill Clinton's special
assistant on economic affairs, and Mr Friedman became sole chairman.
It is the end of an era for Goldman: the two men, whom colleagues say have a
remarkable rapport, had worked closely together in senior positions since
the mid-1980s.
They were appointed co-chief operating officers in 1987 and took over the
joint chairmanship at the end of 1990 when Mr John Weinberg, the previous
incumbent, stepped down from day-to-day management.
The change invites two questions: who is Mr Friedman, a man with a
reputation for shunning publicity? And will Mr Rubin's departure mean any
shift in Goldman's strategy?
On the latter point, Mr Friedman gives an emphatic no. In a memo to staff
when Mr Rubin's White House appointment was announced, he stressed that
'apart from normal evolution, you should not expect any departures from the
managerial or strategic courses we have been on'.
Central to that strategy is the continued expansion of Goldman as one of the
world's few strongly international investment banks, with important
operations in the US, Europe and Asia. 'We want to be a truly global firm,'
Mr Friedman says.
'That doesn't mean trying to imitate the local firms in each market we're
in, because unless we bring something different to the party, there's no
particular reason to use us.'
Aged 54, but looking younger, he is a slim, fit man who likes to run -
'exercise is the best relaxer I know' - and has a low-key manner but a
reputation for crisp yet thoughtful management.
With an ivy league education and a training in law - Cornell University and
the Columbia University Law School - he joined Goldman in 1966 and was
fortuitously thrust into the then small, but rapidly expanding world of the
takeover advisory work.
'When I joined the merger department we were primarily selling family-owned
or relatively small companies, but during the next few years we pioneered
many of the techniques now standard in the industry,' he recalls.
One of these was the defence of companies against bid raids, out of which
grew a reputation, which Goldman retains today, for not acting on behalf of
hostile takeovers.
Takeover work became a key feature of Goldman's growth in the 1970s and
1980s, allowing it to build up strong relationships with corporate clients:
there is nothing closer to the centre of power than advising a chief
executive on group strategy.
In the mid-1980s, the firm moved into the European take-over market with
considerable success, though its sometimes brash tactics in the British
market have irritated some local investment banking rivals.
Mr Friedman became co-head of Goldman's investment banking business in the
early 1980s and helped build up the firm's strength in equity underwriting,
where it now usually ranks first or second in the US league tables.
With Mr Rubin, he revamped the firm's fixed income department from 1985 to
1988, taking the un-Goldman-like step of bringing in fresh talent from
outside, including some from much brasher rival Salomon Brothers. After
that, he shook up the firm's information systems and operations areas.
All this has given him broad exposure to Goldman's businesses and firm views
on how to preserve the group's particular culture, with its strong emphasis
on collegial teamwork, at a time of rapid international growth.
'The business is becoming increasingly inter-departmental and intricate,' he
says. 'You must have very short lines of communication and you must avoid
debates about transfer pricing (between departments) and turf. An enormous
amount of our management efforts have been directed to maximising teamwork
in these areas.'
Roughly 30 per cent of Goldman's 7,000 employees work abroad and Mr Friedman
says he wants an increasing proportion of managerial staff to be local
nationals, though this will have to be achieved within the 'one-firm Goldman
Sachs culture'. It is a culture which has long placed great emphasis on the
primacy of relationships with corporate clients - and Mr Friedman's
conversation is peppered with references to this. However, some Wall Street
critics question whether in recent years Goldman has, like several
investment banking rivals, subtly shifted its focus towards greater trading
on the firm's own account.
Critics have accused Goldman of being slow to react to market changes.
Retorts Mr Friedman: 'I think historically that was a valid criticism, but
certainly not in recent years, since we have been at the forefront of
innovation. We're a dramatically different firm than we were then.'
He and Mr Rubin had no formal division of responsibilities, though they both
say the joint chairmanship worked well. 'It's an approach I would only
recommend for people who have extremely good chemistry and are secure in
themselves, so they are not keeping score about who won how many debates,'
says Mr Friedman.
Mr Rubin, with his work for the Democratic Party, tended to be seen as the
public face of Goldman and his partner as the private face.
However, Mr Friedman tended to spend the greater time of the two in
Washington lobbying on securities industry issues and he insists that 'in
terms of client relationships we criss-crossed the globe roughly equally'.
Nor will the departure of Mr Rubin mean any significant change in the way
the firm is run, with executive decisions bounced around its relatively
young, 11-member management committee.
'I will certainly miss Bob,' says Mr Friedman, 'but its not as if either of
us was the other person's only sounding board.'
