Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based cargo equipment and ferry group, beat its
earnings per share forecast with a 4 cent rise to Dollars 2.35 (165p) for
1992.
For the final quarter the earnings figure of 28 cents compared with previous
losses of 4 cents.
Total revenue for the year grew to Dollars 421m (Dollars 385m). Net income
of Dollars 39.8m (Dollars 32.7m) was aided by an increased contribution of
Dollars 33.3m (Dollars 25.5m) from marine container leasing.
Ferry and port income fell Dollars 4m to Dollars 16.2m. Leisure industries
incurred a loss, but this was offset by profits from foreign exchange
contracts and left profit from other activities of Dollars 400,000 (Dollars
4.9m).
The company said the results were about Dollars 1m greater than predicted
due to year-end accounting adjustments.

Mr Arnold Ziff, chairman of Town Centre Securities, the Leeds-based property

government policy regarding the rating of empty premises.
'This is probably the first time in history that any government has been so
stupid as to put a tax where there is no income.
'If the powers that be cannot realise the consequences of this iniquitous
tax . . . then there is little hope for the future of the building industry
in this country.'
Mr Ziff's statement accompanied the group's results for the six months to
December 31 which showed profits ahead 10 per cent to Pounds 3.65m (Pounds

The interim dividend goes up to 1.1p (1p), payable from earnings of 2.4p

Insulations Group to offset a further significant fall in construction
activity and hoist pre-tax profits by 95 per cent, from Pounds 1.51m to
Pounds 2.95m, in 1992.
Turnover of the group, which supplies insulation products and services for
energy conservation, was only slightly ahead at Pounds 133.5m (Pounds

increases in market share were recorded in all businesses.
Earnings rose from 3.7p to 7.9p, while an unchanged final dividend of 3.6p
makes a same-again total of 5.4p.
Bad debts, although 16 per cent below the 1991 level, remained high at over
1 per cent of sales. Gearing was slightly lower at 41 per cent (42 per
cent).

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Comet growth helps lift Kingfisher to
Pounds 205m - Retailer goes for volume with low prices on 500 products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR GEOFFREY Mulcahy, chairman of Kingfisher, yesterday committed the
retailing group - which owns B&amp;Q, Woolworth, Superdrug and Comet - to a
policy of everyday low prices as a way of enhancing earnings in the 'lower
growth 1990s.'
As a first step, B&amp;Q and Woolworth would be introducing permanently lower
prices on a range of 500 products this week.
This was not the beginning of an Easter price war, Mr Mulcahy said: 'A war
has a beginning and an end. This will just go on and on.'
However, the strategy implied that gross margins would have to fall.
Analysts welcomed the latest development in Kingfisher's strategy.
'Kingfisher is one of the few retailers which understands what discounting
is really about,' said Mr Paul Deacon of Goldman Sachs. 'It is about driving
volume . . . and has been proven with the US experience.'
Mr Mulcahy was announcing profits for the year to January 30, which showed a
5 per cent increase to Pounds 205m under the accounting standard FRS 3.
This was after a Pounds 26.4m write-down (Pounds 1.9m gain) on the
development portfolio, and a Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 11.4m) charge on the
disposal of group properties.
Under the old accounting standard, profits were depressed by a Pounds 23.5m
net exceptional charge - arising from the property write-down - from Pounds
228m to Pounds 211m.
Turnover rose to Pounds 3.55bn (Pounds 3.39bn).
The sharpest improvement came from the Comet chain, which sells electrical
goods. Operating profits rose from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 17.7m.
Like-for-like sales increased by 15 per cent.
Mr Mulcahy attributed Comet's growth to a refocusing away from the high
street to out-of-town centres, better management and an improved product
range.
B&amp;Q, suffered a 10 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds 81.1m on
increased sales. However, sales were 16.5 per cent ahead in the last two
months of the financial year, and the improvement in trading performance had
continued.
Woolworth improved by Pounds 6.4m at the operating level to Pounds 77.8m,
fuelled by strong contributions from computer games, toys, and kitchen
products.
Superdrug's profits were marginally higher at Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 34.6m).
The division was examining new markets following the success of retailing
discounted perfumes. Kingfisher was also beginning to look into introducing
pharmaceutical services in Superdrug, with two outlets already operating
pharmacies.
Finally, Mr Mulcahy said the planned merger with Darty, the French
electrical goods retailer, was due to be completed in June.
Darty shareholders would have 12 per cent of the enlarged group following
the transaction and the Pounds 313m rights issue launched by Kingfisher to
help fund the merger.
The final dividend is raised by 0.5p to 9.5p, for a total of 13.7p (13p).
Earnings per share fell from 35.2p to 31.3p. Under the new accounting
standard, earnings increased from 28.5p to 30.1p.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BSG increases to Pounds 12m and plans
Pounds 31m rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSG INTERNATIONAL, the motor components, vehicle distribution, childcare
products and aircraft interior equipment group, announced an 8 per cent
increase in profits for 1992 together with a 1-for-4 rights issue to raise
Pounds 31.4m to fund planned capital investment.
The pre-tax outcome was Pounds 12m, compared with Pounds 11.1m, helped by a
strong performance from its Australian component plants, healthy demand in
Germany and a recovery in its car leasing and Birmingham dealer operations
following rationalisation.
The rights issue, underwritten by Morgan Grenfell and brokered by Panmure
Gordon, is priced at 62p, a discount of 19.5 per cent to the overnight
market price of 77p.
Yesterday the shares closed at 70p.
The fund-raising comes against the background of capital spending plans for
1993 and 1994 of Pounds 34m.
Of this Pounds 12m will be spent on a mirror plant in the US and Pounds 7m
on a Vauxhall dealership in Manchester and the relocation of a Ford
dealership in Cheltenham.
Without a rights issue to fund expansion, 'gearing would have got out of
hand; we needed it for future growth,' said Mr Tom Cannon, managing
director. Gearing at the end of 1992 was 49 per cent. Proceeds of the rights
issue would have cut it at that time to 13.7 per cent.
Both BSG's capital expenditure and its research and development spending
have been sustained through the recession. R&amp;D costs, charged against
trading profits, will be no less this year than the Pounds 8.9m spent in
1992.
Turnover was Pounds 555.1m, down from Pounds 569.8m, reflecting
deterioration in trading in the final quarter, especially in the UK.
However, so far this year there has been a slight imrpovement in orders
across all sectors of the business, although Mr Cannon observed that
problems with margins remained at LA Rumbold, the aircraft interiors
company.
The final dividend is 2.5p, maintaining the total at 3.2p.
Although covered by earnings per share of 3.46p, against 3.32p, part of the
cost will come from reserves following discontinued business charges of
Pounds 1.9m taken below the line.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wehmiller expands to Pounds 3.21m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
REFLECTING improved operating margins, pre-tax profits moved ahead 42 per
cent at Barry Wehmiller International, the packaging equipment manufacturer,
in the half year to January 31.
Profits rose to Pounds 3.21m, compared to Pounds 2.25m, although turnover
increased by a more modest 8 per cent, rising from Pounds 35.7m to Pounds
38.6m.
Mr Stewart Brown, chief executive, said the vision division, which makes
bottle and package control scanners and the general packaging division had
produced some growth, particularly in North and South America.
However, he said that overall there was little sign of sustained upturn in
any of BWI's traditional markets
In the UK, continued slack demand for bottling and filling equipment from
the dairy industry, which has been undergoing restructuring, resulted in
reduced returns from the food division.
Earnings per share were up from 3.9p to 5p while the interim dividend is
unchanged at 2.4p.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Geest hit by banana surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE DEFLATION affecting fresh produce resulted in a 22 per cent fall in
Geest's pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks ended January 2.
Profits at the fresh produce and prepared foods group fell from Pounds 26.2m
to Pounds 20.4m on lower sales of Pounds 625m (Pounds 626.3m). Trading
profits from fresh produce fell from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 15m, mainly
because of the surplus of bananas.
Mr David Sudgen, chief executive, is expecting the price of bananas to rise
after July when the new banana regime within the Single Market comes into
effect.
He said: 'For the first time, the whole of the European Community will be
regulated when our significant investment in creating a pan-European
business will pay off.'
Last year the group increased capital expenditure from Pounds 18m to Pounds
43m, primarily in the development of its banana business. A further Pounds
35m of investment has been earmarked for 1993.
As a result of the capital expenditure, a cash surplus of Pounds 19m was
turned into net debt of Pounds 7.2m.
Food preparation increased trading profit from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 6.2m.
Mr Sudgen said he hoped the division, which is to be expanded, would double
profits by 1995.
Macfish, in which Geest had a 50 per cent interest, was sold for Pounds 9.7m
in September and last week the group's two US salad businesses were sold for
Dollars 5.7m (Pounds 3.8m).
The sales gave rise to a Pounds 17.2m extraordinary charge, of which Pounds
16.1m related to goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Earnings per share fell from 26.3p to 20.4p. However, the final dividend is
increased to 4.4p making a total of 8.1p (7.9p).
COMMENT
The new banana regime should have the effect of taking away business from
the big dollar banana importers, such as Dole. In 1994, after the first full
year of the new regulation, Geest may well achieve its aim of becoming the
second or even the biggest importer of bananas into the European market. It
is unlikely, however, to pull off its other stated aim of generating half
its profits from food preparation. It is already facing stiff competition in
this area, not least from the likes of Northern Foods. With forecast pre-tax
profits of Pounds 25m, the shares  - down 4p to 454p - are on a prospective
multiple of 18.2 this year. But in 1994, which is arguably where investors
should be looking, the shares are on a more realistic rating of 13 times
earnings.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Johnston Press hits Pounds 9.76m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSTON PRESS, the Edinburgh-based newspaper publishing group, increased
1992 pre-tax profits by 32 per cent to Pounds 9.76m, with just over half the
increase coming from acquisitions.
The company, in which the Johnston family has a 45 per cent stake, has
doubled its turnover since 1988 - partly because of a series of acquisitions
of newspaper and publishing groups as it has expanded out of Scotland and
the north of England.
Mr Fred Johnston, executive chairman, said that for the third year running
there was no evidence of any improvement in the market place. The company's
improved performance was due to its own efforts in containing costs and in
finding business opportunities 'in often bleak economic conditions.'
The company benefited from 'the strong and well-established' position of its
free and paid-for newspapers, which operate between Falkirk and Sussex. The
bookbinding and library bookselling businesses performed well.
Turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 71.7m, of which all but 1.6 per cent was
due to acquisitions. The figure benefited from one year's revenue of
Greenhead Books of Ipswich, one quarter from TR Beckett, the Sussex-based
newspaper group, and from Shoesmith and Etheridge, a stationery wholesaler
in Uckfield, Sussex.
Mr Iain Bell, managing director, said: 'Our strict cost controls and good
housekeeping stand us in good stead.'
Mr Johnston hinted at possible further acquisitions, stating 'as companies
scarred by the recession begin to review their portfolios, there are going
to be further business opportunities for undertakings which have survived
the last three years in good order.'
He added: 'Despite the utterances of the politicians, evidence in the
everyday world has yet to provide any significant signs that the recession
is coming to an end.'
A final dividend of 4p makes a 6.25p (5.5p) total.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Confusion over the identity of Fisherking -
Alice Rawsthorn looks at Darty, an institution on the French retail scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASCAL, a sales assistant at the Darty store in Les Halles shopping centre
in Paris, beamed when asked about Darty's takeover by a British company.
'It's good news for everyone,' he said. 'We'll represent them in France and
they'll represent us in the UK. It makes sense for us to link up with
Fisherking.'
Pascal is not alone in his confusion over the identity of Darty's new owner.
Kingfisher may be one of the most powerful players in UK retailing but it
was virtually unknown in France until last month's announcement that it had
agreed terms to acquire Darty, the largest chain of electrical retailers in
the country.
Darty itself is equally obscure in the UK. However, Kingfisher has bought a
business which is not only a leadding force in its sector, but an
institution on the French retail scene.
The Darty stores, with their warehouse-style interiors and monochrome signs,
are a familiar sight in city centres and out-of-town shopping complexes all
over France.
Darty has 130 stores throughout the country which command 12 per cent of the
national market for electrical products and nearly 30 per cent of sales in
Paris and Lyon. It also has an almost unassailable reputation for quality
and service among its customers.
To the French, the Darty name has the same cadences of good value and
reasonable prices, as Marks and Spencer or John Lewis to the British. In
other words it has built up a reputation for value-for-money and quality
which would be the envy of most UK electrical chains, including Kingfisher's
Comet. Darty has achieved this through a combination of highly disciplined
management, a carefully co-ordinated public image and strong commitment to
service.
Darty dates back to 1957 when the three Darty brothers - Bernard, Claude and
Nathan - opened their first store. The company expanded rapidly in the
1960s, 1970s and 1980s as the brothers opened new stores to satisfy demand
for the new electronic products - washer-dryers, fridge-freezers, hi-fi
systems, colour televisions and videos - which were flooding on to the
market.
The Darty stores have a similar clean, functional look to those of M&amp;S and
John Lewis, with white walls and pale grey floors. The stores are filled
with row after row of products, all accompanied by neat information panels
and discreet neon signs to identify different departments.
Cleaners prowl around the stores to dust and polish the products. The glitzy
signs and bargain baskets that tend to litter other electrical stores are
conspicuous by their absence. Darty's outlets have a restrained ethos which
could not be more different from the flashy feel of its competitors.
Darty has also invested heavily in service. Its sales staff are sent on
regular training sessions to ensure that they are well-informed about the
merchandise. Darty also offers free delivery and also an after-sales
service. This gives it a distinct competitive advantage over other French
retailers, which are notoriously weak on customer service. Darty made sales
of FFr375m from service alone in the year to August 31, against FFr8.19bn
from its retail operations.
As a result, Darty is one of the handful of French retailers to dominate its
sector. Its size helps to deter potential competitors particularly as it now
operates on such a scale that it would be difficult for other companies to
match its negotiating power with suppliers. It is the only large specialist
electrical chain in France. The rest of the market is fragmented between
hypermarkets, department stores, furniture chains such as Conforama and
thousands of independents.
Darty's reputation among the French public is mirrored in the stock market's
perceptions of the group. Despite the recent slowdown in the household
products market - which trimmed Darty's sales from FFr8.75bn in 1991 to
FFr8.56bn in 1992 and pre-tax profits from FFr1.085bn to FFr1.07bn over the
same period - it is still one of France's most profitable retailers.
Since its management buy-out in 1988, Darty has effectively operated as a
private company with a very low profile in the investment community. Before
the buy-out it traditionally traded at a generous premium with a p/e ratio
of about 20, against an average of 15 for the rest of the retail sector.
'Darty was always a blue chip stock,' said one Paris retail analyst. 'I've
lost contact with the management since the buy-out, but I'm still a loyal
customer. Nothing has changed judging from the feel of the stores. The
quality of the business seems to be as high as ever.'

Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance and reinsurance broker, yesterday
reported a 21 per cent increase in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.3m and

The shares rose 10p to close at 261p despite a decline in earnings to 18.11p
(restated 20.66p). The final dividend is 9p.
In line with FRS 3 some Pounds 1.15m in net profits from the sale of the
group's investments in two associates was included in profits.
Operating profits, however, fell to Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 3.6m).
Investment income increased by 14.6 per cent to Pounds 7.83m and associates
contributed Pounds 911,000 (Pounds 115,000) to profits.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Adult readers lift Dorling Kindersley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN INTEREST in sex and British enthusiasm for gardening helped boost
interim profits at Dorling Kindersley, the publisher of illustrated
reference books which was floated in October.
However, shares in the group fell 41p to 264p after it said that trading
conditions for children's books had become more competitive in America and
it would stop sales to US warehouse clubs.
Group pre-tax profits rose 21 per cent to Pounds 4.2m for the six months to
December 31, after charging Pounds 208,000 for flotation costs. Sales
improved 20 per cent to Pounds 38.6m.
There was strong US demand for two sex books - Anne Hooper's Ultimate Sex
Guide and The Magic of Sex by Dr Miriam Stoppard - which sold 70,000 copies
each.
UK readers bought 69,000 copies of The Royal Horticultural Society
Encyclopedia of Gardening in its first season, in spite of the book's Pounds
30 price tag. The companion, RHS Encyclopedia of Plants and Flowers, has
sold more than 1.1m copies worldwide and generated more than Pounds 1.1m of
turnover in the UK alone.
Turnover of the DK Adult division increased by 31 per cent to Pounds 23.9m.
However, DK Children's turnover declined 10 per cent to Pounds 11.3m,
reflecting a more competitive market and the phasing of main titles. The
group has stopped selling books to discount warehouses because it plans to
start selling books at full retail price through its Family Library business
in the US.
Earnings were 4.7p (4.3p). The interim dividend is 1.1p.
COMMENT
The Dorling Kindersley story was beginning to look too good to be true:
after the intermediaries element of its October offer was six times
oversubscribed, the share price had nearly doubled and the company was last
month voted publisher of the year at the British Book Awards. Yesterday's
correction in the share price came because of a drop in sales to the tougher
children's market, a gap in the phasing of new reference books, and the
decision to stop selling to discount warehouses in the US. That makes sense
in the longer term, since it will protect the group's high retail margins,
but it will hit sales immediately. Analysts have reduced full-year forecasts
to Pounds 9.5m, which puts the shares on a prospective multiple of nearly
20. They are likely to drift until the problems in the children's market
begin to recede.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Weir maintains growth record with 14% rise
despite flat turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEIR GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering concern, delivered a 10th year of
profits growth in 1992, pushing the pre-tax figure up by 14 per cent from
Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 39.2m.
Lord Weir, chairman, said the concentration on specialist engineering and
services had paid off, as had getting out of such 'commodity' activities as
steel foundries.
About 60 per cent of sales were overseas and its UK business was in the more
resilient sectors of oil and power.
Turnover in the 53 weeks (52 weeks) remained flat at Pounds 424.8m after the
inclusion of Pounds 23.1m from a US acquisition.
Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive, said short-term orders, such as for spare
parts, were down in the first nine months. 'About Pounds 30m of business
that we expected did not appear.' The inflow had improved over the past six
months.
The slackness had mainly affected the engineering services division, where
operating profit fell from Pounds 8m to Pounds 6.18m on sales of Pounds
80.4m (Pounds 87.3m).
Engineering products advanced to Pounds 26m (Pounds 20.3m), including a
near-Pounds 2m acquisition contribution. The margin improvement was partly
due to profits being taken towards the end of contracts.
Lord Weir said that although the order book had fallen from Pounds 470m to
Pounds 373m, the position was not bad. The previous year's figure was
abnormally large because of long-term contracts for desalination plant and
gas-handling equipment.
The balance sheet strengthened further to show Pounds 52.3m (Pounds 46.3m)
cash, of which Pounds 29m (Pounds 21m) was advance payments.
Mr Garrick said the group's acquisition policy was firmly in the field of
'mechanical engineering products that are difficult to make or design.'
Following the US purchase, a pump business in continental Europe would be an
ideal next step.
Earnings per share rose to 35.5p (32.1p). The final dividend is raised to
8.3p to make an 11.8p (10.5p) total. The company proposes to split its
shares, doubling the number in issue to about 156m.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Only two bids received for 30% Greencore
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government said last night that it had received only two bids for
its 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the sugar, milling and malting group.
One bid was from Archer-Daniels-Midland, a US agribusiness conglomerate, and
the other from Irish Life, a Dublin-based insurance concern.
No details were given of the price of the bids, but the government said that
ADM had 'reaffirmed its interest' in purchasing a stake providing that 'its
participation must exceed 25 per cent on a fully diluted basis'.
The Irish Life bid is to purchase just 2m shares of the 25.4m on offer,
'conditional on the government selling at least 20m shares to purchasers
including Irish Life'. Irish Life said last night that it was not acting on
behalf of any other investors to purchase the outstanding amount.
Earlier this month, the Irish agriculture minister Mr Joe Walsh said that
ADM had made an offer of 260p per share. Since then Greencore's shares have
risen to 270p. Mr Walsh said this week that the sale would not automatically
go to the highest bidder.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, said that the criteria to be used in
assessing the government's decision would be 'price, the strategic
development of the company and the development of the food sector in
Ireland'.
The government has been under pressure from trade unions and the Labour
partners in the coalition to prevent the selling of the stake to a foreign
company. However, the fact that no Irish food company has made a bid for
Greencore and that Irish Life has only bid for less than 10 per cent of the
shares on offer, is something of an embarrassment to the government.
It must now decide whether to accept the joint ADM-Irish Life offers, which
are not incompatible, or to abandon the sale altogether.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Blenheim upbeat on Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLENHEIM GROUP, the exhib-ition organiser, yesterday forecast an 'excellent'
year to come after announcing slightly higher than expected profits.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 49.7m in the 16 months to December 31. The 12
months to August 31 1991 achieved Pounds 37.3m.
The company decided not to adopt accounting standard FRS 3 because of a
change in the financial year end.
Turnover of Pounds 239.1m (Pounds 122.2m) included Pounds 13.5m from
Batimat, the biannual French building supply exhibition held in November
1991.
Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said gross and operating profit margins fell
slightly, partly because few large events were held in the last few months.
The company was also affected by higher than expected inflation in Germany.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 11.7m covered losses on the disposal and
closure of the Belgian and Swiss companies.
About 90 per cent of profits come from outside the UK. Because the company
uses year-end exchange rates, sterling's fall in value led to a Pounds 4m
exchange gain. However, this was balanced by a large increase in debtors.
Average exchange rates would be adopted from this year.
Earnings were 36.9p (24.1p), while a final dividend of 3p makes a 12p
(7.83p) total.
COMMENT
Not too much should be read into these figures, which are inconclusive
because of the change in year end. But the company's optimistic statements,
and the fact the shares are tightly held so can over-react, pushed the
shares up 6p to 605p. The figures did contain some pointers. A Pounds 3.5m
pre-tax profit from trade magazines and catalogues was promising. The
episodes in Belgium and Switzerland were not, although shareholders will be
relieved Blenheim realised its mistake quickly. For the coming year,
comparisons will remain difficult because of the timing of biannual events.
Analysts will want to see if Blenheim can maintain its margins and push
through some price rises. With last year's currency gains salted away in
case times get tougher, the company should meet forecasts of Pounds 47m this
time. A rating of 18 times looks demanding for a company still to prove it
can maintain momentum now it is maturing.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold falls 14% to Pounds
3.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NATHALIE LEMOINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARR &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust reported pre-tax profits down 14 per cent, from
Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 3.7m for 1992 as recession took its toll on the
group's travel, motor and fuel distribution activities.
Profits were reduced to Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 1.99m) on the core motor
distribution side, and fell to Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 3.7m) at the leisure and
holidays division.
Fuel distribution was in the red for the first time.
Turnover of this Leeds-based company slipped to Pounds 227m (Pounds 229m).
The group's borrowings doubled to Pounds 20.2m and gearing rose to 74 per
cent (32.4 per cent) at year end after a change in accounting policy to
conform with FRED 4. The main effect was to bring the group's interest in
four hotels, and their associated debt, on to its balance sheet.
Prospects had improved for the motor distribution, said Mr Malcolm Barr,
chairman, but widespread discounting of holiday prices would affect the
group even more deeply this year. The results for 1993 were unlikely to
improve much he said.
An unchanged final dividend of 7p is proposed for a maintained 10p total
which is payable from reduced earnings per share of 19.1p against 20.7p.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Caird parts company with chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAIRD Group, the waste management company, has parted company with Mr Peter
Linacre, its controversial chief executive.
Mr Linacre, who built up Caird from a sleepy Dundee-based property company,
became unpopular with institutions in 1990 when the company was overshadowed
by a profits shortfall, a lapsed bid from Severn Trent, the regional water
company, and another profits warning last November.
Mr John Ashton, chairman, said: 'This has been on the cards for some time,
but we've been looking around for a replacement.'
Caird's final results are due out this morning.
NatWest Securities, the company's broker, has forecast a fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 6.87m to Pounds 4.25m and no final dividend. Mr Ashton
stressed that the profits shortfall was not related to Mr Linacre's
departure.
Mr Linacre is replaced by Mr David Weir, formerly managing director of
Cleanaway Waste Services, part of the GKN/Brambles joint venture.
Mr John Phillips has resigned as Caird's senior operations director. The
moves are effective from April 1.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Amec deficit accelerates to Pounds 88m -
Provisions mar 'fine performance' by UK construction side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMEC, the UK construction, engineering and property group, announced
provisions of Pounds 114.6m resulting in a Pounds 87.5m pre-tax loss for the
12 months to December 31.
That compared with a Pounds 13.1m deficit last time. The 1991 results, which
included provisions of Pounds 69.4m, were recalculated in line with the FRS
3 accounting standard.
The final dividend is cut from 6.25p to just 1p, making a total of 3p
(10.25p) for the year.
The latest provisions included almost Pounds 34m of write-downs caused by
problems with cladding on a Brighton office development block and the
receivership of the Trocadero redevelopment in central London.
The group also reported a Pounds 14.3m loss, mainly in Australia, where it
has previously reported write-downs on hotel, shopping and office
developments in Sydney and Melbourne.
Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said the provisions had marred an otherwise
fine performance by the UK construction division. Senior management involved
in the Brighton and Australian developments had been changed, he pointed
out.
'We are not happy about this situation but have taken the appropriate action
to put things right,' he said.
Amec has written down by Pounds 18m its one fifth stake in Power
Corporation, the Irish property group which took over full responsibility
for redeveloping the Trocadero site after its joint venture partner, Brent
Walker, ran into trouble.
Receivers were appointed earlier this year to the five Power subsidiaries
responsible for the Trocadero redevelopment. The write-down on the Brighton
development totalled Pounds 15.9m.
Amec in addition has written down by Pounds 63m the value of land and work
in progress of its housing and commercial property operations.
These produced an operating loss of Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 10.1m loss) before
provisions. Overseas operations, following setbacks in Australia and the US,
incurred a Pounds 13.7m loss compared with a Pounds 1.1m prof-it.
UK contracting profits by comparison were only 10.7 per cent lower at Pounds
55.1m (Pounds 61.7m). Sir Alan said this was an excellent performance in a
difficult market.
COMMENT
There was no surprise at the size of the provisions which had been widely
forecast and Amec's share price rose 5p to 81p despite the scale of the
loss. The company has been honest about its mistakes and the market appears
to have accepted that these have been caused by isolated management
aberrations rather than by a general corporate malaise. The UK contracting
business has performed well and mechanical and electrical margins, excluding
the Australian problems, remain good. The lack of a quality housing
operation detracts from what otherwise is an excellent range of businesses.
Profits of Pounds 25m would put the company on about 10 times earnings which
does not do justice to the quality of the construction business but reflects
the lack of housing recovery potential.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar rights 89% taken up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House, the construction, engineering and shipping group, yesterday
announced that its shareholders had taken up 89 per cent of its 1-for-2
rights issue at 60p.
It ordinary and A shares yesterday rose by 1 1/2 p to 77p and 75p
respectively. The rights raised Pounds 204.5m.
The rump of the issue, representing 38.8m shares, was placed with the Swiss
Bank Corporation by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank handling the issue.
SBC has a put option under which Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson
controlled property company, may be required to purchase up to 67m shares,
or about 75m shares adjusting for the rights, representing 7.1 per cent of
Trafalgar's stock.
SBC is expected to sell the rump of rights to Hongkong Land for about 78p a
share. This would take Hongkong Land's 20.7 per cent Trafalgar shareholding
above 24 per cent.
If SBC exercises all of the put, which it would have to do by May 3,
Hongkong Land's stake would rise to about 28 per cent. Its stated aim is to
take its Trafalgar holding to 29.9 per cent.
Hongkong Land has undertaken not to increase its stake above 29.9 per cent
or make a full bid for Trafalgar until April 1 1994, unless a third party
offer or tender is made or a third party acquires 15 per cent of the
company's shares.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Blenheim optimistic after achieving Pounds
49.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLENHEIM GROUP, the exhibition organiser, yesterday forecast an 'excellent'
year to come after announcing slightly higher than expected profits.
Pre-tax profits totalled Pounds 49.7m in the 16 months to December 31.
Profits for the 12 months to August 31 last year amounted to Pounds 37.3m.
The company decided not to adopt accounting standard FRS 3 because of a
change in the financial year end.
Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said Blenheim continued to perform well. He said
the company's large, established exhibitions had weathered recession in its
main markets like the US and France.
Turnover was Pounds 239.1m, compared with Pounds 122.2m, including a Pounds
13.5m contribution from Batimat, the biannual French building supply
exhibition held in November 1991.
Gross and operating profit margins fell slightly, partly because few large
events were held in the last few months while overheads remained steady. The
company was also affected by higher than expected inflation in Germany, Mr
Buch said.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 11.7m to cover losses on the
disposal and closure of the Belgian and Swiss companies. The charge covered
goodwill previously written off through reserves.
About 90 per cent of profits come from outside the UK. Because the company
uses year-end exchange rates, sterling's fall in value led to a Pounds 4m
exchange gain. However, this was balanced by a large increase in debtors and
Mr Buch said there was 'very little' currency gain in the figures. The
company had decided to adopt average exchange rates from this year, he said.
Earnings per share were 36.9p, against 24.1p, while a recommended final
dividend of 3p makes a 12p (7.83p) total.
COMMENT
Not too much should be read into these figures, which are inconclusive
because of the change in year end. But the company's optimistic statements,
and the fact the shares are tightly held so can over-react, pushed the
shares up 6p to 605p. The figures did contain some pointers. A Pounds 3.5m
pre-tax profit from trade magazines and catalogues was promising. The
episodes in Belgium and Switzerland were not, although shareholders will be
relieved Blenheim realised its mistake quickly. For the coming year,
comparisons will remain difficult because of the timing of biannual events.
Analysts will want to see if Blenheim can maintain its margins and push
through some price rises. With last year's currency gains salted away in
case times get tougher, the company should meet forecasts of Pounds 47m this
time. A rating of 18 times looks demanding for a company still to prove it
can maintain momentum now it is maturing.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Mitchell family cuts Wimpey stake to 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 70-year link between the Mitchell family and George Wimpey was loosened
yesterday when Grove Charity Management raised more than Pounds 110m from
selling a 29 per cent stake in the construction group.
The 84.3m shares were placed with a wide number of institutions by SG
Warburg Securities and Cazenove.
Wimpey's share price, which fell by 4p following the announcement to 142p,
has more than doubled since its low of 67p last September.
The charitable trust was established in 1955 by Sir Godfrey Mitchell, who
bought Wimpey, a west London stone mason, for Pounds 3,000 in 1919.
Grove will remain Wimpey's largest shareholder, with a 5 per cent stake.
Mr Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, said yesterday that he had been
aware for 18 months that the trust wanted to widen its investment portfolio.
The placing would make it more difficult for a predator to mount a takeover
bid, as the shares would be more widely held .
'The rules governing charitable trusts meant that if it had received an
attractive single offer for all its shares it would have been required to
sell in the best interests of the beneficiaries,' said Mr Dwyer.
The trust provides funds for a wide range of UK social and welfare projects.
It controls investments worth about Pounds 270m, of which the Wimpey stake
formerly represented about 40 per cent.
Trustees include Mrs Mary Graves and Mrs Helen Dunwell, Sir Sir Godfrey's
daughters. Dr Desmond Graves, husband of Mrs Mary Graves will remain on the
Wimpey board.
Seven years ago the trust reduced its 49.9 per cent stake to 34 per cent. It
said it had no intention of reducing its stake below 5 per cent.
The disposal, however, may make it easier for Wimpey to issue equity to
raise cash, should it eventually consider this necessary.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Barratt makes 92% surge to Pounds 4.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LAWRIE Barratt, brought out of retirement 21 months ago to rescue
Britain's third largest housebuilder, yesterday proposed to increase the
company's output by almost two- thirds during the next three years.
Barratt Developments, which announced a 92 per cent jump in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 2.5m) in the six months to December 31, said there
were clear signs that the UK market was beginning to revive after four years
of recession.
The company wants to increase the number of homes it builds from 5,000 in
the current year to 8,000 by 1998.
It said it would finance expansion from within its own resources, without
resorting to a rights issue and keeping gearing to less than 50 per cent.
Since Sir Lawrie returned in July 1991, the company has cut net debt from
Pounds 255m to just Pounds 81m at the end of December, including off-balance
sheet borrowings. This was equivalent to 44 per cent of shareholders funds
of Pounds 184m.
The biggest contribution to the first half profits improvement was reduced
interest payments, which fell from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 4m. Of this about
Pounds 1.1m was due to lower interest rates and Pounds 4.8m to reduced debt.
Sir Lawrie said that net reservations had risen by about 15 per cent
compared with the first three months of last year. This was despite the fact
that Barratt was operating from considerably fewer sites than a year
earlier.
UK profits rose from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 7.5m, despite the number of
houses sold dipping from 2,128 to 2,017. Group turnover fell from Pounds
209.7m to Pounds 174m, of which the UK accounted for Pounds 164m (Pounds
190m).
The US incurred a Pounds 2.7m loss in the first half with the group
continuing to experience problems in a depressed Californian market.
The group was seeking to get better value out of its Californian operations
by introducing similar management to those which had turned round the UK
business, Sir Lawrie said .
The interim dividend is restored at 1p. Earnings per share increased from
1.4p to 2p.
COMMENT
Barratt shares, which have had a good run recently, fell 3p to 133p
yesterday. There was some disappointment that the housing recovery, reported
by other housebuilders, was not more in evidence and some brokers downgraded
profit expectations for the full year. The group will also need to step up
its land holdings of 13,500 plots with planning permission to about 16,000
if it is to meet its three year sales target. Sir Lawrie and chief executive
Frank Eaton, however, have done a tremendous job in turning round the UK
business. But the shares are on a prospective multiple of more than 17 on
forecast profits of Pounds 18m and have probably run their course for the
time being.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cheap birds shave off Pounds 10m at B
Matthews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Bernard Matthews, the poultry processor, fell by 75 per
cent in 1992 as low-priced imports from the US and Europe and falling demand
in the UK market for whole turkeys hit the Norfolk-based company hard.
Profits in the 53 weeks to January 3 were Pounds 3.33m, compared with Pounds
13.2m in the previous 52 weeks.
Turnover was down from Pounds 148.4m to Pounds 144.2m.
Mr Bernard Matthews, chairman, said profits from value-added processed
turkey products had risen. These account for about 80 per cent of turnover.
Losses in the company's whole bird and commodity meats business had caused
the overall reversal.
He said the added competitiveness as a result of sterling's devaluation had
led to some improvement so far this year. Demand was also up, but prices
were still extremely low.
Meanwhile, Mr Matthews announced his company's second venture into
continental Europe, through the Pounds 2.7m cash acquisition of a 90 per
cent share in Sarvari Baromfiipari, a Hungarian producer of turkey, chicken,
goose and duck meat.
Sarvari, with net assets last June of Pounds 12.3m, serves the Hungarian,
Swiss and Austrian markets.
Mr Matthews said his company saw development in central Europe as a
strategic opportunity for expansion.
Bernard Matthews is also engaged in a big push to establish its processed
products in France. A television advertising campaign began 10 days ago. Mr
Matthews said it was too early to judge the impact.
Earnings per share were 1.64p (6.95p). The final dividend is 1.25p, making a
halved total of 2.25p.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wetherspoon advances by 47% to Pounds 1.49m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JD WETHERSPOON, the chain of Greater London pubs floated in October,
increased pre-tax profits 47 per cent to Pounds 1.49m in the six months to
January 31.
Sales rose 32 per cent to Pounds 13.2m, but earnings per share fell from
6.9p to 6.1p because of the greater number of shares in issue following the
flotation. The first interim dividend is 1.8p.
The company had 44 pubs open at the time of the flotation, and has since
increased its estate to 58.
Mr Tim Martin, chairman, said: 'Since the flotation, the company has
obtained five additional licences to convert unlicensed premises into pubs
and has also purchased a large existing pub from a brewer.'
He said the new establishments had made a promising start and would make a
significant contribution to earnings in the second half. The original 44
pubs continued to perform well, with food sales particularly strong.
Costs as a percentage of turnover were higher than the corresponding period
last year because of the expense of opening new pubs and the higher
proportion of leasehold pubs which were free of tie.
Some 14.68m shares, representing 51 per cent of the enlarged capital, were
floated at 160p.

<TEXT>
MANGANESE Bronze Holdings, the black taxi cabs maker, returned to pre-tax
profits of Pounds 577,000 in the six months to January 31, compared with
losses of Pounds 492,000.
There is an interim dividend for the first time in two years, with a 0.5p
payment from earnings per share of 2.19p (2.3p losses). Turnover rose to
Pounds 37.8m (Pounds 33.9m).
Mr Hugh Lang, chairman, said overall taxi sales were lower than before, but
from November they tended to move forward and this trend has continued into
the second half.
The vehicles division returned Pounds 13m (Pounds 10m) profits on turnover
of Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 20.7m) - sales are lower in the first half of the
year.
The group reported losses on its LTI Homer sub-assembly business and the
continued failure of Fairway Nissan, the car dealership, to break even.
The Deans Powered Doors division returned to profits of Pounds 9m (losses
Pounds 433,000) with turnover up 46 per cent to Pounds 2.78m (Pounds 1.89m).
The components side turned in Pounds 778,000 (Pounds 541,000) on turnover of
Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 9.77m).
Both divisions benefited from the sterling devaluation. Deans Powered Doors
exports about 50 per cent of its products and about 30 per cent of
components go abroad.
Mr Jamie Borwick, chief executive, said: 'The sterling devaluation may have
got us in, but its the quality level that will keep us there.'

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Weir maintains growth with Pounds 39m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEIR GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering concern, delivered a 10th year of
profits growth in 1992, pushing the pre-tax figure up by 14 per cent from
Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 39.2m.
Lord Weir, chairman, said the concentration on specialist engineering and
services had paid off, as had getting out of such 'commodity' activities as
steel foundries.
About 60 per cent of sales were overseas and its UK business was in the more
resilient sectors of oil and power.
Turnover in the 53 weeks (52 weeks) remained flat at Pounds 424.8m after the
inclusion of Pounds 23.1m from a US acquisition.
Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive, said short-term orders, such as for spare
parts, were down in the first nine months. 'About Pounds 30m of business
that we expected did not appear.' The inflow had improved over the past six
months.
The slackness had mainly affected the engineering services division, where
operating profit fell from Pounds 8m to Pounds 6.18m on sales of Pounds
80.4m (Pounds 87.3m).
Engineering products advanced to Pounds 26m (Pounds 20.3m), including a
near-Pounds 2m acquisition contribution. The margin improvement was partly
due to profits being taken towards the end of contracts.
Lord Weir said that although the order book had fallen from Pounds 470m to
Pounds 373m, the position was not bad. The previous year's figure was
abnormally large because of long-term contracts for desalination plant and
gas-handling equipment.
The balance sheet strengthened further to show Pounds 52.3m (Pounds 46.3m)
cash, of which Pounds 29m (Pounds 21m) was advance payments.
Mr Garrick said the group's acquisition policy was firmly in the field of
'mechanical engineering products that are difficult to make or design.'
Following the US purchase, a pump business in continental Europe would be an
ideal next step.
Earnings per share rose to 35.5p (32.1p). The final dividend is raised to
8.3p to make an 11.8p (10.5p) total. The company proposes to split its
shares, doubling the number in issue to about 156m.
COMMENT
Plaudits for Weir's management through recession have been amply expressed
in a share price rise from 227p in January 1991 to 668p last month. Now the
argument is that recovery stocks will lure away some of the money that
retreated to quality. Weir points out that it will continue to grow and that
the pound's devaluation helps its export prospects. Its irritation is
understandable at the idea that companies which have done badly are more
attractive. But its price looks high. On a pre-tax forecast of Pounds 42m,
its prospective p/e is more than 17 on last night's close of 649p. That
rating is more suitable to companies whose earnings are returning from a
depressed level. Assuming 10 per cent dividend growth, the prospective yield
is roughly 2.5 per cent, significantly below the market. While the case for
holding on to quality is strong, especially while tangible evidence of
recovery is weak, some profit might be taken.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Platform shoes squeeze Lambert Howarth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAMBERT HOWARTH, the UK footwear supplier, yesterday announced an 8 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.98m in 1992 on a 17 per cent jump in
sales to Pounds 56.6m.
Mr Robert Garfit, managing director, said the group had suffered from
'adverse conditions on the high street' and the effect of devaluation on its
imported products. Margins had been under severe pressure, although Lambert
had sought to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
The impact of changing fashion - particularly increased demand for platform
shoes - had also depressed margins. Platforms, the group said, required more
complicated production processes and higher cost materials.
However, the group had made significant progress in its acquisition
programme. Honeywell footwear, a safety footwear group, and Technic, a
manufacturer of mens shoes, were acquired and contributed some Pounds 1.5m
to sales.
Lambert reported net cash balances at the end of the year of Pounds 5m,
after making the acquisitions. The final dividend is 8.75p for a total of
13p (12.5p). Earnings were maintained at 39.2p (39.3p), helped by a lower
tax charge.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Steel Burrill pleases City with rise to
Pounds 13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEEL BURRILL Jones, the insurance and reinsurance broker, yesterday
reported a 21 per cent increase in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.3m and
maintained a total dividend of 13.25p.
The news prompted a positive response from investors and the shares rose 10p
to close at 261p, even though earnings declined to 18.11p, from a restated
20.66p for 1991. The final dividend is 9p.
In line with FRS 3 some Pounds 1.15m in net profits from the sale of the
group's investments in two associates was been included in pre-tax profits.
Operating profits, however, fell to Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 3.6m). Investment
income increased by 14.6 per cent to Pounds 7.83m and associates contributed
Pounds 911,000 (Pounds 115,000) to pre-tax profits.
Mr George Boden, chief executive, said he expected falling interest rates
and tough trading conditions to constrain growth in 1993. 'Growth of total
group income is likely to be modest . . . and the group's results will
inevitably be affected if short term interest rates continue at current low
levels,' he warned.
The group, however, will continue to control its expense base. In 1992
expenses increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 43.9m (Pounds 37.4m) - against
growth in turnover of 15.27 per cent to Pounds 47.3m. But expenses were down
at an underlying rate of 8 per cent, with the group's headcount falling from
880 to 830.
A poor performance by SBJ Regis Low, the offshore energy broker acquired for
Pounds 35m in January 1992, was the biggest blot on the performance. SBJ
Regis Low lost an important account insuring US construction liabilities -
worth some Pounds 2m in commission income - in April, and was subsequently
hit by reduced demand for offshore insurance.
Despite a cut back in expenses pre-tax profits were only just over half of
their pre-acquisition level of about Pounds 5m.
Mr Allan Nicholls, analyst with James Capel, said the market was relieved
that Regis Low's had not produced worse results, and that this has
contributed to yesterday's positive reaction.
'The figures are not out of line with what was expected but Regis Low has
shown a capacity to disappoint.'

FT  25 MAR 93 / Daimler discloses DM4bn of reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-Benz, Germany's larg-est industrial company, yesterday disclosed
'hidden reserves' of about DM4bn (Pounds 1.66bn) while announcing its plan
to obtain a share listing on the New York stock exchange.
Daimler will become the first German company to obtain a listing on the
exchange and is likely to lead the way for others as they attempt to
strengthen their ability to raise capital.
The company said yesterday that it had reached a compromise with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulatory body for securities
markets, which would allow it to list its shares on Wall Street this year.
The compromise would include the German company giving increased financial
details to meet US investors' expectations, Daimler said. The refusal of the
SEC and German groups to compromise on disclosure rules has for long been an
obstacle to the companies gaining access to the world's biggest capital
market.
Daimler said that it would change its accounting for the 1992 financial
year. This would disclose extraordinary profits of about DM4bn, more than
twice the expected net profits of between DM1.4bn and DM1.5bn. The profit in
1991 was DM1.9bn.
A Daimler-Benz listing would boost the New York Stock Exchange, which faces
increasing competition for business from electronic, regional and
international exchanges, notably London. The NYSE exchange has been trying
to promote itself as the leading international stock market, but the SEC's
strict disclosure rules have discouraged some large foreign companies from
listing in the US.
Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the SEC, said yesterday that there had been
give on both sides and he thought the result would be a ' win-win' for the
two parties.
Mr William Donaldson, chairman of the NYSE, who has long campaigned for a
relaxation of SEC rules on foreign companies, said Daimler's announcement
stemmed from a 'breakthrough compromise that we have sought for a long
time.'
Daimler is undergoing a restructuring at Mercedes-Benz, its core car
subsidiary. It planned to hold a DM2bn rights issue last autumn but this was
postponed because of poor conditions on the German stock market.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Reuters signals rethink on cash pile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS, the international information and news group, is considering ways
of returning some of its Pounds 710m cash pile to shareholders - probably
through a special dividend or share buy-back scheme.
The difference in tax and regulatory regimes between the UK and US - where
Reuters has 35 per cent of its shareholders - would pose obstacles to both a
cash payment and a share buy-back, a method more commonly used in Wall
Street than the UK.
Reuters said yesterday: 'We have not yet decided whether we wish to make a
distribution. This depends on the pace at which plans for business expansion
proceed. There are also significant regulatory and tax issues which we are
trying to resolve.'
Analysts estimate Reuters could hand back as much as Pounds 400m to
shareholders and a buy-back would not be dilutive at about the present share
price, and would enhance earnings at a lower level. Reuters shares yesterday
closed 4p higher at Pounds 13.59p, giving the group a market capitalisation
of nearly Pounds 6bn.
The annual report said that if Reuters decided that it had more cash than it
required to develop new business, it had the capacity to distribute a
proportion of this cash to shareholders without the need to write off
unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax. Reuters achieved this by paying an
increased dividend of Pounds 357m from its main operational company to the
holding company in December, thereby preserving a portion of the group's ACT
capacity.
The main concern for the company is that it will no longer be seen as a
growth stock. Having increased profits rapidly during the eighties, 1980s,
its performance has slowed as recession has struck the world's financial
markets.
Reuters increased its capital expenditure by 25 per cent last year to Pounds
200m, but that was overshadowed by strong cash generation.
Analysts would prefer to see Reuters hand back some of its cash to
shareholders, rather than be tempted to invest it an areas outside its core
expertise.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Lasmo cuts dividend after Pounds 385m deficit: Chief
executive describes 'very hard' decision to reduce payout to 3.3p from 8 1/2
p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the oil exploration and production company, slashed its dividend by
more than expected and reported an after-tax loss of Pounds 385m for last
year.
The company's share price tumbled by 19p to 173p as it announced it had cut
its dividend to 3.3p for last year from 8 1/2 p the year before. 'This is a
disastrous set of results and the outlook is not good,' said Ms Irene
Himona, analyst at Strauss Turnbull, the UK securities house.
Mr Joe Darby, who took over as chief executive at Lasmo in January, said:
'The dividend cut was a very hard decision, but we took a long look at the
business and decided to reduce the dividend to a level that is sustainable.'
The company also announced it would sell its share of the Markham gas field
in the North Sea. Analysts have estimated it might fetch Pounds 100m.
Mr Darby said he is looking at re-focusing Lasmo, strengthening its balance
sheet and putting a drive on core exploration while divesting much of its
peripheral interests. But some analysts suggest the company could be
jeopardising future growth.
'You've got to differentiate between fat and muscle and Markham is more
muscle than we've recently got rid of, but there is not huge upside
potential there,' said Mr Darby.
Lasmo made an operating profit before exceptional items of Pounds 112m
compared with a loss of Pounds 9m the year before. But the company was hit
hard by exceptional items of Pounds 426m. These included a writedown of
Pounds 232m as it revalued its assets based on lower price expectations and
more conservative reserve estimates for some of its fields. Lasmo is now
testing all of its oil projects against a flat oil price of Dollars 19 a
barrel. Production is planned to rise 40 per cent during the next five years
to 220,000 barrels a day.
The company also changed its accounting procedures and the loss for 1991 was
restated to Pounds 4m. Its debt-to-equity ratio rose to 111 per cent at the
end of the year and once the benefit from disposals made last year feeds
through, gearing will fall to 88 per cent.
Earnings per share before exceptional items were 4.6p and after
exceptionals, the company incurred a loss of 52.2p a share compared with a
loss of 2.8p in 1991.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Drug stocks fall on Merck warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUG stocks on both sides of the Atlantic tumbled yesterday after Merck &amp;
Co, the sector's biggest company, warned that earnings growth this year
would be slower than expected.
The US group also revealed its first-ever job reduction programme when it
announced 1,000 of its 38,000 employees would be made redundant this year.
Yesterday Merck's shares fell Dollars 2 1/4 to close at Dollars 32 3/4 . In
London, Glaxo Holdings closed down 17p to 597p in spite of news that its
migraine treatment Imigran had been given technical approval in France.
Merck blamed the slowdown on increasing competition in the US and healthcare
cost-containment measures worldwide. It also cited currency movements. The
announcement followed last week's similar warnings from Eli Lilly and Marion
Merrell Dow, the US drug groups.
The group said the effects would be seen in the first-quarter results and
would be particularly noticeable in the first half. Analysts downgraded
earnings growth predictions for Merck during 1993 from as high as 16 per
cent to about 10 per cent.
Merck has been hit both by its undertaking not to increase prices by more
than inflation and the growing ability of bulk healthcare providers to
negotiate drugs discounts. Sales have also been affected by health reforms
in Germany.
In the US, the price of some drugs are falling due to the growing power of
bulk healthcare providers called health management organisations (HMOs).
These account for about half of the US market. 'The drugs groups have dug
their own grave,' explained Mr Hermant Shah, pharmaceuticals analyst at HKS
&amp; Co in New York. 'They have been launching more medicines with little
additional therapeutic benefit. That has allowed the HMOs to trade one drug
off against another, driving down prices,' he said.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Halifax up 8% despite sharp rise in bad
debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX Building Society disclosed an 8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits,
from Pounds 628m to Pounds 680m, despite a 63 per cent increase to Pounds
374m in provisions against bad and doubtful debts.
Mr Jon Foulds, chairman, said the society had performed well in 'the worst
year in the housing market since the war'. The priority in the year to
January 31 had been to maintain financial strength and security, and help
members.
Mr Jim Birrell, chief executive, said competition from National Savings for
retail funds and the need to maintain investors' returns meant that any
further cut in base rates was unlikely to lead to mortgage rate reductions.
Mr Birrell said it was possible that the society might have to raise
mortgage rates later in the year to support a rise in savings rates if there
was a strong upturn in the housing market and a scarcity of retail funds.
Gross mortgage lending fell 8 per cent to Pounds 8.3bn (Pounds 9.1bn) while
net advances - mortgage advances minus repayments of mortgage loans - fell
to Pounds 3.3bn (Pounds 3.9bn). This represented 18 per cent of net lending
in the UK housing market.
Total assets rose 7 per cent to Pounds 62.8bn (Pounds 58.7bn). The asset
growth was funded by a Pounds 2.9bn increase in retail funds to Pounds
50.4bn and a Pounds 1bn increase in wholesale funds to Pounds 8.3bn.
Wholesale funds were 15.2 per cent of total funding.
Net interest income was up 18 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn because of asset
growth and widening of margins, while other operating income firmed 5 per
cent to Pounds 348m (Pounds 332m). The society said this reflected a 9 per
cent fall in housing transactions.
The ratio of costs to income fell to 40 per cent (43.6 per cent) although
the number of staff expressed in full-time equivalents was 20,600.
Cost/income ratio has fallen steadily from 51.6 per cent in 1989.
Some 87 per cent of the rise in provisions for possible bad debts related to
residential mortgages. There were 22,486 mortgages in arrears at January 31
compared to 18,061 a year before, and total arrears were Pounds 268.7m
(Pounds 257.4m).

THE Greek government yesterday signed an agreement with Tayeuro, a
consortium led by Taylor Woodrow International, the British construction
group, for a river diversion project in central Greece that has aroused
strong opposition from international environmental groups.
The Dr82.7bn (Pounds 268m) agreement, which is subject to approval by the
Greek parliament, calls for building a dam and tunnel diverting the Acheloos
river from west to east into the Thessaly plain. The diversion, due for
completion in six years, would feed two hydro-electric power stations to be
constructed in the Pindus mountains in central Greece as well as providing
water for irrigation.
The environmentalists claim the project will destroy wetlands in western
Greece frequented by rare European birds. The government argues that damage
will be limited because only 30 per cent of the Acheloos water will be
diverted to eastern Greece.
Farmers in Thessaly, the country's main grain-producing region, are facing
problems because the water table has dropped sharply in the past few years.
Nevertheless, government officials said yesterday that plans were being
prepared to channel water from other sources to the Acheloos delta in
western Greece to conserve the wetlands.
The Acheloos project was originally planned on a much larger scale, but was
cut back.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Turnround at Sealink helps Stena
recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STENA LINE, the Swedish ferry group, returned to the black in 1992 after
improved passenger and freight volumes and a sharp turnround in the
performance of Sealink, its UK operation
The profit after financial items was SKr212m (Dollars 27m), compared with a
SKr302m loss a year earlier. Turnover climbed 7 per cent to SKr7.98bn from
SKr7.47bn, despite recession in the group's main Scandanavia and UK markets,
as the number of passengers carried rose 2 per cent to 14m and freight
volumes increased by 6 per cent to 788,000 units.
The group's cost-cutting programme within Stena Sealink, which resulted in
1,800 job losses, changed working practices, and the closure of the
Folkestone-Boulogne route, returned the unit to profit after 1991's heavy
loss. The group's other ferry operations were also profitable, except for
the Dutch operation, Stena Line BV, which posted a small loss.
No dividend will be paid for the year, because the group said it did not
have sufficient unrestricted equity following its big loss in 1991.
Stena is aiming to save a further SKr200m a year from 1994, largely through
job cuts.
The board has confirmed plans for a SKr750m preference share issue to repay
two loans taken out in autumn 1991.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Timex union issues warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL leaders of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union
yesterday warned extremists not to interfere in the dispute at the Timex
factory in Dundee, following violence outside the circuit-board plant that
led to 16 arrests on Monday.
'Our message to outsiders is keep out and mind your own business,' said Mr
Gavin Laird, the union's general secretary. 'They are exacerbating the
dispute and making it more difficult to resolve the problem and save the
jobs of our members.'
None of the demonstrators who were arrested on Monday belongs to the union
or works at Timex, the US-owned multinational.
Mr Bill Jordan, the AEEU's president, added: 'An extreme reaction by an
employer has attracted extremists who are not part of our union. We want to
find a negotiated settlement and we reject the development that has take
place. Our members have obeyed the law.'
The strike - now in its fifth week - was sparked by the dismissal of all the
Timex manual workers by the company after a number of them, who had been in
dispute for 21 days over proposals for cuts in benefits, a pay freeze and
job cuts, had agreed to go back to work under protest. A substitute
workforce is being hired.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, also condemned the demonstrators. He said
during question time that 'rent-a-picket' was back, and this was 'not in the
interest of workers at Timex'. He said strikers 'had always faced the risk
of being sacked without the right to claim unfair dismissal'.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Placing gives QSP Pounds 25m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality Software Products, an accounting software company whose clients
include the Bank of England, Commercial Union and WH Smith, comes to the
market today by way of a placing which is expected to value the company at
about Pounds 25m.
QSP's principal product, Olas, is designed to run on mainframe computers and
is a direct competitor for leading US software houses like Computer
Associates and Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software and SAP, the German house.
Formed in 1981, QSP sold its first Olas program the next year. A sales
ledger module, it was designed to run on IBM mainframes, the de facto
standard for large company accounting in the 1980s.
The company has just spent some Pounds 11.8m of its own money over five
years to develop a new version of the software - Universal Olas - which will
run on a variety of computer hardware systems and operating environments.
The need to invest heavily in research and development has inevitably
affected recent results. The company turned over Pounds 7.5m in 1990, Pounds
11.1m in 1991 and Pounds 13.1m last year, but pre-tax profits were Pounds
1m, Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 1.2m respectively in the three years.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Troubled times at Timex
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VIOLENCE ON the picket line at Timex, and a rash of strikes and strike
threats on the railways, in the coal industry and at Ford, smack of an
old-fashioned bout of British labour militancy.
Appearances, however, are deceptive. All of these actions are defensive,
about job security rather than pay, and all, apart from Timex, are limited
in duration, designed primarily to provide a focal point for media
campaigns. Elsewhere there is no sign of a general pick-up in strike action.
Indeed, at a time of very high unemployment, employers are finding it
increasingly easy to push through pay freezes, especially in manufacturing.
Nevertheless, the Timex dispute does raise some questions about Britain's
labour laws. The conflict has little to do with the employment legislation
of the 1980s, except for the question of how far a trade union can support
its members in a dispute without exposing itself to legal attack. But it
does show that the law can be clumsy, and possibly unhelpful to both sides,
when dealing with the changes to employees' pay and conditions increasingly
demanded by competitive product markets.
The Timex dispute was originally about lay-offs. The company wanted to shed
a group of workers. The workforce suggested laying off different groups in
rotation and struck to support that position. The workers eventually decided
to return to work but refused to accept the less favourable terms and
conditions which the company had meanwhile decided to impose. The company
therefore sacked the whole workforce, including those who had worked through
the original dispute.
This story illustrates two facts of British labour law. First, it is often
difficult for employers to change an employment contract without consent,
even when they have good grounds. Second, since British workers have no
right to strike, employees can be sacked for breach of contract even if a
proper ballot has taken place. The result is that employers can be tempted
to use strikes about one problem to sort out another.
Timex said it was forced to sack its employees in order to change their
contracts of employment; otherwise each individual could have taken it to
court. Employers can give notice of termination of existing contracts and
provide new ones, but anyone not accepting the new contract can claim unfair
dismissal. In defending itself against such claims, the company would have
to show that the changes were necessary and that they were fairly
introduced.
It is in the interests of employers and trade unions that the framework of
employment contract law should be as clear as possible and that everyone
should respect lawfully agreed contracts. Labour law reformers should focus
on this objective.

FT  24 MAR 93 / N Sea group may halve exploration after oil tax change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERADA HESS, one of the most active companies in North Sea oil exploration,
has threatened to halve its exploration programme this year and cut jobs
because of tax changes an-nounced in the Budget last week.
The company, which will be one of the hardest hit in the North Sea by
proposed rules on petroleum revenue tax, said it would also pull out of many
applications for government licences to explore in the UK.
'This is not an idle threat, we are doing what is necessary to survive,'
said Mr Sam Laidlaw, managing director of Amerada, the UK arm of the
international US oil company. Mr Laidlaw said that, even with its plans to
cut exploration by 50 per cent, its profit level will still suffer.
Last week, Mr Norman Lamont announced that the rate of petroleum revenue tax
for existing fields in the North Sea will be cut from 75 per cent to 50 per
cent. But more importantly, for companies such as Amerada, he abolished PRT
relief on the costs of oil exploration and appraisal.
North Sea operators estimate that the cost of exploring will quadruple as a
result of the Budget changes. Mr Harold Hughes, head of the UK Offshore
Operators' Association, said: 'The proposals represent a major disincentive
to future exploration activity which is the life blood of the North Sea.'
A group of oil experts including several exploration directors of leading
oil companies have written to newspapers denouncing the chancellor's tax
changes.
Amerada said the new regime would cut profits from Pounds 2 a barrel to 10p
a barrel for a small discovery such as its Angus field, estimated to contain
10m barrels of oil. 'The profit under the old regime was pretty small. No
one would contemplate developing a field for 10p a barrel and this is the
future life-blood of the North Sea,' Mr Laidlaw said. The new UK regime
would make Norway and Australasia more attractive prospects.
The company is considering job cuts in its exploration department and laying
off two rigs which it had contracted. Mr Laidlaw estimated that the industry
could lose several thousand jobs in the short term and more over the longer
term as a result of the new PRT rules.
Mr Laidlaw said Amerada would pull out of applications it had already made
to the Department of Trade and Industry for licences to drill some North Sea
blocks.
Mr Richard Hardman, Amerada's exploration director, said the company would
probably drill four wells next year as opposed to eight or 10 under the
existing tax regime.
Overall, he estimated that companies would drill 80 to 100 wells in the
North Sea this year compared with 130 last year. The DTI is expected to
announce results of the 14th licensing round in May. Applicant companies
must commit to drill a certain number of wells within a particular time -
since these will now not be eligible for tax relief, many companies are
reassessing their commitments.
Mr Laidlaw is lobbying for changes in the PRT proposals, arguing that only
one or two large companies in the North Sea would be net beneficiaries of
the new rules.

FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brokers hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The withdrawal from the London non-life reinsurance market of NRG, the Dutch
insurance group, triggered a late flurry of selling pressure in the two
leading insurance brokers, Sedgwick and Willis Corroon, which could be hit
by the contraction of the London market. Willis shares fell 5 to 198p on
turnover of 1m and Sedgwick 4 to 174p on 605,000 traded.
NRG's UK reinsurance arm, Victory, has a big chunk of London's reinsurance
market. And there were suggestions that another of the big reinsurance
groups may soon pull out of London. Prudential said yesterday that its
reinsurance subsidiary is chopping its reinsurance business by 50 per cent
this year. 'This will translate into premium rate increases, which should be
good for the composites,' said one analyst. 'But is could make life
increasingly difficult for the brokers,' he added. In the composites Royal
Insurance jumped 11 to 318p. Sun Alliance, however, dropped 6 to 346p after
one securities house was said to have adopted a cautious stance.
Prudential's preliminary results showed profits at the lower end of
expectations but the dividend was a touch better than most forecasts,
dealers said. Prudential shares moved up 3 to 329p.
Clyde Petroleum's Pounds 34m rights issue, a one-four at 44p, surprised the
market but caused little disruption to the Clyde share price which drifted 4
to 51p. The oil team at Hoare Govett, broker to Clyde and underwriter of the
rights issue, commented 'The development of Gryphon and adoption of
successful efforts accounting underpins future profits growth and a
sustainable and progressive dividend.' Lasmo attracted more keen buying in
front of this morning's preliminary numbers although many expect them to
include a reduction in the final dividend, possibly to 3p.
Glaxo returned to favour, the shares climbing 13 to 614p on 4.8m traded.
Dealers noted good US support for the shares ahead of the start of clinical
trials for the group's 3TC anti-aids drug. Wellcome rose 12 to 910p. Unichem
put on 7 1/2 to 243 1/2 p following the 49 per cent increase in profits.
Wolseley, the building materials group, raced up to 617p immediately
following the much better than expected figures before coming off the top
and closing a net 10 higher at 604p. A block of 3m shares was sold into the
market at 599p and mostly placed at 600p.
Bargain hunters helped engineering group Siebe shrug off recent weakness to
advance 5 to 460p. The market was unimpressed by a Pounds 126m rights issue
from components group BBA and the shares fell 7 to 170p, in response. Weir
Group were wanted ahead of today's figures and put on 4 to 648p. Also in
demand was James Wilkes, which added another 2 to 72p, on continued bid
speculation.
A two way pull was seen in P&amp;O, which reported figures in line with
expectations, and the sale of the Sutcliffe catering group to Granada Group.
Having jumped 26 to 627p, on the release of the figures, closer examination
of them saw the shares come off the top to close a net 2 better at 603p,
with turnover reaching 4.6m. Mr Steve Clapham at Credit Lyonnais Laing
appreciated the figures but reduced his current year forecast by Pounds 15m
to Pounds 295m to take account of the Sutcliffe disposal and higher than
expected net debt figure.
Results from Iceland Frozen Foods came in line with expectations. Most
analysts kept next year forecasts in the Pounds 66-69m range. The shares
advanced 9 to 744p. However, one foods specialist warned that the stock's
rating was looking high. J Sainsbury slipped 8 to 507p, Kwik Save 14 to 801p
and Argyll Group 10 to 343p.
Budget changes to FT statistics
The Financial Times will implement with effect from April 5th the Budget
reduction in the income tax rate applied to dividends to 20 per cent from 25
per cent. This will affect gross dividend yields shown for individual
companies in the London Share Service, and those calculated for the FT-SE
Actuaries UK Share Indices and the FT-Actuaries World Indices.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (11): Sweeping away the cobwebs -
Profile, Skoda Automobilova
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'OUR CARS are much better than the name (implies),' Mr Milan Smutny,
deputy-director of public relations for Skoda Automobilova, says somewhat
defensively to explain the legacy of 45 years of safe but uninspired
communist management.
Today the company is sweeping away the cobwebs of state planning and
controlled markets as it strives to rejoin the European family of car makers
that it had helped to found earlier this century. Skoda Auto - not to be
confused with Skoda Plzen, the heavy engineering group of which it was once
a part - has pinned its hopes for revival on Germany's Volkswagen group
which has taken a 31 per cent stake in the Czech company.
The relationship is described as a joint venture, though by 1996 Volkswagen
will raise its stake to 70 per cent turning the Czech company into a
fully-fledged subsidiary.
Volkswagen will invest DM9bn over 10 years to transform and modernise
Skoda's large plant in Mlada Boleslav, about 60km north east of Prague, and
two nearby subsidiaries in Vrchlabi and Kvasiny. Production, now at around
200,000 cars annually, will be raised to 450,000. New models will be
developed with more powerful engines than the 1,300cc engine.
Skoda Auto plans to raise DM1.4bn soon on the international money markets to
finance investments. Mr Volkhard Kohler, deputy-chairman responsible for
finance, says the loan will be neither guaranteed by the Czech government
nor by Volkswagen, but this should not present any problems.
So, while the international downturn in the car market is forcing leading
manufacturers, including Volkswagen, to make drastic cuts in their workforce
and investments, the Skoda project remains firmly on track, he says. The
underlying assumption is that there will be demand for around 3m cars in
central and eastern Europe - not including the former Soviet Union - in the
second half of the 1990s. The Czech Republic's central location, Skoda's low
labour costs representing about 7 per cent of total costs compared with 25
per cent in Germany, and a well-established industrial tradition, provide a
strong basis for growth, Mr Kohler says.
The aim is to sell one third of production jointly to the Czech Republic and
Slovakia, one third to other central European countries, and one third to
western Europe. 'Skoda cars are one of the few Czech products that can be
exported to the west,' Mr Kohler says.
It is a tough challenge made more difficult by recession in all target
markets. In 1991, Skoda's sales fell by 8 per cent from 187,000 cars in 1990
to 172,000 cars, though sales recovered last year, rising by 16 per cent to
200,000 cars. This was achieved despite declines in Czechoslovak industrial
production of 30 per cent and 10 per cent in 1991 and 1992 respectively.
In 1990, two thirds of Skoda's production was sold on the home market, but
domestic sales fell sharply in 1991 as the government opened the market to
foreign imports. A flood of second-hand imports and the illegal export of
Skodas initially distributed to agents for the local market cut domestic
sales to around 27,000 cars. Mr Kohler says a high volume of exports to
Yugoslavia and Poland compensated for declining domestic sales. 'That saved
us in 1991,' he says. But the war in Yugoslavia, and Poland's imposition of
35 per cent tariffs (now 41 per cent) on car imports, badly hit exports last
year.
There are other pressing problems. Productivity is about 50 per cent of that
achieved by Japanese plants in the UK, and raising productivity is a
principal objective. 'Suppliers are our Achilles heel. Few can produce to
western standards,' Mr Kohler says.
Slovakia supplies Skoda with 55,000 tonnes of steel annually, aluminium and
rear axles, but payments through the clearing system established between the
two countries is inefficient and costly.
On the plus side, Skoda's new owners inherited a relatively modern plant.
Turnover has risen rapidly from CzK14bn in 1991 when the company made a loss
of CzK900m, to CzK28bn last year when it made a small profit. The main plant
and its two subsidiaries employ 17,000 workers, and finding new workers is
not a problem with the average monthly pay of skilled workers at CzK6,000
(Dollars 210), about 20 per cent higher than in other local industries, Mr
Smutny says. Czech managers receive around CzK13,000.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Berisford talks to Clark over bid: Board of shoe company yet
to decide as commodities group renegotiates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERISFORD International, the property and commodities group, yesterday met
the board of C&amp;J Clark to renegotiate elements of its Pounds 160m-plus bid
for the family owned shoe manufacturer.
Observers were speculating that the Berisford bid, the highest by a small
margin, could well have won favour a majority of the board.
The property and commodities group is thought to be renegotiating some of
the conditions of its offer. These include exclusive rights of due diligence
and an indemnity for costs if a majority of the board agreed to recommend
Berisford, but shareholders rejected the bid.
Clark yesterday said it had not decided on which of three bidders to
recommend and it planned to meet again on Friday. An announcement would be
made after shareholders had been informed. However, insiders said a majority
of the directors had decided, although a final attempt at reaching a
unanimous decision would be made this week.
At least four members of the 11-strong board have objected to a sale to any
of the bidders: Berisford, Fii the shoe manufacturer and a consortium of
existing shareholders backed by Electra Investment Trust. There is a fourth
institutional bidder which has been rejected.
If Berisford's offer wins approval, shareholders should expect that Clark
will be one of four divisions in the international holding company which Mr
Alan Bowkett, chairman of Berisford, intends to build.
Cost-cutting is likely to be a priority although - like all the bidders -
Berisford says it is committed to UK manufacturing.
Berisford intends to chase volume overseas, with opportunities in the
children's market. The Clark brand, Mr Bowkett believes, has languished for
too long as a mainly British product.
Berisford intends to keep the struggling retail division, but reposition the
products. Emphasis on fashion and keeping up with trend changes are key
elements of Berisford's strategy.
The other bidders, by contrast, aimed to make Clark their main business. Fii
would, in fact, treble its size if it succeeded in a bid for Clark. The
company is believed to have stressed to the board the opportunities
presented by combining its fashion-oriented range with Clark's children's
and casual shoe expertise.
It planned to introduce a high quality range of children's and casual shoes
to its main customer Marks &amp; Spencer.
Fii also sought to stress its commitment to UK manufacturing, and has said
its bid would not mean significant job losses.
The consortium, meanwhile, has made a bid in which existing shareholders
would be offered a 49 per cent stake in the business.
The new vehicle will back current management strategy, although under a new
leader. It would pursue 'global economies of scale' such as increasing the
investment in brand promotion, both at home and abroad.
Reebok for example, has been reported to spend some Pounds 190m a year on
advertising, while Clark spends a mere Pounds 5m. Yet Reebok is only twice
the size of Clark.
The emphasis would be on the group's strength in the children's and men's
shoe market. The final goal of the institutions is a flotation in five
years.
However the board decides between these options, it is difficult to escape
one basic fact: the very public row which has rocked this intensely private
Quaker company for the past seven months is unlikely to disappear when the
board finally announces its decision.

FT  24 MAR 93 / BBA plans Pounds 125.9m rights issue and continental
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the engineering group, is raising Pounds 125.9m in a rights issue and
spending Pounds 86m on two acquisitions in continental Europe.
The move comes only a week after the Pounds 58m sale of a controlling stake
in Pacific BBA of Australia, which reduced gearing from 61 per cent to 44
per cent on a year-end basis. After paying for the acquisitions, the share
issue will cut it to 21 per cent.
The one-for-four issue, priced at 142p a share, comes less than two years
after BBA's last issue which raised Pounds 79.1m. After yesterday's
announcement, the share price slipped from a three-year high of 177p,
valuing the group at Pounds 555m, to 170p.
BBA said it intended to maintain its dividend at 7.5p this year, giving a
gross yield on the rights issue price of 6.6 per cent. The group has twice
dipped into reserves to pay an uncovered dividend.
BBA is buying two electrical engineering companies making coils, instrument
transformers and high-voltage testing equipment. About Pounds 53.9m is being
paid for the companies and Pounds 32.2m taken on in debt.
Haefely, based in Switzerland, is costing a total of SFr146.5m (Pounds 65m),
including SFr36.5m debt. Last year it made SFr17.7m operating profit - twice
the 1990 level - on sales of SFr152.4m.
The second acquisition, MWB, is German. About three quarters of its DM50.8m
(Pounds 21m) cost is debt. MWB made DM3m operating profit on turnover of
DM74.3m last year.
Mr Ian Williamson, chief executive of engineering products, said Haefely and
MWB would join Trench, a Canadian company, to create a group focused on
electrical power distribution equipment. In a full year they add about
Pounds 100m to group turnover, which totalled Pounds 1.32bn in 1992, and
increase the strength of the industrial division with Pounds 35m at the
operating level on sales of Pounds 486m.
Mr John White, managing director, said the group - which also has automotive
and aviation divisions - now had 'sufficient cores'. It would continue to
sell non-core activities.
At the year-end the group's net debt was Pounds 227.5m. By the end of this
year it expected debt to be about Pounds 150m, with gearing of 31 per cent.
The group regarded its 'comfort level' for gearing as 40 per cent.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nestle raises its stake in San
Pellegrino to 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss foods group which controls Perrier, has tightened links
with Italy's leading mineral water brand, San Pellegrino, by lifting its
stake from 20 per cent to 25 per cent, writes Haig Simonian.
The stake is being acquired for an undisclosed sum from the Mentasti family,
which controls two-thirds of the capital.
The purchase has been accompanied by an agreement for Nestle to distribute
San Pellegrino products to bars and restaurants in France and Belgium.
Links between Perrier, which Nestle bought last year after a battle with the
Agnelli family, and San Pellegrino stretch back some time.
Perrier bought 35 per cent of the Italian brand in 1972 and disposed of 15
per cent last year shortly before coming under the control of Nestle.
San Pellegrino, based near Bergamo in northern Italy, raised its turnover by
15 per cent to L429bn (Dollars 271m) last year, with foreign sales surging
by over more than 40 per cent.
The closer alliance with San Pellegrino will allow Nestle to distribute a
broader mix of mineral waters.
While Perrier is the world leader and the Vittel brand, which is also
controlled by Nestle, is a leading still water, San Pellegrino claims that
it is the most popular water ordered with meals, as opposed to being drunk
independently.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Woman who could break the Austrian mould: Heide Schmidt's
new-found popularity is a significant addition to the whole political
landscape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN it comes to stirring up Austria's normally somnolent politics, Mr Jorg
Haider, the rowdy right-wing populist, has proven a master in the past
couple of years.
But in the end it may be Mrs Heide Schmidt, a mild-mannered liberal, who
actually succeeds in breaking the strange conservative-socialist alliance
that has run the country for much of the post-war period.
Mrs Schmidt, a former ombudsman turned politician, last month led four
parliamentary colleagues in defecting from Mr Haider's Austrian Freedom
party (FPO) and setting up a new Liberal Forum.
The five had long been disenchanted with Mr Haider's mercurial behaviour,
but hung on in the hope that, one way or another, matters would improve.
Their hopes ended when he launched an inflammatory petition campaign in
January to demonstrate the strength of grass-roots support for his demand
that the government get tougher with immigrants.
'To take the risk that something really terrible could happen - that was too
much for me,' Mrs Schmidt says. 'To use anxiety as a policy instrument is
not liberal.'
While their numbers are not large, the defectors can claim a significance
beyond their size. For one thing, their departure means that the FPO, with
only 28 seats left in the 183-seat legislature, is no longer a potential
power in coalition-making.
Also, the defections have probably taken the steam out of the FPO's rapid
advance.
The party's popularity has nearly doubled from its 10 per cent level in the
1986 national election, thanks to Mr Haider's appeal to a new generation of
right-wing dissidents. Now, however, it risks losing the traditional liberal
part of the party's base.
In Mrs Schmidt, liberals have a popular and effective spokeswoman for their
cause. Although she was elected to parliament only in 1990, she achieved
national exposure last year when Mr Haider picked her to be the FPO's
candidate to replace the disgraced Mr Kurt Waldheim as president.
While she won no more than the FPO's acknowledged 17 per cent of the vote,
she left a strong impression on Austrian voters. According to a recent
opinion poll, more than half of them would like to see her in a responsible
position in the government.
Whether that popularity can be translated into votes for the Liberal Forum
in the general elections due next year remains to be seen, but at least it
has got the other parties thinking.
'This is a sign for the whole political landscape,' says Mr Erhard Busek,
vice-chancellor and head of the conservative Austrian People's party (OVP).
Mrs Schmidt herself is cautious about the prospects. She is confident that
the Forum will get the 4 per cent of the popular vote required to gain
recognition as a parliamentary party, but anything more she will consider a
bonus.
'It is not easy to get over that level because so many voters are tied to
the big parties,' she says.
Her hope, rather like that of the Social Democratic party in Britain a
decade ago, is that discontent with the two ruling parties will work to her
advantage.
Certainly, discontent is substantial. In the 1990 election, the OVP's
support fell from 45 per cent to 30 per cent, and there is no indication
that the decline has since halted.
The Socialists held their vote share at 40 per cent, but only because of the
personal popularity of Mr Franz Vranitzky, the party's leader and
chancellor.
That sounds promising for the Forum, but the danger is that, like the SDP in
Britain, it will find itself squeezed when one or both of the leading
parties regains popularity.
There is also a risk of being identified as merely a front for one of the
parties. Rumours in Vienna have it that when Mrs Schmidt and her colleagues
were thinking of breaking away from the FPO, they were encouraged by Mr
Heinz Fischer, the socialist speaker of parliament.
Mr Fischer's view was that the new Liberal Forum would win enough seats in
the next election so that it and the socialists, now the largest party in
parliament with 80 seats, could form a coalition without having to include
the conservative OVP.
'It is a rumour,' Mrs Schmidt concedes. But she adds that it would be
foolish to set up any alliance before the elections.
'We do not know which way the election will go. When I was in the FPO, I was
asked often which party I would prefer to form an alliance with, and I never
answered. You have to deal. That is the normal democratic parliamentary
way.'
The Forum has not yet worked out a formal platform, but Mrs Schmidt makes
clear that it will be pure liberal - with the emphasis on individual rights
and open markets.
The party will also take a very strong stand in favour of Austria joining
the European Community, not least to distance itself from Mr Haider who
vacillates on this issue.
Mrs Schmidt has had her share of difficulties with Mr Haider - he briefly
withdrew his support for her during the presidential campaign last year -
but she refuses to smear him.
'It is wrong to describe him as a neo-Nazi or as an extremist,' she says.
Rather, she sees him as excessively competitive.
'There is a lack of democratic thinking in his way of fighting. He sees
things too much in terms of black and white, rather than accepting that we
are a pluralistic society.
'He really wants to beat the old parties; he says things like 'They have to
be destroyed'. I think that if you are in politics you must respect limits.'

SHANGHAI Vacuum, the first Chinese company to offer shares to foreigners,

But the surge was due to an increase in 'investment income', it said, not to
a boom in its business of manufacturing tubes for televisions.
Investors marked down its B shares by 5 US cents to 45 cents yesterday.

<TEXT>
SHANGHAI Vacuum, the first Chinese company to offer shares to foreigners,
has reported a 311 per cent leap in attributable profits and a doubling of
turnover for the year to December 31.
However, the profits surge was due to an increase in what the company
described as 'investment income' and not due to a boom in its business of
manufacturing tubes for colour televisions. The source of the investment
income was not disclosed.
Investors reacted indifferently to the figures, marking down Shanghai
Vacuum's B shares - denominated in dollars - by 5 cents to 45 cents
yesterday. This is partly a reflection of a continuing slide in the Shanghai
market.
The directors announced a dividend of 3.5 cents per B share and a one-for-10
bonus issue.
Shanghai Vacuum is also proceeding with a seven-for-10 rights issue at 44
cents, a 1 cent cent discount to yesterday's closing price. The rights issue
would raise about Dollars 92m, assuming the shares are fully subscribed.
Attributable profits rose to Yn72.9m (Dollars 12.7m) on turnover of
Yn1.02bn. The company expects turnover to be much the same for 1993, and
profits to be up by more than 20 per cent.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Eni to rationalise foreign units
after Italian scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENI, the state-owned energy and chemicals concern implicated in Italy's
political corruption scandal, plans to rationalise its network of foreign
subsidiaries.
The aim is to improve transparency and accountability at the group, which
had sales of L50,883bn (Dollars 32bn) in 1991 and has 209 subsidiaries
registered abroad.
The Eni group comprises the parent company and 12 main subsidiaries, all but
one of which, Eni International Holding, are based in Italy.
The biggest subsidiaries in terms of sales are Snam, involved in gas supply
and distribution; EniChem, Italy's biggest chemicals concern; Agip, the
upstream oil and gas operation; and Agip Petroli, which handles the
downstream side of the oil business.
While Eni International Holding, a purely financial operation, has four
subsidiaries, all abroad, Eni's other big subsidiaries have many of their
operations registered outside Italy.
Agip Petroli and EniChem together have around 60 non-Italian companies,
while Agip has 30 subsidiaries registered abroad. Among the most common
locations are financial centres or tax havens, such as Geneva and Jersey.
Details of the streamlining are still vague, but the changes are expected to
affect mainly the Eni group's financial subsidiaries or holding companies.
Eni has become a focus for investigations into political corruption and
illegal financing of Italy's main political parties. Mr Gabriele Cagliari,
chairman, and the heads of three big subsidiaries are still in a Milan jail
after being arrested earlier this month. Mr Franco Ciatti, chairman of its
Nuovo Pignone turbines subsidiary, who was also detained, has now been
released.
Illegal payments to politicians and kickbacks on big contracts have
allegedly been channeled through Eni's foreign operations.
Political contributions were allegedly paid through profits from unbooked
foreign exchange transactions. In some cases, kickbacks for big equipment
orders were allegedly made through bank accounts held by foreign
subsidiaries.
Most of the foreign operations come under the control of Eni's subsidiaries.
The planned restructuring is to be spelled out by a special committee of the
group's board. It is supposed to tighten financial controls, partly by
working closely with leading international accounting and consulting firms.
Eni also plans to scale down Eni International Holding, its main foreign
financial operation, based in Amsterdam.
Eni International Holding, in turn, has foreign subsidiaries. These include
Eni International Bank, registered in Nassau with a capital of Dollars 160m,
and Hydrocarbons International Holding, based in Zurich and Luxembourg.
The annual meeting of Eni International Holding is to be brought forward to
early next month, when the small stake held in it by Enirisorse, Eni's
non-ferrous metals subsidiary, will be moved to the parent company.
Eni yesterday announced plans to sell Inca International, a small plastics
subsidiary of its EniChem chemicals arm. The company, which had sales of
L45bn last year, specialises in making bottles and packaging from plastics.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Comparex earnings halved to
DM15bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAREX, the computer supplier wholly owned by BASF Group of Germany, saw
profits after tax halved last year as hardware prices continued to fall in
tough trading conditions.
Turnover for the year totalled DM1.14bn, (Dollars 695m) about 9 per cent
lower than last year and 6 per cent lower than forecast.
Profits after tax were DM15m, half last year's total. The company said the
result was satisfactory as profits margins in the computer industry had
eroded steadily as prices fell.
Comparex markets mainframe computers manufactured by Hitachi of Japan and
peripherals of its own design. Computing services contributed 19 per cent of
total revenues for 1992, 3 per cent up on the previous year.

FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton talks tough on Nafta side pacts
</HEADLINE>

THE SIDE agreements it is proposed to attach to the North American Free
Trade Agreement must raise wages and clean up the environment on both sides
of the US-Mexican border, President Bill Clinton said yesterday.
Referring to the Nafta in language generally used by its opponents, he
acknowledged that the pact was 'not simply a trade agreement, this is also
an investment agreement'.
Because it would make Mexico a 'much more attractive' investment, the Bush
administration had negotiated rules protecting intellectual property and
investment. 'Shouldn't we also, in the interest of both the economies of
Mexico and the US, see that basic environmental standards and labour
standards are observed?' he said.
A few hours before the president spoke, his private sector and labour
advisers were briefed about the progress of the new Nafta negotiations. One
said labour union representatives now seemed hopeful they could use the
opportunity to strengthen labour law enforcement in both the US and Mexico.
The administration will try to satisfy labour in order to fend off attacks
by Mr Ross Perot, the former independent presidential candidate, who is
still loudly opposing Nafta.
'Its going to be a tough spring,' the adviser said. 'There is a problem
between the US and Canada, the US and Mexico, and the administration and the
Congress. Congress wants a lot of teeth. Our guys know wonder how they can
get teeth when they know (the enforcement provisions) work both ways.'
Mr Clinton referred in his press conference to a Bush administration foreign
aid programme in which the US 'spent taxpayers' money to encourage American
companies to invest in Central America who then went down there and actually
lowered wages instead of raising them in the host company'.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Norway talks will focus on fisheries
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERIES policy will be the main issue in the negotiations aimed at
admitting Norway to the European Community, European Commission officials
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
They said that the issue had been singled out in the Commission's 'opinion'
on Norway's application. This opinion is expected to be finalised at the
Commission's meeting today.
Officials underlined, however, that European fisheries policy had evolved
since Norwegian voters in a divisive referendum narrowly rejected European
Community membership in 1972.
One official said: 'I think what we would want to stress is that the
Community (body of law) on fisheries is different from 1972. . . We don't
expect a rerun of 1972.'
The Commission document also singles out Oslo's decision to resume
commercial whaling.
'Whaling will need to be discussed, but we cannot say at this stage what
will be acceptable and what will not,' an official said.
The opinion also echoes concerns expressed in the Commission's opinion on
Finland's application about the need to deal with the big differences
between Norway's agricultural system and the Common Agricultural Policy and
between the two sides' regional policies.
Norway's agricultural production prices are often double those in the EC,
and farmers, who have to deal with much harsher conditions, are paid more
support than they would be allowed under EC rules.
Officials said the opinion did not mention Norway's aversion to a draft
directive aimed at prising open the EC market for oil exploration,
prospecting and drilling as it has not yet been agreed at EC level.
Norway, Europe's biggest oil producer, opposes the plans, saying they would
interfere with its sovereignty to manage its resources.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Irish models in clothing VAT protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH models abandoned the catwalks yesterday to join an industry-wide
protest at the government's five percentage point increase in value added
tax on clothing and footwear at the beginning of the month.
Joined by sewing machine operators, shop assistants and jumper-knitters from
across the country, they formed a phalanx of several thousand people from
the Irish rag trade which converged on the Dail (parliament) to impress on
deputies that unless VAT rates are reduced, further job losses can be
expected in this much-depleted industry.
In three successive budgets since 1991, clothing and footwear VAT rates in
Ireland have more than doubled, from 10 per cent to the present 21 per cent,
making the Irish rate one of the highest in the EC.
A recent survey carried out by the Apparel Industries Federation showed as
many as a fifth of the 15,000 jobs in clothing manufacturing in Ireland are
likely to be lost because of the latest VAT increase. Like other industries
it is already suffering under high interest rates and the punt's strength
against sterling.
Mr Reg McCabe, the federation director, said: 'The effect of VAT is to
reduce industry margins; that threatens the profitability of companies and
their ability to maintain jobs. (The increase) makes it easier for retailers
in the republic to seek their supplies outside, particularly in the UK'.
Imported and domestically manufactured clothing is charged at the same 21
per cent VAT rate irrespective of origin, but the industry argues that the
latest increase will encourage cross-border shopping to Northern Ireland,
encourage chain stores to seek cheaper supplies abroad, and divert 5 per
cent of consumer spending on clothing into tax.
About 80 per cent of the apparel market is already supplied by imports into
Ireland; 50 per cent of the annual IPounds 230m (Pounds 233m) output from
Irish clothing makers is exported.

<TEXT>
MR Vladimir Dlouhi, Czech trade and industry minister, has warned banks they
must cut interest rates and be more active in helping restructure the Czech
economy.
'The banks' policies do not meet the needs of our economy. Interest rates
are too high for most enterprises. The banks must take at least part of the
risk (of restructuring) which we take,' Mr Dlouhi was quoted as saying at a
meeting in Znojmo, southern Moravia.
According to Czech news agency reports, he said the government was preparing
for 'serious negotiations' with the banks, and wanted to stress the need to
stimulate business. Interest rates for borrowing are running at 16-18 per
cent.
Mr Dlouhi said the government intended cutting high taxes and health
insurance for companies. Earlier, Mr Josef Tosovsky, central bank governor,
warned banks they faced big losses if businesses failed.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UN airlift for wounded Moslems: UK and French helicopters to
head for Srebrenica in key test for Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, LAURA SILBER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BELGRADE, VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Nations officials intend to launch a helicopter shuttle service today
to cross eastern Bosnia's battle lines and rescue wounded in the besieged
Moslem enclave of Srebrenica.
The operation is to be a test of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's
promise in New York to open a corridor to provide an escape for tens of
thousands of Moslems being pushed before advancing Bosnian Serbs.
Major Pepe Gallegos of the UN protection force said the operation would be
carried out by British and French helicopters.
Earlier, General Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander in Bosnia,
turned his wrath on to the Bosnian Moslems, after his heroic action to
relieve the besieged Moslem population of Srebrenica last week.
In a show of impartiality in keeping with his senior position in the UN's
peace-keeping operations in Bosnia, Gen Morillon accused the Moslem
authorities in the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla of bad faith in preventing
the evacuation of Serbs.
The general, who has been subject to some criticism from his military and
political superiors for allegedly behaving as 'a loose cannon', had asked Mr
Ejup Ganic, the Moslem Bosnian vice-president, to intervene in Tuzla, where
local government officials had gone back on a promise to let some Serbs
leave.
'I consider, at the present time, that their bad will is blocking the whole
peace process,' the general told reporters in the Serbian border town of
Mali Zvornik. 'I am only asking for the respect of the Geneva Convention.'
The UN commander said he would probably be obliged to go to Tuzla, probably
today, to sort things out.
Bosnian Serb leaders in the area have insisted that some 240 of their
compatriots should be allowed to leave Tuzla if aid convoys to Moslems cut
off in other towns and villages are to be permitted to move.
An aid convoy and a French field hospital attempting to reach Srebrenica
remained blocked yesterday, while trucks heading for the Moslem town of Zepa
were ordered to return by the UN, after having been held up by Serb
militiamen for nearly a week. The local Serb military commanders were
pursuing their obstructive tactics in spite of the announcement by Mr
Karadzic that he had given his agreement in principle for an air corridor to
be opened between Srebrenica and Tuzla.
The aid airlift is to be provided by French and British helicopters, which
would make as many as six flights a day. The Bosnian Serb news agency said
the corridor would be open for five days, but that this could be extended.
The difficulties on the ground in Bosnia occurred as the Bosnian Serb
leaders ordered a 'general mobilisation' in reply to the planned vote by the
UN security council to adopt a res-olution enforcing the no-fly ban over
Bosnia, first imposed last November. Though international observers have
been under the impression that most able-bodied Bosnian Serbs are already
fighting in the civil war against the Moslems, the call-up order was
intended to signal to the world that the Serbs would not take the ban lying
down.
Some diplomats feared that the UN resolution, while having little practical
effect on the war, would further hamper the peace negotiations in New York,
where there has not been a face-to-face meeting between the Bosnian Serb and
Moslem leaders for weeks.
Officials close to the talks said that the Moslem Bosnian president, Mr
Alijah Izetbegovic, was closer to signing the map on the division of the
country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces than Mr Karadzic.
But there was still a long way to go before either of them would be ready to
conclude a peace settlement.
Austria, already host to 60,000 refugees from Bosnia, will no longer accept
asylum-seekers from the region, according to Mr Franz Loeschnak, the
interior minister, Reuter reports from Vienna.
He was speaking after a meeting in Klagenfurt, southern Austria, with Mr Ivo
Bizjak, his Slovenian counterpart. 'I cannot perceive Austria accepting any
more refugees in the near future,' Mr Loeschnak said. He added it was now up
to other European countries to accept their full share of refugees from
former Yugoslavia.
'One part of Europe acts as if the consequences of the war in the Balkans
only affected the directly bordering states,' Mr Loeschnak said. He singled
out Britain for criticism in the refugee question. He said that despite
Austrian requests, London had granted entry to only 30 Bosnians out of 120
heading for Britain, who were stranded for days in freezing weather at the
Austrian border because of Britain's refusal to grant visas.
The refugees, including women and children, had been cared for by Austrians
who took them into their homes until permanent accommodation was found for
them.
Of the 60,000 refugees taken in by Austria, 46,000 are in the care of state
institutions. The remaining 14,000 are staying mainly with relatives or
friends. Mr Bizjak too said his small country's capacity to take in more
refugees was almost exhausted.

British governor Chris Patten for wider democracy. He was formerly chief

FT  24 MAR 93 / TUC condemns cost of closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSING each of the 31 threatened pits will cost between Pounds 8m to Pounds
10m more for each pit than keeping it open, says an assessment released
yesterday by the Trades Union Congress.
The TUC said its study showed that the total net costs of pit closures,
after taking into account unemployment benefit and tax losses, would be
Pounds 80m for the 10 pits earmarked for early closure and Pounds 320m for
all 31 pits.
The TUC called for immediate government action to 'create a larger market
for coal as recommended by the Commons trade and industry select committee'.
The committee called for measures widely interpreted as meaning expansion of
the coal market by at least 16m tonnes a year.
The government's white paper is likely to lead to considerably less
expansion.
The TUC study challenged the government's assertions that the costs of pit
closures would be short-lived and that saving pits would have a severe
impact on jobs elsewhere. It argued that the net additional costs of closing
pits would damage industry's competitiveness.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said closing pits made no economic
sense. The public should be told how much more it would cost to close pits
than to keep them open, he said.

<TEXT>
GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket operator in which
Germany's Tengelmann group holds a majority stake, yesterday reported a
Dollars 189.5m loss after tax in the year to February 27.
The loss contrasts with a Dollars 70.7m profit in the previous 12 months,
and comes on sales of Dollars 10.5bn, down from Dollars 11.6bn in 1991-92.
Much of the deficit is explained by a Dollars 151.2m write-off of A&amp;P's
investment in Isoceles, the UK company which bought out Gateway in a
leveraged deal, and a Dollars 90.1m charge related to accounting changes.
However, even at the operating level, A&amp;P posted sharply lower profits -
down from Dollars 203.9m in 1991-92, to Dollars 44.3m last year.
In the final quarter of the year, A&amp;P said it saw 'a reversal of the
company's previous sales decline, particularly in Canada', and added that it
had 'commenced its new financial year with an improving sales and
bottom-line performance'. Nevertheless, the company still reported a Dollars
40.1m loss after tax in the final three months, compared with a Dollars
16.1m profit in the same period a year earlier.
The operating profit fell to Dollars 18.9m from Dollars 46.4m. Final-quarter
sales were Dollars 2.38bn compared with Dollars 2.74bn. A&amp;P shares fell
Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 23 3/8.

<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the US credit-rating agency, yesterday downgraded its
rating on American Express, the travel and financial services group.
The American Express Credit Corporation was downgraded from AA- to A-Plus,
while commercial paper was downgraded from A-1-Plus to A-1 and preferred
stock from A-Plus to A.
S&amp;P said the downgrades reflected lower profitability at the core
travel-related services (TRS) division and the company's continuing card
member attrition rate. TRS, according to S&amp;P, faced increasing competitive
pressure, which is expected to continue to affect net earnings.
S&amp;P also pointed to the group's plan to sell a large shareholding in its
First Data Corporation subsidiary as one way of offsetting write-offs, such
as a Dollars 342m charge last year related to the restructuring of the TRS
division. The First Data offer began yesterday. But S&amp;P noted 'there may be
fewer such non-recurring gains available in the future to offset unforeseen
weaknesses.'
American Express said the ratings changes would have 'an insignificant
impact' on its funding costs.
Last year, losses at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and
brokerage subsidiary, helped cause a 65.4 per cent slump in fourth-quarter
1992 net income at American Express, to Dollars 82m.
American Express agreed earlier this month to sell the Shearson brokerage
business to Primerica, the financial services group headed by Mr Sandy
Weill. S&amp;P yesterday affirmed its A rating of Shearson's senior debt.

GILLETTE, the Boston-based toiletries and shaving products group, will post
its offer to acquire Parker Pen to shareholders of the UK company today,
after a US federal judge denied the US Justice Department's request for a
temporary restraining order.
The Justice Department announced on Monday that it was filing an anti-trust
suit, preventing Gillette from purchasing Parker Pen, on the grounds that
the deal would have an anti-competitive effect on the market for premium
fountain pens.
However, in spite of yesterday's ruling that Gillette can go ahead with the
posting of its Dollars 560m offer, a US court must still rule on the Justice
Department's request for a preliminary injunction barring the deal.
In the meantime, the US bidder - which is making its offer under UK takeover
rules, which incorporate a strict timetable for bids - will be unable to buy
shares in, or acquire control of, Parker Pen.

FT  24 MAR 93 / EC agrees scheme for voluntary ecological audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community environment ministers yesterday agreed on a
Community-wide ecological audit scheme. This will enable industrial
companies to sign up voluntarily to environmental protection goals they
themselves would set, but external auditors would verify.
The logic of the scheme is to use the market to stimulate continuous
improvement in environmental management by industry. Companies participating
in the scheme will have to make fully public the details of their
environmental performance, within agreed norms of commercial
confidentiality.
When the European Commission first drafted its proposals in 1990, eco-audits
were to have been mandatory for all industrial companies above a certain
size - and some industrialists fear the voluntary scheme will in time become
obligatory.
But the Commission and some companies which have already introduced
environmental auditing believe the voluntary mechanism will gradually be
seized on by businesses searching for competitive advantage in an
increasingly eco-conscious market. It is parallel to the similarly
market-based 'eco-label' scheme, agreed in December 1991, whereby companies
will apply for endorsement of their products as environmentally friendly
according to common EC standards.
Under the audit scheme qualifying companies would be able to publicise their
'green' credentials - probably through the EC emblem of 12 gold stars and a
statement indicating their participation. But they will not be able to use
the endorsement on product advertising or on products or their packaging.
The main qualifications for participating are:
putting in place environmental policies, goals and management systems;
systematic self-assessment, through site audits at intervals no greater than
three years;
full provision of information to the public on the results; independent
verification by external auditors - who will be put on licensed registers by
each member state, within 21 months of the scheme's start.
The regulation should come into force towards the end of this year, once
common standards are agreed by the Commission and the 12 member states.
Audits will contain, for example, figures on each site's pollution
emissions, waste output, consumption of raw materials, energy and water, and
noise levels; company policy, goals and eco-management of the site; and the
name of the accredited external auditor. Failure to meet deadlines or
serious auditor's queries could result in disqualification from the scheme.
The last remaining hold-up to yesterday's agreement was Germany's insistence
on higher qualifying thresholds. Companies, in Bonn's amendment, would have
had to 'reduce environmental impacts to levels not exceeding those
corresponding to best available technology'.
Several member states baulked at the potential cost implications of this
threshold and, led by the UK, inserted the nullifying qualification of
'economically viable' best available technology.
At Spain's insistence, small to medium-sized companies should get technical
assistance and training to help them participate.

<TEXT>
HUDSON'S BAY, Canada's biggest department store group, is taking over
troubled Woodward's, the oldest name in western Canada retailing. The deal
is estimated to be worth nearly CDollars 100m (USDollars 80.3m).
The Bay intends to turn some of Woodward's best store sites into Bay and
Zellers units. Bay's national market share will rise from 22 per cent to
almost 25 per cent.
'We will buy Woodward's shares and gain all its assets, including
accumulated tax losses,' said Mr Gary Lukassen, the Bay's executive
vice-president for finance.
The Toronto-based retailer, now 25 per cent owned by the Kennes Thomson
family, will dramatically raise its market share in western Canada and gain
valuable properties.
Woodward's had filed for court protection after heavy losses and mounting
debts. It had closed its Vancouver flagship store and laid off 1,500
employees.
In the nine months ended December 31 last, the company lost CDollars 80.6m
on revenues of CDollars 245m.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Squeeze costs exporters Pounds 1bn in lost credit cover:
Uncertainty persists over state reinsurance policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACUTE EXPORT credit capacity shortages and uncertainty over future
government policy on political risk reinsurance have led to at least Pounds
1bn in potential exports failing to win credit cover in recent months,
according to Mr Colin Foxall, managing director of NCM, Britain's leading
export credit agency.
Mr Foxall said yesterday that uncertainty over the plight of reinsurance for
short term export credit cover could result in up to 20 per cent of requests
for cover being turned down - worth up to Dollars 4bn in exports a year. NCM
accounts for 80 per cent of short-term credit insurance for UK exporters,
providing cover for more than Pounds 14bn of exports in 1992.
'The shoe is pinching in a number of areas, and it is inhibiting us in
supporting exporters,' Mr Foxall said.
For example, NCM has had to turn down requests from Siemens Plessey for
cover on sales of radar to China worth Pounds 10m, forcing the company to
seek alternative protection against non-payment.
'We are anything but alone in this,' said Mr Keith Johnson, a director at
Siemens Plessey and deputy chairman of the British Exporters' Association.
'We understand there are significant other contracts awaiting reinsurance
from the market, where there appears to be no more capacity, or the
government,' he said. He asked why the government had chosen to encourage
trade with China through three ministerial visits in one year without
ensuring reinsurance cover could be arranged.
Mr Foxall and Mr Johnson join voices ranging from the Confederation of
British Industry and the Institute of Export, to NSM's competitor, Trade
Indemnity, in demanding that the government abandon plans to withdraw from
reinsurance at the end of 1994. Britain would then be alone in Europe in
forcing the commercial market to meet short-term reinsurance needs.
They argue that withdrawal is misguided when the government has pledged to
encourage exports as a means of lifting the economy out of recession.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said last autumn the government was
committed to boosting Britain's share of world trade from 5.3 per cent to
6.3 per cent by the end of the decade, adding about Pounds 10bn to exports
at 1993 prices.
Mr Terry Bridgman, director of Trade Indemnity, added this week: 'British
industry stands to lose hundreds of millions of pounds of export orders. The
reinsurance market is prepared to play its part, but can only do so within
balance sheet limitations. Ministers are failing fully to appreciate the
urgency of the matter.'
Unavailability of export credit cover does not inevitably mean that an
export is lost, but acts as a powerful deterrent. The search for cover can
result in delay, which can lead to the loss of a contract.
Companies with overseas subsidiaries can also switch a bid to a country
where cover is more readily available, resulting in a loss of jobs and
exports from the UK.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Arts: Letters Home - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sylvia Plath killed herself 30 years ago in London. She put the children to
bed, blocked herself in the kitchen, and turned on the gas. She was 30. She
had warned: 'Never commit suicide, because something unexpected always
happens.' Her reputation flourished posthumously with Ariel (1965) and the
Pulitzer prizewinning Collected Poems (1981).
After leaving her middle class Boston home for a scholarship at Smith in
1950, Plath wrote 700 family letters - most to her mother, Aurelia - which
were gathered and published in 1975. They form a quasi-public diary, the
basis for Rose Leiman Goldemberg's dramatisation, Letters Home. It makes
fine reading, potentially wonderful radio, but poor theatre.
First, Letters Home lacks the poetry that redeemed Plath and which excused
the indulgent misery. Second, the play fails to admit that other people's
depressions are not intrinsically dramatic; and third, it fails to make
written letters live as voices and interactions between two people. The
acting is intimate and sharp, with fast cutting between Hildegard Neil as
Aurelia and Daryl Back as Sylvia. Sometimes the accent of north-east America
evades them, but they conjure a community and history out of the material,
moved along by Ian Rimington's swift direction.
However, much can be learned of Plath, the poet who kept bees. Her
depression prompted her to write home frequently: of a missed date or a fall
science course at Smith, of the heady meeting and marriage to Ted Hughes in
Cambridge, of babies and of the looming divorce. All facets of Plath's
relations were underpinned by a desire for oblivion. She had attempted
suicide in 1953, and she spent the summer in therapy and undergoing
electro-convulsive treatment. She returned to college to write about Fyodor
Dostoyevsky. During a period of depression in the winter of 1962-63, Sylvia
Plath produced what many consider to be her best work, putting her alongside
the other great modern American writers who also suffered from depression:
Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton and John Berryman. On the one hand, Letters Home
offers nothing consolatory, and on the other, nothing to show that in
Plath's case, reformation was necessary and despair criminal.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Clarke hints at sentence reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the home secretary, yesterday indicated that the
government would review the rules on the sentencing of criminals, following
criticism by the Lord Chief Justice.
Lord Justice Taylor said the 1991 Criminal Justice Act had been founded on a
'misconceived notion' which restricted judges' discretion. A desire to
reduce custodial sentencing had led to 'restrictive provisions forcing the
judge into an ill-fitting straitjacket'.
These included rules which stopped magistrates taking into account previous
convictions.
Mr Clarke told BBC Radio: 'Plainly, if the act is not working as it is
intended we must revisit it and change it.
'I totally agree that somebody who comes before the court having committed
many burglaries is a more serious criminal than a man who has committed
burglary for the first time.'

FT  24 MAR 93 / Plans to mothball mines expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, PHILIP STEPHENS and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR met more than half the cabinet last night to finalise details
of the government's proposed lifeline for coal mines threatened with
closure.
The cabinet committee discussed a draft white paper, which sets out in broad
terms how the coal market could be expanded, and aims to avert a threatened
revolt by Tory MPs.
The government, which is understood to believe that around a dozen of the 31
threatened pits could be kept open at least in the short term, is also
believed to have drawn up plans to mothball indefinitely up to six others.
The aim is to reassure Tory critics that reserves of deep-mined coal would
not necessarily be wasted.
The mothballed pits would be open to bids from the private sector once
legislation to privatise the industry was passed by the Commons.
The plans centre on a limited Treasury subsidy to make UK coal more
competitive, but this may last only a year or two, while the privatisation
of British Coal would be speeded up.
Treasury ministers have resisted offering a subsidy above about Pounds 500m.
The paper is likely to be published tomorrow after formal approval by the
full cabinet. Downing Street indicated that Mr Major may press ahead with
the white paper plans before publication even if core contracts are not
formally agreed between British Coal and the electricity generators.
Publication will be followed by an intensive campaign to win over waverers
on the Tory back benches.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, would face pressure to
resign if the package failed to win the support of MPs.
Intensive energy users are hoping the white paper will encourage moves
enabling them to bypass the electricity wholesale pool and reduce their
electricity bills.
On Monday the British Management Data Association, an independent
organisation backed by 25 companies, presented a proposal to ministers that
the association says would provide British Coal with more security.
Under the proposal large companies including Imperial Chemical Industries,
would sign long-term deals with generators for coal-fired electricity.
Analysts were sceptical yesterday about whether the scheme would increase
demand for coal.
Meanwhile PowerGen said it had signed an eight-year deal with Electricite de
France to supply electricity. Analysts believe it could help save one of the
threatened pits.

FT  24 MAR 93 / 1,400 jobs to go at naval bases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER WEEKS of delay, the government yesterday confirmed that 1,400 jobs
will be lost at Portland and Portsmouth naval bases.
A provisional announcement was made in November that more than 1,000 jobs
would go, but a final decision was delayed because of concern at the
political fall-out from rising job losses.
Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, said in a Commons written answer
that the Portland base in Dorset will close by April 1996, and its sea
training operations will be transferred to Devonport, Plymouth. This will
save an estimated Pounds 70m over 10 years.
More than 1,000 service and civilian jobs will be lost at Portland, but Mr
Hamilton said consultations were continuing with the unions about the
implications. The Ministry of Defence will also be working with local
authorities to investigate alternative commercial uses for the naval base.
The minister also confirmed that the fleet maintenance and repair
organisation at Portsmouth will be reduced, involving the shedding of 400
civilian jobs and leaving a workforce of about 1,800.
Ship refitting will cease at Portsmouth by this summer, although
Portsmouth-based vessels will return there for maintenance work. Refitting
work will be transferred to the royal dockyards at Devonport, and Rosyth in
Fife.
The announcement, part of the continuing effect of the so-called peace
dividend and the government's Options for Change defence programme, was
delayed because of the news of 5,000 job losses at Rolls-Royce.
Defence industries and tourism have traditionally been the biggest employers
at Portland, and local unemployment is expected now to rise to about 16 per
cent.

FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton hits out over Japan trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, HAWAII
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday launched his toughest attack yet on
Japanese trading practices, claiming that the prospects for fair access to
Japanese markets were 'somewhat remote'.
He also bluntly reaffirmed his opposition to the Bush administration's
decision to allow Japanese minivans to enter the US at low tariff rates. The
US motor industry is seeking an increase in these tariffs from 2.5 per cent
to 25 per cent.
He said he was 'astonished' that the previous administration 'overruled its
own customs office and gave a Dollars 300m a year freebie to the Japanese
for no apparent reason. And we got nothing, and I emphasise nothing, in
return'.
The president's onslaught at yesterday's news conference was provoked by a
question on minivans. But it coincides with critical bilateral negotiations
on semiconductors in Hawaii, and suggests that Mr Clinton, like several of
his senior advisers, is increasingly inclined to pursue quantitative
sectoral targets as a way of reducing Japan's trading surplus with the US,
which last year exceeded Dollars 50bn (Pounds 35.2bn). The Japanese
government, however, is determined to end the use of market share targets,
over which, it says, it has no control.
At yesterday's Hawaii talks, the US pressed Japan to maintain 'gradual and
steady progress' in opening its semiconductor market by achieving an average
20 per cent foreign market share in 1993. Japanese officials said, however,
that they would 'reject out of hand' any suggestions for further use of
numerical indicators of progress in semiconductor trade. Japan is also
determined to avoid the approach in any future trade agreements with the US.
Mr Clinton said yesterday he still hoped to engage the Japanese government
in a dialogue 'across a whole broad range of issues'. He implied that he
wanted to put the minivan case 'in the context of a larger set of trade
issues before acting unilaterally'.
But he noted that whereas the balance of US trade with the EC, Taiwan and
Korea had fluctuated over the years, 'the one that never seems to change
very much is the one with Japan'.
He went on: 'The persistence of the surplus the Japanese enjoy with the US
and the rest of the developed world can only lead one to the conclusion that
the possibility of obtaining real and even access to the Japanese market is
somewhat remote'.

THE SIDE agreements it is proposed to attach to the North American Free
Trade Agreement must raise wages and clean up the environment on both sides
of the US-Mexican border, President Bill Clinton said yesterday.
Referring to Nafta in language generally used by its opponents, he
acknowledged that the pact was 'not simply a trade agreement, this is also
an investment agreement'. Because it would make Mexico a 'much more
attractive' investment, the Bush administration had negotiated rules
protecting intellectual property and investment. 'Shouldn't we also, in the
interest of both the economies of Mexico and the US, see that basic
environmental standards and labour standards are observed?' he said.

THE days of Judge William Sessions as head of the FBI appear to be numbered.
Yesterday President Bill Clinton said he was waiting on a report from Ms
Janet Reno, the new attorney general, before determining the director's
fate.
He also pointedly declined to confirm or deny reports of the existence of a
short list to succeed Judge Sessions. Prominent on the list was said to be
Mr Richard Stearns, now a state judge in Massachussetts but Mr Clinton's
contemporary as a Rhodes Scholar in England and like the president, a
campaign worker for Senator George McGovern in 1972.
The FBI director came under heavy fire from the outgoing Bush
administration, which accused him of misuse of public funds for private
purposes. His stock had risen a little lately because of early FBI arrests
in the World Trade Centre bombing. The administration was also reported not
to want to remove him while the siege of a religious cult outside Waco,
Texas, drags on.
A further indication of of the administration's drive to purge law
enforcement of Republican officials was provided yesterday when Ms Reno
asked for the resignations of all US attorneys (federal prosecutors) from
around the country.
Ms Reno said she wanted to 'begin to build a team that represents. . . my
views and the views of President Clinton.' US attorneys are political
appointees, but more than 90 Republicans have continued to serve. There is
one potential controversy to her action yesterday. The Republican US
attorney in Washington, Mr Jay Stephens, has been aggressively investigating
allegations of corruption against Mr Dan Rostenkwoski, powerful Democratic
chairman of the House ways and means committee.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Spanish socialists reel from a body blow: Finance
allegations by tax inspectors embarrass the party as election looms
</HEADLINE>

   By PETER BRUCE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S RULING socialist party was yesterday struggling to ride a political
body blow, after Spanish tax inspectors confirmed reports that the party had
systematically financed itself illegally in the late 1980s by selling
phantom consulting services to big business.
The revelations come as polls show the socialists already slipping badly
ahead of a general election later this year.
They are suffering the effects of a deepening recession and the knock-on
effect of last weekend's Socialist defeat in France.
Legal confirmation of illicit financing, after two years of vehement denials
by the party leadership, has renewed opposition hopes that corruption will
become a decisive issue ahead of the election.
The inspectors, on secondment from the Finance Ministry to a judge
investigating socialist party financing, said late on Monday that consulting
companies operated by senior party officials had taken receipts of some
Pta1bn (Pounds 5.75m) from some of Spain's largest banks and industrial
companies between 1987 and 1990.
For the past two years, newspapers have been alleging that these companies -
including Banco Central, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Asea Brown Boveri's Spanish
subsidiary, Catalana de Gas and the Pryca supermarket chain - paid money to
two companies in return for expensive reports on their sectors of business.
Hardly any of the companies have since been able to produce reports for
which they paid, on occasion, more than Pta100m, some saying they have been
lost.
The inspectors implied that those reports which had been produced had been
hastily cobbled together by the business clients.
They said these clients owed about Pta437m in unpaid taxes.
The 'consulting' companies involved, Filesa and Time Export, were controlled
by Mr Carlos Navarro, the former treasurer of the socialist parliamentary
party, and Mr Josep Maria Sala, administrative secretary of the Catalan
socialist party and a member of the party's national executive.
The two men, said the inspectors, excercised 'active de jure and/or de facto
ownership and management' of the companies.
Money taken from business 'clients' was then used to pay socialist election
expenses and, to disguise that, they took receipts not from party suppliers
but from companies run by Ms Aida Alvarez, the socialist party's national
financial co-ordinator until 1986.
The socialist party said yesterday that it would not try to protect the
parliamentary immunity of anyone implicated in the scandal, but it is not
clear whether the investigating judge, Mr Marino Barbero, will now begin
trial proceedings.
If he does so before an election, the political cost to the socialists could
be huge.
The Filesa report is embarrassing for Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who
has sharply criticised Judge Barbero for making searches of party
headquarters in Madrid, implying that the probe is politically motivated.
The report marks probably the lowest point socialist fortunes have reached
since the last election in 1989.
Mr Gonzalez is likely to try to regain some political ground in a state of
the nation address next month in which he is widely expected to announce an
anti-corruption drive.
With polls now showing the socialists level-pegging with the conservative
opposition, the Partido Popular, it is far from certain, though, that he has
not already lost too much momentum.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Germany leads push for EC energy tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SIX EC member states, led by Germany, yesterday all but signed up to the
European Commission's controversial proposal for an energy tax to combat
global warming. They said that if measures including the tax were not in
place by the year-end date the EC has set itself to ratify the Rio Climate
Change Convention, 'ratification of the convention has to be reconsidered'.
Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg made clear
their conviction that, without the tax, meeting the EC commitment under Rio
of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000 'is not
possible'. Their joint demarche is recorded in the minutes to Monday's and
yesterday's debate on climate change by between EC environment ministers
meeting here.
It will give added evidence to the current Danish presidency of the EC's new
push to get the tax through, but risks a damaging north-south split in EC
environmental policy.
Denmark has called an extraordinary council of energy and environment
ministers for April 23 in Luxembourg to discuss the tax and the EC's
greenhouse gas strategy.
The joint declaration of the six comes as the European Commission published
details of each member state's programme to comply with the stabilisation
target - showing that national efforts without the EC-wide tax would lead to
a 3 per cent increase in CO emissions in 2000 over 1990 levels.
The tax puts Dollars 3 (Pounds 2.10) on each barrel of oil equivalent,
rising to Dollars 10 by 2000, and falling half on the fuel content of all
non-renewable fuel and half on its carbon content.
It is being strongly resisted by energy-intensive industries such as
chemicals, steel and paper producers. The poorer southern countries oppose
it, arguing that the richer northern countries which emit most CO should cut
proportionately more. The UK is sceptical about any EC-wide tax and says it
can meet the stabilisation target through its own efforts, including
recently announced fuel taxes.
Of the six countries that came out unequivocally in favour of the tax
yesterday, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Holland intend significant cuts in
their 1990 emissions by 2000, while Italy and Luxembourg - like the UK - are
aiming at stabilisation.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: Navy admits dumping nuclear reactors at
sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has admitted the Soviet navy sank nuclear submarines and radioactive
materials in its northern seas.
An official report seen by the Financial Times paints a chilling picture of
secret pollution which began in 1959. The report, drawing on KGB and
military documents declassified on the orders of President Boris Yeltsin,
was drawn up after a ship from Greenpeace, the environmentalist
organisation, was seized by the Russian navy for trying to measure the
radioactivity last October.
Between 1959 and 1992, 18 reactors from nuclear submarines were dumped at
sea after accidents or decommissioning, as well as a reactor from the
nuclear-powered ice-breaker Lenin which was simply put on to a barge and
sunk. Seven of the reactors, complete with their submarines and dangerous
nuclear fuel, were dumped into the northern Kara and Barents seas after
on-board accidents made them too dangerous to handle.
The report says that 2.3m curies of radioactive material - 50m curies was
released by the world's worst nuclear accident, at Chernobyl - was dumped
into the sea over this period. It specifies where and when the dumping was
carried out.
But Professor Alexei Yablokov, the presidential adviser who led the
commission which produced the report, said research was now needed to
determine the harm done to the environment and draw up steps to repair the
damage.
'We don't know the extent of the danger because there is no data on what
radioactivity seeped into the ecosystem. Maybe nothing terrible happened.
But maybe it did get into fish and will then go on to human beings.'
Mr Yeltsin has ordered the government to draw up a programme to deal with
the issue. He has also instructed Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister,
to circulate the report among the international community.
Greenpeace has urged the Group of Seven industrialised companies to consider
urgent assistance for Russia to deal with what it describes as the Russian
navy's 'deadly cold war legacy'.
Russian nuclear submarines are continuing to dump liquid radioactive waste
at sea for lack of on-shore storage and reprocessing facilities. Britain,
France and the US, the other countries to operating nuclear submarines, as a
rule return the waste back to land.
Despite signing in 1976 the London Convention banning disposal of highly
radioactive materials at sea the Soviet Union ignored the ban.

FT  24 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: Yugoslav peace talks in peril as
Karadzic leaves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Yugoslav peace talks in New York appeared in doubt last night as Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, withdrew and prepared to fly home. Lord
Owen, one of the two international mediators, said Mr Karadzic refused to
sign the proposed map dividing Bosnia. The UN Security Council again put off
voting on a plan to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia. The delay was caused
by Russian efforts to restrain the proposed action, mainly aimed against the
Serbs.
A UN airlift to evacuate wounded Moslems from the besieged Bosnian town of
Srebrenica was due to begin early today, carried out by British and French
helicopters. The commander of UN peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, General
Philippe Morillon, said he had reached agreement with Moslems to evacuate
Serb families from the Moslem city of Tuzla.
Meanwhile, Austria, host to 60,000 refugees from Bosnia, said it would no
longer accept asylum-seekers from the region.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clyde calls for Pounds 34m as losses hit
Pounds 40m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLYDE Petroleum, the UK exploration and production company, yesterday called
on shareholders for Pounds 34m and at the same time reported a 1992
after-tax loss of Pounds 39.8m.
The loss reflected a change in accounting policy and the subsequent
write-off of Pounds 42.3m of costs of unsuccessful exploration. The year
earlier net loss was a restated Pounds 1.2m after a Pounds 32.7m write-off.
Turnover dropped to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 87.2m)
Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the rights issue would give the company a
cash cushion following the go-ahead of its development of the Gryphon field
in the North Sea later this year. 'This is a major sea-change within Clyde -
we're moving to the fast track development of Gryphon,' he said.
Originally, Gryphon was due to come on stream in 1996 but Clyde now plans to
start production in the final quarter of this year. That would involve
investment of Pounds 90m - Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in Gryphon - this
year which would push the company's debt to equity ratio to over 100 per
cent. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said: 'We're at a peak of our
expenditure this year and the rights issue will help keep that under
control'.
The rights issue, of 79.86m shares on a 1-for-4 basis, will give Clyde the
flexibility to continue its exploration programme overseas while it proceeds
with UK developments.
Cashflow will increase to Pounds 350m next year as the company's production
rises to 55,000 barrels a day in the second quarter from a current level of
23,874 b/d.
With the strong cashflow, the company plans to pay down its debt quickly and
reduce gearing from the 100 per cent level to 60 per cent by 1994 and 15 per
cent by the end of 1996.
The company is looking at break-even this year with possibly a small profit
or loss. For 1994, when it hopes to return to profit, it plans to pay an
interim dividend of 0.5p followed by a final of 1p.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Belgian coalition facing collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S governing coalition headed for collapse yesterday after ministers
failed to agree how to bring the country's worsening budget deficit in line
with the strict Maastricht criteria for European economic and monetary
union.
King Baudouin was last night considering whether to accept the resignation
of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene's centre-left government, formed just over a year
ago.
The king will consult political advisers before taking his decision.
The criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty have come in for severe
criticism over the last year, as it has become clear that deepening
recession will make it difficult for most EC member states to meet the
economic conditions for monetary union by the first deadline of 1997.
But Mr Dehaene, a Flemish-speaking Christian Democrat, denied that his
coalition had cracked under the Maastricht pressure. 'Belgium remains a firm
supporter of the Maastricht treaty and economic and monetary union. We need
economic and monetary union more than ever,' he said. 'The source of this
crisis is not a dispute over whether we need to meet the convergence
criteria; it's about how we're going to meet that objective.'
Belgium's annual budget deficit reached BFr485bn (Pounds 10bn) last year, or
6.9 per cent of GNP, compared with the 1996 Maastricht target of 3 per cent.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (8): Complaining in
code - The early results of tougher lending criteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL COMPANIES in the UK and the US have complained bitterly about their
treatment at the hands of banks. In Japan the complaints may be more coded,
but they are just as heartfelt.
Bad loan books, weak balance sheets and a declining capital base have forced
Japan's commercial banks to tighten up their lending criteria - perhaps even
more so than their western counterparts. At the same time the slump in stock
prices has cut off access to equity capital for most companies. And much of
the equity warrant related finance raised in the heyday of the boom economy
is due to be repaid in the next 18 months.
A great deal has been made of the tidal wave of some Y10,000bn of
warrant-backed paper which companies will have to refinance in 1993, but it
would appear to be the least serious of the problems.
Most of the money was raised by large blue chip companies which either do
not need to replace the borrowings because of falling capital expenditure,
or have little difficulty raising money from banks, insurance companies or
the bond market. According to Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith of Credit Suisse Japan,
some 70 per cent of this year's capital requirement may already have been
financed through straight bond issues.
As short term interest rates have fallen, bonds have become a more
attractive investment for many institutions, so blue chip companies have
found a ready market. And while the dividends of 5-6 per cent which
companies are having to pay on new bond issues are well above the near-zero
cost of capital of the bubble economy years, the higher interest bill is
only a modest drain on corporate cashflows.
Because banks and insurance companies are now more cautious, but still need
to book assets, competition to lend to high quality companies is, if
anything, more intense than it was in the 1980s.
Mr Hideya Kubo of Nippon Life highlights the dilemma: 'We are keen to expand
our lending to quality companies, but it is very hard at present because so
few companies want to borrow. With a significant rise in the stockmarket
unlikely, and yields on shares too low, we have been forced to hold a lot of
domestic bonds. And now that yields on these have fallen too, we may have to
consider more overseas bonds as well.'
Nippon Life is also trying to establish more regional relationships in Japan
so that it can increase its lending to large regional companies outside the
Tokyo area. 'We have established contacts with over 400 new companies in the
last year,' says Mr Kubo.
Still, even if large companies can get the limited finance they need as they
struggle to strengthen their balance sheets, small companies face a harder
time. In February the Japanese ministry of finance publicly called on the
banks to make more loans to small companies: a tacit admission that there is
a credit crunch in some sectors at least. This contradicts the banks'
argument that they have only returned to pre-bubble criteria for assessing
loans, and that they have not become overly conservative.
Mr Yasuo Noda, managing director of Dai-Ichi Kango Bank, puts the case: 'It
is true that growth in lending is low, but that partly reflects borrowers
balance sheet needs. Demand for loans is falling too. We can earn a higher
spread from lending to small firms so we do want to lend to good small
companies.'
The difficulty comes in judging what is a creditworthy small business. Mr
Noda acknowledges that while bank managers are under instructions not to
overreact, there may be a natural tendency to become over-cautious when so
much lending has gone bad in recent years.
And Mr Kenji Mitzutani, the senior managing director at Tokai bank, admits
that 'small companies may find it more difficult to get further loans,
particularly if they want to use property as collateral.'
The property issue is important because in many cases it is the only
security small businesses can offer. Prices of residential land have fallen
by about a third, but there are no reliable figures for commercial property
because the market has simply dried up. Some analysts think that the
property market may fall by another quarter before it hits bottom.
Difficulty in valuing any collateral on offer is one more reason for banks
to be nervous. Many companies, even quite small ones, have made life harder
for themselves by speculating in the boom years and coming to grief.
For example, Yanmar, an agricultural tools manufacturer, has a finance
subsidiary with substantial debts. It may have to sell the land on which its
headquarters stands, simply to repair its balance sheet - something no
Japanese company would normally consider.
If bank finance is hard to come by, equity is almost impossible to raise. In
Nagoya - Japan's third city, located right in the centre of its
manufacturing heartland - there is a queue of medium sized companies just
waiting to get a listing on the local stock exchange.
Mr Ichiro Kawai, president of the Nagoya Stock Exchange (NSE), says: 'It has
been harder and harder to get a listing for small and medium sized companies
on the NSE since the supplementary budget last August. I know of at least
seven companies which want a listing as soon as possible, but they will have
to wait at least until the next financial year which starts in April.'
There are plenty of companies behind them. Mr Kentaro Sakai, president of
the Nagoya-based Maruman Securities, thinks that over 30 companies would
like to come to the Nagoya market in the next year or so. But with little
money flowing into the equity market, getting such issues underwritten will
be tough. (The government has acknowledged as much, by pulling issues such
as the flotation of JR East railways and a further tranche of NTT stock,
despite the fact that it would help fund the expanding budget deficit.)
Though life is tough, there is at least a partial silver lining. With
official interest rates going down, many small firms have seen some fall in
their financing bills - even those whose banks have widened out their
lending margins. And in Japan there is still a culture of saving businesses
wherever possible, rather than grabbing the collateral and throwing the
company to the receiver.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Bombay police find arms cache: Sixteen held since bomb
attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN police investigating the bomb blasts which rocked Bombay earlier this
month yesterday discovered a huge cache of arms including 600 detonators,
195 hand grenades, rifles and ammunition.
The discovery is the latest development in a wide-ranging probe involving
the Indian intelligence service, as well as Interpol and anti-terrorist
experts from the US and other countries.
The Bombay police have detained 16 people in connection with the blasts,
which left about 250 people dead and over 1,000 injured in the biggest
terrorist attack in Indian history. The explosions followed riots in Bombay
and other cities which came in the wake of the destruction of a mosque in
the holy town of Ayodhya by Hindu militants.
However, those detained by the Bombay police are seen as minor participants
in the attacks: they include men who allegedly drove bomb-laden cars to
blast sites and dealers who supplied the vehicles.
The police have yet to arrest anybody thought to be an organiser of the
attack; norhave they publicly identified any group as a possible party to
the incident, though they strongly believe that the explosives used were
supplied from overseas. Police officials have declined to comment on the
suspicion - widely held in Bombay - that an Islamic fundamentalist group
could have organised the attacks in revenge for Ayodhya.
However, the police want to question two Indian Moslem brothers, the alleged
leaders of smuggling rings, who left the country just before the blasts.
They are Mr Mushtaq Memon, known as 'Tiger', and his elder brother Yakub.
The two flew with their families to Dubai. From there they have fled to
another Moslem country, believed to be Pakistan.
In New Delhi, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, prime minister, yesterday beat off a
challenge to his authority from Mr Arjun Singh, minister for human
resources. Acting before a national conference this weekend of the ruling
Congress (I) party, Mr Singh had questioned if Mr Rao was being aggressive
enough against the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, whose supporters
stormed the Ayodhya mosque.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Superstores under threat: Warehouse clubs are immense sheds
in which a limited range of items sell at bargain prices - Two cut-price US
retailing concepts that could change British shopping are on their way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE US, they called them the 'silent enemy' because of the impact they
had on traditional retailers. Warehouse clubs have been the fastest-growing
format in US retailing in the past 10 years, with total sales reaching
Dollars 27.9bn in 1991.
Between 50 and 100 opened each year throughout the past decade. Now Costco,
the third-largest US operator, is reported to have taken two sites in the UK
with an unnamed competitor taking two more.
Costco refuses to confirm reports that it has signed up sites at Trafford
Park, Manchester, and Thurrock, Essex. But as managing director Mr Paul
Moulton at Costco's newly opened UK office says: 'We are definitely coming
here, and we hope to open a number of locations.'
The unidentified American competitor is said to have taken space in
Wednesbury in the west Midlands, and on the Valley Park development in
Croydon, south London.
In a report last year, retail analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested warehouse
clubs could 'turn the retail scene upside-down', with scope for 30 in the UK
within 10 years, making annual sales of Pounds 2bn.
But Mr Alan Treadgold, of the retail unit of Coopers &amp; Lybrand's, the
accountancy firm, believes it is not grocery retail chains which need worry,
but wholesalers and cash-and-carry operators such as Nurdin &amp; Peacock, Makro
and Booker.
'It's the middlemen who look most vulnerable,' he says. 'In the US, 60 per
cent of warehouse club customers are small businesses.'
US warehouse stores are about three times the size of a typical UK Sainsbury
or Tesco superstore at 100,000 to 140,000 square feet - and sell a limited
range of 3,500 to 4,000 lines (against about 15,000 in a typical Sainsbury
or Tesco) at bargain prices in no-frills surroundings. Gross margins are
pared to the bone - 10 per cent compared with the 25 per cent typically
enjoyed by US supermarkets. They make money by shifting huge volumes of
goods, and charge an annual membership fee of Dollars 25 to Dollars 30
(Pounds 17.60 to Pounds 21.10).
Their culture is the opposite of that of many UK retailers which make money
by 'adding value', trying to achieve the widest possible gap between their
selling prices and selling costs.
'When these two cultures clash - as they are about to do - it will be very,
very interesting to see which one wins out,' says Mr Treadgold.
There are two types of club. Price Club, the second-biggest US operator with
sales of Dollars 6.6bn in 1991, and Costco, third with Dollars 5.6bn,
officially sell only wholesale. Sam's, the biggest with Dollars 9.5bn, and
Pace (Dollars 4.3bn), are operated by US retail giants Wal-Mart and K mart
respectively, and are open to individual shoppers.
Some retail experts question whether warehouse clubs in the UK will be able
to keep costs low enough and volumes high enough to secure adequate rates of
return. Cash-and-carry operators say they will not be able to operate more
efficiently than the UK's existing wholesalers.
Mr Richard Hyman, director of Verdict, the retail market research group,
says land costs can be five or six times those in the US. He wonders whether
UK customers will be as willing as their US counterparts to travel long
distances to do their shopping, sometimes in unattractive locations such as
industrial estates, or even to buy and store goods in such large quantities.
Such doubts are not deterring UK operators from looking at the warehouse
club format. Nurdin &amp; Peacock is widely expected to open warehouse clubs,
and is rumoured to be seeking to change planning consents on some of its
existing 46 outlets to allow them to act more like clubs.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Sites already chosen for vast cut-price malls: Factory
outlet units sell branded goods at heavily discounted rates - Two cut-price
US retailing concepts that could change British shopping are on their way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FACTORY outlet malls have taken the US by storm. From a near standing start
10 years ago, the US now has 270, with 160 in the pipeline, according to
research group Corporate Intelligence.
The concept is still at a rudimentary stage in the UK. There are more than
1,100 small one-off factory clearance outlets, mainly attached to the plant.
Large malls, in which a number of outlets are clustered together, are
relatively new. The idea was pioneered in the UK in the late 1980s by the
Hornsea Retail and Leisure Park in Humberside. It is owned by Peter Black
Holdings, a diversified manufacturing group.
The centre, including a model village and adventure playground, has units
occupied by manufacturers such as Wrangler, Aquascutum and Knickerbox
selling at prices generally a third lower than in the high street.
In Street, Somerset, C. &amp; J. Clark, the footwear manufacturer, is building a
purpose-built outlet complex next to its headquarters. The most ambitious
plans for the expansion of factory outlets in the UK have stemmed from three
US-led development consortiums and a couple of UK operators.
Value Retail, a consortium of SD Malkin Properties and Chelsea Group of the
US and Argent Group and London &amp; Metropolitan of the UK, says it plans ten
150,000 sq ft outlets on motorway corridors. McArthur/Glen, another
ambitious US operator, is looking for 25 outlets across Europe, starting
with the UK.
Prime Group of America, with Richardson Developments and Tarmac, have
identified their first locations - a former British Rail works at Swindon,
due to begin construction this autumn, and Fort Dunlop in Birmingham.
Factory Outlet Shopping Centres, a UK developer, is seeking to convert a
building in the West Midlands and one in Croydon, south London.
The appeal of the UK to these developers is that the recession has
heightened demand for value-for-money and increased manufacturers' problems
with end-of-line or returned stock.
Some commentators are sceptical about the prospects for this concept in the
UK. The appeal to British shoppers of buying last year's fashions from
out-of-town malls is largely untested. Manufacturers are concerned about the
risk of diluting their brands' image and damaging relations with retailers.
Factory outlet developers insist they will create new demand rather than
competing for existing shoppers. 'It is opportunistic shopping,' says Mr
Scott Malkin, chief executive of SD Malkin.
Resistance from retailers, and difficulties in getting funds and planning
permission, may limit the number of factory malls. But they may benefit from
the growing price-consciousness of consumers.

FT  24 MAR 93 / ITV output worries few in poll on violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESULTS of an Independent Television Commission survey of attitudes to
commercial network television indicate that people are not increasingly
taking offence at the amount of sex, bad language and violence on
television.
The survey questioned 1,239 people aged 16 and over and was conducted last
year as part of the commission's statutory obligations.
Seventy per cent said they found nothing offensive on commercial network
television. That compares with 72 per cent in 1991, 70 per cent in 1990 and
65 per cent in 1989.
Nothing offensive was found on BBC1 by 74 per cent (75 per cent in 1991);
BBC2 scored 80 per cent (the same as 1991); and Channel 4 registered 72 per
cent (73 per cent in 1991).
Among cable and satellite TV viewers - surveyed for the first time - 93 per
cent were not offended by satellite film channels. Of the 1,603 people asked
about cable and satellite TV, only 4 per cent cited violence as a source of
offence.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Audit 'quarantine' period extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTNERS in accountancy firms will be banned from working for the same
client for more than seven years at a time under draft rules on ethics
issued yesterday.
The proposed draft rules come in a 'white paper' from the joint ethics
committee of the three institutes that represent chartered accountants in
the UK and Ireland. The rules also say partners will not be allowed to
resume audit work for the client company for a further five years.
That represents an increase in the length of the 'quarantine' period from
two years in response to comments received by the committee since its 'green
paper' was issued last October.
It reflects a concern that a firm's objectivity may be threatened or appear
to be threatened if a partner in charge of an audit continues in that role
for a prolonged period.
The guidelines will be mandatory for auditors to listed and other
public-interest companies, and will be recommended for all other companies.
Mr Jock Worsley, chairman of the committee, said: 'A lot of people wanted
very detailed regulations. But we believe that the guidelines will be most
successful if they are applied and monitored for compliance with the spirit,
not the letter.'
Nearly 90 firms, committees and organisations responded to the guidelines,
and most called for tougher recommendations on rotation.
Any final comments on the guidelines should be produced by May 10 this year.
If approved, they will be phased in over the next three years.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Auditors must restructure profession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS must restructure their profession radically or risk losing their
monopoly on scrutinising financial reports, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's
largest accountancy firm, warned yesterday.
Unless auditors develop long-term plans they will fail to attract
high-quality recruits and may lose their statutory monopoly on auditing to
other consultants, the firm added.
The conclusion comes in the firm's submission to the Auditing Practices
Board about its consultative document on the future development of auditing.
The submission's positive tone for reform is in stark contrast to many
submissions to the board, which have been highly critical of the proposals
for change.
Shareholders need to take a more active role in improving the development of
auditing, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said in its
submission.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Watchdog warns MoD on sale of surplus arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ministry of Defence is preparing for a 'dramatic' sell-off of military
equipment without an adequate grasp of sales and pricing techniques, the
National Audit Office warns today.
Items on offer over the next two years may include obsolete Phantom and
Buccaneer aircraft, Leander frigates and Oberon submarines. The audit
office, the government spending watchdog, says sales will be 'on a scale
unprecedented since the period following the second world war'.
It says smaller disposals over the past five years have raised almost Pounds
200m, but that more could have been realised. The value of some ships, for
example, was reduced unnecessarily by the premature stripping out of
equipment.
The office adds that the Ministry of Defence needs to tighten safeguards
against fraud and theft in the light of 'a major investigation' by police at
its disposal depots.
The second-hand market is competitive because of defence cuts in many
countries, the audit office says. But the ministry has failed to assess the
identities, strategies and strengths of its competitors.
There has been progress in improving the efficiency of equipment sales, the
office says, and the ministry has created a directorate to centralise sales
of surplus equipment.
It has been involved in the sale of 35 ships to south America and south-east
Asia, as well as tank spares to Kuwait and ammunition to New Zealand, Chile
and Sri Lanka.
The number of aircraft sold more than trebled to 102 in 1991-92 compared
with a year before, and the ministry disposed successfully of several
hundred tonnes of time-expired ration-pack biscuits to zoos and
manufacturers of pet food.
Yet the directorate still relies largely on a manual database because its
computers have failed to work, says the audit office which blames 'funding
limitations and a lack of appreciation of the directorate's requirements'. A
shortage of management information means that 'the directorate has
insufficient information on prices achieved and costs incurred to know
whether they are covering their costs'.
The handling of auctions is also criticised by the audit office. It says
most buyers at the ministry's auctions are late in their payments, and urges
that professional houses should be consulted about producing a list of
possible changes to the ministry's auction procedures with the aim of
increasing the prices obtained.
The ministry said it was studying the report and hoped to make a response
within weeks.

FT  24 MAR 93 / US backs British role in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN was urged to play 'a central and vigorous role' in Europe yesterday
by the US ambassador, Mr Raymond Seitz.
Such a role, Mr Seitz said, 'adds considerable value and weight' to the
Anglo-American relationship, the value of which 'is exponentially increased
or diminished by Britain's position in the multilateral Europe'.
But, he added, the US was also anxious 'that Britain preserve its capacity
for independent action', notably in the military field. On a wide range of
security issues after the cold war 'the willingness of either Washington or
London to respond. . . will depend in large measure on the willingness of
the other to act as well'.
He added: 'The overlap of our strategic interests may not be quite so
extensive as before'.
Mr Seitz, appointed by President George Bush as the first career diplomat to
hold the post, is thought likely to stay in London for at least another
year.
But the Clinton administration has yet to confirm this.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Ford talks fail to avert strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD's 8,000-strong white-collar staff will go ahead with a planned 24-hour
strike tomorrow in protest at the company's threat of compulsory
redundancies.
The decision followed a fruitless meeting yesterday between union
representatives and Ford managers. The white-collar workers voted to support
strike action in ballots held earlier in the month.
Mr Jim Thomas, national official with the MSF union, warned: 'We are now on
a collision course, and if anyone is made compulsorily redundant further
industrial action will be taken.'
The disruption at Ford's 21 UK plants, involving foremen, computer operators
and salesmen, will coincide with the official launch of the Mondeo
replacement for the Sierra.
The unions plan to lobby Ford dealers and march from Brentwood, Essex, to
Ford's European headquarters nearby at Warley.
The company told union officials yesterday it could not meet their demand
for a guarantee of no compulsory white-collar redundancies.
Managers also disclosed that they had found volunteers for all but 88 of the
2,200 redundancies required, with 101 staff being redeployed or transferred.
The company said 'every effort' would be made to achieve the full redundancy
target by March 30. If this was not reached compulsory redundancies would be
imposed on April 16.

ENGINEERS AND technicians at Rolls-Royce's Bristol plant are set to ballot
on strike action today over threatened compulsory redundancies, Diane
Summers writes.
MSF, the general technical union, said about 300 employees had volunteered
for redundancy. But the company needed to shed a further 700by March 26,
after which redundancies would be compulsory.
Rolls-Royce has cut 12,000 jobs in the past two years and plans a further
cut of 5,000 jobs by the end of 1994. It has said the decline in military
orders and turmoil in the world airline industry have forced a
restructuring.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Move to help disabled in work
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PILOT scheme to keep disabled people in work was launched yesterday by Mrs
Gillian Shephard, employment secretary. The scheme, initiated by the Royal
National Institute for the Blind, is being backed by Barclays Bank,
McDonald's and Midland Bank, as well as organisations in the public sector.
Newly disabled employees will be assessed to see whether they can continue
to work after retraining or whether adaptations are needed to their work
environment.
The RNIB said people who become disabled often resign, take ill-health or
early retirement before proper thought is given to how they could continue
in their jobs or be redeployed.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Unions to press for Pounds 700 pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL GOVERNMENT unions yesterday endorsed a proposal by Nalgo, the
public-sector union, to press for a flat-rate pay increase of Pounds 700 a
year for 750,000 local authority workers. The claim would add 5.5 per cent
to local government wage costs.
The claim, to be submitted to employers on April 6, ignores the government's
ceiling of a 1.5 per cent pay increase in the public sector.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Aslef to hold strike ballot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXECUTIVE of the Aslef train drivers' union voted unanimously last night
to ballot members on industrial action over the planned privatisation of
British Rail. 'I can tell you now we will get a yes vote,' said Mr Derrick
Fullick, general secretary.
The ballot will close on April 7, five days after the first of a series of
one-day strikes planned by the larger RMT rail union. Mr Fullick predicted
that Aslef would organise its own series of one-day strikes.
He said his members feared job cuts and changes in promotion prospects after
privatisation. 'We cannot get any straight answers from the BR board,' he
added. 'They have pushed us into this. It was a situation that we have tried
to avoid.'
BR yesterday asked for talks with RMT leaders in an effort to head off that
union's first strike.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Output by Bosch to leave Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSCH, the German vehicle components, electronics and power tools group, is
to transfer production of car alternators from Stuttgart to south Wales and
Spain.
The company says alternator production will cease 'in the medium term' at
Feuerbach, Stuttgart. Production will be moved to a plant at Miskin, near
Cardiff, and a smaller factory at Treto in Spain 'in order to reduce costs
and thus secure competitiveness'. Bosch says a cut of up to 700 jobs at
Feuerbach, which will continue to make other components, 'cannot be
excluded'.
The Miskin plant, which has been manufacturing alternators since it opened
two years ago, is expected to double annual alternator production to 5m by
1995-96, and to increase its workforce over this period from 700 to 1,200.
Bosch said Feuerbach had been a pilot facility for a new compact alternator
and it had always been the company's strategy to transfer production to its
Welsh and Spanish plants.
The alternator made at Miskin, where the overall investment in the plant and
equipment is about Pounds 100m, is designed to cope with the increasing
amount of electrical components in cars. Eighty per cent of the Miskin
alternators are exported. A second production hall in Wales will be opened
later this year.
The arrival of Japanese car-makers in the UK was an important factor in
Bosch choosing to open Miskin, which also has lower labour and production
costs than Stuttgart. Bosch has a no-strike agreement at Miskin and says
that staff relations are very good.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Extradition move soon in charity case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, GILLIAN TETT and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH police are planning to press for the extradition from Belgium of Mr
Gamil Naguib, one of two men named in a High Court writ last month filed by
the Salvation Army alleging fraud of more than Pounds 6m.
The move came after details of Mr Naguib's whereabouts were passed to the
Metropolitan and City of London police fraud squad by The Independent
newspaper. Mr Naguib was found in Antwerp. He had been missing since the
writ was issued on February 15.
Formal extradition proceedings need to be processed through the Crown
Prosecution Service and the Home Office. Details of Mr Naguib have been
passed to Belgian and other European police forces through Interpol.
Police are confident that a second man named in the writ, Mr Stuard Ford,
will soon return to Britain voluntarily.
It emerged yesterday that the Crown Prosecution Service has been given
documents relating to discussions between individuals representing the
Salvation Army and an organisation claiming to belong to the United Nations.
It is understood discussions involved some of the individuals named in last
month's writ. The discussions were made on behalf of the ACP Investment and
Trade Bank, which has been disowned by the UN and was under investigation in
the US.
According to a bulletin from the US Controller of the Currency dated August
14 1992, ACP may have been operating a banking business in the US without
authorisation.
Dr Antoine Yameogo, ACP's executive co-ordinator, told the Financial Times
that his bank had received a UN mandate to operate for humanitarian and
development purposes in 1979 and in the early 1980s. UN officials said they
had never heard of the bank. Colonel Grenville Burn, who was in charge of
Salvation Army fundraising and involved in contacts between the charity and
Mr Naguib and Mr Ford, yesterday refused to comment.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Profits warning was confidential, court told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER chairman of a waste disposal group told an Edinburgh court
yesterday that when he briefed an investment analyst about a profits warning
by the company he emphasised that the information was confidential.
Mr Peter Runciman, former chairman of Shanks &amp; McEwan (SME), was giving
evidence for the prosecution on the second day of the trial at the Court of
Session of Mr Thorold Mackie, an analyst with Edinburgh stockbrokers Bell
Lawrie White. Mr Mackie has pleaded not guilty to insider dealing. He has
the full support of Bell Lawrie, which is paying for his defence.
It is alleged that Mr Mackie 'counselled and procured' two share salesmen in
his firm to sell shares in SME, thus avoiding the fall in the share price
which occurred when the profits warning was issued on September 19 1991, and
realising Pounds 1.39m more than would have been achieved if they had sold
after the profits warning.
Mr Runciman said he met Mr Mackie on September 6 by appointment for a
briefing. The previous day SME's three-man executive committee had decided
it was necessary to issue a profits warning because the group's earnings per
share for the half year were likely to fall by 1.6 per cent, instead of
rising 15 per cent increase as indicated at the agm in July.
Mr Runciman said he had had a good relationship with Mr Mackie because Bell
Lawrie was its main point of contact with its Scottish shareholders.
He told Mr Mackie SME would be issuing a profits warning and answered
detailed questions for a circular. 'I told him that he could not use the
information until he had clearance from me,' Mr Runciman said. On the
afternoon of September 9, Mr Runciman was told by SME's broker, Hoare
Govett, that 1.8m shares in the company had been sold through Bell Lawrie.
'My reaction was that there must have been a leak,' Mr Runciman told Mrs Ann
Paton QC, prosecuting.
The next day he telephoned Mr Mackie. 'I mentioned that he had been given
highly privileged information and that if there had been a leak it would be
an extremely serious matter.' Mr Mackie replied: 'I hear what you say."
Cross-examined by Mr Donald Macfadyen QC, Mr Runciman denied that he had
given Mr Mackie no general indication that the whole discussion was
confidential, and that he had not mentioned to him that SME was planning a
profits warning.

FT  24 MAR 93 / R-R set to hold ballot on strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGINEERS AND technicians at Rolls-Royce's Bristol plant are set to ballot
on strike action today over threatened compulsory redundancies, Diane
Summers writes.
MSF, the general technical union, said about 300 employees had volunteered
for redundancy. But the company needed to shed a further 700 by March 26,
after which redundancies would be compulsory.
The ballot is due to follow a lobby of senior management and a rally of
workers.
Mr Alistair Fraser, a union official at the Bristol plant, said: 'It is
madness that Rolls-Royce are considering throwing skilled engineers and
technicians on to the dole when all the indications are that there will be
an upturn in the world aerospace market. We will not pay the price of their
mismanagement of the company and will resist compulsory redundancies at any
cost. If this means a strike, then a strike it will be.'
Rolls-Royce has cut 12,000 jobs in the past two years and plans a further
cut of 5,000 jobs by the end of 1994. It has said the decline in military
orders and turmoil in the world airline industry have forced a
restructuring.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Ford negotiations fail to avert strike by white-collar staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD's 8,000-strong white-collar staff will go ahead with a planned 24-hour
strike tomorrow in protest at the company's threat of compulsory
redundancies.
The decision followed a fruitless meeting yesterday between union
representatives and Ford managers. The white-collar workers voted to support
strike action in ballots held earlier in the month.
Mr Jim Thomas, national official with the MSF union, warned: 'We are now on
a collision course, and if anyone is made compulsorily redundant further
industrial action will be taken.'
The disruption at Ford's 21 UK plants, involving foremen, computer operators
and salesmen, will coincide with the official launch of the Mondeo
replacement for the Sierra. The unions plan to lobby Ford dealers and march
from Brentwood, Essex, to Ford's European headquarters nearby at Warley.
The company told union officials yesterday it could not meet their demand
for a guarantee of no compulsory white-collar redundancies.
Managers also disclosed that they had found volunteers for all but 88 of the
2,200 redundancies required, with 101 staff being redeployed or transferred.
The company added that 'every effort' would be made to achieve the full
redundancy target by March 30. If this was not reached, the company told
union officials, compulsory redundancies would be imposed on April 16.
Ford said the cuts among staff were part of a wider European restructuring
programme to make Ford more competitive. They had not been caused by changes
in the business cycle.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Why is the government losing
committee-stage votes? - As the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty returns
to the House of Commons, FT writers look at the remaining obstacles to its
passage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST MPs support the Maastricht treaty. And yet the government has already
lost one committee-stage vote and is in danger of losing more. Nor can it
command the votes necessary to speed its progress by forcing MPs to debate
it beyond 10pm. Why?
The short explanation is that the two main opposition parties - though
pledged not to wreck the treaty - have not ruled out seeking to 'improve'
it. Nor does Labour in particular feel any compunction about prolonging the
committee stage as much as it can. This delays the consideration of other
bills and complicates life for those charged with managing the government's
legislative programme.
Combine these votes with those of the hard-core Tory Euro-sceptics intent on
sinking the bill, and the government's overall majority of 20 becomes
vulnerable on all but amendments that would change the text of the treaty
and therefore wreck it.
The table below, showing the likely division of forces if the government
pressed to prolong debate beyond 10pm, illustrates its problem. The figures
 -which suggest the government would lose such a division by some 17 votes
even when supported by the Liberal Democrats - indicate that more Tories are
prepared to rebel on these 10 o'clock-rule votes than on non-procedural
motions.

'You have enormous power and influence over these proceedings, and as we
struggle to understand the meaning of the treaty, the very raising - or even
the half-raising - of your eyebrow will cause the government to jitter with
fear.'
Nicholas Budgen, Tory Euro-sceptic MP to Michael Morris, deputy speaker,
December 1 1992
'So we have begun at last.'
Sir Russell Johnston, Liberal Democrat spokesman on Europe, after 1 1/2
hours of points of order at beginning of committee stage, December 1 1992
Sir Russell Johnston: 'Few matters are discussed more often in my
constituency than the acquis communautaire. Asking me to translate it is
rather like asking me to give the English for 'spaghetti' or 'blitzkreig'.'
Dennis Skinner (Lab, Bolsover): 'Or 'bullshit'.'
Sir Russell: 'No, that is a different matter with which the hon. gentleman
is deeply familiar.'
December 1 1992
'Logically, if the union had already been established, as article A,
paragraph 1 says that it has, the process of creating an ever closer union
is superfluous as one cannot get closer than union itself. The process has
reached its conclusion with the establishment of the union, which means that
the process has ceased, although the second paragraph suggests that there is
some way still to go. That raises the next question: is the European union
of article A, paragraph 1, the 'ever closer union among the peoples of
Europe' aimed at under earlier treaties and continued by article A,
paragraph 2, of the treaty?'
Bill Cash, Tory Euro-sceptic, December 1 1992
'The monumental and excessive windbaggery of the hon. member for Stafford
(Mr Cash) may have allowed word to get out from the chamber that there is
something marginally tedious about our proceedings on the bill.'
Charles Kennedy, January 19 1993
'Is not the real point that the Maastricht treaty establishes not a
federation but a union, a superstate, which has not yet been revealed in its
full concept to the British people?'
Bryan Gould, Labour Euro-sceptic. March 4 1993
'I cannot imagine a more feeble and foolish posture.'
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, addressing Euro-sceptics. March 11 1993
'Would it be possible - this is a question for you, Mr Morris - given that
we seek to reject the amendment in order to prevent the artificial delay of
the bill, for a further debate to take place on the matter before the
division is called?'
Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, as the government faced defeat
over a Labour amendment. March 8 1993
'No.'

FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Procedural hurdles loom - As the
bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty returns to the House of Commons, FT
writers look at the remaining obstacles to its passage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE parliamentary progress of any bill is like a hurdles race: it goes round
a clearly marked track with regular obstacles.
But ministers' failure to control the progress of the Maastricht bill has
turned that race into a more gruelling assault course on which the
government will finish, but risks injury in doing so.
The government's inability to win a Commons vote imposing a 'guillotine' to
limit all future discussion of the bill is so patent that such a vote has
not even been sought. But it is this inability that has exposed it to so
many back-bench rebellions and prevents it from setting a date for royal
assent.
In most other cases the timing of a bill is agreed between the two main
parties, which ensure that the issues in which they are most interested
receive the greatest airing.
Where the parties cannot agree, the government puts forward a motion to
timetable discussion and - once it has won that vote - can then be sure that
the bill will be through within the allotted time.
The problem is worsened because, as a constitutional measure, the
line-by-line discussion of the Maastricht bill involves the potential
participation of all 600-plus MPs, and excludes other business in the
Commons itself.
In almost every other case, after a full day's debate to give it a second
reading, the bill in effect disappears from view to be considered in detail
by a cross-party committee of some 20 to 30 MPs. Some weeks later it
re-emerges into the public gaze for edited highlights to be replayed at the
report stage, in which they are debated by the whole House.
Before giving final approval, the Commons holds a third-reading debate,
sometimes for no more than a matter of minutes. For Maastricht, this is
likely instead to be a set-piece confrontation between government and
rebels.
When the bill goes to the Lords, however, ministers can relax a bit more. By
convention peers never vote against a bill's second reading, and the
committee and report stages are almost indistinguishable. Both stages take
place as the main business of the day, and the bill can be altered at any
point. Minor amendments can even be made as the legislation is given a third
reading.
Lords debates attract less attention, and the government need not be
embarrassed at being unable to control the timing: no guillotine ever cuts
off Lords' debates.
4The only drawback is that any changes made by the Lords, no matter how
minor or arcane, have to be approved by MPs as well.
In many cases the return of the bill to the Commons is purely a technical
stage. On Maastricht, however, it could lead to a further, opaque discussion
on matters which would not be known until perhaps only days before.
So far as the UK's EC partners are concerned, that might be a fitting end to
the unenviable assault course that has been Westminster's consideration of
Maastricht.

SMALLER and more businesslike police authorities will lead a drive for
better performance and value-for-money under proposals announced by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, yesterday.
He told the Commons he planned to devolve responsibility within police
forces to 'local police units who will be directly accountable to their
local communities,' cutting out unnecessary headquarters and management
tiers.
But, under pressure from cabinet colleagues and chief constables, he is
moving cautiously on possible amalgamations between the 43 English and Welsh
forces. There will be no immediate mergers but Mr Clarke intends to simplify
statutory procedures 'to allow for amalgamations when the time is right'.
Yesterday's proposals form part of a review of the Pounds 6bn-a-year police
service aimed at improving its managerial and operational efficiency.
The next phase is due in May when a committee of inquiry into police
responsibilities and rewards under Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT
industries, produces its report. This is likely to recommend a simplified
rank structure and performance-related pay.
Police authorities comprise two thirds local councillors and one third
magistrates. Mr Clarke envisages much smaller 16-strong bodies - eight
councillors, three magistrates, and five business people and others
appointed by the home secretary. The home secretary would appoint the
authority's chair from among the 16.
A police authority for London will be created. At present, the home
secretary is responsible for the Metropolitan Police.
Mr Clarke told the Commons that the funding structure, with central and
local government contributing to police costs, would continue in broadly the
same proportions as now.
The central government contribution would be cash-limited while the local
portion would be subjected to local government expenditure controls. But
police forces would have greater freedom to decide how to spend and manage
their resources.
Mr Clarke intends to set national objectives for the police service, while
police authorities will produce local performance targets. The results will
be published so that the public can compare forces' performance.
The proposals will be addressed in detail in a white paper in June, followed
by legislation. Mr Clarke's plans to reduce local authority representation
on police authorities, and add his own appointees, is likely to prove the
most controversial aspect of the package.
MPs gave a cautious welcome to the proposals, but Mr Clarke was warned from
both sides of the House not to follow a 'bigger is better' concept in
initiating amalgamations to reduce the duplication of headquarters and other
facilities.
Mr Clarke refused to be drawn about the likelihood of the City of London
force continuing as a separate entity, insisting that he had not begun to
consider the number of likely amalagamations.
He emphasised that the more powerful and businesslike police authorities
envisaged would be able to decide how to apportion their budgets between
expenditure on manpower and equipment.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM vulnerable to ambush by
amendment - As the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty returns to the House
of Commons, FT writers look at the remaining obstacles to its passage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE PATH to ratification is still strewn with pitfalls for Mr John Major's
government.
As the committee stage grinds on, the prime minister and his colleagues are
vulnerable to ambush on virtually any non-wrecking proposal behind which the
Labour front bench puts its weight. There are up to eight such amendments
and new clauses which Labour insists it will press to a vote.
In practice, the threat of further government defeats may be gravest on the
two amendments where the Liberal Democrats are expected to side with Labour.
Only one of the eight - Amendment 27, which would remove the protocol
containing Britain's social chapter opt-out from the treaty - appears likely
to inflict lasting damage to the Maastricht process.
Unfortunately for Mr Major and his troops, this amendment does enjoy the
unanimous backing of the 291 Labour and Lib Dem MPs.
Following last month's much-derided legal U-turn, the amendment is
technically non-wrecking, since the government believes it would not stop
ratification of the treaty. But its passage would at the very least put the
government in uncharted legal waters.
That is because it would prevent the protocol to which it relates being
incorporated into UK domestic law. Pressing on and ratifying the treaty,
including Britain's opt-out - in defiance of parliament - would also leave
Mr Major open to charges of resorting to undemocratic methods (the royal
prerogative) to get his way.
To defeat the government, Labour and the other opposition parties would have
to be joined in the 'Aye' lobbies by at least a dozen Tory Euro-sceptics -
an unlikely prospect on the face of it, since they profess to abhor the
social chapter and all it stands for.
But some Euro-sceptics are inclined to do just that. Ironically, they use
the thrust of the government's own legal argument to justify their stance,
insisting that passage of the amendment would not impose the chapter on
British companies. It could accordingly be supported with a clear
conscience.
Ominously for the government, such views are not confined to the hard-core
contingent of 20 to 25 Tories who are taking the unofficial Euro-sceptic
whip. 'I will never vote for any amendment that will have the effect of
taking us into the social chapter. Douglas Hurd (the foreign secretary) has
said Amendment 27 will not have that effect, therefore I am minded to
support Amendment 27,' said a senior Tory MP.
The government could be rescued if a majority of Euro-sceptics decides on
balance not to back the amendment and the group votes en bloc.
Alternatively, it could improve its prospects of winning by coaxing some of
the Ulster unionists or other minority parties not to side with Labour.
The vote is expected immediately after MPs' detailed consideration of Clause
one of the tiny three-clause Maastricht bill - conceivably as soon as next
week.
The government could live with defeat on any of the other seven divisions
Labour may press for, although a string of reverses would have a
debilitating effect on loyalists' morale.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats are most likely to present a united front
in opposition on Amendment 35, which would require parliament to vote on
whether Britain should join the last stage of economic and monetary union if
certain conditions were fulfilled.
This vote is expected immediately after MPs have debated Clause two of the
bill. Whether the Euro-sceptics will decide they can back such an amendment
is not yet clear.
The remainder of the amendments and new clauses Labour intends to push focus
mainly on increasing the accountability to parliament of various European
institutions and the Bank of England. But these are not being supported by
the Liberal Democrats and have no guarantee of Euro-sceptic backing either.
The Euro-sceptics are divided between those who favour voting against the
government at virtually every juncture before the second Danish referendum
in May, and others who think it right to keep their powder dry ahead of the
Commons report stage to which the government is now resigned.
The Liberal Democrats are worried that the accent on accountability risks
distracting attention from making European institutions more democratic and
may even impair their independence.
MPs also still have to debate a string of new clauses calling for a British
referendum on the treaty. The call will spark perhaps the largest rebellion
of all among Euro-sceptics. But this is one issue where the government is
assured of the Labour front bench's support.
This should ensure that its stance in opposing a referendum will carry the
day.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: VAT probe will go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INVESTIGATION by a cross-party committee of MPs into the impact on the
worst-off of extending value added tax to domestic fuel is to go ahead in
spite of the reservations of some of its Tory members.
Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the social security committee, said
yesterday that members had agreed to consider who would be most affected by
the extension of VAT. It would also consider the mechanisms with which the
government could compensate poorer households.
This could include how extra help might be provided for people who are just
above income-support levels, and for people who are eligible for
income-related benefits, but do not claim them.
However, in response to the worries of some Tories, the committee will not
consider how much compensation should be provided until after the government
has announced its own proposals in November.
Confirmation of the inquiry came as Mr John Major once again had to defend
in the Commons the Budget decisions on VAT and on increasing National
Insurance contributions as being 'in the interests of the economy'.
Progress in deciding the form of the investigation is now unlikely until
after the committee has met Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary,
next month. The committee could be taking evidence at about the same time as
the Commons will be dealing with the measure in the detailed discussions on
the Finance Bill.
Some of the Conservative MPs on the committee have been irritated that their
colleague, Mr David Shaw, suggested such a politically sensitive inquiry
last week. They want to minimise possible embarrassment.
In practice, however, it may be difficult for the MPs to hold the inquiry
without considering the rises in fuel bills for particular groups, and thus
providing a figure for critics to use as a benchmark.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government grasps for treaty
life-support - As the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty returns to the
House of Commons, FT writers look at the remaining obstacles to its passage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Mr John Major it is life or death. If the deal he negotiated with his
European partners in the Dutch town of Maastricht in December 1991 fails to
win the endorsement of the British parliament his premiership will be
destroyed. Close colleagues of the prime minister are convinced he would
quit, along with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.
As the treaty heads for the final stage of its tortuous passage through the
House of Commons, the political stakes could not be higher. All the serious
betting is that the treaty - and Mr Major - will survive, and that by late
July, or at worst the autumn, Maastricht will be ratified. Britain will
again have held on to the coat - tails of Europe.
Even ardent opponents will admit privately that they believe the chances of
sinking the legislation are slim. On the central issue of principle -
whether Britain should ratify - there is a clear majority of the Commons in
favour. On a 'free vote' - unencumbered by the obligations of party
allegiance - around two thirds of the 650 MPs would support it.
But life for Mr Major is not that simple. The curious coincidence of
interest between 50 or so Conservative diehard opponents of the treaty and
the determination (they would say duty) of the opposition parties to weaken
the government at every opportunity conspires against him.
Between 25 and 30 Tory MPs have defied consistently powerful threats and
pleas for loyalty to vote against their own government. A further 20 to 25
abstain. Labour and the Liberal Democrats support the principle of the
treaty. But they want ratification on their terms and want in the process to
damage the government. Mr Major's paper majority of 20 MPs is thus rendered
worthless.
The government is hampered also by the arcane procedures of the House of
Commons - a set of rules for debate which allows opponents to support the
principle of a piece of legislation but to seriously delay and disrupt its
passage.
Between them the Euro - sceptics, the Labour, Liberal Democrat and smaller
opposition parties can dictate the timetable for the legislation. They can
filibuster. They can prevent, when they wish, the government winning the
votes it needs to speed up progress of the legislation with all - night and
weekend sittings.
More threateningly, the combined forces ranged against Mr Major can, if
their alliance holds, amend the legislation. They have already done so once
 -on a relatively minor issue. But if they were to find an amendment (and
they have not yet) to change the legislation in a way which forced the
government to embrace the social chapter then they just might derail the
whole process. Mr Major would not - could not - ratify a treaty without the
opt-out he negotiated from its social dimension.
The risk of an ambush - and of an unpredictable defeat - will remain until
the treaty passes its final House of Commons hurdle - the so - called third
reading.
On an optimistic timetable the third reading will come early in June. On a
pessimistic forecast it might not be before mid July. Then the legislation
will face loud opposition during a month or so in the House of Lords. Lady
Thatcher and Lord Tebbit, the self - appointed spokesman for the nation's
street - corner Europhobes, will lead the attack. But in the Lords, Mr Major
has a comfortable in - built majority. There will be plenty of noise but no
real threat to the substance of the legislation.
Mr Major cannot afford to be other than optimistic. The endless wrangling
has sapped the authority of his premiership. His is the first government
since the row over devolution which destroyed the Labour administration of
the late 1970s which has not been able to dictate the terms of debate for a
key piece of legislation. He depends on backroom deals with one or other of
the opposition parties. After 13 years with unchallengeable majorities, the
government has found it hard to rediscover the humility to strike such
bargains.
Ministers freely admit that until the treaty is ratified they will not be
able to regain a grip on domestic policy. Other European leaders may be
frustrated by the delay in ratification. None finds it more debilitating
than Mr Major.
That frustration is visible in the swings in the prime minister's mood. On
some occasions he acts as if determined to crush the enemy within. On others
he replaces scorn with attempts at persuasion. His own view of the treaty -
that it is vital to retain a British voice in the future of a wider Europe -
is distorted by his habit of focusing alternately on its positive elements
and then on the British opt - outs from monetary union and the social
chapter. 'Ratify it because it will never be implemented' sometimes seems to
be the message.
The struggle risks doing serious long - term damage to the Conservatives.
The declared dissidents have the private support of a similar number of more
discreet opponents. The risk is that it will prove impossible to heal the
schism.
There are problems too for the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. Both
parade their pro - European credentials (though Labour has its own sizeable
hard core of passionate Eurosceptics). They are tarnishing those credentials
in their anxiety to weaken Mr Major. Political opportunism has a price.
But for now - and until the ratification documents leave the Palace of
Westminster to receive the signature of the Queen - Mr Major remains the
helpless victim of his negotiating triumph in Maastricht.

THE Department of Transport will spend Pounds 10m on experimental speed
limits aimed at smoothing traffic flows on congested sections of the M25
London orbital motorway. The scheme will take about two years to set up.
Indicators between junctions 11 and 15 will light up telling drivers to
reduce their speeds to 60mph or 50mph in heavy traffic. The department says
similar schemes in The Netherlands and Germany have eased traffic flows and
cut accidents.

ATTEMPTS were being made last night to save the G-Plan furniture range and
480 jobs after the company asked its bankers to call in administrative
receivers.
G-Plan, one of the best-known furniture brands, was bought a year ago by The
Cabinet Maker which had plans to expand the company. However it fell victim
to the recession, and efforts to refinance the group failed. The workforce
of 480 is spread between its base in Bath and Lympne, Kent, and King's Lynn,
Norfolk.
Joint administrative receivers Mr Cedric Clapp and Mr Christopher Hill, from
accountants Ernst &amp; Young, are seeking buyers for the operation.

RECHEM, the waste management group, yesterday said it was surprised and
disappointed by a request from Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, for
his German counterpart to prevent a shipment of waste being transported to
the UK.
Earlier this week, Mr Howard asked Mr Klaus Topfer to ban the export of
about 1,000 tonnes of hazardous waste from Hamburg to Rechem's incinerator
in Pontypool, Gwent.
'The government appears to be marking out the pitch and then redrawing the
lines during the match,' said Mr John Shaughnessy, external affairs manager
at Rechem.
'The waste involved is entirely consistent with the range of materials for
which we are licensed,' he added.
Rechem, a subsidiary of Shanks &amp; McEwan, the UK's largest waste management
group, said it had been in advanced negotiations with Boehringer Ingelheim,
owner of the waste. It added that no specialist capacity appeared to be
available in Germany.
The German group said it was negotiating with a number of companies in
Germany and other European countries to dispose of the waste.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Threat grows to school testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND union representing headteachers has warned the government that
boycotts by teachers could stop the compulsory testing of 14-year-olds in
England and Wales this summer.
The Secondary Heads Association, regarded by ministers as one of the most
responsible of the teaching unions, is advising members not to do anything
that could undermine action by the two largest unions.
The NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union, has launched a boycott of
all testing and assessment connected with the national curriculum. The
largest teaching union, the NUT, will ballot its members in May over a
boycott of the English test for 14-year-olds.
The association's warning comes just a week after the other union
representing heads, the National Association of Head Teachers, said heads
would find it impossible to continue with the tests if boycotts took place.
It said that there was limited scope to compel heads who cancelled the tests
to stage them.
An emergency conference of Secondary Heads Association branch conveners
yesterday heard the anger of heads and deputies over the tests planned for
this summer, especially those in English and technology. The conveners
deplored the lack of pilot trials for the new tests and the administrative
muddles over the syllabuses for them.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Energy users look for cut in costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTENSIVE energy users are hoping the white paper will encourage moves that
would enable them to bypass the electricity wholesale pool and to reduce
their electricity costs.
On Monday the British Management Data Association, an independent
organisation backed by 25 companies, presented a proposal to ministers that
the association says would provide British Coal with security.
Under the plan large companies, including Imperial Chemical Industries,
would sign long-term deals with generators for coal-fired electricity.
Analysts were sceptical yesterday about whether the scheme would increase
demand for coal.
Meanwhile PowerGen, the electricity generator, said it had signed an
eight-year deal to supply Electricite de France with power via the
cross-Channel electricity link.
The deal might lead to sales of more than Pounds 100m. Analysts believe it
could help save one of the threatened pits. Closing each threatened pit
would cost between Pounds 8m to Pounds 10m more per pit than keeping it
open, says an assessment released yesterday by the Trades Union Congress.
The TUC figures took into account extra unemployment benefit payments and
tax losses resulting from closures.
Its study challenged the government's assertions that the costs of pit
closures would be short-lived and that saving pits would have a severe
impact on jobs elsewhere.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Councils bank on Tour de France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO STAGES of the Tour de France, the world's greatest cycle race, will be
held in Britain in July next year.
Le Tour en Angleterre, as it is being called, will start from Dover on July
6 for a 201km (125-mile) run through Kent and East Sussex to Brighton. The
next day the cyclists will race for 193km through Hampshire, starting and
ending in Portsmouth.
The three county councils and various district and city councils on the
route are paying at least Pounds 500,000 between them to stage the event.
Mr Alan Rushton, the managing director of Sport for Television, which
conducted negotiations on behalf of the event, said Berlin paid Pounds 1.2m
for a visit in 1987, Luxembourg paid Pounds 1m last year, while the average
fee for a start or finish in a French city is Pounds 600,000.
Mr David Knight, head of leisure at Portsmouth City Council, said yesterday
the event 'has all the ingredients to be the largest tourist attraction of
1994 in the UK. It attracts 960m television viewers in 120 countries.'
Mr Brian Daley, leisure officer at Havant, near Portsmouth, said: 'Hotels
within 50 miles of the route are usually booked up. The event will be
outside the main tourist season and we anticipate that the average spend of
visitors will be higher.'

FT  24 MAR 93 / Private hope for hit-list pits: Companies eager to run
British Coal mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the government publishes its white paper on coal, probably tomorrow, it
will attempt to focus much attention on people such as Mr Richard Budge.
The head of a private mining group, RJB Mining, Mr Budge may not be
mentioned by name in the white paper. But the entrepreneurial spirit he
represents will contribute strongly to the flavour of a document expected to
stretch to more than 150 pages.
The white paper will almost certainly fail to match the aspirations of MPs
who want British Coal to keep mining, under its ownership, at least half the
threatened 31 pits.
But, with the help of the private sector, the government may offer hope of a
future of some kind for at least 20 of the 31.
By drawing in private companies to run pits no longer wanted by the
corporation, the government will also be able to claim that it has started
the privatisation which it hopes to complete within three years.
Companies such as RJB, Ryan International and Edwards Energy are almost
certain to be invited to bid for licences to run the 10 pits that British
Coal has already said it wants to close immediately and others which may be
mothballed.
That could lead to about six pits being saved, although the number of
employees would have to be cut significantly.
Under existing legislation licensed miners can only employ up to 150 people
underground, whereas the average British Coal mine employs 1,000. Changing
the law would take some months and may not be possible before the end of
this parliamentary session in the autumn.
In any event, companies keen to mine under licence may hold back before
making their bids until the corporation concludes contracts with the
electricity generators for coal additional to 'base tonnage' deals likely to
be finalised later this week.
That will probably take several months, and only then will the private
sector be able to judge the size of the market available to it.
The chances are that the additional contracts will be for about 40m tonnes
over five years, leaving some space at least for the private operators.
Why should the private sector be able to make a success of mines which the
corporation says are not viable?
Mr Budge's ambition to buy up to 10 British Coal pits is based on his belief
that he can achieve far greater efficiencies than the corporation, and
supply coal at world prices far more speedily than British Coal's projection
of up to five years.
He believes that the corporation's problems are the product of its
nationalised past. 'It is a culture, an attitude,' he says. 'We would be
happy to pay similar wages to British Coal but we would get far more out of
workers.'
Mr Budge, whose company already operates two deep coal mines in north-west
England and has significant opencast interests, also believes that British
Coal suffers because of what he sees as a preoccupation with the electricity
supply industry market.
He says: 'BC is directing all its attention to one market and satisfying
others, like those for households and industrial users, with what falls off
as a result.'
Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former British Coal marketing director who hopes to
lead a consortium to licence up to four mines in the York-shire region,
agrees with Mr Budge. 'If BC closes all 31 mines, they will not be able to
supply some of the specialised markets,' he says.
'Supplies to the household market would reduce if BC closed both Markham
Main and Rossington. Neither they nor Frickley and Bentley, which we are
also interested in, have achieved their full potential. I am confident they
could be a long-run success.'
In Wales, companies including Ryan International say they could make a
success of the Betws mine which produces high-quality anthracite coal but
which British Coal is no longer interested in because of depletion of
reserves.
Ryan says its interest in the corporation's mines ends with Betws. At the
other end of the scale, Hanson is constantly rumoured to be interested in
large parts of British Coal's business.
That will become clear only after publication of the white paper.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Hospital withdraws redundancy notices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ESSEX hospital has withdrawn redundancy notices to 160 employees, whose
jobs were being contracted out to the private sector, following revised
government guidelines on European Community legislation.
Goodmayes Hospital, which will become the Redbridge Hospital Trust on April
1, said it had been advised last year by the Department of Health that
Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (Protection of Employment), or Tupe,
would not apply to its contracting-out of domestic services for its new
hospital. Where they apply, staff must be retained on existing terms and
conditions.
Mr Colin Houghton, personnel director, said revised guidelines issued
earlier this month had caused him to seek legal advice and withdraw the
notices. Negotiations would take place with ISS Mediclean, which was to have
taken over the contract, to see if it still wanted to bid.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday praised the
performance of NHS trusts as she confirmed that another 138 would become
operational from April 1. A total of 156 are now fully operational in
Britain, she said.

SECURITY issues including the Warrington bombing dominated the meeting of
the Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast yesterday, our Belfast Correspondent
writes.
The recent upsurge in terrorist violence by the IRA and loyalist
paramilitaries was high on the agenda. However, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland secretary, said of the relationship between the Royal
Ulster Constabulary and Garda, the Irish police force: 'I think that
co-operation is the best means by which the two police forces can bear down
upon these evil people, and I am very glad to say that co-operation has
never been closer.'

FT  24 MAR 93 / Minister offers BR talks on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is offering to negotiate with British Rail's board of
directors over the future of BR's Pounds 8.5bn pension scheme after
privatisation.
However, it has not backed down from its initial proposals that would allow
it to take a portion of the scheme's assets in exchange for a promise to
increase pensions in line with inflation - the BR scheme's current policy.
Last week BR's directors privately told the government that proposals for
the pension schemes after privatisation were inadequate and needed
improvement. Specifically, the directors are seeking the right of BR
employees who transfer involuntarily to the private sector to remain members
of a joint industry scheme as long as they do not leave railway employment.
Yesterday Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said: 'The government
does not rule out the possibility that the existing British Rail scheme
could remain open in the short term and the pensioners remain in it with
existing British Rail staff.'
The government contemplates that scheme members could then have five years'
grace until privatisation is completed. 'I do not at present see a need for
individuals to have a right to remain in the joint industry scheme. But we
will discuss this idea further with the trustees and others,' Mr Freeman
said.
The government had proposed that all current employees whose division is
privatised would be required to leave the BR scheme and join their new
employer's scheme.
BR directors told the government it could not support plans to review the
annual contribution to the pension scheme made under the Transport Act 1980.
The BR board also rejected two government options to provide benefits for
current and deferred pensioners - those who have left BR employment but have
not yet reached retirement age. One proposal involved running the pension
scheme as a closed fund with current assets. In the other the government
would take a portion of the pension scheme's assets for itself, guarantee
annual increases in line with inflation but would rule out any improvements
in benefits.

FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Kantor backed on EC sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSED US sanctions against EC companies represent 'a fair and measured
response' to the EC utilities directive which gives EC companies a
competitive edge in their government procurement bids, according to a
majority of the public comments submitted by US companies and trade
associations to the US trade representative.
The sanctions, due to go into effect last Monday, have been delayed at least
until after Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, meets EC
officials in Brussels next week.
Few of the public comments support a US withdrawal from the Gatt government
procurement code, a step proposed by Mr Kantor to broaden the sanctions
beyond a ban on EC sales of telecommunications, power generating equipment
and other services.
Typical of the comments was that of AT&amp;T, which expressed a hope that
sanctions could be avoided, but promised to back retaliatory measures if
Europe would not retreat.
'AT&amp;T believes US withdrawal from any of the Gatt codes would jeopardise the
open and stable world trading system,' AT&amp;T Vice President Randolph Lumb
said.
Even though telecommunications companies do not benefit from the code
because they are not covered by it, 'US withdrawal from the code would set a
very dangerous precedent for Gatt more generally, and would send a highly
negative signal regarding our view of the future of the world trading system
and the US role within it.'
The Telecommunications Industry Association disagreed and called on the
administration to study the option of withdrawing from the code.
General Electric, which manufactures steam turbines, out of the domain of
the procurement code, advocated the cut-off of all US financing of joint
US-EC research and development projects.

FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese low-alcohol tax sinks EC spirits
 -Community whisky producers are angry at what they see as further
discrimination / Scotch and water has prompted a new trade dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SCOTLAND they tend to drink it straight. In the US they prefer it on the
rocks. But in Japan, whisky is usually consumed diluted with water, a custom
which has become the focus of a growing controversy with the European
Community over anomalies in the Japanese alcohol tax system.
Mizuwari, or whisky diluted with water, has become the latest thorn in the
side of foreign whisky producers struggling to increase their share of
Japan's drinks market amid a persistent slowdown in consumer spending.
It has also become a symbol of Japan's continuing reluctance to implement a
Gatt recommendation to harmonise its alcohol taxes and remove discrimination
against imported drinks.
The growing row over mizuwari centres on a move by domestic producers to
sell whisky already diluted with water.
To help their cause, they have convinced the tax authorities that mizuwari
should carry a lower tax burden than full-strength whiskies since it has a
lower alcohol content.
The EC has been protesting to the Japanese authorities that a low-strength
whisky tax not only discriminates against foreign producers, who would not
be able to take advantage of it, but is a step backwards in the trend
towards alcohol tax harmonisation.
Mr Ronald Brown, chairman of the European Business Community Alcohol
Committee, points out that in the EC the definition of whisky is that it has
to be at least 40 degrees proof. Thus, the lower tax for diluted spirit 'can
be construed as discriminatory'.
The mizuwari dispute, however, is just the latest example of Japan's failure
to live up both to the spirit and the letter of a Gatt recommendation which
aims to remove what is seen as discrimination against European products.
In 1989, the government amended the country's alcohol tax system but left
considerable tax differentials both between imported and domestic spirits
and between white and brown spirits.
The Japanese market for white spirits, for example, is dominated by a
domestic product, shochu. The tax on shochu is Y83 (48p) a litre for high
quality shochu and Y46 a litre for low quality. This compares with Y330
(Pounds 1.92) for non-shochu white spirits, most of which is imported. The
tax on whisky is Y980 (Pounds 5.73) a litre.
'We are just asking for fair treatment,' says Mr Brown. 'We are not saying
we want equal rates, but we want a fair rate. The consumer should choose,
based on taste preferences not on tax preferences.'
The Japanese government has tried to counter EC pressure to harmonise its
alcohol taxes further by pointing to the political difficulty of bringing
the tax rate on shochu in line with that on other white spirits.
'At a time when the opposition party controls the lower house (of the
Japanese parliament),' says an official at the Finance Ministry, 'it would
be politically difficult to raise the tax on a 'people's drink' like
shochu.'
The Japanese excuse has been that since shochu is made in rural areas it
would be politically risky for the governing Liberal Democratic party to
introduce steps that might hurt producers. However, the producers of most
popular-selling shochu are large corporations.
'It is amazing that Japan continues to believe it is appropriate to protect
domestic industry with high taxes,' Mr Brown says.
The Japanese government also claims that it would be just as difficult to
reduce the tax on other spirits at a time when its revenues have suffered in
the economic downturn.
As for the lower tax on mizuwari, this is based on the same system used in
the EC for taxing drinks with lower alcohol content.
'You have whisky and lemonade, or whisky and ginger ale (in Europe). In
Japan, we are going to have whisky with mineral water, so it's the same
thing,' according to Mr Kabun Muto, chairman of the Tax System Reformation
Promotion Headquarters of the LDP.
Since the Japanese government introduced changes in 1989, foreign whisky
producers' share of the market has risen from between 8 and 10 per cent to
between 23 and 25 per cent. However, their sales in Japan have diminished
over the past 12 months as consumer spending has slowed down.
Further harmonisation of the tax system is thus seen as an important step
towards improving their prospects further in the Japanese drinks market.
The EC has said that it will be seeking full implementation of the Gatt
recommendation. The only question was when. 'At a time when the trade
deficit is running so much in favour of Japan,' says Mr Brown, 'our
submission is that this is a very good time.'

FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: China seeks to allay UK trade cut fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, yesterday sought to allay concerns
that Britain's trade with the People's Republic would be damaged by the
continuing row over Hong Kong.
Responsibility for the row and potential harm to economic ties lay with
Britain, Mr Qian said.
China did not wish to see a deterioration in the trading relationship. His
remarks coincided with renewed demands for the removal of Mr Chris Patten's,
Hong Kong's governor, published in an official Shanghai newspaper, which
described him as 'a colonialist throwback'. China has been enraged by Mr
Patten's plans for democratic reforms in the lead-up to its takeover of the
colony in 1997.
The Liberation Daily commentary, by one of China's leading commentators, He
Minze, contained bitter allusions to Britain's colonialist past. 'You've
kept Hong Kong for more than 100 years, what have you done for democracy?
Nothing] ,' Mr He observed, likening Britain's performance to that of a
prostitute who, on her retirement, urges chastity for others.
Mr Qian denied there was any comparison between China's insistence that
political issues such as human rights should not be used to undermine its
most favoured nation status in the US, and threats against British trade
over Hong Kong.
He had been asked about a statement of Mr Li Lanqing, China's foreign trade
minister, that if the row over Hong Kong persists Britain economic ties with
China would 'inevitably be affected'.
Sino-British trade was worth Pounds 1.38bn last year, with the balance
heavily in China's favour. China's exports to the UK totalled Pounds 954m,
up 35 per cent on the year before.
Mr Qian ruled out an early meeting on the vexed Hong Kong issue with Mr
Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, saying conditions were 'not ripe'
for such an encounter. He warned that if Mr Patten's reform plan was
presented to the Legislative Council it would create fresh obstacles to
talks.
Mr Qian also said China was strongly opposed to UN sanctions against North
Korea over its refusal to accept inspections of its nuclear facilities. He
said there was 'no international precedent' for the punishment of countries
withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty after refusing
inspections.

FOUR SQUARE, a UK-based subsidiary of Mars, the US confectionery and petfood
multinational, has won a Pounds 50m contract to supply Apex of Japan with
33,000 tea and coffee vending machines, as well as drinks, over the next
three years.
Apex is a market leader in Japan, operating more than 50,000 office-based
drinks vending machines, with an annual turnover of Y7.3bn (Pounds 43m) in
1992. Japan has some 5.5m vending machines - about one for every 20 people -
and almost half are drinks dispensers.
Four Square, based at Basingstoke in the UK, is understood to have an annual
turnover in the region of Pounds 100m; the deal with Apex thus represents an
important boost to the company's revenues.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Unions settle for pay rises under 4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE trade unions are accepting the lowest wage increases since the
recession of 1987.
Settlements in four leading industries - electronics, motors, shipbuilding
and steel - suggest this year's spring wage offensive will yield rises of
less than 4 per cent for most workers.
After cuts in overtime payments and bonuses are taken into account, overall
real earnings are likely to increase by less than 2 per cent this year.
Meanwhile, two government surveys predicted the economy would start to
recover from the third quarter.
Many Japanese industries are expected to reach pay settlements this week.
The low increases reflect the drive at most manufacturing companies to cut
costs after a third year of falling profits.
In the middle of the wage round several leading companies such as Nissan and
telecom group NTT announced sweeping job cuts. This has set the context for
wage bargaining.
Unions in the electrical appliance industry have agreed a 3.6 per cent rise
in basic wages, down by 1.1 percentage points on last year's increase, while
steel unions have accepted 2.6 per cent, the lowest rise for four years,
about 1 point down on last year's rise.
Toyota, the biggest car maker, yesterday agreed an increase of about 3.8 per
cent or Y11,000 (Pounds 64) a month, the lowest increase since 1987.
Only the shipbuilding and heavy machinery industry so far have reached
settlements over 4 per cent.
The news on pay deals comes as the Economic Planning Agency's index of
leading indicators, which predicts the state of the economy three to six
months ahead, rose sharply to 50 per cent in January. A reading above 50 per
cent is a sign that the economy is expected to grow. The index of leading
indicators has been below 50 per cent for more than 10 months.
Officials at the EPA were cautious about reading too much into one month's
figures. They pointed out that industrial production had yet to recover, and
inventories were still growing. The index rose from 30.8 per cent in
December, partly because of a surge in machinery orders and lower commodity
prices.
However the EPA's index of coincident indicators, which shows current
conditions, suggests the economy is still deeply depressed. The index was 11
per cent in January.
A Finance Ministry survey of large companies found most expected improvement
after July.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Japan's banks under heavy pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading banks plan to declare non-performing loans of about
Y15,000bn (Pounds 87bn) at the end of this month, up from Y12,300bn in
September, suggesting that the banking system is still under extreme
pressure from the collapse of the property and stock markets.
But the Y15,000bn figure, about 4.8 per cent of total loans, does not
indicate the true burden on the leading 21 banks, which will not include bad
loans carried by affiliated financial companies.
The figure, to be formally published by the Ministry of Finance, also does
not reflect the damage done to most Japanese banks by loans on which
interest rates have been cut to almost zero in an attempt to prop up a
collapsed company.
Japanese banks, whose bad loans are unofficially estimated at Y30,000bn,
plan to use an increase in operating profits this year to write off or make
provision for these loans, but they are being discouraged from large-scale
write-offs by a nervous Finance Ministry.
Under the ministry's guidance to banks, 'restructured' loans, or those on
which interest rates have been cut, do not show up in the non-performing
figures and, for taxation purposes, the banks can claim the lost interest as
a 'business expense'. That means a bank may have slashed the interest rate
to 0.5 per cent or less for a company which may never recover from the
financial excesses of the late 1980s, but the favourable tax treatment
encourages the institution to sit on the loan in the hope that it may turn
good.
The leading 21 banks - 11 commercial banks, seven trust banks, and three
long-term credit banks - are still finalising non-performing loan figures
for the fiscal year ending this month, but three institutions said yesterday
the total would be around Y15,000bn.
Ms Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia, said some of these
banks would like to write off more of their exposure, but had no incentive
to do so. She said the Finance Ministry was reluctant to highlight the
difference between healthy and unhealthy banks by adopting a broader
definition of 'non-performing'.

The New Zealand Labour party, which opinion polls say will easily win
November's general election, yesterday published an economic strategy
designed to double annual growth to 4 per cent and create jobs, Terry Hall
reports from Wellington.
The main plank in the policy is the development of an Enterprise Council, to
undertake long-range planning and foster industrial development. It will
include the governor of the Reserve Bank, the Treasury, trade union and
business groups. Some tax incentives will be permitted.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Canberra warned on federal deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, yesterday
warned the government that recovery from the 1990-91 recession could not be
sustained without a reduction in the federal budget deficit.
Mr Fraser's warning accompanied a widely-forecast reduction of half a
percentage point in official interest rates to 5.25 per cent, the 14th cut
since rates peaked at 18 per cent in early 1990.
Lower interest rates would assist business cash flows and encourage
investment. But the budget deficit 'will need to be reduced over the medium
term to provide room for a rising level of business investment', he said.
The deficit is forecast to reach ADollars 15.9bn (Pounds 7.7bn) this year,
equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The government
claims that economic growth will reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by
1996-97.
Meanwhile, Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, announced the promotion of
11 backbenchers in a reshuffle which stamps his authority on the Labor
government following its victory in last week's federal election.
However, Mr Keating delayed the announcement of portfolios until today,
apparently to avoid distracting media attention from challenges to the
leadership of both conservative opposition parties.
The prime minister also postponed announcing senior bureaucratic
appointments and changes in departmental structures which will accompany the
revamped government.
Several senior ministers were sacked, including Mr John Kerin, trade
minister, who was briefly treasurer (finance minister) in 1991. Mr John
Dawkins, the present treasurer is expected to retain his post.
Mr John Hewson, leader of the Liberal party, the largest partner in the
opposition coalition, comfortably defeated a challenge from Mr John Howard,
a former leader. Mr Tim Fischer, leader of the National party, was also
re-elected.

ISRAEL'S government is coming under increasing public criticism for its
failure either to stem the worsening tide of political violence or to make
progress in Middle East peace negotiations.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, who last week cut short a visit to the
US because of the situation at home, yesterday sought to invoke the spirit
of 1948 when the State of Israel was created. He reminded the public that
without the toughness shown by his generation, Israel would never have been
born.
'The Israeli public must return to what it once was: a fighting nation, a
coping nation, a nation which knows that in the current confrontation the
winner is the one who does not tire or become seized with fear,' he earlier
told the Knesset (parliament). President Chaim Herzog added his appeal for
public calm.
Mr Rabin won last June's general election on the twin policies of toughness
on security issues and quick progress towards a negotiated peace agreement
with the Palestinians. His emotional appeal to the public underlines how
little progress he has made on either issue.
On Monday night several Israelis were hurt in west Jerusalem as police with
water cannon battled hundreds of demonstrators protesting at the
government's inability to halt the wave of random stabbings by Arabs and the
deaths of soldiers ambushed in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
Since Mr Rabin ordered the expulsion of 415 men from the occupied
territories in mid-December, 12 Israelis have been killed. During the same
period Israeli forces have killed more than 70 Palestinians and wounded
hundreds more.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said talks
with Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, would be held in
Washington on Friday in a new effort to resolve the issue of the expelled
Palestinians.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Vietnam's PM to meet businessmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government is planning to show the wonders of modern capitalism
to Mr Vo Van Kiet, the Vietnamese prime minister, who arrives in Japan today
on a visit that will reflect his country's emergence from diplomatic
isolation.
Japanese officials see the five-day visit as an opportunity to introduce the
Vietnamese leader to leading business executives and to reinforce the idea
that Tokyo will have a growing political role in south-east Asia.
The visit, the first by a Vietnamese prime minister since Tokyo and Hanoi
established diplomatic relations 20 years ago, comes as Japanese companies
are rapidly expanding their investments in Vietnam. By the end of November,
28 direct investments worth Dollars 305m (Pounds 215m) had been made.
Mr Vo Van Kiet is regarded by Japanese officials as an important force
behind Vietnam's economic reform programme, and Tokyo will indicate to him
that aid will continue to flow into the country, as long as reform stays on
track.
Last November, Japan provided a Y45.5bn (Pounds 266m) commodity credit,
ending a 14-year ban on aid to Hanoi that had been maintained in sympathy
with US concerns about servicemen missing in action during the Vietnam war.
However, Japanese officials are planning to raise concerns about the
continuing Vietnamese influence on the Cambodian army, which they see as a
potential obstacle to peace there.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Kenya abandons the straight and narrow of reform: Corruption
has triumphed over donor-inspired liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S reversal of its economic liberalisation programme is a serious
challenge to the concept of linking western aid to political and economic
reforms and a sign of the stranglehold corruption has over one of Africa's
most developed economies.
The government's announcement on Monday that it was abandoning foreign
exchange reforms demanded by the country's donors and returning to a
controlled allocation system has thrown the fragile economy further into
crisis and re-opened opportunities for graft.
The move, accompanied by a series of bitter attacks on the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, signalled the government's intention to 'go it
alone' without western aid - a policy which has wrecked several other
African economies such as Zambia under ex-President Kenneth Kaunda.
The government's belligerent attitude to its western donors has also sunk
hope that pressure could be brought to bear on the country to end economic
mismanagement and corruption and release the considerable potential of its
dynamic business community.
Donors and economists believe the government's retreat is rooted in the
considerable power wielded by a handful of politicians who have stolen
millions of dollars by manipulating economic controls in their personal
favour.
For more than a decade Kenya has been making efforts to reform its economy,
supported by billions of dollars of western aid. But throughout the late
1980s the government consistently failed to fulfil its policy pledges to
donors to curb a growing budget deficit, slash the bloated public sector,
privatise inefficient government-owned companies, reform the financial
system, and free the trade regime.
At the same time, evidence continued to leak out of corruption perpetrated
by the ruling elite which has defeated reform efforts. This has taken two
forms: direct payoffs to politicians by private companies in return for
inflated government contracts or politicians using their position to build
business empires and divert money to overseas bank accounts.
Donors suspended quick disbursing balance of payments support worth Dollars
40m (Pounds 28m) a month in November 1991, pending a government commitment
to tackle corruption and introduce a serious reform programme. Donors also
decided to insist on political reform in the hope that a democratic system
would create accountability and root out corrupt practices.
President Moi responded to the suspension of western aid by introducing
multi-party democracy and sacking Mr Nicholas Biwott, one of his most
controversial ministers.
The biggest recent scandal surrounded a company called Goldenberg
International which was licensed to export gold and diamonds. The company
was paid at least Ksh1bn (Pounds 10.4m) in preferential export compensation
payments by the Treasury for inflated export shipments.
It was also granted billions of shillings by the Central Bank under a
pre-shipment financing facility - originally devised to provide cheap credit
to exporters before shipping goods. Goldenberg and some politically
connected banks - including Exchange Bank, set up last year and linked to
Goldenberg - abused the scheme to gain cheap credit to speculate on the
collapsing foreign exchange market.
The Auditor-General's report last year exposed the Goldenberg scam and
blamed the Treasury and Prof George Saitoti, vice president and minister of
finance, for allowing the scandal to continue. No action was taken and
Central Bank documents given to the Financial Times yesterday suggest that
Goldenberg continues to operate freely with official blessing, claiming to
export almost Ksh1bn of diamonds in December 1992 alone.
Furthermore the Central Bank allowed several politically connected banks
which have been in severe financial difficulties for at least two years to
run up huge overdrafts worth up to Ksh10bn in contravention of Kenyan
banking regulations. The state owned pension fund the National Social
Security Fund was also directed to lend up to Ksh9.5bn to banks desperate
for deposits.
Last month the government appeared to be grasping the nettle when it
introduced bold foreign exchange liberalisation measures. However, it failed
to mop up the excessive liquidity in the system fuelling a rapid
depreciation of the Kenya shilling and more inflation.
Bankers say the government has been reluctant to use interest rates to
squeeze liquidity because of the impact it would have on prices and on the
politically connected banks. The banks still maintain large overdrafts at
the Central Bank and last week the Central Bank rolled-over Ksh5.4bn of debt
incurred under the pre-shipment financing facility .
'The cancer in the system is the power of the political banks to determine
economic policy in their interest,' said one banker yesterday.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Clinton hopes high as Senate debates bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate yesterday began the serious and complicated business of
putting its distinctive stamp of approval on President Bill Clinton's
economic package, which easily passed the House of Representatives last
week.
The Senate, unlike the House, has few procedures limiting debate or the
number of motions that may be offered. It was expected this week to consider
as many as 60 amendments to the budget resolution bill, which is the broad
blueprint of the president's proposals.
The Democratic leadership, nurturing a 57-43 edge over the Republican party
in the Senate, remains guardedly optimistic that Mr Clinton will get most of
what he wants. But in Monday's preliminary debate, several conservative
Democratic senators laid down markers that they were less than happy with
some of the particulars in the bill.
Senator Jeff Bingaman from New Mexico, for example, complained that the
western states were being asked to bear too much of the burden of sacrifice
involved in cutting the federal budget deficit. He objected to the proposals
raising 'user fees' for farmers using federal land for grazing and to the
impact on his region of the new energy tax.
Senators David Boren from Oklahoma and John Breaux of Louisiana expressed
sympathy with the position of Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin that the
economy needed at best only about half the Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11.2bn)
short-term stimulus recommended by Mr Clinton. Mr Kohl would prefer that the
stimulus be deferred until after real spending cuts have been agreed.
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the armed services committee, again
warned that defence spending should not be irresponsibly reduced. Senator
Bennet Johnston of Louisiana may bring up his particular hobby horse, the
introduction of a national value added tax.
For their part, the Republicans may seek to embarrass Democrats by forcing a
vote on Mr Clinton's proposal to increase income taxes on more affluent
pensioners. Democrats have usually opposed tinkering with social security,
one of the great monuments of President Roosevelt's New Deal.
Senator Robert Dole, the minority leader, seems to have his troops in better
disciplined order as the Democrats, for 12 years accustomed to a Republican
president, adjust to the new reality of losing some of their notional
independence in order to support the Democrat in the White House.
But some moderate Republican senators, like James Jeffords of Vermont and
Mark Hatfield of Oregon, are known to feel that reflexive opposition to
everything in the president's package might not suit the party's interests
best, especially given the broad public support for Mr Clinton's approach
and the apparent national desire to end 'gridlock' in Washington.

FT  24 MAR 93 / US president weighs which court card to play first: Jurek
Martin fans the pack of Supreme Court candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST October Mr Bill Clinton, who has a law degree from Yale, allowed
himself the luxury of a little pre-election fancy. 'I'd give every penny
I've got in the bank for a ringside seat at the first argument between Mario
Cuomo and Justice (Antonin) Scalia.'
Now president, Mr Clinton does not have to dig into his own pocket for the
privilege. Following the announcement last Friday that Justice Byron White
is to retire from the Supreme Court, he can, if so moved, actually promote
the confrontation between the two Italian Catholics from Queens - one a
leading liberal intellectual who happens to be governor of New York, the
other the court's dominant conservative thinker.
That court watchers would love to see the sparks fly does not mean that it
will happen. Mr Cuomo, as ever enigmatic about his own future, flatly
refuses to say if he would accept a nomination to the highest US court.
He would certainly be a controversial choice, attracting the fire of an
American right wing determined to dig into a background which, shaped as it
has been by the snake pit of New York politics, is full of public and
private controversy. Even Mr Clinton once scathingly referred to suggestions
Mr Cuomo might have Mafia connections, and was obliged later to apologise.
Still, the fact remains that Mr Cuomo is the only individual ever mentioned
by Mr Clinton as the sort of person who should be on the Supreme Court. Even
Mr Clinton's most recent comments - that the new justice should have 'a big
heart' - can also be said to apply to the New York governor.
With the prospect of Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens also
retiring in the not-too-distant future, Mr Clinton could wait a while,
perhaps to allow Mr Cuomo, who is up for re-election next year, to sort out
his domestic political landscape.
The president may also conclude that there are safer options for his first
choice to the court. Distinguished federal judges Patricia Wald, who took
herself out of consideration to be attorney general, and Amalya Kearse, who
is black and a Republican appointee, would satisfy both the need for
judicial quality and, as women, for diversity, so much a criterion in
appointments to this administration. So would an Hispanic American, Mr Jose
Cabranes, the chief federal judge in Connecticut.
The right of first refusal, based on a close relationship with both the
president and first lady, might lie with Mrs Marian Wright Edelman, director
of the Children's Defence Fund, on which Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton has
served. A black woman with impeccable liberal credentials, she is reported,
however, not to want to move to the court.
Other balancing considerations may also apply, including, perhaps, the
desirability of restoring 'the Jewish seat' on the court, a constant from
1916 to 1969 when Justice Abe Fortas retired. There are also plenty of
liberal law professors around with intellectual pretensions comparable to Mr
Cuomo's (Mr Laurence Tribe of Harvard, for example).
Whoever does make the move will join a court now possessed of a fine
political balance but lacking - Justice Scalia apart - a distinctive
juridical mind. His last real intellectual counterweight was Justice William
Brennan, who retired in 1990 and is now 84 and physically frail, though
still eminently capable of exerting influence behind the scenes.
The current composition finds a conservative wing (Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, Mr Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas, the black judge whose
nomination by President George Bush attracted so much controversy). On the
relative left stand Justices Blackmun and Stevens, and in the middle
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter. Justice
White, the only Democratic appointment, often voted with the conservatives
on issues like abortion and prayer in schools.
The middle, disappointing their Republican political patrons, has just about
held the line in frustrating the conservative social agenda, above all the
determination to reverse Roe vs Wade, the landmark 1992 abortion ruling.
Presidents Reagan and Bush had sought to make opposition to abortion the
litmus test for judicial appointments. Mr Clinton has said he dislikes such
explicit criteria but that justices should believe in the constitutional
right to privacy, including freedom of reproductive choice.
More than that, however, Mr Clinton is himself a social activist in the
sense that he thinks, unlike his predecessors, that a government's role does
not have to be minimalist. The current court has, in the main, tended to
take a relatively narrow view of its own role, in sharp contrast to its
interventionist civil rights heyday under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the
1950s and 1960s.
Mr Warren, it should be noted, was neither a legal scholar nor a Democrat,
but an experienced politician, a former Republican governor of California
and vice presidential candidate in 1948. His political 'feel' provided an
added dimension to a court filled with considerable intellects.
President Clinton would doubtless like to find such a heavyweight to succeed
Justice White, who retires at the end of the summer term. If such a nominee
could at the same time engage Justice Scalia in philosophical battle, so
much the better for the fans of legalistic debate.
But there are nine members of the court, each with an equal vote, and, in
the last analysis, it is the majority which counts.
The late Justice Thurgood Marshall was proud to have been known as 'the
great dissenter' but would have preferred in the 1980s to have been on the
winning side more often.

A US federal court in Atlanta has given final approval to the settlement of
a class-action lawsuit against the main US airlines which centred on
allegations of illegal ticket price-setting through use of a computerised
reservation system.
Most of the carriers settled the suit last summer, without admitting
liability, and will pay out an aggregate Dollars 458m (Pounds 322m) - most
of it through discount coupons for future air travel.
Under the settlement, virtually anyone who took a domestic flight between
January 1 1988, and June 30 1992 can apply to share in the settlement pool.
The deadline for claims is June 1.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Craxi receives 11th warning of investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE central position of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, in
Italy's corruption scandals was underlined yesterday when Milan magistrates
issued him with an 11th separate notice that he was under investigation for
alleged illicit funding of political parties.
The latest notice was part of a batch affecting seven deputies and senators
served by Milan magistrates. Apart from alleged illicit party funding, the
magistrates are seeking to investigate allegations of corruption and the
illegal receipt of money relating to contracts from Anas, the state roads
authority, and Acea, the Rome electricity company.
All but one of the seven parliamentarians are already involved in one or
several corruption scandals. Mr Craxi received his first notice of
investigation on December 15, and on March 9 the parliamentary commission
responsible for immunity issues agreed to waive his immunity to face
corruption charges relating to the first seven requests by Milan
magistrates.
Mr Craxi has consistently denied any wrong-doing and claims the magistrates
have deliberately sought to destroy him and the Socialist party. However,
both Mr Giorgio La Malfa and Mr Renato Altissimo have been forced to resign
respectively from the leadership of the Republican and Liberal parties
because of allegations they received illegal funds.
Also yesterday, Mr Severino Citaristi, the former treasurer of the Christian
Democrats, was served with his 21st notice of investigation for alleged
corruption. This is almost double the number of notices served on Mr Craxi,
and by a long shot the record number in the current scandals.
The Christian Democrats now have 31 parliamentarians caught up in
magistrates' investigations.
The party yesterday sacked most of its national executive to try to clean up
its image. The executive was cut from 48 to 15 permanent members.
To underline the reforming nature of the meeting of the council which voted
in the new executive, party president Rosa Russo Jervolino told members
touched by the scandal to stay away.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Warning on German forces: Bundeswehr not ready for active
operations, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Bundeswehr is currently not in a position to be deployed on
active operations, according to a damning report published yesterday by the
parliamentary ombudsman responsibility for the armed forces.
Even if the political parties in Bonn were able to agree a coherent policy
on the use of German military units outside the Nato area, the Bundeswehr
would be willing but not immediately able to carry it out, he warned.
The primary reason is the upheaval caused by huge changes in structure and
planning, as a result of military cutbacks, and the integration with east
German units, he said. At the same time, German professional soldiers on
long-term commissions are suffering a crisis of morale, because of
uncertainty about their careers. Mr Alfred Biehle, who is responsible for an
annual report to the German parliament on the state of the armed forces,
issued an urgent appeal for political clarity on the role and financing of
the military, to restore confidence in the ranks.
His sweeping criticism of the government and political establishment comes
at a moment when the issue of whether German troops can serve outside the
Nato area threatens to split the ruling coalition and even bring down the
government. The Free Democratic Party (FDP), including Mr Klaus Kinkel, the
foreign minister, is demanding that German crews be withdrawn from airborne
reconnaissance aircraft (Awacs) in the Adriatic, if the UN security council
decides to enforce the no-fly zone in Yugoslavia. The FDP says it cannot be
used in such a combat-related role unless the German constitution is
changed. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and their Christian
Social Union sister party are adamant that the crews must stay on board the
Awacs, which are operated by the Nato allies jointly.
Mr Biehle, a member of the conservative CSU, said the lack of a clear policy
from the political establishment was an important factor undermining morale,
compounded by the drastic cuts in defence spending.
'For the armed forces, this has been a very difficult year,' he said
yesterday. 'The army has had more demands made on it than ever before. The
hope of getting binding decisions on a clear planning timescale is
evaporating.
'I greatly regret that the discussion over the tasks and limitations on
(military) operations has still not been concluded . . . Soldiers report
frequently on the danger of becoming ever more isolated from their comrades
in allied forces.'
He rejected suggestions that the armed forces showed growing sympathies for
right-wing political extremism, saying there had been just 61 cases of
suspected right-wing actions involving soliders, in armed forces numbering
425,000. In only one case was an officer involved.
'There is no swing to the right in the army,' he said.
Three suspected extremists have been detained after an anonymous caller
threatened in the name of Adolf Hitler to bomb a refugee hostel, police said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
A police statement said the three were held on Monday after police received
a telephone call concerning the home for asylum-seekers in
Schleiden-Gemuend, just west of Bonn.
Seventeen people were killed last year in racist violence.

THE Polish government has proposed changes to Poland's mass privatisation
plan in an attempt to gain parliamentary support for the long-delayed
project defeated in parliament last week.
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, privatisation minister, plans to re-submit a revised
two-track system which benefits pensioners and civil servants. In the first
track are 200 enterprises which will be handed over to funds whose shares
would be distributed solely to those entitled to compensation for pension
and wage cuts worth 24,000bn zloty made in 1991. These cuts were later
declared illegal, and incomes forgone then still have to be repaid by the
government.
Another 400 enterprises would be placed on the second track and given to
other funds. Their shares would be distributed to the population as
originally planned. The government has refused to bow to right-wing
nationalist pressure over foreign managers, who will retain an important
role in the new scheme. In particular the government has made no gesture to
win back rebels from the Christian National (ZChN) party who voted against
the original proposals.
Doubts remain however over the power of the limited concessions to ensure
support from the 58 former communist SLD deputies who could ensure the
passage of the plan simply by abstaining. The government is conducting
private talks to seek their tacit support.
In its new proposals however the government has refused to concede the SLD's
demand for a delay in the distribution of shares until the operation of the
first funds can be tested. Nor will it agree to give companies deemed
suitable for the scheme the right to opt out, another SLD demand.
'They (the SLD) think the mass privatisation scheme is a risky experiment,
while we think it's safe to go ahead as fast as possible,' a senior
Privatisation Ministry official explained yesterday.

FT  24 MAR 93 / EC agrees plan for ecological audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community environment ministers yesterday agreed on a
Community-wide ecological audit scheme. This will enable industrial
companies to sign up voluntarily to environmental protection goals they
themselves would set, but external auditors would verify.
The logic of the scheme is to use the market to stimulate continuous
improvement in environmental management by industry. Companies participating
in the scheme will have to make fully public the details of their
environmental performance, within agreed norms of commercial
confidentiality.
When the European Commission first drafted its proposals in 1990, eco-audits
were to have been mandatory for all industrial companies above a certain
size - and some industrialists fear that the voluntary scheme will in time
become obliga tory.
But the Commission and some companies which have already introduced
environmental auditing believe the voluntary mechanism will gradually be
seized on by businesses searching for competitive advantage in an
increasingly eco-conscious market. It is parallel to the similarly
market-based 'eco-label' scheme, agreed in December 1991, whereby companies
will apply for endorsement of their products as environmentally friendly
according to common EC standards.
Under the audit scheme qualifying companies would be able to publicise their
'green' credentials, probably through the EC emblem of 12 gold stars and a
statement indicating their participation.
But they will not be able to use the endorsement on product advertising or
on products or their packaging.
The main qualifications for participating are:
Putting in place environmental policies, goals and management systems;
Systematic self-assessment, through site audits at intervals no greater than
three years;
Full provision of information to the public on the results;
Independent verification by external auditors - who will be put on licensed
registers by each member state, within 21 months of the start of the scheme.
The regulation should come into force towards the end of this year, once
common standards are agreed by the Commission and the 12 member states.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Spain's Socialists in funds scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SPANISH tax inspectors yesterday confirmed reports that the ruling Socialist
party had financed itself illegally in the late 1980s by selling phantom
consulting services to big business.
The revelations come as polls show the Socialists slipping badly with a
general election due later this year.
Confirmation of illicit financing, after two years of vehement denials by
the party leadership, has renewed opposition hopes that corruption will
become a decisive issue ahead of the election. The inspectors, provided by
the Finance Ministry, said that consulting companies operated by senior
party officials had taken receipts of Pta1bn (Pounds 6m) from some of
Spain's largest banks and industrial companies between 1987 and 1990.
For the past two years, newspapers have been alleging that these companies -
including Banco Central, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Asea Brown Boveri's Spanish
subsidiary, Catalana de Gas and the Pryca supermarket chain - paid money to
two companies in return for expensive reports on their sectors of business.
Hardly any of the companies have since been able to produce reports for
which they paid, on occasion, more than Pta100m, some saying they had been
lost.
The inspectors implied that those reports which had been produced had been
hastily cobbled together by the business clients.
They said these clients owed about Pta437m in unpaid taxes.
The 'consulting' companies involved, Filesa and Time Export, were controlled
by Mr Carlos Navarro, the former treasurer of the Socialist parliamentary
party, and Mr Josep Maria Sala, administrative secretary of the Catalan
Socialist party and a member of the party's national executive. Money taken
from business 'clients' was then used to pay socialist election expenses
and, to disguise that, they took receipts not from party suppliers but from
companies run by Ms Aida Alvarez, the Socialist party's national financial
co-ordinator until 1986.
The Socialist party said yesterday that it would not try to protect the
parliamentary immunity of anyone implicated in the scandal, but it is not
clear whether the investigating judge, Mr Marino Barbero, will now begin
trial proceedings.

FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand yesterday came under pressure from both
sides of politics to resign, in the wake of the Socialists' defeat by the
right in the first round of the general election, but officials said he
would stay.
Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the Gaullist RPR, which polled the most votes
last Sunday, said: 'It would be in Mr Mitterrand's own interest to resign.
Otherwise he must not hinder the next government.'
Among the Socialists, the former prime minister, Mr Michel Rocard, regretted
the 'over-elitist and imperial character' of political leaders on both
sides. He said the campaign had already begun for the presidential election,
not officially due until March 1995. Mr Rocard confirmed that he would be a
Socialist candidate for the presidency, because that was the most obvious
solution.
Officials at the Elysee palace said Mr Mitterrand had a right and duty to
serve out his full seven-year term, as guarantor of the smooth running of
the constitution. He was certainly not thinking of resigning and saw
co-existence with the conservative alliance of RPR and UDF as no different
from the last period of cohabitation with them in 1986-1988.
The RPR and UDF yesterday patched up what had threatened to blow up into a
row over the share-out of seats in next Sunday's final round of voting. They
agreed to field joint candidates in all but four constituencies, where
voters will choose between runners from both conservative parties.
The deal isolates Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF. He wanted
the two parties to fight it out next weekend in all constituencies where a
Socialist had no chance of being elected to the national assembly, in the
hope that the UDF would catch up on the RPR, the bigger coalition partner.
Earlier, Mr Edouard Balladur, the RPR's front-runner for prime minister,
said the new government must be as 'open, as tolerant and as respectful of
others as possible'. His appeal for consensus reflects the sheer size of
popular rejection of the three mainstream parties.
The combined score of the Socialists, RPR and UDF has fallen from 72 per
cent in the first round of the last general election in 1988 to 57 per cent
last Sunday. Within this, the conservative allies have barely maintained
their share of the vote, enough to give them a huge majority a parliamentary
seats. Unstable or extreme minority parties, like the ecologists and
National Front, have won more votes, but few seats.
Ecologists' fortunes took a fresh dive yesterday when Mr Antoine Waechter,
head of the Greens, the older of the two ecology parties, ended his group's
electoral pact with Generation Ecologie. He called for the two parties to
field separate candidates in the 1995 French presidential elections and next
year's vote for the European Parliament. Mr Waechter said the pair's
unexpectedly poor score on Sunday showed the pact 'had not worked' and that
they had 'different sensibilities'.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's decree putting Russian press and broadcasting
media 'under his protection' sounded like a Mafia godfather making an offer
one could not refuse rather than a reformer protecting liberty.
However, it is not generally seen as repressive, partly because the
draconian-sounding part of the decree - that armed guards would be posted at
the doors of newspapers and broadcasting stations - does not seem to have
materialised. As Mr Valentin Starkov, editor of the mass circulation
Argumenti i Fakti, pointed out yesterday, he had had militia men on the door
for the past year, paying several million roubles a year for the privilege.
'We need them to protect us against the mad people who want to come and see
me about something,' he said.
Though Russia's press is immeasurably freer than it was even under Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost regime, it is still significantly constrained.
The editors of both main state television channels, Mr Vyacheslav Bragin of
Ostankino and Mr Oleg Poptsov of Russian TV, were appointed by Mr Yeltsin
and are political, not industry, figures. Most of the national and Moscow
press is pro-Yeltsin, even if often critically so.
On Mr Khasbulatov's side are only a clutch of communist and nationalist
papers, with a couple of papers taking a wavering centrist line.
The once-dominant Pravda, now owned by a Greek millionaire and still taking
the communist line, has been a strong supporter of Mr Khasbulatov. Its
splash headline yesterday was 'The people need a strong Russia: the
president needs a strong shock'.
Sovyetskaya Rossiya, the communist-nationalist paper of the Russian
communist party, takes a similar line. The influential far-right weekly Den
prefers Mr Khasbulatov to Mr Yeltsin but really likes neither, while
Rabochaya Tribuna, controlled by the Union of Industrialists, and Trud, once
the organ of the trade unions and still reflecting their view, are often
strongly critical of Mr Yeltsin - though they have preferred, in these early
days of presidential rule, to sit on the fence.
Mr Starkov, whilecritical of Mr Yeltsin, believes the biggest threat is from
parliament.
'I recently received a packet of papers from the parliamentary press office,
including a speech from Ruslan Khasbulatov, with a request that I print it.
On the basis that the speech had already been aired on TV, I didn't. Even
when this paper was controlled by the central committee of the Communist
Party, we didn't print speeches like that.'
The possibility of a takeover of the media by Congress is real enough: a
draft decree was drawn up during the last extraordinary Congress earlier
this month to take over TV and radio channels as well as the Itar Tass news
service.
In an earlier stand-off between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov, the latter
tried to repossess the daily Izvestia, once the organ of the USSR Supreme
Soviet, arguing that it was still the property of its Soviet successor, the
Russian parliament. Mr Khasbulatov did send the parliamentary guards to the
paper, but they were withdrawn without incident the next day.
Mr Starkov said: 'The president wants to be seen as a preserver of freedom:
he wants to show the country and the world his commitment to liberty. And so
I don't think there is a threat from his protection. It wouldn't accord with
the image he wants to have, to force us to do things.'

PETER the Great, the 17th century Russian reformer admired by President
Boris Yeltsin had to start his rule sharing the throne with his cousin
Princess Sophie. But it was only after he dispatched his conservative
half-sister first to a convent and killed her supporters that he was able to
launch his reforms.
Although the dashing air force general would resent the comparison, there
are at least some parallels between Vice President Alexander Rutskoi and the
hapless Sophie.
In modern day Russia, President Yeltsin finds himself in uncomfortable
cohabitation with his vice president.
From the very start of the unpopular radical reforms launched by Mr Yeltsin,
Mr Rutskoi has shared the throne but led the opposition to his policies. And
by occupying this unusual position, he has avoided being identified with
unpopular policies.
Yesterday, the 45-year-old former Afghan war veteran was even offered the
presidential throne all for himself. In calling for Mr Yeltsin's
impeachment, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of parliament, said Mr
Rutskoi should become president until fresh elections were held.
Indeed, Mr Rutskoi no doubt sees himself as the man to pick up the pieces if
things go wrong for Mr Yeltsin.
But an aide, Mr Andrei Fyodorov, said all the vice president was concerned
about was respect for the constitution and that he had nothing against
President Yeltsin. 'I see no problems between them. The problems are with
the people who surround Yeltsin who put crazy ideas into his head.'
In contrast, Mr Rutskoi's former ally in the Civic Union opposition
movement, the wily Mr Arkady Volsky, has remained silent since Saturday,
clearly waiting to see who will win before he takes sides.
Mr Rutskoi even received the endorsement of the head of the Russian
Communist party which once condemned him as a renegade for supporting
President Yeltsin two years ago.
The difference between Mr Rutskoi and Sophie, if President Yeltsin wins the
showdown with parliament, is that the vice president will keep his job -
although his ambitions to become the next president will have suffered a
serious blow.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: Sting in tail of court's judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE constitutional court's judgment on President Boris Yeltsin's appeal to
the Russian people was described yesterday by a court official as 'very
mild'. But on closer inspection the judgment has all the mildness of a
ticking time bomb.
The official noted that the preamble to the judgment expressed understanding
of the president's desire to provide stability in Russia, and that the
ruling did not demand impeachment.
It is true the preamble stresses that the court agrees on the need to end
the crisis over the division of powers, on the need to continue political
and economic reform and to safeguard the unity and integrity of the country.
It is also true that there is no call for impeachment, though the Interfax
news agency said such a clause had been in early drafts of the judgment.
Further, the judgment is careful to say that the two notorious articles of
the constitution which give all power to the congress - articles 104 and 109
 -cannot be taken at face value, but must be read in conjunction with other
articles - 1, 3, 72 and 81 - which guarantee the principle of the division
of powers.
In the past Mr Yeltsin and his supporters have pointed to articles 104 and
109 as proof that the Soviet-era constitution which still governs the powers
of the different levels of government is simply impossible to work with.
But the conclusion to the six-page judgment is, in constitutional terms,
devastating. The president is judged to have broken nine provisions of the
constitution, and various provisions of the federal treaty which Mr Yeltsin
signed with leaders of the autonomous republics, regions and districts of
Russia.
The verdict by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, yesterday
that there were clear grounds for impeachment of the president has a clear
legal basis.
The one concession made is to say that Mr Yeltsin has a right to ask the
people for an expression of trust in himself.
But he is not, in the court's view, constitutionally able to pose a question
of relative trust between himself and the parliament (as he has said he
wishes to do), nor can he ask the people who they wish to lead the country -
president or parliament.
By centring all power into his own office, says the judgment, he destroys
the principle of division of powers. He cannot hold a referendum on a new
constitution nor on a new electoral law without the permission of congress,
since that breaks a key provision of article 104.
Above all, his declaration of 'special rule' is provided for only in
extraordinary situations (which do not at present exist), and according to a
set order, which has not been followed. The judgment is thus 'mild' only in
relation to what it was thought it might say. In fact, to have stated that
the president must be impeached would have transgressed the court's powers
and intruded on those of congress, which must make that decision. Its
preamble merely says that it agrees that life should improve.
The power of the court's judgment lies in the rehearsal of what it believes
to be the breaches of the constitution. Mr Yeltsin and his supporters have
never seriously proposed that they were acting within the constitution: they
have cast doubt on the constitution itself, called the court biased and said
that they will ignore its findings.
Most seriously, the judgment presents the congress - expected to meet on
Friday - with a momentous decision. It must either vote for impeachment as
Mr Khasbulatov urges, or, if it backs away, face political oblivion.

THE shock waves caused by the spiralling crisis in Russia rolled over the

said Ukraine could not now rid itself of nuclear weapons while Russia
constituted such an unstable neighbour, writes John Lloyd.
Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, influential head of the foreign affairs committee, said
that while Ukraine would sign the start treaties, 'we can rule out joining
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which makes Ukraine a non-nuclear
state, primarily because of the situation in Russia'.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: EC proposal for Moscow to join free trade
zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC would negotiate an eventual common free trade zone with Russia, in an
attempt to underpin its economic reforms and political stability, under a
proposal the European Commission is expected to agree today.
The move comes as a senior EC delegation, including foreign ministers, is
due in Moscow to underline its solidarity with the reform process.
Brussels wants a mandate from EC member states to widen current negotiations
with Moscow on a so-called 'partnership' agreement. This is in response to
requests from the Russian government for an accord more like the
arrangements the Community now has with Hungary, Poland, the Czech and
Slovak republics, Romania and Bulgaria - the so-called 'Europe agreements'.
'One of the principal requests from the Russian side which the Community is
unable to fulfil within the existing directives is the inclusion in the
partnership and co-operation agreement of an evolutionary clause opening the
possibility at a future stage for free trade in goods, and for national
treatment for the establishment of companies and cross-border trade in
services,' according to a confidential Commission document.
The document, prepared by Sir Leon Brittan, external economic affairs
commissioner, in collaboration with Mr Hans van den Broek, external
political affairs commissioner, was largely agreed by senior Commission
officials on Monday.
The central idea is to work towards a common free trade zone with Russia -
and possibly other former Soviet republics - along with improved technical
and financial assistance to make this possible. The EC and its member
states, mainly Germany, already provide some two thirds of total financial
aid to the former Soviet Union and central and eastern Europe.
The Commission is looking for endorsement of the 'enlarged mandate' when EC
foreign ministers meet in Luxembourg on April 5, and for the agreement with
Russia to be politically rubber-stamped by June's Copenhagen summit of EC
heads of government.
The main difference between what it is seeking for Russia and what has been
negotiated with the east and central Europeans is that the drive towards a
free trade zone with the latter is linked to their eventual membership of
the EC. This is not on offer to Russia.
But the terms of trade Russia might get, according to the Commission
document, could be more favourable than for the east Europeans.

convinced emergency meeting on aid is needed

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government is now convinced that an emergency summit of leading
industrialised nations to consider aid to Russia is both desirable and
probably inevitable.
Until now, the administration has publicly confined itself to supporting a
special meeting of G7 finance and foreign ministers, still likely to take
place some time next month.
But senior officials have taken careful note of growing pressure from
President Francois Mitterrand of France, Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany for more immediate action.
Mr Kohl is in Washington to see Mr Clinton later this week and Mr Douglas
Hurd, the British foreign secretary, meets Mr Warren Christopher, the
secretary of state, in Washington today.
President Bill Clinton meanwhile has been prepared to move next month's
meeting with Mr Boris Yeltsin from Vancouver to Moscow or any other venue
requested by the Russian president. But the Russian government indicated
yesterday that this idea had been dropped.
Mr Clinton's advisers are becoming increasingly irritated that Japan still
apparently wishes the annual G7 economic summit, which is to take place in
Tokyo in July, to be the principal forum for discussing aid to Russia.
They believe the immediate imperative of putting together an aid package far
transcends Japan's territorial dispute with Russia over the Kurile islands
and its determination not have the annual summit upstaged. Some cannot
understand why Japan has not settled its differences with Russia.
Such an aid package would be intended to demonstrate support for Mr Yeltsin
as the best hope for continuation of economic reform in Russia.
But in a speech in Chicago on Monday, Mr Christopher sought to draw some
fine distinctions between backing for Mr Yeltsin in particular and for the
reform process in general.
While staunch in his approval of the Russian president, he also said, with
some nuance, 'our engagement with the reformers must be for the long haul,
whether they're out as well as whether they're in, whether they're down as
well as when they are up'.
But officials concede that it is difficult to find in Russia alternatives to
Mr Yeltsin to keep the momentum for reform going.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, the chief White House spokesman, is careful never
to identify in his daily briefings others in whom the US might be willing to
place confidence.
Mr Clinton's attachment to Mr Yeltsin, often compared to President George
Bush's support for Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the former Soviet
Union, is attracting some critical fire.
Yesterday, Dr Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, wrote in the
Washington Post that 'the US must not tie itself to any one leader of any
one government in Russia.'
He said that he personally preferred Mr Yeltsin, 'but I also believe he must
be able to stay in office by his own efforts and not through foreign
exhortations that could easily backfire.'
Senior administration officials are prepared for the fact that if Mr Yeltsin
does fall a degree of blame will be attached to Mr Clinton.
It was partly for this reason that the president, contrary to the advice of
some of his advisers, chose to hold his first formal press conference
yesterday, knowing that Russia would dominate the questions but insistent on
being given the opportunity to explain his approach in detail.
In the event, at his press conference Mr Clinton walked a similar line to Mr
Christopher's.
He endorsed Mr Yeltsin as fulsomely as might be expected but emphasised that
the greater US vital stake lay in promoting the reform process in Russia
'with or without Yeltsin.'
Asked how he would characterise the US ability to influence the immediate
course of events in Moscow, he was equally careful.
'We are not a bystander,' the president insisted, since Russian reform
needed US assistance. But ultimately the fate of Mr Yeltsin was 'in the
hands of the Russian people'.

China will not allow developments in Russia to affect relations whatever
happens, Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister said yesterday, writes
Tony Walker in Beijing.
Speaking during a session of China's parliament, the National People's
Congress, Mr Qian said the turmoil was Russia's internal affair, but he
hoped the situation would stabilise quickly. Mr Qian's non-committal
references to the constitutional crisis in neighbouring Russia - their
border is the longest in the world - reflect an apparent attempt by Beijing
to remain neutral in the crisis.
Unlike western leaders, the Chinese have given no indication that they
support Mr Yeltsin; or, on the other hand, that they might favour his
removal. China's media reporting appears to have been scrupulously
even-handed. China's communist leaders have never evinced much public
enthusiasm for Mr Yeltsin, who visited Beijing last December. Chinese
hardliners have in the past denounced him as a 'traitor to communism'.
Diplomats say that while China's leaders may lack full confidence in Mr
Yeltsin, they are more frightened of alternatives such as the emergence of
more militant Russian nationalism along their western flank.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: Reformers play last economic card - After
parliament, the offensive has moved to the central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY CALLING yesterday for the sacking of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko as central
bank chairman, Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister for economics and
finance, was playing his final card in a battle for supremacy over economic
reforms.
Now that President Boris Yeltsin has openly taken on the parliament, Mr
Fyodorov felt he had nothing to lose by demanding the head of Mr
Gerashchenko, who believes the government's strategy will lead Russia to
disaster.
At the height of the Congress of People's Deputies session which two weeks
ago humbled Mr Yeltsin, Mr Gerashchenko, who is accountable to parliament,
told the Financial Times that either the central bank could persuade the
government to change its policies or he would have to resign.
Asked whether he would resign, he said 'let's wait and see' with an amused
look that suggested that the policy rather than the central bank chairman
would change.
Now Mr Fyodorov, a 35-year-old who used to work under him at the central
bank, has declared that he is tired of waiting after three months of trying
to get the chairman to see things his way. As Mr Yeltsin has gone on the
offensive against parliament to put himself in a stronger position, so Mr
Fyodorov has chosen this moment to take the initiative against Mr
Gerashchenko.
In a direct appeal to the central bank's board of directors - which he
believes is divided into 'conformists' who back Mr Gerashchenko and younger
rebels - Mr Fyodorov set out measures he has often before demanded from the
central bank.
They include increasing interest rates beyond their extremely low levels,
limiting credit creation to government-set limits, and allowing all the hard
currency which enterprises must sell for roubles to be sold directly on the
currency market rather than transferring part of it to the central bank.
In another move to help strengthen the fast-falling rouble, he also demanded
that non-residents, who are not currently allowed to own roubles, should be
allowed to place orders to buy the currency through commercial banks.
Finally, he published a separate document emphasising a message already
conveyed in broad outline by Mr Yeltsin to former Soviet Republics: either
follow monetary, credit, customs, and currency guidelines set by Russia, or
give up the rouble as your currency.
Despite his threat that the reforms could not continue until the problem
with the central bank was resolved, he also vowed that the government would
not sit and do nothing at a time when some might take advantage of the
political crisis.
With a sure feel for the popular longing for order, he said he had ordered
the tax and customs services to strengthen their vigilance against tax
evaders and smugglers.
More seriously, he said that the government was working on a package for
tough spending cuts.
As the International Monetary Fund announced it would resume talks with
Russia in the near future, Mr Fyodorov also accused Mr Gerashchenko of
sabotaging Russian attempts to conclude a standby agreement which would
unleash more money from the Fund.
He also took the opportunity to explain tactfully to the Russian public that
the west is entitled to set conditions for any aid it provides.
'Nobody will help a country which is not pursuing economic reform, which is
not generating hard currency to pay off its debts,' he told a news
conference.
In so doing, he wants to dispel popular disillusionment which set in after
the west promised Dollars 24bn (Pounds 17bn) in aid which was either
invisible in its effect, or not granted because Russia failed to meet
conditions for it.
Despite his assurances that his main concern is about the economy, Mr
Fyodorov also confirmed his skill as a politician.
His statements yesterday, designed to deflect at least some the blame for
the country's worsening economic problems on to the central bank, are part
of a campaign to enlist public support ahead of a popular vote of confidence
called by Mr Yeltsin next month.
Starting off by declaring his unconditional support for the president, he
acknowledged that politics and the economy in modern-day Russia are linked
as nowhere else.
Mr Andrei Illarionov, deputy chief of the government's centre for monitoring
economic reforms, made his contribution to the campaign to win the
referendum and save the reforms. He claimed yesterday that it was strong
pressure on the central bank from the government over recent weeks that had
resulted in a slowing of weekly inflation from 5.2 per cent at the start of
the month to 3.8 per cent in mid-March.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Pru backs OFT over greater life costs disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL, the UK's largest life insurance company, yesterday broke ranks
with the Association of British Insurers and supported the Office of Fair
Trading's proposal to require much more disclosure about the cost of life
products.
Mr Mick Newmarch, the Pru's chief executive and a board member of the ABI,
said: 'The need for the industry to become much more transparent is
something I agree with.' The Pru was considering telling prospective
customers more about costs than current rules require, he said.
Such a move could force the Pru's competitors to follow - something many in
the industry are reluctant to do now.
Mr Newmarch's remarks, made at a press conference to announce the Pru's
annual results, referred to the OFT's report last week which concluded that
life companies do not tell consumers enough about their products to enable
them to choose among products, companies or sales agents.
The Treasury must consider the report and, if it agrees with its
conclusions, will ask regulators to draft rules for a new disclosure regime.
The ABI said last week it intended to urge the Treasury to reject the
report.
The ABI, however, yesterday appeared to be softening its stance. Mr Tony
Baker, director of public affairs, said: 'There are reservations and we will
be commenting to the Treasury and to the regulatory bodies. We've got to
wait for our members to consider the report, but we will not take lightly
going against anything the OFT has said.'
The OFT proposals were also strongly endorsed yesterday by Mr Joel Joffe,
founding director and former deputy chairman of Allied Dunbar, the UK's
biggest unit-linked life insurer.
Mr Joffe told the social security select committee at the House of Commons:
'It's ironic that the ABI has suddenly begun to express a concern over the
costs of regulation to the consumer. There will be intense lobbying by the
industry, allegedly in the interests of the consumer.'
This is the second time in recent months that Mr Newmarch has attacked his
industry's approach to regulation, arguing that it was undermining public
confidence in insurance products generally and would harm sales in the long
run.
In November, he called for statutory regulation if self-regulation could not
be made to work.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Clinton pledges US support for Russian reforms: G7 nations
consider emergency summit as EC proposes trade liberalisation talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, DAVID GARDNER and CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yester-day promised 'an aggressive, quite specific
plan for American partnership' in Russia's economic reforms, amid
preparations for a possible emergency summit of the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations to consider the political crisis in Russia.
In Brussels, the European Commission is expected to agree today on a
proposal to negotiate a broad-based trade liberalisation pact with Russia in
a bid to underpin the country's economic reforms and political stability.
A senior EC delegation of foreign ministers and foreign affairs
commissioners is due in Moscow to express solidarity with the Russian reform
process which President Boris Yeltsin is trying to salvage.
The US government has become convinced of the need for an emergency G7
summit on aid to Russia. Japan, which as host of the next regular summit in
Tokyo in July has until now been seen as reluctant to convene an earlier
special meeting, may now consider plans to bring G7 leaders together in May.
It is also proposing to bring forward a special meeting of foreign and
finance ministers to April 13 and 14, after Mr Clinton's scheduled summit
with Mr Yeltsin in Vancouver on April 3 and 4. The Russian government has
dropped the idea of moving the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting to Moscow.
The White House said earlier it would look favourably on a request to shift
the summit, but Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, said there
would be no change of venue. After meeting Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, Mr Kozyrev said their talks were aimed at preparing a
'good stage' for a 'productive summit'.
Mr Clinton endorsed Mr Yeltsin as 'the only person who has been elected to
run that country in a thousand years'. Mr Clinton said it was important 'to
understand the unique character' of the events unfolding in Russia. He
doubted the US, together with its allies, could determine what happens next,
but it was obliged to help the reform process 'at every step along the way,
with or without Yeltsin'.
He said he had not talked to the Russian president in the past few days but
had written him two letters, one of condolence on the death of Mr Yeltsin's
mother.
He commended Mr Yeltsin's determination to ask the Russian people for its
confidence in a plebiscite on April 25. This, Mr Clinton said, was
'appropriate' for a democracy.
He ducked questions on what he might do if Mr Yeltsin were unseated, on the
grounds that he did not want to say anything that might 'undermine or
rigidify' the situation in Moscow. 'We have to let it play out,' he added.
In Brussels, the European Commission wants a mandate from EC member states
to widen current negotiations with Moscow on a so-called 'partnership'
agreement. This is in response to requests from the Russian government for
an accord more like those the Community now has with Hungary, Poland, the
Czech and Slovak republics, Romania and Bulgaria - the so-called 'Europe
agreements'.
A confidential Commission document refers to the Russian government's
request for inclusion in the EC's proposed agreement with Russia of 'an
evolutionary clause opening the possibility at a future stage for free trade
in goods, and for national treatment for the establishment of companies and
cross-border trade in services'.
The document, prepared by Sir Leon Brittan, external economic affairs
commissioner, with Mr Hans van den Broek, external political affairs
commissioner, was largely agreed by senior Commission officials on Monday.
The central idea is to work towards a common free trade zone with Russia -
and possibly other former Soviet republics - along with strengthened
technical and financial assistance to make this possible.
The EC and its member states, mainly Germany, already provide some
two-thirds of total financial aid to the former Soviet Union and central and
eastern Europe.
The Commission is looking for endorsement of the 'enlarged mandate' when EC
foreign ministers meet in Luxembourg on April 5.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Call to impeach Yeltsin after supreme court ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPEACHMENT of Russian President Boris Yeltsin was demanded yesterday by
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. The call came after the
supreme court ruled that Mr Yeltsin had broken numerous articles of the
constitution.
The Supreme Soviet will meet today to consider calling on Friday a special
session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the conservative-dominated
full parliament, to discuss impeachment.
His opponents would need to muster a two thirds majority vote in Congress
for impeachment, though he refuses to recognise that Conress alone has power
to remove him.
Mr Khasbulatov said: 'We face today a direct attempt at a coup d'etat. . .
It is as clear as day that there is every ground for impeachment.' The
court's judgment said Mr Yeltsin's address to the people on Saturday, his
assumption of 'special rule' and his demand for a popular vote on who should
govern the country, on a new draft constitution and electoral law, added up
to about a dozen infractions of the constitution.
The judgment, described as 'mild' by a court official because it did not
call for impeachment and agreed with Mr Yeltsin's aims of continuing reform
and safeguarding the country's integrity, nevertheless defined his actions
as lawless.
A parliamentary session yesterday afternoon was almost immediately postponed
by the speaker as Mr Yeltsin's mother was buried in Moscow. Even hardline
deputies agreed on the need not to be thought callous in pursuing Mr Yeltsin
on a day of mourning.
The impeachment threat is now very real. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first
deputy prime minister, said in a radio interview that it was 'expected' by
the president and the government.
A senior presidential official who asked not to be named said that if the
decision were taken, the president would ignore it.
This would face the parliament and its allies with the harsh choice of
attempting to enforce it by causing Mr Yeltsin to step down and replacing
him with General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president. Mr Khasbulatov said
that, if impeachment were passed, Gen Rutskoi should take over as acting
president for a period of about three months until fresh presidential
elections were held.
Three points of conflict became clearer:
The enforcement of an impeachment ruling could lead to rival forces
attempting to deprive Mr Yeltsin of office, or protect his retention of it.
Regional and republican leaders who defy a presidential order, signed
yesterday to carry through reforms, face dismissal - but could rely on local
support to continue their defiance.
Mr Khasbulatov directly appealed to officials at every level not to follow
the president's lead but to 'stay within the limits of the constitution' - a
direct invitation for rival factions supporting the president and parliament
to form throughout the country.
However, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy premier in charge of the economy and
finance, seized the opportunity presented by special presidential rule to
call for the sacking of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman.
In a letter sent to Mr Gerashchenko and to Mr Yeltsin, Mr Fyodorov accused
the central bank chief of 'sabotaging' the government's fight against
inflation and refusing to give information on the levels of credit being
granted 'despite dozens of appeals'.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Reprieve for 12 pits planned in coal white paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABINET MINISTERS last night agreed proposals that would save or 'mothball'
at least a dozen, and possibly as many as 19, of the threatened British Coal
pits - but perhaps for less than two years.
The long-awaited coal industry white paper, expected to be approved formally
by the full cabinet tomorrow, is understood to set out how some six of the
31 threatened pits could be 'mothballed' rather than closed. Up to as many
as 13 more could be kept operating, helped by government subsidies lasting
no more than two years.
The white paper puts a heavy emphasis on speeding up coal privatisation,
with the aim of transfering many pits threatened with closure to the private
sector. The paper is understood to set out a number of possible ways to
expand the market for coal.
The possibility of a Commons vote on the package as early as next week was
being floated at Westminster last night.
Mr John Major and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will
launch a concerted campaign to win over Tory MPs who are threatening to defy
the government if insufficient miners' jobs are saved. The potential rebels
meet this afternoon.
Mr Winston Churchill, Tory MP for Davyhulme, warned last night that if the
deal was 'a two-year wonder and then all of the 31 pits that had been
threatened were to close, that would be completely unacceptable'.
If the saved and mothballed pits are added together, the proposals could be
presented as exceeding the expectations of many Conservative MPs. But the
government faces an uphill task to avoid a Commons defeat over the white
paper's proposals which fall far short of those set out by the Commons
select committee on trade and industry in a report in January.
Instead of subsidies lasting five years, as proposed by the committee, the
reprieved pits are expected to be given no more than two years to improve
their competitiveness sufficiently to survive in world markets.
No sum is expected to be put on the total Treasury grant in the white paper
but Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is believed to have resisted allowing
the subsidy to rise above Pounds 500m.
Final details of the white paper were approved at a 2 1/2 -hour meeting of
the economic and domestic policy cabinet committee, chaired by the prime
minister, at which almost the entire cabinet was present.
The draft white paper was approved in spite of the failure of British Coal
and the electricity generating companies to agree core contracts on coal
supplies from the end of this month. Earlier, Downing Street indicated that
Mr Major would still publish the white paper even if no deal were reached by
tomorrow.
The longer-term viability of many of the threatened pits will depend on
winning agreement from the electricity companies to buy coal over and above
levels expected to be set out in the core contracts.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (10): Tower of Bubble
totters - The official 'price-keeping operation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an office block in the centre of Tokyo's financial district they
call the Tower of Bubble. With a vast and beautiful oval atrium which takes
up half of the building's floorspace, it is a monument to the excesses of
Japan in the late 1980s. It also tells the story of the rise and fall of the
infamous bubble economy.
The site used to house an NTT telephone exchange, but when computer
miniaturisation meant that the building was no longer needed, the phone
company redeveloped the site as a financial centre. It now houses securities
companies such as Nomura, Salomon Brothers and BZW.
Such was the hubris that even as land prices soared in space-hungry Japan
the architects could afford the expense of the eye-catching but unproductive
void. (Perhaps presciently, the builders fitted unusually high barriers on
the areas overlooking the 20-storey hole, presumably to deter stockbrokers
from making a traditional exit in the event of a crash.)
That collapse was not long in coming. The Nikkei index sagged from 39,000 in
late 1989 to 14,300 last August before the government stepped in with a
Keynsian public works programme to prevent the real economy from sliding
into depression, and an attempt to support the stock market with public
pension funds and postal savings.
Mr Noburu Fukuda of Nikko Securities wryly calls the share support scheme a
Price-Keeping Operation, after the UN's various peace-keeping operations
around the world; a joke shared by other Tokyo brokers. But while it may
have helped prevent the widely-feared systemic collapse of Japan's banking
and life assurance industry, the Price-Keeping Operation is slowly
throttling Japan's securities houses.
For the broking community, the problem is that trading volumes have all but
dried up. The government seems determined to put a floor under share prices
 -about 16,000 on the Nikkei index - to support the banks' and insurance
companies' capital bases. But if the government has put a floor under
prices, then almost everyone else has built the ceiling. Speculative Tokkin
funds, individuals, companies with unrealised capital gains, banks and life
insurance companies with a shortage of liquid assets would all like to sell
shares above 18,000.
A stalemate between the government and investors has left the stock market
in a very narrow trading range. Few would like to guess when the market will
break out - or even in which direction the move is likely to come. That
leaves very little reason to trade, and as speculative activity has dwindled
the brokers' income has fallen.
Apart from executing the government's share purchases, practically the only
trade is in index arbitrage - a business dominated by foreign brokers. Most
Japanese securities houses think that the Tokyo Stock Exchange needs to turn
over at least 400m shares a day for the large brokers to break even. While
that is much lower than the peak volumes of 800m shares a day in 1988,
current turnover is only 200m shares a day. Brokers large and small are
haemorrhaging cash.
Opinions vary about how easily the brokers can cope. Alicia Ogawa of Salomon
Brothers thinks that there is plenty the securities houses can do. 'The big
four houses, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi, have done a lot to get costs
down,' she says. 'In September 1991 they needed a TSE turnover of 450m
shares to break even; now that's down to 350m. They can chop bonuses, cut
out new recruits, and have a higher natural wastage than many other Japanese
businesses.
'About 25 per cent of their costs are in areas such as advertising and
entertainment - which can clearly be cut back. Smaller overseas operations
and even some domestic branches are being closed or merged.'
But Noburu Fukuda at Nikko is not so sure. 'I am struggling with this
problem and it is not easy. People often say that we shed labour naturally
as women leave to get married. But fewer are leaving, perhaps because of the
economic difficulties. We can try to cut our costs by sending staff to our
affiliated companies, but then our affiliates have their own problems and
want to send people to us.
'We need to ride this together and perhaps that means forgetting bonuses.
Still, we must be careful that the pain is shared fairly. Top management
will need to sacrifice more.' Nikko is budgeting on a long run market
turnover of about 350m shares a day, but that looks optimistic. 'If things
don't start to improve soon, we will have to think again,' Mr Fukuda
concedes.
Indeed, the securities industry has made a rod for its own back by
responding so slowly. The stock market peaked over three years ago, yet it
is only in the last 12 months that securities firms started to take
significant action.
That is especially true of the second tier securities houses which are
arguably most at risk because they expanded most rapidly in the late 1980s,
and now have cost structures a long way out of balance with any likely
incomes. 'Firms like Sanyo Securities and New Japan must really be hurting,'
thinks Ms Ogawa. 'They geared up the most during the 1980s, and still need
turnover to exceed 600m shares."
If the medium sized firms are in the deepest trouble, that is only cold
comfort to the large and small brokers. Small firms are heavily dependent on
individual investors who have mostly quit the field. And while they operate
out of cheaper offices, with much lower overheads, income has almost dried
up.
Selling investment trusts managed by the large brokers which paid high
commission rates was an important source of above average commission. That
business is fading fast. Many small brokers have relationships with large
firms and look to them for salvation. They may look in vain.
Large firms, fearful that they will set a general precedent, are reluctant
to commit themselves to rescuing any but their closest allies. At least a
proportion of the smaller brokerage firms will be allowed to go out of
business.
That network of relationships is a problem for the large firms. Not only do
they have equity stakes and other ties to many small and embattled firms,
but they also have financing subsidiaries which have suffered as badly as
many banks in the property bubble. Once those subsidiaries are accounted
for, the balance sheets of even very large firms may start to look
stretched.
If the most likely scenario for the Japanese broking community is for a
rationalisation of small firms and the strengthening of the big four at the
expense of the upstart pretenders, then that outcome is crucially dependent
on the ability of the large firms to exploit the situation. The size of the
black holes in their balance sheets will determine not only the ability of
the large firms to capitalise on the exposed middle market, but also the
number of their smaller brethren they can afford to rescue.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (9): Attitudes turn
west - Higher dividends are being sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTRAST between Anglo-Saxon and Japanese attitudes could not be more
complete.
In traditionally high-inflation UK, pension funds, insurance companies and
individuals have got used to having a large holding of equities in order to
protect their wealth from rising prices. A quick glance at the performance
of gilts and equities since the first world war shows that this is no more
than good sense.
But in low-inflation Japan most money has traditionally been held in
deposits or bonds, and holding equity has been regarded as a way of
cementing corporate relationships or, in the case of individuals, gambling.
'My father has been saving for a long time and he would never consider
putting money into the stock market,' claims Ms Yukino Shigeno, an
interpreter working in Nagoya. 'He thinks it's just another way of betting
on the horses.'
That attitude is not just a jaundiced by-product of the stock market
collapse. Yet whatever the historical motives for Japanese investors holding
shares, the shock to the financial system which followed the collapse of the
bubble economy is forcing both institutions and individuals to reassess
their whole investment philosophy. It seems likely that, for better or
worse, that review will result in the import of more western investment
habits.
For a start, calls by Japan's insurance companies for higher dividends have
been a formal ritual in the past. Now they are more insistent.
Mr Hideya Kubo, a senior economist at Nippon Life, explains how
institutional pressure on Japanese companies to improve profitability is
growing.
'We have been examining corporate return on assets and equity and they are
too low. Companies are also paying out too little in dividends. We will not
be reducing our weighting in equities but we will consider selling shares in
those companies which don't regard shareholders highly.'
Such sentiments are even more keenly felt by the smaller trust banks and
life companies which are suffering most from the fall in the stockmarket.
Large life companies have assets which were acquired for next to nothing in
the aftermath of the second world war. Smaller life companies are not nearly
so feather-bedded. Some of these may be running low on reserves, and they,
rather than the banks, may be the real target for the government's price
support operation.
Alicia Ogawa, of Salomon Brothers, points out: 'Only 16 per cent of the
large banks' capital base is directly sensitive to the level of the stock
market. Even that could be replaced by subordinated bonds if the need arose.
It is the life companies which are really suffering from unrealised stock
losses.'
That seems to be confirmed by the way that the Japanese ministry of finance
has eased the rules on how life companies have to report the losses on
foreign bond holdings. The pain is clearly real.
Traditionally, Japanese investors have been happy to let company managements
run the business. Now that institutions are feeling the heat, they are less
relaxed.
'There are those who think it is necessary to review our non-interventionist
posture,' thinks Mr Kubo, 'but if Japanese companies decide to emphasise
return on assets, that will help the Japanese economy.'
That said, there is an element of posturing in the institutions' position.
Faced with having to earn high enough returns to satisfy policyholders, they
are fast running out of options. Short term deposit rates are now at 2.5 per
cent, a record low.
The only alternatives left are high-yielding foreign bonds - which carry
substantial currency risks - or equities. And as equities no longer offer
near-automatic capital gains, life companies are demanding bigger dividends.
But if the government is successful in its attempt to put a floor under
share prices and equities start to rise, Japanese institutions may be forced
back into the market, however much they kick and scream.
Even if they return, though, the lesson of the last two years is unlikely to
be lost quickly. Fund managers and individuals will probably not be prepared
to put all their faith in rising asset prices, and will demand the security
of western-style dividends.
Other western habits are likely to catch on too. The stock market will have
to become more transparent and shed its image as an insiders' club if it is
to stand any chance of regaining investors' trust. That may mean more
stringent accounting standards and a greater openness by companies. The
Dollars 1bn foreign exchange losses at Showa Shell demonstrate how easy it
is for individuals - and by implication companies - to skirt round current
accounting rules.
In particular, greater openness will be needed to encourage foreign
investment in Japanese equities - a point made by Mr Noboru Fukuda of Nikko
Securities: 'We have to work with the infrastructure to provide a
transparent and fair market. That is part of the process of re-establishing
investors' faith in shares.'
Mr Fukuda also thinks that investors need better benchmarks to measure
performance: 'There has been a decline in the attractiveness of the market.
In part that reflects investors' concern with finding an appropriate way to
value shares. They need a criterion which is convincing, and it cannot
simply be yield.' The recent western-focus cash flow measures of performance
may catch on in Japan too.
Individuals may be equally cautious about returning to the market unless
transparency improves. Many investors who ploughed their savings into the
NTT telephone privatisations have seen their shareholdings fall
dramatically. And the poor public image of equities will hardly have been
improved by the last two years of falling prices and scandals.
Bulls point to the low proportion of assets which individuals keep in
shares. The likelihood is that that it will remain low. For individuals,
shares will continue to be a home for speculative pin money.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (7): Conservatism can
be a source of strength - A non-bank faces a tough year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHETHER through accident or design, the Japan Consumer Credit Services
company (Jaccs) has emerged relatively unscathed by the rise and fall of
Japan's speculative bubble economy of the late 1980s.
During the bubble years between 1987 and 1989, when stock and real estate
prices soared, bank lending expanded prodigiously and consumer spending
surged, Jaccs was regarded as a stable but rather unexciting company.
Since the bubble was punctured in 1990 the group's conservatism has become
one of its main strengths. Avoidance of many of the problems which have hit
its competitors is a revealing reflection of the mounting difficulties of
the Japanese non-banks.
Jaccs, which is listed on the Tokyo stock market, is a leading Japanese
non-bank. The non-banks lend money for house purchases, real estate
development and consumer credit. But they do not take in deposits from
savers. They generally finance themselves by borrowing from larger financial
institutions, mainly commercial banks, and then lend this money on to
borrowers. About 80 per cent of non-bank finance comes from other financial
institutions.
The legions of non-banks - about 37,000 are registered, with about 17,000
actively trading - have been a vital outlet for bank lending into consumer
markets with which the big commercial banks were themselves unfamiliar. The
banks also used the non-banks to get round finance ministry restrictions on
lending, especially to real estate.
The non-banks were thus among the most active inflators of the bubble
economy. They more than trebled their lending, from Y31,000bn in 1987 to
Y97,000bn in March last year (the most recent figures available).
But in the past two years the non-banks have become a serious problem for
their backers among the big commercial banks, especially as real estate
lending turned sour in the late 1980s. Many of the bad loans which are
mounting up at the big banks are coming in from the small non-banks.
Jaccs managed to escape this fate. In the six months to last September its
total revenues went up by 4.4 per cent to Y913,989m, compared with the same
period the year before, with credit card income up by 13.2 per cent. In
contrast, bank lending is only growing by about 2.2 per cent. The group's
income before taxes was Y3.4bn, up 21.6 per cent. and its interim net income
was 54 per cent up, at Y1.4bn.
Several factors have contributed to Jaccs' resilience. It began life in 1954
in the northern island of Hokkaido, as a consumer credit company pioneering
the use of special tickets allowing department store customers to buy
products by paying in instalments. By 1976 it had established a national
network. Since then it has built up its business, with 7m card holders,
210,000 participating retailers, about 180 automatic cash machines and
access to a further 6,000 operators co-operatively with other financial
institutions. It steered clear of all corporate lending, including lending
to real estate developers.
Non-bank profits margins have been helped by recent cuts in the Bank of
Japan's official discount rate, which has lowered funding costs. These costs
have not been fully passed on to consumers.
Besides adopting a conservative approach to lending, sticking to core
business and avoiding adventures into real estate development, the company's
management is addressing its future aggressively - at least by the standards
of the Japanese financial system. Jaccs is spending more than Y15bn to
develop a new computer system to process transactions. Mr Naoe Sugimoto,
general manager of Jaccs' planning department explains: 'The old computer
system was purely administrative. The new system will provide us with more
management information.'
Mr David Atkinson, Tokyo banking analyst with Goldman Sachs, the securities
house, says: 'Consumer credit is largely a high volume processing business,
so it is vital to drive down costs. The Jaccs computer investment could help
to do just that.'
The group is tightening up its credit assessment to avoid adding to personal
bankruptcies. which are growing, from getting out of hand. Much of the lower
rate of consumer lending is because of tighter credit surveillance,
especially at its initial stages, Mr Sugimoto says.
Jaccs is also taking a relatively tough approach to writing off bad loans.
Most Japanese institutions want to prolong paying for bad loans over a long
period. Jaccs wants to move swiftly to cover bad loans.
It says about 2 per cent of its loans are being rescheduled. Personal
bankruptcies are rising, although it is difficult to get precise figures.
Nevertheless Jaccs provisions against bad loans have risen abruptly.
Provisions against bad loans rose from about Y2.6bn last year to Y7bn in the
six months to September. Analysts expect that provision will rise to perhaps
Y12bn next year.
Mr Sugimoto explains: 'We want to deal with bad loans as fast as possible.'
Perhaps most importantly, Jaccs is backed by the conservative Mitsubishi
Bank, which is likely to emerge from the in the Japanese financial crisis
system stronger than many of its rivals.
Jaccs will face a difficult year. Consumer spending is deeply depressed,
especially for expensive items such as cars. Personal bankruptcies will
continue to rise, a trend which may perhaps accelerate.
But Jaccs seems well placed to compete by lowering its costs in a declining
market, to raise both profit margins and market share. Mr Atkinson comments:
'Competition in the consumer credit market is shrinking. Competitors are
pulling out because they need to deal with the problems of their corporate
lending.'
For the foreseeable future, companies such as Jaccs are likely to find that
their conservatism becomes the financial fashion.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (6): High hopes
demolished - The reforms intended to widen markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE past few years, Japanese government officials and financial
institutions have debated reforms intended to demolish the walls between
banking and securities business and make the country's markets more
international and accessible.
The results of these controversial negotiations will become law next week.
But the high hopes for the reform programme have already given way to
general disappointment that a nervous government took the line of least
resistance in dealing with territory-conscious banks and brokers.
Japanese banks complain that the finance ministry has kept them out of the
stock market indefinitely, protecting brokers weakened by the collapse of
stock prices and share turnover. The brokers complain that their cherished
access to trust banking has been unnecessarily restricted and, in other
areas such as corporate bonds, trading remains weighed down by government
regulation.
Ministry of finance officials insist that the 'spirit' of reform has been
maintained in next week's changes, but that the reforms had to be introduced
more slowly than planned because of the collapse of stock prices and the
impact on brokers' competitiveness.
Professor Kazuo Ueda, co-ordinator of the Committee to Make Tokyo Markets
More Transparent and International (CTTI), an industry body with Japanese
and foreign representation, says the government must push ahead with changes
in spite of the turbulence in the stock market.
'There will be a long-term negative impact on Japan if nothing changes,'
Professor Ueda says. He argues that regulation in Tokyo will limit Japan's
ability to profit from value-added financial instruments, which are more
freely available abroad. Continuing regulation also creates difficulties for
local industrial companies seeking to diversify the sources of funds.
The tenor of debate on financial reform has reflected the mood of the
markets. During the late 1980s, when stock prices surged and brokers made
easy profits, the finance ministry presumed that banks could enter the
securities markets without undermining the brokers' profitability.
But the conclusion of the reform debate coincided with fears that an already
ailing stock market could fall to 14,000 or 12,000 or lower. Prices are now
about half the level of December 1989, while not one of the 14 largest
brokers reported a net profit for the first half (to end September). All of
them are trimming staff and closing offices.
Banks' enthusiasm to enter the broking business has been blunted by the
obvious difficulties of the securities houses, though the banking industry
was hoping that the finance ministry would give a clearer signal on a
gradually expanding role in stock trading until the end of the decade.
Under the regulation changes coming into force on April 1, Japan's 10 trust
and long-term credit banks will be able to establish securities subsidiaries
to issue - but not market - convertible and warrant bonds, and to deal in
straight bonds. Leading commercial banks were told that they must wait at
least another year for the same limited opportunities.
The ministry has plans to review the banking industry's role in the bond
market after 'two to three years'. The impression is that further reforms
will follow, but the ministry's vague promises have disheartened the banks
and given the government an opportunity to delay changes.
In return, the securities houses will be limited in their trust banking
business, though they will have more freedom to deal in investment trusts
and currency instruments. However, brokers were disappointed at being denied
access to special large-lot securities trusts and special loan trusts in
which public funds are invested, effectively protecting the vested interests
of the trust banks.
Banks and brokers are still assessing the costs and benefits of their entry
into new businesses in which they are barely able to compete with existing
players. For banks, there may be better opportunities in waiting for the
shake-out of troubled medium-sized brokers, which have suffered most from
the market collapse, and may be in need of rescue from friendly
institutions.
The collapse of stock prices has also encouraged the finance ministry to
return to the opaque ways of the past in attempting to support stock prices,
undermining a reform programme which has promised 'transparency'. In the
wake of the stock industry scandals of the past two years, the ministry
promised to clarify its 'administrative guidance' procedures, ending the
informal relationships which had previously characterised the system.
Japan's Big Four brokers, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko
Securities and Yamaichi Securities, were particularly concerned that the
scandals had damaged their relationship with ministry officials, but the
concerted government campaign to prop up stock prices has drawn the two
sides back together.
The continuing unpredictability of the ministry's decisions remains a
concern for foreign brokers and for some Japanese institutions. In its
report last month, the CTTI complained that the decision-making by the
ministry was both unclear and inconsistent, particularly in evaluating new
financial products.
CTTI estimates that only 12 of 25 financial instruments available in the US
and the EC are available in Japan, and that the ministry's policy on new
products leads to 'incongruous treatment of issues and issuers, with
insufficient consideration for the interests of investors'.
US and European brokers told the committee that, in other markets, an action
is allowed unless specifically prohibited. In Japan, on the other hand, an
action is forbidden unless specifically permitted.
But foreign financial institutions are also divided over the pace of
liberalisation, which has created new opportunities for them but which also
promises to provide more competition for companies with carefully-crafted
niches in partly closed markets.
For example, an easing of restrictions in the domestic bond market could
hurt institutions which have done well from Japanese issues in the
Euromarkets. And for foreign brokers, many of whom are still struggling to
make profits in Tokyo, the deregulation of stock brokerage commissions will
intensify competition.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (9): EC warning causes concern -
The ailing steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is an air of resignation in Prague following the latest bout of
sabre-rattling between Washington and the European Community over steel
subsidies and recent EC warnings against 'excessive' steel exports and
dumping by east European producers.
Officials know that as a small producer, the Czech Republic can do little to
arrest the wave of protectionist sentiment in the west. Mr Vladimir Dlouhi,
trade and industry minister, dismisses the EC charges as unfounded. 'There
is no dumping. There are no direct subsidies to steel mills, and practically
no indirect subsidies.' He says if the EC really wants to help eastern
Europe, it should open its markets rather than erect protectionist barriers.
Mr Vladimir Petr, director for steel at the industry ministry, takes a more
conciliatory line. 'We will do what is agreed, and we're talking to our
companies to make sure they behave themselves.' In the meantime, he says,
Czech steel makers will look for new markets elsewhere.
But there is no masking the disappointment with the EC over its threats
against a domestic industry that is already in the throes of a crisis and
whose restructuring will cause many job losses. The drive for modernisation
and higher productivity is expected to see employment in the steel industry
fall from around 85,000 today to 45,000 by 2000. Much of the burden of job
losses will fall on the north-eastern region of Ostrava near the Polish
border which is home to the Czech Republic's three biggest steel plants, Mr
Petr says.
To add to the uncertainty, new agreements with the EC will have to be drawn
up separately with the Czech Republic and Slovakia following the break-up of
the former Czechoslovak state on January 1. Czech and Slovak producers are
operating on the basis of agreements drawn up between the EC and
Czechoslovakia in 1990/91 with quotas for this year expected to remain at
their 1992 levels. This allowed for exports to the EC of 1.1m tonnes of
rolled products annually, and 60,000 tonnes a year of steel pipes.
Officials admit exports of rolled steel to the Community have doubled since
1990 when they totalled 783,300 tonnes compared to 1.5m tonnes last year,
but they say this had nothing to do with dumping.
Czechoslovak producers faced with the collapse of markets in eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union, a sharp decline in domestic consumption, and a
freeze on the domestic arms industry imposed after Czechoslovakia's 'velvet
revolution' in 1989, looked to western Europe for markets. They were
competitive because production costs are about 30 per cent lower than in the
EC, Mr Petr says. 'Wages and transport costs are low and we have cheap iron
ore from the Ukraine, but this will not last and the next three or four
years are going to be difficult.'
Officials say the Community also conveniently overlooked that Czechoslovakia
exported steel to the former East Germany when setting the quotas.
This gives no comfort to companies already struggling to survive such as the
giant Poldi United Steel Works in Kladno, some 30km west of Prague. In
February, the company appealed for urgent financial help from the government
to overcome a serious financial crisis that had already forced it to
temporarily close down two of its plants.
During the past two years, Poldi has cut its workforce by half to around
10,000 workers, with another 3,000 jobs due to go this year. Poldi's
troubles came to a head following the state-owned electricity utility's
decision to sharply reduce power supplies to the company which it said owed
it CzK260m. Poldi has debts of CzK5.1bn, but it is also owed almost CzK3bn
in unpaid bills from more than 200 customers including some of the largest
Czech companies. To overcome this debilitating circle of bad debt, it wants
the government to inject CzK1bn into the company and to allow it to raise
another CzK1bn through the sale of real estate assets.
A resumption of economic growth after the past two years' sharp fall in
output would help, but it will be a long and painful haul until the Czech
steel industry recovers. Total steel production in the former Czcheslovakia
has fallen by 20 per cent from 14.9m tonnes in 1990 to below 12m tonnes last
year, according to the latest estimates, and it is set to continue to fall.
Long-term prospects for the industry will depend on the success of
restructuring as well as on access to markets. A study commissioned by the
government and completed last June favours privatising all the Czech
Republic's steel industry with the larger companies to be split up into
smaller units to make them more attractive to foreign investors.
As a first step towards privatisation, 11 companies have been turned into
joint stock companies for which the government is hoping to find foreign
partners for joint ventures. What the government would like is to repeat the
successful sale last month of a wheel-making subsidiary of Nova Hut, the
large steel and metallurgical group, to Hayes Wheels International of the
US. The company makes about 1.5m car wheels annually, but under the
agreement with Hayes, production will be raised to 11.5m wheels a year with
supplies going to leading car manufacturers in Europe including General
Motors, Volkswagen, Renault and Mercedes.
As part of the restructuring plan, Czech steel production will be lowered
from last year's 7m tonnes to 5.5m tonnes a year by 2000. The aim is to
raise productivity and improve quality while reducing energy and raw
materials consumption. This will help to save resources as well as maintain
the competitiveness of local industry as labour and other production costs
rise.
Three large projects include construction of a new rolling mill in Vitkovice
and of a mini-mill for Nova Hut, each with an 800,000 tonnes a year
production capacity; and another mini-mill in Trinec to produce cables.
Total investment for the three projects will be CzK12.9bn spread over four
years. 'All of these priority actions should give a good return on the
capital invested,' Mr Petr says.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (10): On the track of new markets -
Profile, CKD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM the top of a hill overlooking Prosek, on the outskirts of Prague, the
sprawling rows of CKD's factories stretch across the landscape below. With a
biblical wave of the arm, Mr Jaroslav Skrhak, finance director, explains:
'All this is CKD. The land just below also used to belong to CKD but we sold
it.'
Senior managers of the group, which is one of the Czech Republic's largest
manufacturers, proudly relate the company's achievements since its beginning
122 years ago as a small workshop with the grand title of First
Bohemian-Moravian Engineering Works. 'We are the world's largest producer of
tramways, and our production of diesel engines for locomotives is comparable
to that of General Electric,' says Mr Skrhak.
Over the years, CKD has made locomotives, trams, engines, cars, airplanes,
heavy electrical machinery, compressors, mining and construction machinery,
industrial and military equipment. But the collapse of the former communist
regimes and the death of the Comecon trade bloc has robbed CKD of the bulk
of its markets, while the recession has made it that much more difficult to
switch production and exports to new markets.
'We exported mainly to the Comecon and developing countries, so to change
our markets is an important part of our restructuring. We entered western
markets, but got into trouble because of the recession. We just arrived too
late,' Mr Skrhak says.
In spite of making a small profit of CzK1.1bn on turnover of CzK14.9bn in
1991 - figures for last year are not yet available - the group faces
difficult times and restructuring is proving a painful process. Since
October 1990, CKD's workforce has been reduced from 40,000 to 17,500 today,
and more job losses are likely. Mr Skrhak says such a radical cut in jobs
was possible only because there is practically no unemployment in the Prague
area.
The group's problems were exacerbated by a rising mountain of unpaid bills
of CzK7.2bn (Dollars 250m) by customers at the end of last year, with debts
from the former Soviet Union in excess of CzK4bn. From a single Dollars 205m
Soviet contract signed in 1991 for 200 locomotives, only Dollars 75m has
been paid, and the chances of recovering the rest are practically
non-existent.
Unpaid bills by domestic customers are another problem, though Mr Skrhak
says this was at its worse in 1990-91, and the company has since adjusted
production to limit supplies to bad debtors and many have begun to pay.
'Without the (Russian) debt we would not need any government help,' he says.
Mr Jan Havelka, managing director and CKD board chairman, says it is ironic
that the former Soviet states desperately need to improve their transport
infrastructure, while CKD which can supply such equipment is forced to sack
workers and borrow money to survive.
To overcome its crisis, CKD has adopted a two-pronged strategy based on
raising fresh money to meet immediate and medium-term restructuring costs,
and on deepening its restructuring programme with the help of foreign
partners and through privatisation.
The government recently agreed in principle for a CzK1.3bn cash injection to
be provided by a bank consortium, and the company is hoping to raise up to
Dollars 60m on the international capital markets.
Separately, the company says it would be willing to transfer production and
technology for transport equipment to Russia and to provide the necessary
technicians, if international financial institutions were willing to pick up
at least part of the Russian debt.
Meanwhile, the company's exports to the Middle East are rising, and it has
big contracts for transport systems in Brazil and the Philippines
Two joint ventures - with Secheron of Switzerland for transport equipment
with a total investment of CzK140m, and with Herbiger of Austria to make
control equipment for pumps - with planned investment of CzK80m, were agreed
last year.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (5): Known for know-how
 -Morgan Stanley bucks the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICES of Morgan Stanley Japan, in central Tokyo, are protected by dour
security guards, placed there after the company received bomb threats.
As the Tokyo stock market has continued to slump, Morgan's Japanese
operations have made the US securities house one of the few to buck the
trend. But its high profitability (using the newest computer technology,
innovative but complex strategies, large capital backing) has faced
criticism from frustrated local brokers who see their losses mount.
For the six months to September, Morgan Stanley reportedly made Y12.6bn in
pre-tax profits, seven times as much as that of Daiwa Securities, the second
largest Japanese broker. Japanese brokers rely heavily on commission from
clients; they have been hit by the plunge in trading volumes. On the other
hand, the leading American brokers make profits on trading stocks,
currencies and bonds for their own accounts. Morgan Stanley has dominated
the stock index arbitrage market, securing profits from the difference in
the cash stock and futures markets.
Japanese brokers do not have the technology in risking their own capital in
the same way; they have been left behind. Moreover, local financial
authorities have quickly blamed stock index arbitrage trading and
derivatives trading, including futures and options, as the reason for the
sluggish stock market.
Trading volatility and volumes for the derivatives markets have declined as
fees have been raised and trading restrictions implemented over the past two
years. The government's support operation for the stock market - pumping in
public funds, including postal savings and public pension money - is also
watering down share price movement.
Mr Takeo Kani, chairman of Morgan Stanley Japan, says the fall in profit
chances is inevitable. 'It's the economic fundamentals which are hurting the
stock market, not derivatives trading,' he says.
However, Mr Kani says the company has developed strategies from its
experience in the past bear markets of New York and London. It also has
expertise in structured products - and a large investor base in the US and
Europe. Such skills were recently sought by the Bank of Tokyo, which issued
a perpetual subordinated bond structured with a convertible option which
allows investors to exchange the bond with the bank's shares during the
first 10 years of issuance.
Not only was it the largest yen-denominated overseas offer, but the issue
was also the first capital raising programme by a Japanese bank to be placed
with genuine European and Asian investors, instead of affiliates and
companies with close business ties. 'Morgan Stanley is known for its
know-how in equity related products, and has an excellent placement
ability,' says a Japanese banker.
Morgan Stanley has also bravely broken into the local corporate bond market,
becoming the first foreign securities house to lead a domestic issue. Morgan
introduced the fixed-price re-offering system, to enhance the transparency
in fixing the price of bonds placed with investors. Last year it began
market-making NTT shares, activating a secondary market which previously was
almost non-existent.
Morgan Stanley's future profitability in Tokyo will depend on the speed of
financial deregulation. The slowdown of deregulation in the debt
securitisation market has disappointed leading US houses in the area.
'The potential of Tokyo as an international financial market is very big,'
says Mr Kani. Regulatory restraints, however, have hampered the growth of
the market: the number of products allowed is limited. The Tokyo market's
importance among global capital markets relies heavily on the willingness of
the financial authorities to accept further financial innovation, especially
from foreign securities houses.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (4): No price movement,
no profits - Foreign brokers are forced to restructure their operations on
an ebbing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIDE has turned for foreign brokers in Tokyo. Those which had raked in
profits, despite faltering volume on the Tokyo stock market, are now being
forced to restructure their operations.
A recent announcement by Salomon Brothers that it would cut 10 per cent of
its staff in Japanese equities, signalled the demise of computer-led program
trading (which foreign brokers, especially the US houses, excelled in).
While Japanese houses, which rely heavily on commission from investors,
faced a plunge in revenue caused by the market slump, leading foreign
brokers had managed to make money from trading their own capital using
computer-led investments.
Japanese brokers persuaded the financial authorities to clamp down on
arbitrage between the cash market and stock index futures - locking in
profits between the cash and futures markets. Market share of foreign
brokers, which have greater expertise in futures and options techniques,
rose to some 20 per cent; sharply higher than the 3 per cent rise during the
first half of 1988.
However, the market slump has finally caught up with Wall Street technology.
The Japanese government badly wants to keep the stock market above 16,000
before the financial year closes in March. It has pumped in public pension
funds and postal savings to support share prices. Large investors, including
banks and insurance companies, have been ordered to stop selling.
'There are no profits where there is no price movement,' says an arbitrageur
at a UK brokerage. Furthermore, the increase in efficiency of the markets
has depressed arbitrage possibilities, as Japanese and smaller foreign
houses have rushed into the arbitrage business. Some foreign arbitrageurs
reckon profit opportunities in the Tokyo market will be gone within three
years.
Meanwhile, an increasing number of foreign houses, reliant on client orders,
have met the same fate as their Japanese counterparts as trading volumes
have plunged to a quarter of the peak of a daily average of over 1bn shares
in 1988.
County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster, announced a
total withdrawal from the Tokyo market last December - the first foreign
broker to give up membership of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Merrill Lynch
Japan announced the closure of its three retail branches. UK brokers,
including SG Warburg and Baring Securities, have also been cutting
overheads.
The winners in the current stagnant market will be securities houses with
enough capital and technology to introduce innovative products to the
Japanese market. One area in which US houses have become active is the
corporate bond market. More Japanese companies have started to dip into the
domestic straight bond market for funds, as equity-linked financing has
become difficult.
Domestic corporate bond issues surged 26.3 per cent durinbg 1992 to
Y3,010bn, and the ministry of finance also endorsed the development of the
corporate bond market by easing issuance rules.
Morgan Stanley has been the first foreign house to enter the domestic
underwriting business, with Japan's first fixed-price deal for Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone in 1991, paving the way for other Japanese companies
to use the fixed-price re-offering system in the domestic bond market.
Until the NTT issue, domestic corporate bonds were issued by the 'proposal
method', by which underwriting was awarded to the securities house with the
highest bid. The excessive competition for underwriting contracts led to
unrealistic offering prices. Mr Masaaki Nogawa, at NTT, says the company had
asked Japanese securities houses to come up with a more transparent system,
but got only lukewarm responses at the time.
Japanese houses, including Nomura Securities, admit that the domestic bond
market has taken off as a result of the NTT launch. Last year, Morgan
Stanley underwrote an NTT issue - the first in Japan - which allowed
investors to trade the bonds during the offering period. Until then,
investors had been forced to hold the bonds until the offering period was
over, making investors vulnerable to market movements.
The new methods employed by Morgan have enhanced liquidity in the secondary
market of domestic corporate bonds. Leading US houses and large Japanese
brokers have started to market-make corporate bonds, giving prices for which
they will buy and sell.
Financial deregulation in Japan, however, may pose a threat to the foreign
brokers' newly established businesses. From April, banking affiliates will
enter the bond underwriting business, as the gradual easing of barriers
between the banking and securities industries takes place.
Long-term credit banks, including Industrial Bank of Japan and Long Term
Credit Bank, which have close ties with corporate Japan because of their
traditional role of providing long-term funds, will be the first to enter
the securities business.
An official at a leading US securities house claims that if banks'
affiliates aim for market share, as Japanese banks have done in their
traditional territories, foregoing profitability, the fledgling market could
collapse.
Salomon was also disappointed recently by the approval of yen-denominated
perpetual bond issues by Japanese banks, which have long been restricted
from issuing yen-denominated bonds as it could intrude on the lending of the
long-term banks. The approval from the ministry of finance came after
Salomon's sale of foreign currency subordinated bond issues by Japanese
banks, repackaged into a yen product.
Although foreign brokers have been the leading force in trying to bring in
innovative products, and pushing for financial deregulation in Japan, they
may face increasing pressure as new markets open to Japanese institutions.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (6): Western ties cemented -
Foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE withdrawal of Soviet forces from central Europe and the consequences
which flowed from the failed Moscow coup of August 1991 have lifted the
danger of military or political pressure from the east after decades of
domination by Moscow. But, ideally, the Czech Republic, like the other
liberated states of the former Soviet empire, would like to guarantee its
future role in Europe by membership of an extended European Community and a
restructured Nato.
'Since the Czech Republic shares the same democratic values with the Nato
countries, and since it is resolved to defend these values, it considers
full-fledged membership in Nato as its long-term and irreversible goal,'
according to a foreign policy statement from the foreign ministry. For good
measure it adds: 'The republic considers an American military presence as a
guarantee of long-term European stability and also sees Czech membership in
the West European Union as its long-term goal.'
As Mr Josef Zielenic, the foreign minister, points out, the Czech divorce
from Slovakia underlines the western character of the new state. It no
longer has a common border with Hungary or Ukraine and has severed the
Danube link which physically links southern central Europe with the Balkans.
Specifically the divorce also leaves Prague free from entanglement in the
international dispute between Slovakia and Hungary over the future of the
controversial Gabcikovo dam, south east of Bratislava.
The maintenance of good relations with Slovakia has become a foreign policy,
not an internal matter, but no less important for that. Slovakia's desire
for its own international status and symbols was one of the main driving
forces behind the divorce. The two states retain important trade, financial
and, above all, human links which will have to be fostered on a new basis.
Further to the east, the potential for economic decline spilling over into
unpredictable political instability, remains considerable and the Czech
Republic, again like other states in the region, fears becoming an
uncomfortable buffer zone between hungry job seekers from the east and an
increasingly protectionist west.
But while diplomats speak of 'monitoring' developments in eastern and
south-eastern Europe and seeking opportunities for business and economic
co-operation, the main emphasis of Czech diplomacy and business will be 'to
strive for the balanced relations of partnership and co-operation with
Germany'. This is hardly surprising given the chequered history of relations
between the two states in this century and the importance of Germany as the
republic's main trade partner and most important source of future
investment.
Beyond Germany the Czech Republic also seeks to 'extend friendly relations
with the US, France and Britain and other member states of the EC and EFTA
with whom it sees its future to be ever more closely linked'.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (5): A shadow of past glories - The
tragic history of the Czech lands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dissolution of Czechoslovakia, following the collapse of the Soviet
Empire, essentially returns the map of central Europe to what it was before
the defeat of the Czech nobility at the battle of White Mountain just
outside Prague in 1620.
From then until the collapse of the Habsburg Empire in 1918 the Czech lands
of Bohemia and Moravia and the southern part of Silesia became part of the
dynastic arrangements of western Europe.
Its geographical location, rich iron, coal and other mineral resources
combined with high skill levels to make the Czech lands the most
industrially productive part of the Habsburg Empire and home to a rich
culture formed from a fertile mixture of three strong influences - Germanic,
Jewish and Czech.
Slovakia, by contrast, rather like Italy as defined by Metternich, remained
'a geographical expression' dominated culturally and politically by Hungary
for the best part of a millennium. It remained largely rural with the
Slav-speaking Slovaks living mainly in country areas. Slovakia also had some
exposure to Germanic Europe through the proximity of Bratislava to Vienna
and Bratislava and Kosice in the east were centres of thriving Jewish as
well as Hungarian communities. But to the north and east Slovakia is bounded
by Slav Poland and Ukraine, while in the south 600,000 ethnic Hungarians
still live in what used to be Hungary until the 1920 Treaty of Trianon.
These cultural and historical differences were swept aside in the pan-slavic
euphoria, fuelled by the romanticism of emigre Czech and Slovak communities
in America, which led to the creation of a federal Czechoslovak state in
1919. But this union effectively brought the Czech lands into closer contact
with the east than at any time in their history while giving Slovakia an
equally new window on the west.
For 20 years the Czechs helped finance the development of Slovakia, a
bitter-sweet experience for many Slovaks who complained of a Czech
superiority complex in their regard. When Hitler forcibly incorporated the
Czech lands into the Reich he exterminated the Jewish community and imposed
a clerical-fascist dictatorship on the nominally independent Slovak state
which was shorn of its ethnic Hungarian areas. These reverted to Germany's
wartime ally, Hungary for the duration.
Physically both parts of reconstituted Czechoslovakia were spared much of
the physical damage which war wreaked on most of the region. But
'liberation' by the Red Army in 1945 was followed by the communist coup
d'etat of February 1948.
After that the entire country was cut off from the west and re-orientated
towards the east. The Nazi's extermination of the Jews was followed by
communist persecution of ideological opponents of all kinds. Three waves of
emigration in 1938, 1948 and again in 1968 after the Soviet invasion all
impoverished the culture of Czechoslovakia and facilitated the deliberate
destruction by the Stalinist regime of bourgeois democratic ways and the
middle class which embodied them.
The expulsion of 3m ethnic Germans from the Sudetenland after 1945 added to
the tale of human misery which followed the failure of the western powers,
led by Britain and France, to stand up to Hitler at Munich in 1938.
Thanks to this tragic history the Czech lands have regained their
sovereignty as a shadow of their former wealth and sophistication. But they
are surrounded by the physical reminders of past glories, not only in the
renaissance and baroque splendours of Prague and other cities and towns, but
also in the art-deco buildings and high quality workers housing of the
inter-war republic. At that time Czechoslovakia was highly integrated into
the wider European economy with 30 per cent foreign participation in its
industry and commerce.
The last three years have seen a remarkable shift in trade back to these old
markets in the west and a growing influx of foreign capital and the
accompanying injection of technology, skills and managerial know-how. The
assumption in Prague is that divorce from Slovakia will leave the Czech
lands freer to pursue their goal of returning to their historic position in
the mainstream of Europe as soon as possible.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (7): Changes create problems -
Reforms have revitalised the banking system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE years into a radical reform programme, the Czech government has yet to
reap the fruits of its efforts to transform a centralised financial system
in which banks were little more than a conduit for distributing money, into
a competitive and efficient financial services sector.
Reforms have already changed the Czech Republic's banking system beyond
recognition from what used to be essentially a cash economy, in which money
transfers took weeks if not months, and where credit cards and cheque books
were unknown. But much remains to be done to achieve western standards.
'There are three main problem areas. The legal environment is incomplete; on
the operational side there are still considerable delays and the
introduction of new technology has been slow; and risk assessment is poor
and information on which to evaluate risk is unreliable,' says a senior
foreign banker.
The recent spectacular and rapid expansion of the banking sector also
highlighted a shortage of qualified staff and led to widespread poaching.
Only about half of bank employees have been in banking for more than a year,
and there are few experienced operations staff.
Mr Richard Salzmann, chairman of Komercni Banka, the largest commercial
bank, explains. 'Five years ago there was one big bank, the Statni Banka,
which was the central bank and a commercial bank at the same time. About 70
per cent of the Statni Banka's reserves were taken from the Czech and Slovak
savings banks. In 1990, it was split up into four banks (including an
independent central bank and Komercni Banka). After that, many more new
banks were created.'
Today there are about 70 banks including several foreign institutions active
on the rapidly expanding Czech market. Komercni Banka provides a good
example of the pace of developments. In 1990, it had 7,500 employees, 83
branches, and around 5,000 clients consisting of state companies and
agencies, and co-operatives. Today, it has 16,000 employees, 450 branches
and around 300,000 clients - about half the Czech Republic's 700,000 bank
accounts.
That experience was repeated across the spectrum of Czech banks which were
joined by the arrival of a large number of foreign banks including
Creditanstalt of Austria, Citibank of the US, Barclays of the UK, ABN-Amro
of the Netherlands, BNP-Dresdner Bank, among others.
The foreign banks benefited from their ability to offer better and faster
services than local banks. But while their arrival on the Czech scene helped
to shake up the local market, they have only a small portion of the market
which continues to be dominated by the big Czech banks. Government hopes
that opening the market to foreign banks would stimulate competition have
been disappointed.
It is early days yet, and the Czech banks face a number of challenges. Under
the previous communist regime, the banking system accumulated a large volume
of bad debts - often the result of loans extended to companies on government
orders. Many of these loans will never be paid back. To overcome this
crippling burden and to give the banks a fresh start, the government decided
to clean up the banks' balance sheets in one fell swoop by allowing them to
hive off the greater part of their non-performing loans and transfer them to
the Konsolidacni Banka (Consolidation Bank), an institution specifically
created to absorb these debts.
In 1991, about one third of Komercni Banka's CzK250bn assets was disposed of
in this way. 'The idea was to concentrate all bad loans into the
Consolidation Bank. We also sold to the bank some other bad debt which might
be redeemable in the long term,' Mr Salzmann says. The Consolidation Bank,
he says, is the 'dustbin of the financial system'.
The hope is that the Consolidation Bank will be able to get some of the
loans repaid, and sell some of the bad debt on the market. The rest will
have to be repaid by the National Property Fund, an institution established
to handle the privatisation process and which has become a large shareholder
in a large number of companies.
But in spite of this cosmetic clean-up of the banks' balance sheets, another
problem looms. Next month a new bankruptcy law comes into effect which could
result in a wave of business failures.
The collapse of markets in the former Comecon trade bloc, recession in the
west, and a severe decline in domestic output, have left a large number of
companies deeply in debt to one another due to lack of funds. 'This has been
a lousy way of compensating for the shortage of liquidity in the market,'
says one banker.
No-one knows the exact volume of inter-company debt and estimates vary
widely between CzK200bn and CzK300bn. But a large number of bankruptcies
would be a blow to the commercial banks whose main lending is to companies.
It would also affect the savings institutions which remain a principal
source of funding for the commercial banks.
Banks are also under pressure to meet tough new capital ratio requirements
of 8 per cent of lending assets by the end of this year, and for the first
time, they are being audited to western standards - which it is hoped will
reveal a true picture of their financial health.
All of which will accelerate the drive to raise productivity, and the
quality and range of services. Most banks are investing heavily in new
technology, and foreign institutions have been called upon to help with
training programmes for staff that range from risk assessment to management
skills and how to deal with people.
'We can't change everything overnight. It is an unprecedented task, but the
banks must come under pressure too,' says Mr Ivan Kocarnik, finance
minister. The government does not hide that it would like the banks to make
a more sturdy contribution to the economic reform process. It now looks as
if they will have no other choice.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (8): Ideal base for exporters - Low
cost of labour is main attraction for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECT foreign investment in the Czech Republic's part of the former
Czechoslovakia doubled last year to reach Dollars 1.2bn, in spite of
political uncertainty over the country's impending dissolution. Mr Josef
Lebl, general manager of CzechInvest, the recently established foreign
investment agency, believes this is a good omen for the future, and hopes
1993 will see even higher levels of investment.
The US was the largest investor last year accounting for 39.5 per cent of
all investments, followed by France with 20.2 per cent, and Germany which
slipped into third place with 15.6 per cent. German investors, however, have
taken the lion's share with just under 40 per cent of all foreign
investments since 1989.
The Czech Republic's main attractions for investors are its low labour
costs, at less than one tenth of German wages, and the availability of
skilled workers who can be easily trained. Its location in the centre of
Europe also makes it an ideal base from which to export westwards and
eastwards, though access to western markets is the prime consideration for
investors. The country's small domestic market of 10m people is constrained
by low per capita income.
Prospects will depend largely on economic developments outside the Czech
Republic. Local drawbacks include poor telecommunications and
infrastructure, and the lack of incentives for foreign investors.
Prime minister Vaclav Klaus says all investors - domestic and foreign -
should be treated equally, and the Czech Republic is attractive on its own
terms.
Small tax advantages are available, but officials insist incentives are not
the decisive issue and other factors are more important.
But incentives can tip the balance when companies make their choice, and the
government may be forced to change its approach in the face of strong
international competition.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (3): Clear differences
in health - Advertising is distracting the banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE BANKS, struggling to overcome an increasing burden of bad loans,
have recently been distracted by debate over a less serious threat -
comparative advertising. This could highlight the differences between strong
and weak institutions.
The banks' acceptance of comparative advertising will not mean that
television viewers will see, for example, a hard-sell on lower interest
rates by Sakura Bank or a critique of competitors by Mitsubishi Bank, but it
does reflect the Bank of Japan's belief that banks should be more
distinctive.
During the clean-up after the excesses of the late 1980s, the banking
industry has insisted that the differences between the 'good' and 'bad'
banks are minimal.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, has told banks to 'escape'
from a collective mentality and 'follow the management policy best suited
under the principle of self-responsibility.'
The blurring of the lines between banks in the past may have served the
purpose of leading public attention away from the most vulnerable
institutions, but there are clear differences in the health of commercial,
trust and regional banks, and in the level of their exposure to the property
and stock markets.
Japanese depositors appear to be making those distinctions, without the help
of comparative advertising.
Several regional banks with large non-performing property loans have seen a
sharp downturn in deposits, including Hyogo Bank, based in the western
Japan, which lost 16.5 per cent of its deposits in the first half, and whose
short-term deposits have fallen by an estimated 50 per cent over the past
year.
Anxious to avoid fears of a 'run' on banks, the Bank of Japan has quietly
pumped fresh funds into Hyogo Bank and asked three leading banks, Sumitomo
Bank, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and the Industrial Bank of Japan,
to restructure the bank's operations. The central bank and the finance
ministry have also sent managers to Hyogo, which is portrayed officially as
an extreme case and not indicative of the industry.
But the difficulty in accepting these reassurances is that it remains
unclear how many other banks are receiving less publicised attention from
the ministry and the Bank of Japan.
In the first half, provisions or write-offs of non-performing loans by 13
regional banks around Tokyo rose 3.4 times, according to the district
financial bureau.
Calculating the exposure of banks is also made difficult by the unknown
exposure of financial company affiliates, which were encouraged, during the
late 1980s, to find customers outside the range normally dealt with by the
parent bank.
The parent may own only five per cent or less of these lenders, but Japanese
customers tend to see the large name behind the small company.
Nippon Credit Bank is having to bail out three leasing and credit companies
which were large property-related lenders, whether directly to developers or
indirectly in accepting property as collateral. The three affiliates are
estimated to have non-performing loans totalling about 20 per cent of their
outstanding loans.
'Japanese have always looked at who is the ultimate backer of a loan rather
than at the hard collateral, so people thought we were backing these three
companies, even though our links to them were not that great. People should
look at more than a company's name in doing business,' an NCB manager said.
But the name behind the name will remain important. Financiers providing
funds to National Lease, a troubled affiliate of Matsushita Electric
Industrial, the electronics company, presumed that they were doing business
with the Matsushita group. These understood relationships create a range of
obligations whose long-term costs are difficult to estimate.
A similar pattern is evident in the restructuring of Nippon Housing Loan,
established by commercial banks to provide funds to home buyers, but a large
lender to the property market during the late 1980s with the result that it
has an estimated Y1,300bn in non-performing loans out of a loan portfolio of
Y2,200bn.
The finance ministry's attempts to organise a rescue of Nippon Housing have
been complicated by farmer-run financial institutions wanting the nine
founder banks and the ministry to take responsibility. However, the
politically-influential farm institutions provided about 35 per cent of
outstanding funds to Nippon Housing, and were pumping in money when the
commercial banks were reducing their exposure.
These large rescues typically involve a sharp cut in interest rates or even
a suspension of interest repayments, though the exposure to Nippon Housing
is unlikely to be counted in non-performing loan figures.
Eight housing loan companies, which diversified into risky development
projects, are in need of assistance, but these institutions have not been
able to use the banking industry's Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company
(CCPC).
The CCPC is supposed to salvage the banking system and revive the property
market, though it has had little impact since its inauguration in late
January.
By valuing property collateral and buying loan credits, the CCPC will enable
stronger banks to quicken the write-off of non-performing loans, but it will
not provide much assistance to weaker institutions.
Japanese banks are being encouraged by the Bank of Japan to take advantage
of profits generated by favourable interest rate margins to make provisions
for or write-off as much of their non-performing exposure as possible. The
case of Sumitomo Bank is cited as a model, as it plans to write-off Y100bn
of its exposure to Itoman, a collapsed trading house.
But the Sumitomo case also highlights how much farther Japanese banks, large
and small, must travel before they overcome their bad loan problems.
Sumitomo's write-offs this year will not mark the end of its bubble era, nor
even cover the exposure to the trading house, as it has an estimated Y500bn
in loans to the Itoman group.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (2): Pace is set by the
slowest - The regulatory bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE financial system seems stuck in a kind of no man's land.
During the 1980s there was considerable liberalisation, which made for
greater competition and allowed financial institutions to move into new
areas of business. But the deregulation did not go so far that financial
institutions learned to do without the guiding hand of powerful bureaucrats
at the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan.
As a result, a struggle is going on over who should pay for the consequences
of puncturing the speculative bubble economy of the late 1980s - and how it
should be paid.
Many financial institutions and some regulators seem to believe that the
best way to clear up the mess is to revert to the old regime, in which the
finance ministry and the Bank of Japan regulated the industry tightly but
kept it safe.
Others believe the way ahead is to press on with liberalisation and
deregulation to make sure that the lesson of the bubble - that financial
institutions must bear responsibility for their managerial mistakes - is
learned.
The Japanese financial system's heavy regulation dates from the second world
war. The finance ministry and the Bank of Japan emerged largely unscathed
from the initial purge conducted by the occupation forces. The Bank of Japan
and the ministry stood at the top of a strictly hierarchical financial
system, in which bank lending, interest rates, the expansion of bank
operations and the bond market were strictly controlled.
The system of wartime controls which helped to funnel investment into
Japanese industry during the three decades after the war, began to fragment
during the 1970s when the government started running up large budget
deficits. This generated a larger, more competitive government bond market,
which in turn stimulated money markets.
But it was in the 1980s that competition between different types of finance
accelerated. For most of the post-war period, banks had been the main source
of funds for manufacturing companies. In the 1980s most large companies
turned from traditional banking relationships to the equity and bond markets
for their long term funds. The banks were forced to compete in unfamiliar
areas such as consumer and real estate lending.
Much of this was facilitated and encouraged by the economic bureaucracy
which had previously kept such a tight reign on the financial system.
Now the consequences are an embarrassment for the authorities. The banks are
burdened by mounting bad debts from speculative real estate lending which
has turned sour. The stock market is in the doldrums. New issues have dried
up, trading volumes have dwindled and the Nikkei average hovers unsteadily
between 16,000 and 18,000.
The aftermath of the bubble is exposing significant differences, partly
rooted in their very different cultures, between the Bank of Japan and the
finance ministry.
The Bank of Japan prides itself on being a national institution, with strong
roots in local branches. Even its senior officials are expected to serve
long stints in the provinces.
The finance ministry, by contrast, is far more Tokyo-bound; its face is
turned towards the government - and politics. Most of the time it is a
deeply pragmatic institution, seeking solutions to political problems. It
has a few fiercely held beliefs - opposition to higher government borrowing,
for example. New ministers such as Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the recently
appointed finance minster, are expected to defend the institution's
corporate line.
The finance ministry invariably recruits not just from a single university
(Tokyo University) but from a single department (the law faculty).
Exceptions are rare.
The Bank of Japan, through its daily money market operations, prides itself
on being closer to the realities of financial markets. The finance ministry
deals in the currency of regulations and administration. It has always been
clear which has had the upper hand: the finance ministry.
However, under Mr Yasushi Mieno, its governor, the Bank of Japan has become
more independent. His speeches are littered with admonishing references to
the excesses of the bubble era and the need for discipline and
restructuring.
The Bank of Japan appears to want a more far-reaching restructuring of the
financial system. The finance ministry favours a more gradualist approach,
in an attempt to keep most financial institutions afloat.
The Bank is urging the commercial banks to take swift action to write off
their bad loans. Bank officials are warning the bigger banks that they may
only have limited room for manoeuvre to write these off.
The banks are making strong operating profits, partly because successive
reductions in the Bank of Japan's official interest rate have reduced the
cost to the banks of borrowing from the Bank. As these reductions in
interest rates have not been fully passed on to customers, the banks have
been able to widen their profit margins.
However, the Bank is warning the banks that in the next year or two, as
economic growth recovers, interest rates may begin to rise, cutting into the
banks' profits. This would limit their ability to pay for bad loans out of
their profits. Bank officials recognise that this policy would require some
banks to declare losses for the first time in their history.
In the long run, bank officials believe that smaller, weaker banks will need
to be absorbed by larger, stronger competitors, while entire sectors of the
industry - such as the housing loan companies - will need to be
restructured. They enjoyed strong growth during the real estate boom of the
1980s. However, now that most commercial banks are capable of real estate
lending, the case for separate housing loan companies has been almost
eliminated.
Finance ministry officials in the ministry's commercial banks bureau want to
take a much more gradual approach to the write-offs. One official says: 'It
is not practical nor possible to write off bad loans in one or two strokes
in the near future. It is all very well for Sumitomo to write off bad loans,
but it is a very profitable bank. For less profitable banks it is much more
difficult.'
The model for the finance ministry approach is the recent deal to bail out
Nippon Housing Loan, the troubled housing finance arm of several commercial
banks. Rather than swiftly write off Nippon Housing's bad loans, its nine
banks have agreed to forego interest on outstanding loans worth Y830bn for
up to 10 years.
The finance ministry is wedded to its traditional approach. This approach is
to view the financial system as a convoy, in which no member can be left
behind even if the rest have to move forward only at the pace of the
slowest.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (3): Architect of economic reform -
Vaclav Klaus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VACLAV KLAUS, the Czech prime minister, is the only political survivor among
the trio of central European finance ministers who emerged from academic
obscurity after the collapse of communism in 1989 to become the architects
of radical, market-based economic reform.
Poland's Leszek Balcerowicz, exhausted by the strain of piloting his
pioneering crash reform programme through the uncharted shoals of transition
politics, has returned to academic life. Mihaly Kupa, the Hungarian finance
minister, has just been replaced by a more overtly political figure. Only Mr
Klaus remains at the helm, but with greater powers and wider
responsibilities.
Beneath the tan of a weekend's skiing in the mountains close to Prague,
however, the strain of masterminding Czechoslovakia's economic reform,
followed by months of gruelling political divorce negotiations with Vladimir
Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, have deepened the lines on his face and
turned his hair silver-grey.
Increasingly exasperated by what the punctilious economist saw as the
sentimental vagueness and intellectual inconsistency of many post-communist
politicians, his rise to the pinnacle of Czech politics began in October
1990 when he became chairman of the Democratic Forum, the anti-communist
umbrella movement which emerged from the November 1989 'velvet revolution'.
Four months later the Forum split into its various ideological components,
marking the end of Czechoslovakia's brief, post-revolutionary romantic
period. Mr Klaus emerged from the split as leader of the newly-formed Civic
Democratic Party (ODS) with his reputation as an irascible opponent of
perestroika-type muddled thinking reinforced. The clear and unambiguous goal
of his new party was to make market reform irreversible and provide a
political home for the aspirant middle class.
For months Mr Klaus barnstormed the country, also appearing regularly on
television and writing a weekly column which explained the basic principles
of market economics and their relevance to the Czechoslovak situation. He
threw his weight behind the privatisation process and made a special effort
to gain support from the young.
Nearly 8.5m Czechs and Slovaks went into the June 1992 elections owning
privatisation vouchers bearing his signature as finance minister. Not all
voucher holders voted for Mr Klaus. But enough did to make the ODS the
biggest party in the Czech republic.
Significantly Mr Klaus, whose wife is a Slovak, was the only political
leader, apart from Miroslav Sladek, the neo-fascist republican party leader,
to canvass support in both halves of the then Czechoslovak federal republic.
But the ODS picked up few votes in Slovakia where the lion's share went to
Vladimir Meciar and his nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
(HSZD).
From that moment the Slovak question dominated politics in both halves of
the federal state originally founded after the post-1918 dissolution of the
Habsburg empire.
Sitting in his large, sparsely furnished office in the former federal
government headquarters Mr Klaus angrily rejects accusations that the
divorce creating two independent republics on January 1 was essentially the
product of secret diplomacy between the two leaders whose potential
long-term effects had never been thought through.
'It was the result of dozens of meetings at various levels, involving at
times the whole government or parts of government. The process was un-secret
and un-private. All the decisions - about separate currencies, monetary
reform and dozens of other issues - were made at government level, ratified
by the parliaments and contained in 35 treaties covering all eventualities,'
he says.
'The most important issue now is to complete a split which was not initiated
by us or in our interests,' he adds to deflect any suggestion that the
Slovaks were manoeuvred into a divorce which will be costly for both sides,
but particularly for the Slovaks who are losing an indirect subsidy of
around Dollars 700m annually from Prague.
'The real issue now is to maintain the level of trade. Everything else,
disputes over property and the like, is a trifle,' he adds. More than 40 per
cent of Slovakia's trade is with the Czech Republic, and until now
Bratislava has run an estimated CzK20bn annual deficit. 'Now this deficit
has to be financed or eliminated. But every 10 per cent drop in trade
translates into a 1 per cent fall in Czech GDP and twice that for the
Slovaks with their smaller economy. We hope they will be able to prevent a
vicious circle developing, but trade could fall by 30-40 per cent,' Mr Klaus
warns.
Meanwhile, the slowdown in the German economy causes further concern given
the importance of trade and proximity to the Czech Republic. These negative
factors to the east and west of the new state place a question mark over
hopes for GNP growth this year and prospects for achieving a balanced
budget.
Mr Klaus insists, however, that a slowdown in economic development will not
affect ongoing reforms designed to make Czech laws and institutions fully
compatible with European Community standards. 'Within two or three years the
Czech Republic will be like a standard EC country. We already have a
multi-party, parliamentary democracy and an economy which will then be
comparable in a systemic way and more liberalised than many European
countries.'
Ideally, Mr Klaus would like to be admitted into the EC club at that point.
But, with a shrug and a wry smile, he acknowledges: 'We will be prepared for
entry before the EC is ready to accept us.'

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (4): A rich diet of adjustment -
The economy is poised for rapid modernisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TWO question marks hang over the performance of the Czech economy in its
first year of independence. The first concern is the impact of the German
and wider European recession. The second is the rate of decline in trade
with Slovakia which is no longer benefiting from an implicit subsidy of
around Dollars 700m annually from Prague.
Neither would be such crucial factors if the economy of the new Czech
Republic with its 10m people were not so open. But the disintegration of the
former Czechoslovak economy, and rapid rise in trade with the west, means
nearly 50 per cent of the Czech GNP now derives from foreign trade.
Last year exports to OECD countries rose 20 per cent, due mainly to sharply
higher exports to Germany and other EC markets. Such exports contributed 3
per cent to GDP growth and provided the hard currency needed to pay for
higher imports of machinery, technology and know-how needed to modernise the
economy. Strong exports also financed the fast growing demand for formerly
unattainable consumer goods imports which reflects rising real incomes after
two years of sharp contraction.
Czech exports are still a fraction of OECD imports. But, like the other
central European states which have association agreements with the EC, they
are concentrated in 'sensitive areas' such as basic chemicals, textiles,
food and steel, and vulnerable to unproved 'anti-dumping' charges.
The disintegration of the former Czechoslovak economy meanwhile, entails a
self-imposed economic cost similar to that which followed the dissolution of
Comecon, the former Soviet bloc trading group. This took place in 1991
without a payments clearance system to replace the old transferable rouble
system. Learning from that experience Czech and Slovak negotiators took care
to set up their own payments clearance system between the two republics.
This is backed by a ECU130m credit facility. But that will not be sufficient
to compensate Slovakia for the loss of the Czech subsidy which allowed
Slovakia to import far more Czech goods and services than it exported to the
Czech Republic.
Economists estimate that a 10 per cent drop in trade with Slovakia, which in
1992 took an estimated 23 per cent of Czech exports, leads to a 1 per cent
decline in the Czech GNP, and twice that for the much smaller Slovak
economy. But there is a real possibility that trade between the two
countries could decline by 30-40 per cent this year, unless special measures
are taken to finance trade over and beyond the ECU130m clearing fund credit.
In spite of these negative factors the small group of free-market economists
who shape Czech economic policy believe that there is sufficient momentum in
the Czech economy to ensure growth of between zero and 3 per cent in 1993.
This contrasts with a 14 per cent GDP decline in 1991, the first year of
radical market reforms, and a 7 per cent fall last year.
The economy bottomed out in the third quarter of last year, according to Mr
Ivan Kocarnik, the minister of finance and rose nearly 4 per cent in the
fourth quarter. Inflation fell to 11.1 per cent last year from 56 per cent
in 1991 while unemployment at 2.5 per cent, remained the lowest in the
region. This is largely because the private sector has grown from virtually
zero in 1989 to around 20 per cent of the economy over the past two years.
The creation of more than 1m jobs in the private sector has compensated for
labour-shedding in the state-owned sector, especially in the big factories
and heavy industry generally.
The new year, however, started with a one-off burst of inflation resulting
from the introduction of VAT and other tax reforms. The government expects
inflation on a year-to-year basis to end up between 15-17 per cent in 1993,
of which 6-7 per cent is attributable to the VAT and other tax changes
designed to widen the tax base and shift the tax burden on to individuals
and consumption and away from enterprises. Independent economists, however,
believe inflation could rise above 20 per cent.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister who spearheaded the economic reform
process as minister of finance after 1989, notes that taxes on business were
reduced from 75 per cent in 1989 to 55 per cent last year and have been cut
again to 45 per cent as part of this years tax reforms. 'Our aim is to
create a stable, low inflation, low tax environment for business,' he says.
This is in response to complaints by business about the high corporation tax
and the complicated calculations the reformed system of taxation demands.
Mr Klaus rejects demands from foreign investors for special treatment as an
aspect of the 'perestroika mentality' created by the old communist regime.
This sought to attract foreign investment without having to change the
system so it created a corrupting climate of special concessions and
exclusions.
As prime minister Mr Klaus still pays close attention to economic policy. He
is backed by a team of competent macro-economists including Mr Josef
Tosovski, governor of the Czech National Bank, Mr Karel Dyba, the economics
minister and Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the trade and industry minister.
Much has already been achieved. The Czechoslovak crown became internally
convertible in January 1991. The divorce from Slovakia is expected to
strengthen the economic fundamentals sustaining the Czech crown. Over the
past two years consumer and producer subsidies have been eliminated, the
budget has been roughly balanced with a small deficit representing less than
1 per cent of GDP, while foreign debt, inflation and unemployment are the
lowest in the region.
On the institutional front sweeping tax reforms, including better tax
collection, have been introduced and impressive progress has been made in
creating a new banking system and dealing with the problems caused by the
collapse of Comecon trade. The related indebtedness of many state
enterprises has also been partially resolved through the creation of a
special Consolidation Bank where bad-debt write-offs are being financed by
the proceeds of privatisation.
Tens of thousands of Czechs who had properties confiscated by the communists
after 1948 have had them reinstated and the first round of Central Europe's
most sweeping mass privatisation programme (MPP) through vouchers appears to
have been successfully implemented.
It all adds up to a rich diet of change and adjustment after the stagnant
decades of Soviet-imposed 'normalisation' which followed the invasion of
1968. But further changes take place next month which are expected to lead
to even faster progress in economic and financial modernisation.
Productivity is expected to rise sharply at the cost of a sharp surge in
unemployment.
The changes which come into effect in April include adjustments to the
bankruptcy laws. These are designed to prevent uncontrolled, domino-effect
failures while encouraging the closure of persistent loss-making enterprises
and departments. At the same time the government will issue shares in the
1,500 enterprises privatised by the MPP. At this point the enterprises will
have new owners and powerful shareholders from the nine biggest investment
funds which intend to put their nominees on the board.
The success of voucher privatisation means that foreign investors will now
be able to bypass the cumbersome official privatisation process and buy
shares or privatised companies directly from their new owners, or from the
new, paperless electronic stock market which also comes into being in April.
The demand from shareholders for a return on their investment is expected to
lead to a significant labour shake-out and a sharp rise in private
investment to modernise and rationalise the new acquisitions.
Unemployment is expected to rise from 2.5 per cent to 8-9 per cent of the
workforce by the end of the year.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (1): Resistant to
change - Japan's asset-price bubble has burst, eroding profits and
relegating expansion plans to the shelf. The country's financial
institutions are under great pressure, but they will still play an important
role internationally

CREATING THE right impression is important in Japan.
The cutbacks in staff, the branch closures of brokers and banks, and the
life assurers' angry demands for better returns on shares give the intended
impression that much is changing in financial Japan, and that institutions
are finally accepting the need for a broad restructuring.
But after three years of plummeting stock prices and the collapse of the
property market the most remarkable characteristic of Japan's financial
markets is the resistance to seemingly inevitable change. The players have
yet to accept that the new financial conditions mean that they must redefine
the old relationships and reform their old ways.
There are even signs that the Japanese government, moving gradually towards
more transparent and competitive markets over the past decade, has allowed
the stock and property crash to divert attention from these goals.
'Administrative guidance' (the often opaque missives from the finance
ministry) is coming back into fashion, and policy decisions appear
increasingly designed to serve the interests of institutions - not
investors.
Relationships on the financial fringe have changed. Banks are less likely to
lend to customers outside their core clientele, and some fringe corporate
customers have sold off bank stocks. But the relationships at the centre
remain relatively stable, and the life assurers have yet to act on their
repeated threats to dump low-yielding shares.
However, the longer the share market and corporate profits remain weak, and
the larger the pile of non-performing loans, the greater the pressure for
changes to these core relationships. A surge in stock prices earlier this
month gave leading banks and brokers the impression that the worst may be
over, but the possibility remains that the real restructuring of financial
Japan may only just be beginning.
Gauging the depth of Japanese institutions' difficulties is not easy. Banks
are being encouraged by the Bank of Japan to write-off non-performing loans,
but the Y12,300bn declared by the 21 leading commercial, trust and long-term
credit banks in September is far from their total exposure.
It does not include the increasing burden of loans on which interest rates
have been shaved down to 0.5 per cent, nor loans on which token payments are
made to get round the definition of non-performing - no repayments within a
six month period. And it does not necessarily include the problem loans of
affiliates.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, admits 'there is no quick
remedy' for the non-performing asset problem, and the 'process will be
accompanied by a certain amount of pain.' He recommends that banks show more
individualism, offering distinctive services and writing-off bad loans in
line with their ability to absorb losses, not in line with their
competitors.
'Each financial institution needs to escape from its conventional management
stance of doing the same as its competitors,' Mr Mieno says.
Conscious of international attention on capital adequacy standards, Japanese
banks have boosted their ratios by taking on subordinated loans and issuing
perpetual subordinated bonds; both improve the raw figures without the pain
of structural adjustment. All leading institutions will be above the 8 per
cent minimum applying at the end of this month, but these figures will
flatter the less profitable banks.
'Restructurings' overseen by Japanese banks are also, sometimes, not what
they seem. This was highlighted by a dispute this month between Azabu
Building, a 'bubble era' developer, and its main bank, Mitsui Trust and
Banking. The bank last year provided the developer with a new president and
managerial staff supposed to reassure other creditors by reducing Azabu's
Y700bn in debts through the disposal of properties.
Azabu Building presumed that the operation would be a time-biding
'restructuring", with properties shuffled around to friendly companies or
affiliates on the understanding that they would be repurchased by Azabu when
the crisis passed. But, as an Azabu official put it, 'Mitsui Trust was
trying to sell too much,' prompting the developer's founder to dismiss the
president and the other Mitsui staff.
Japan's brokers are also yet to make the deep cuts necessary to ensure their
profitability at the present market turnover and stock price levels. Not one
of the 14 largest brokers reported a net profit for the first half to the
end of September, and apart from a sudden surge in mid-March, prices and
turnover have continued on a downward trend begun in December 1989.
The Big Four brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities
and Yamaichi Securities - are closing retail boutiques opened in shopping
centres and railway stations during the late 1980s, and cutting staff
through attrition. But they still need an average daily turnover in Tokyo of
about 400m shares, approximately double the level of recent months.
Of the 10 second-tier brokers, only those with close links to the still
powerful Nomura appear strong enough to survive without a complete overhaul.
These houses have made deeper cuts than the Big Four, but the knife must go
deeper still, as they are more reliant on trading commissions, which account
for as much as 80 per cent of their income.
The stock market's continuing weakness raises the question of what other
funding sources can be tapped by industrial companies. (They are lucky that
the life assurers are looking to return to their traditional role as lenders
to industry.
Mr Yutaka Tanaka, managing director of finance at NKK, the steel maker,
claims to have had little difficulty in finding Y220bn this year to
refinance Dollars 700m in warrant bonds issued in December 1988, and another
Y130bn in convertible bonds from July 1989. He chose bond issues in the
Euromarkets, and says his confidence came out of his belief that 'with
issues maturing, people have to find some new investment.'
Other large and respectable companies have turned to the domestic bond
market, where there were 40 issues totalling Y1,680bn in the fiscal first
half, compared to 63 issues at Y2,423bn for all of the previous year. But
the market remains heavily regulated, and the power utilities, which had the
market to themselves until the 1980s, still account for about half of the
issues.
A sign of the pressure on small companies was a decline in lending by
second-tier regional banks during February for the first time in five years.
The Regional Banks' Association blamed decline on lack of demand, but it
also reflects the unwillingness of banks to fund new corporate customers.
International companies are also finding Japanese banks more cautious. An
Asian confectionery manufacturer, having signed a lucrative contract to
supply a Japanese retail chain, told of a meeting with officials at a
Tokyo-based commercial bank which seemed to approve a loan - but a call next
day made it clear that no funds would be available.
That introversion is in contrast to the internationalism shown by Japanese
financial institutions during the 1980s. Another worrying sign is the
finance ministry's willingness to return to the wink-and-nod relationships
which tended to exclude institutions outside the inner circle in Tokyo.
Convenient rule changes - allowing life assurers to count unrealised profits
on their stock portfolios as income, and permitting banks to defer
write-downs of overvalued assets - seek to give the impression that the
worst of the crisis is over. Long-heralded reforms to demolish the wall
between banks and securities houses have been delayed.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (1): Ready to go it alone - After
the 'velvet divorce' from Slovakia, the new republic is preparing to reform
its economy, restructure its industry and modernise its infrastructure.
Anthony Robinson explains how the 10.3m people are coping with the
tumultuous changes
</HEADLINE>

THE CZECHS were always the most westerly of the Slav nations of Europe but
for nearly 50 years their incorporation into the Soviet empire turned them
reluctantly towards the east. The collapse of communism and the divorce from
Slovakia on January 1 have unshackled their drive to integrate into the
hitherto exclusively western European Community as soon as possible.
Czech and Slovak negotiators managed to dissolve the Czechoslovak federal
state in an orderly, peaceful fashion without the violent ethnic conflicts
which have accompanied the collapse of Yugoslavia. But the speed with which
the former common currency split, and their formerly integrated economies
started to diverge after the divorce, bears witness to the strength of the
forces now likely to widen their differences after 74 years of cohabitation.
Without Czech subsidies and free access to the Czech market, Slovakia faces
a period of economic and political stress which will require sympathetic
handling not only by Prague but also by western governments, including the
US. At least, that is the message which senior Czech politicians left with
the Clinton administration during a recent visit to Washington.
Many among the 10.3m Czechs in the new republic admit to a sense of relief
that they are no longer responsible for what happens in Slovakia. But this
is tinged with concern that Prague, along with ethnic minorities such as
Hungarians and gypsies, may be among the scapegoats who will be blamed if
independence does not bring the promised prosperity to independent Slovakia.
Those Slovaks who opposed the nationalist fervour whipped up before last
June's elections and wanted to keep a modified federal relationship with
Prague are now being joined by others who feel resentful that, in the words
of a senior Slovak diplomat, 'Slovakia has been dumped by the Czechs'.
In the short run, the diminution in trade between the two republics will act
as a drag on growth in both republics, rather as the collapse of Comecon and
the Warsaw Pact deepened the recession which accompanied the shift to
market-orientated reforms throughout central Europe.
The expectation in Prague, however, is that the increasingly privatised
Czech economy will respond by building up already growing markets in the
European Community, especially Germany, which surrounds the Czech Republic
on two flanks, and with Austria. Such re-orientation will be much more
difficult for Slovakia which is saddled with a less flexible industrial
base.
Even before the split the Czech Republic attracted around 90 per cent of the
foreign investment flowing into the old federation. The republic's medieval
and baroque cities, ski resorts and spas also earned the lion's share of
tourist revenue, a crucial factor keeping the Czech balance of payments in
the black.
Last year the Czech Republic earned Dollars 1.2bn officially from tourism
and at least another Dollars 500m in unrecorded tourist payments. This was
roughly equivalent to the foreign capital inflow, although total foreign
investment, including the transfer of plant and equipment, was considerably
higher.
German companies, in particular, attracted by a skilled labour force at
around 10 per cent of German wage rates, have been closing their German
plants and transporting equipment together with a handful of key personnel,
to new sites in the Czech republic, mainly just across the border in
Bohemia, the most westerly part of the country.
Stripped to essentials, the combination of low wages and high skills is the
main Czech draw card. But wages rose 22 per cent between the first and third
quarters of 1992, according to labour ministry figures, reflecting the
rising demand, especially for skilled workers, from foreign companies and
the fast growing private sector.
Foreign investors are often impressed by the skills, and willingness to
learn, of their Czech employees. But three waves of emigration, 50 years of
totalitarian rule and the attempted destruction of 'bourgeois' traditions by
successive communist governments have left their mark on the older
generation's willingness to accept responsibility and take decisions.
As elsewhere in the region, decades of communist party rule also reduced the
quality and effectiveness of local and state administration, a problem which
has been exacerbated by the loss of key personnel to the higher-paying
private sector.
The lack of an efficient administration has increased the burden on
ministers and a handful of senior officials. It has also contributed, for
example, to long delays in finalising some large foreign investment
privatisations, such as the planned investment by Siemens of Germany in the
Skoda-Pilsen engineering group, and the revised joint venture plans of
Mercedes-Benz for the Avia truck company.
Years of low investment, or at least low innovation, have also run down the
former Czech industrial power house and left a legacy of often run-down,
giant plants built to supply standardised products for Soviet-bloc markets
which can no longer pay for them. The country faces a massive programme of
industrial restructuring and infrastructure development, including crucial
areas for foreign investment, such as telecommunications and modernisation
of the banking system.
The centre-right coalition government headed by Mr Vaclav Klaus which
emerged after the elections is committed to retaining the historical role of
the Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia) as one of the most highly
industrialised areas of Europe. To ensure the rapid transformation of
industry towards new markets and products it has sponsored the most
extensive mass privatisation programme in central Europe and encouraged
foreign investment with new laws and institutions modelled on EC practice.
Modernisation involves high costs and complex issues. The communist-imposed
concentration on heavy industry, for example, has turned some of the oldest
industrial towns into ecological disaster areas. The worst pollution is to
be found among the string of industrial and mining towns in northern Bohemia
and Moravia fuelled by a chain of coal-burning power stations. Their
smokestacks continue to spew out poisons which have led to infant mortality
levels generally found in the third world, and to shortened life-spans. The
chemical-laden smoke has destroyed nearby forests and contributed to the
acid rain which has killed life in lakes as far away as Scandinavia.
Faced with this reality, the government has opted to complete a 2,000MW,
Soviet-designed nuclear power station at Temelin in southern Bohemia, the
construction of which was first ordered in 1977. It will be equipped with
fuel rods and safety equipment from Westinghouse of the US and will employ
western contractors to ensure the complex complies with the highest safety
standards when it comes on stream in the second half of the decade.
Once on stream the aim is to phase out the worst-polluting coal-fired
stations in the north and equip the remainder with expensive anti-pollution
scrubbers. But, like so many of the hard choices facing resource-starved
governments throughout the region, the nuclear option has been attacked by a
vociferous anti-nuclear lobby as another example of government arrogance,
while coal-miners facing closure of pits have joined steelworkers and others
facing unemployment in anti-government protests.
For all the problems facing the new state, however, few would return to the
stultifying atmosphere of the communist era, with its humiliating insistence
on outward conformity in exchange for a quiet life. Like millions of other
involuntary members of the Soviet empire, Czechs lived without perspective
or hope for change. Over the past three years stagnation has been replaced
by tumultuous change in all directions. Since January 1, Czechs have
regained the independence they first lost 370 years ago. They seem
determined to make a success of it.

FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures traded in a tight 20 point range as uncertainty over
political developments in Russia continued to cast a shadow over the
derivatives sector, Joel Kibazo writes.
The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,870, in
line with the equity market at the time. It moved forward in a flurry of
buying to reach 2,879 by 9am. It then started drifting lower after the early
momentum ran out of steam as worries about Russia's future once again became
a focus of concern.
Sporadic selling saw the June contract continue to fall , trading at 2,854
by lunch time, before bargain hunting ahead of the opening on Wall Street
resulted in it bouncing back to stand level with the day's opening.
The early weakness in New York saw independent traders once again turn
sellers of the June contract but this was countered towards the close by a
bout of short covering.
The June contract closed at 2,870, up 18 on Monday's close and in line with
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 9 points. Turnover was a
reasonable 9,629 lots.
A big trade by James Capel dominated the session in traded options. It was
reported to have accounted for the majority of the day's business in the
Euro FT-SE 100 option which totalled 8,911 lots. It traded 5,694. Glaxo was
the busiest stock option at 1,517 lots.

FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Life profits move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that United Friendly, the life assurance group, is examining ways of
determining ownership of its life fund and methods of distributing profits
from future life insurance profits triggered an upsurge in United shares and
similar gains in other life stocks.
Life assurance specialists said the move by United was not entirely
unexpected and follows similar ones by other life companies.
'It is a positive step forward and should put pressure on other life
companies,' commented the insurance team at Charterhouse Tilney, the
stockbroker.
Mr Youssef Ziai at Morgan Stanley adopted a much more cautious view: 'This
could be the last piece of positive news in the sector for some time and is
now fully reflected in share prices.'
United shares jumped 65 to 715p, having touched a peak 725p. Britannic and
Refuge, seen as likely candidates to adopt a similar approach to their life
funds, rose 13 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. The latter closed 112
higher at a record 1130p and the former a massive 172 up at an all-time high
of 1475p.

FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bass weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further worries over the domestic brewing market were evident as Bass once
again bore the brunt of market anxiety. Kleinwort Benson was one of two
houses to chop its figures on the hotel and brewery group, blaming a
combination of tough domestic competition and increased capital expenditure
in its pub estate. The broker now expects profits of Pounds 555m, down
Pounds 18m, for this year, and for Pounds 618m, down Pounds 10m, for 1994.
NatWest Securities also raised fears over the domestic market and issued a
sell note on the stock. The house warns that the battle being joined for
market share, chiefly with Courage, will eventually be won by Bass but cost
it 'reduced profitability over several years.' NatWest cut its forecasts to
Pounds 572m in 1993 and Pounds 595m in 1994. The shares dropped 13 to 562p
in turnover of 1.6m.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (11): Home town woes -
Small brokers are feeling the pinch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY YEAR in Gifu there is a nearly-naked ceremony where hundreds of men
gather for a traditional rite of male bonding. But this is hardly typical of
a town in the heart of the Chubu manufacturing region which surrounds
Nagoya. The area is steeped in conservative values.
While manufacturing remains the engine of the Chubo economy, the finance
community based in Nagoya has a problem.
Nagoya lies about halfway between Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's second city. The
improvements in communications and technology have meant that business has
steadily been sucked out of the Nagoya stock exchange and on to the larger
markets of Tokyo and Osaka. Even the regional companies which have
traditionally used a listing on Nagoya as a stepping stone are being tempted
away.
That only adds to the woes of small town brokers such as Dai-Ichi Gifu,
already suffering badly from the bursting of Japan's bubble economy. Most of
Dai-Ichi Gifu's customers are individual savers; in the past they have
tended to invest in blue chip shares and, sometimes, local companies which
they know well.
Turnover has slumped with the stockmarket - particularly in pooled
investments such as investment trusts, which paid the highest commissions.
'People have seen the value of their investment trusts fall sharply,'
explains Mr Hiroki Mori, president of Dai-Ichi Gifu. 'They just are not
prepared to buy any more until prices rise.'
Mr Mori paints a picture of his customers which looks much like that of
small investors everywhere. Contrary to the popular western myth of the
housewife share trader in Osaka, it is usually the father of the family who
takes the investment decisions. Mr Mori's male customers outnumber the women
by four to one.
They typically have stockmarket holdings ranging from Y2m to Y10m, and the
money is split between two and 10 stocks. Average families might keep 10 per
cent of their funds in shares, and only the most adventurous keep more than
a quarter in equities. However, unlike many other countries it is not true
that stock investment is more popular with the rich - Japanese investors
tend to keep more of their money in property or deposits than their western
counterparts.
Dai-Ichi Gifu feels the backwash of the recession. Turnover is now only 20
per cent of the peak, and many of the brokers' 10,000 clients, who were
dealing a couple of times a month, may now only trade once a quarter.
Yet the firm has some protection. 'We have lower running costs than the big
houses because rents and overheads are cheaper here,' says Mr Mori. 'Our 22
sales people are split between three branches and the firm only employs 45
people overall. Though turnover has fallen badly, we do not need as much as
the large houses to keep going.'
That may be true, but cost savings are still needed. The company has reduced
its staff and is cutting back on information services such as chart books
and monitors. Low revenues may mean that many small brokers will not
survive, and some will have to try to fall back on their ties to larger
firms such as Nomura - if big brother is willing to help.
Mr Ichiro Kawai, president of the Nagoya exchange, offers little comfort to
his beleaguered members. 'We are trying to encourage trade on the exchange,
but what business there is gravitates to Tokyo or the futures market in
Osaka. Things can not really improve until the economy turns around.' That
will be some time.

FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Granada deal welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE superlatives which greeted the announcement of Granada Group's purchase
of the Sutcliffe catering group from P&amp;O were matched by the advance in the
share price, with analysts confidently predicting more of the same. 'This is
a superb deal at a very good price,' said Mr Roy Owens at Smith New Court.
Most other leisure specialists were equally excited and buy recommendations
and profit upgrades quickly lifted the share price.
Sentiment was boosted in early trading as the market heard that the placing
of 42.4m new shares, issued to part-fund the Pounds 360m deal, had been
oversubscribed by over four times. Hoare Govett, Granada's joint broker,
placed the stock with institutions at 350p a share, a discount of only 4 per
cent to the opening market price of 365p. By the end of the day, the shares
had jumped 20 to 385p in turnover of 4.4m. Smith New Court, reiterating its
buy stance, said the shares are some 10 per cent undervalued.
The positive mood was linked to the business background of Granada's chief
executive, Mr Gerry Robinson, who joined from another leading catering
concern, Compass Group. Analysts said that the 10 per cent margin per
contract enjoyed by Compass compared with a margin of around 4 per cent at
Sutcliffe, and most were confident that Mr Robinson would be able to repeat
his success. The market was also supportive from a strategic perspective,
judging that one of the chief criticisms levelled at Granada, namely that
its long-term earnings growth was in doubt, had now been satisfied.
NatWest Securities, a bear of the stock, moved from an underperform stance
to hold. It also raised its profit forecast for 1994 - the deal being
earnings neutral in 1993 - from Pounds 164.9m to Pounds 187m. Hoare Govett
went to Pounds 200m, while Smith New Court moved to Pounds 207m.
The deal also took speculative pressure off Compass and Yorkshire
Television. Both had been rumoured bid targets of Granada's. Compass tumbled
19 to 590p and Yorkshire 5 to 150p.

FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy placings in shares absorbed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEEPENING uncertainty over developments in Russia left the UK stock market
to busy itself with more local matters yesterday. Successful placings of
shares with the big institutions, tax loss trading and hints of impending
changes in life assurance profits distribution all combined to drive equity
volume higher but the broad range of the market close with little change
from the previous day.
Equities were also overshadowed by fund managers' preoccupation with the
details of the latest UK government bond auction, disclosed only towards the
end of the trading session. The stock market was also restrained by
continued weakness in stock index futures, which gave little lead to the
underlying blue chips.
Shares moved uncertainly, gaining 9 Footsie points in early trade, and then
sliding to 2,851 for a mid-session loss of 12.9. Traders expressed
satisfaction at seeing the FT-SE 2,850 held. Some analysts believe the
market has now absorbed the implications of last week's UK Budget and will
renew its advance if further evidence of economic recovery arrives.
At the close, the FT-SE Index showed a fall of 2.8 at 2,861.1, having
rallied somewhat half-heartedly as Wall Street came in with a loss of only
8.65 on the Dow during London hours.
The tone of the day was set early with a highly successful placing of more
than 42m shares in Granada, the entertainments group, in part-payment for
its Pounds 360m purchase of the industrial services division of P &amp; O.
This substantial placing, comprising more than 9 per cent of the enlarged
equity of Granada, was heavily over-subscribed by the institutions, although
it was priced at a discount of only 4 per cent to Granada's share price in
the market. Dealers saw this as clear indication of the institutions'
readiness to buy good quality stock at current market levels.
The same point was underlined by a very successful response from fund
managers to the flotation yesterday of Hambros Insurance Services. The stock
market also took aboard without difficulty two rights issue, of Pounds 126m
from BBA and Pounds 34.1m from Clyde Petroleum.
News than another life assurer was considering ways to improve rewards to
shareholders was good for investor confidence. It sharp gains in the life
sector, but insurance broker issues were hit by suggestions that a leading
reinsurer was about to reduce its business range.
These developments, together with a burst of what appeared to be tax loss
selling of shares at the close lifted Seaq volume to 701.7m shares, with
non-Footsie business matching recent daily averages with a contribution of
about 62 per cent. Tax-influenced activity is likely to be matched by
similar trades today.
On Monday, Seaq volume dipped to 529.2m shares and was worth only Pounds
1.03bn at retail level. These volume figures appear to bear out the general
belief that the institutions have not been heavy sellers since the Budget,
in spite of some signs of caution towards the UK chancellor's measures on
dividend payments from corporate profits earned outside the UK, and also the
future prospects for corporate taxation. The FT-SE Index has lost about 2
per cent since the Budget.

FT  24 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Airlines rise on traffic
reports as Dow eases

Wall Street
EQUITIES turned narrowly lower yesterday afternoon in dull trading with only
the transportation sector showing signs of real strength, writes Karen Zagor
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day down 1.62 at 3,461.68. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.04 at 448.84, while the
Amex composite rose 0.38 to 419.56. The Nasdaq composite closed 1.59 lower
at 675.03 after posting gains in morning trading. Trading volume on the NYSE
was about 232m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 967 to 887.
A surge in airline shares contributed to strong gains in the Dow Jones
transportation average which climbed 20.15 to 1,551.14.
Airline issues were lifted by reports of improved domestic traffic. An
analyst at First Boston said that domestic revenues for the industry were
about 6 per cent higher in February, above his expectations of 4.5 per cent
growth, although he expected international business to decline by as much as
9 per cent in March.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 63 7/8 ,
Delta Air Lines rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 51 7/8 , UAL, parent of United
Airlines, climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 120 3/8 and US Air improved
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 1/4 .
Ford hit a 52-week high of Dollars 53, up Dollars  1/2 after Dean Witter
Reynolds increased its rating on the stock to 'buy' from "hold'. The firm
also increased projected earnings for Ford to Dollars 2.45 a share for 1993,
from Dollars 2.25. Among other car makers, Chrysler slipped Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 38 7/8 and General Motors closed unchanged at Dollars 39 7/8 .
Outboard Marine, a leading manufacturer of outboard motors, sank Dollars 1
7/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 after the company said that a slow-down in European
and US sales had hurt second quarter net income. Outboard Marine expects
earnings in the three months to fall below the 10 cents a share it earned a
year earlier.
Drug company shares overcame their recent depression, with Merck rising
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37, Glaxo Holdings adding Dollars  1/4 to Dollars
18 and Johnson&amp;Johnson gaining Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 .
In Nasdaq trading, shares in Retix plunged Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 6 1/2
after the software company said that it might break even or post a small
loss in the first quarter and predicted that revenues might fall as much as
15 per cent in the quarter.
Other technology issues were unable to hold onto their morning gains.
Canada
TORONTO prices ended higher in active trading boosted by a strong gain in
real estate stocks. Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300 composite index
gained 14.99 points to 3,598.73, with advances leading declines 342 to 319.
Volume of 61.1m shares included two blocks of Royal Bank of Canada totalling
about 2.8m shares. Real estate stocks jumped 3.87 per cent, as Cambridge
Shopping rose 1 1/8 to 16 1/8.

FT  24 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rise in yen, Russia
fears leave Nikkei down 1.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in the yen against the dollar and European currencies, and news
of political unrest in Russia made their mark. Share prices lost ground on
selling by investment trusts and profit-taking by dealers, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 292.77 or 1.6 per cent to 18,491.62, having opened
at the day's high of 18,734.72 before sliding in later trading to hit a low
of 18,489.52 just before the close.
Volume was 370m shares against Monday's 330m. Losers led gainers by 732 to
300, with 138 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
fell 15.79 to 1,397.91 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose by 0.96
to 1,112.39.
A fall in overseas stock markets unnerved some investors but the decline was
led by the futures market, followed by arbitrage selling. Profit-taking by
foreign investors was also noted.
Concerns over the higher yen heightened as the dollar moved to record lows
against the domestic currency. Investors feared that earnings of leading
exporters would be eroded by foreign exchange losses if the yen continued to
strengthen. The dollar closed at Y115.33, down Y0.69.
Export-oriented companies weakened on volatility on the currency market.
Hitachi lost Y22 to Y760 and Fujitsu fell Y10 to Y585. Toyota Motor declined
Y10 to Y1,440.
Steels were lower on profit-taking: Nippon Steel fell Y10 to Y330 and
Kawasaki Steel lost Y6 to Y317.
Brokers were also lower as profits were taken. Nomura Securities, which has
gained 21 per cent since the beginning of the month, fell Y30 to Y1,820,
while Daiwa Securities lost Y80 to Y1,000.
Nippon Express, the parcel delivery company, gained Y14 to Y849. The issue
has been traded by short-term dealers as a Japan Railway-linked issue, and
has gained 18.7 per cent since March 1.
Mitsubishi fell Y24 to Y971, having announced on Monday that it will bail
out its financing and investment subsidiary, which accumulated stock
investment losses of Y28bn. Other trading houses, which hold heavy
unrealised losses on stock fund investments, also lost ground with Sumitomo
down Y15 to Y805.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 100.43 to 19,462.39 in volume of 74m shares.
Roundup
Political events in Russia continued to inhibit trading in some Pacific Rim
markets.
HONG KONG paid little heed to the day's political developments in the
simmering Sino-British dispute and shares ended higher with trading
dominated by domestic speculative interest in property stocks.
The Hang Seng Index closed 57.91 higher at 6,117.95 in modest turnover of
HKDollars 2.2bn.
Property issues were in demand after unconfirmed local press reports that
the Banking Commissioner was studying ways of increasing the ceiling on
mortgage lending from 70 per cent.
Cheong Kong topped the active list, closing 60 cents higher at HKDollars
22.20. Henderson Land added 40 cents to HKDollars 17.10 while New World rose
50 cents to HKDollars 18.70.
AUSTRALIAN investors remained worried about the situation in Russia and the
market moved lower in spite of a cut in local interest rates. The All
Ordinaries index dipped 4.7 to 1659.5 in weak turnover of ADollars 271.6m.
Banks were, however, mostly beneficiaries of the rates cut. National
Australia rose 5 cents to ADollars 8.77, ANZ put on 2 cents to ADollars 3.46
while Commonwealth was steady at ADollars 7.92. However, Westpac fell 7
cents to ADollars 3.03.
Great Central Mines rose 20 cents to ADollars 11.20 after Monday's ADollars
3 surge in response to a strong overnight performance by the company's
American depositary receipts.
TAIWAN was discouraged by reports that parliament planned to complete the
privatisation of state-run financial institutions over the next three years,
since previous sell-offs had proved unsuccessful.
However, selected buying in industrials provided some support and the
weighted index finished 27.05 lower at 4,647.23 in fairly active turnover of
TDollars 72.87bn.
Electronics and food shares were the only gainers, with Acer rising 60 cents
to TDollars 23.6 and Great Wall Enterprise up 40 cents to TDollars 28.4.
MANILA was weakened by an overnight fall in Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co (PLDT) on Wall Street, and the composite index slipped 12.35 to
1,443.25.
On the local bourse, PLDT fell 25 pesos to 870 pesos.
Manila Electric, however, was in demand, ending steady at 310 pesos, after
speculation that it will declare a 40-60 per cent stock dividend.
SEOUL rebounded after Monday's sharp fall and the composite index added 8.20
to 666.95, boosted by a government pledge to offer cheap finance to small
and medium-sized companies.

FT  24 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt decline concentrated
in financials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES were mixed yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff, appearing to accept
the argument that the Russian crisis will affect equities longer than its
predecessor did in August, 1991.
FRANKFURT blamed Russian uncertainty for another fall in the DAX index, down
12.96 at 1,648.44; but the falls in German shares yesterday were more
heavily concentrated in the financial sector, where corporate financing
moves unsettled the market.
Volume fell from DM6.8bn to DM6bn. Dresdner's confirmation of rights issue
plans took the shares down DM6.30 to DM399.20, and other banks followed. Ms
Barbara Altmann, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, observed that there were profits
to take in the sector.
However, the market fell more on reaction to a DM950m Allianz Eurobond issue
with warrants attached to buy the equity. Investors sold the insurer's
shares to buy the warrants, Allianz plunged DM68.00 to DM2,174.00 for a
two-day fall of 5.8 per cent, and traders came in to short other blue chips,
including BMW which fell DM5.80 to DM462.
PARIS recovered some of Monday's losses in a generally quiet session, helped
by a stronger bond market. The CAC-40 index closed up 12.90 at 1,952.18, off
the day's high of 1,959, in turnover of some FFr2.6bn.
There was, however, a flurry of interest in Carnaud Metalbox, up FFr8.40 or
3.7 per cent at FFr234.00, as speculation intensified as to who might buy
the 25 per cent stake due to be sold by MB-Caradon of the UK. One of the
possible candidates, Pechiney International, fell FFr8.80 to FFr220.00.
BRUSSELS rose strongly in late trading on reports that the government had
reached an agreement on the budget. However, after the close, it was
announced that the talks had failed - which may lead to the government's
resignation. The Bel-20 index put on 16.34 or 1.3 per cent to 1,256.32, but
off an all-time intraday high of 1,258. Turnover was some BFr1.5bn.
MADRID reversed early losses in the last 90 minutes of trading, the general
index closing 1.59 higher at 234.35 on speculation that today's inflation
figures will be much better than expected.
AMSTERDAM's correction continued with a fall in the CBS Tendency index of
0.3 to 106.1. ING, the insurer, noted that it was taking extra provisions
for its UK subsidiary, Victory Reassurance, and dipped 60 cents to Fl 62.20.
Reports that a broker was to upgrade DSM was partly responsible for a Fl
2.10 rise in the shares to Fl 81.90.
MILAN'S rumour machine turned its attention to Fiat once again with a
resurgence of stories that it could be about to announce an international
accord. The shares fixed L300 or 5.6 per cent higher at L5,700 in the wake
of one early foreign buy order for 500,000 shares, before continuing up to
L5,810 after hours.
The market took its lead from Fiat and the Comit index added 5.94 to 487.51.
Fiat has consistently denied a series of rumours, the most recent of them
last Thursday, suggesting an industrial alliance or disposal to Renault. But
yesterday's speculation suggested that an accord with a German group might
be in the offing.
Stocks likely to be privatised posted gains as the market's confidence was
renewed following Treasury Minister Piero Barucci's comments on Monday that
state asset sale plans were on line.
Ciga, reinstated on the bourse on Monday, was delayed from settlement
because of a trading imbalance. Shares in the financially-troubled hotel
group finally settled L128 or 12 per cent lower at L922.
ZURICH consolidated last week's gains and the SMI index edged 4.7 higher to
2,166.3.
Nestle, due to release 1992 profit figures today, saw its bearers add SFr5
to SFr1,180 in spite of some pessimism about its earnings prospects.
Analysts are, however, waiting to see whether the company has anything to
say about plans to introduce divisional reporting, which would clear the way
for a full Wall Street quotation.
In the machinery sector, Schindler lost SFr20 to SFr4,100 after it forecast
flat 1993 profit.

FT  24 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Finland's equity rally pauses for
breath - Events in Russia have had a sobering influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political upheaval in Russia has proved to be the first really sobering
influence on the Finnish stock market for six months, temporarily ending a
boom which has seen share prices soar by nearly 90 per cent in local
currency terms. Shares fell on both Monday and Tuesday, to leave the
Helsinki stock exchange's general index at 984.4 last night, after its climb
from a low of 541 on September 7 1992 to a 1993 peak of 1,017.5 on March 5.
Events across the border, clearly, will have a significant short-term impact
on the market's development; but this nervousness aside, many observers
believe that the rally has further to go, even although they expect the pace
to slacken.
They point out that at its current level, the index is still only half way
back to the point it reached in April 1989, when it touched 2,009.5.
The upward trend, which has seen the index rise by 20 per cent so far this
year, has been driven by two factors.
One is the heavy presence of foreign buyers in the market. The 40 per cent
depreciation of the markka in the last 18 months, following two
devaluations, has made Finnish stock cheap for many foreigners. In addition,
the country has just relaxed restrictions on foreign share ownership, so
that international equity portfolios have been undergoing a process of
readjustment.
The second factor is the drop in interest rates, which has made it less
attractive to hold money in the bank, and increased domestic interest in
equities. New tax rules, introduced at the start of this year, have also
favoured equities, if only because they are now treated more equitably with
other forms of investment.
Nevertheless, the strength of the stock market rally does seem surprising
given the state of the economy, which is characterised by record
unemployment, a soaring budget deficit and high foreign debt. These problems
recently led the US rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor's, to lower its rating on
Finnish debt from AA+ to AA-.
However, analysts stress that many of the stocks being bought are in major
export companies which are benefiting substantially from the lower markka. A
typical example is Nokia, the telecommunications and consumer electronics
group, whose shares have risen 30 per cent this year.
Pulp and paper groups are also major devaluation beneficiaries, and this
sector has extended its strong performance in the closing months of 1992
with a 25 per cent rise so far this year. Analysts say that current levels
discount a substantial increase in profits this year and next.
Some of the buying has a more speculative flavour to it. Banking shares, for
example, have climbed more than 30 per cent so far this year, even though
the sector faces huges credit losses this year and next, and the shadow of
state ownership hangs over it.
Buyers could run out of steam: apart from developments in Russia, rights
offers are beginning to be loaded on to the market, and these could soon dry
up liquidity if the issues are not marketed internationally.
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the leading commercial bank, is first in line with a
FM930m issue, but there are plenty of other companies in the wings, looking
for the opportunity to repair their tattered balance sheets.
Nevertheless, the general mood remains positive. The recent results season
brought no unpleasant surprises, even if most of the major Finnish companies
only succeeded in cutting losses, rather than returning to the black, and
further improvements are expected this year and next.
The Helsinki-based Opstock Securities, for example, predicts that Finnish
listed companies' net losses will halve this year to FM8.5bn (Dollars
1.4bn), while combined profits of FM4.3bn will be earned in 1994.
Anticipating continued healthy turnover levels, it expects one share in
every three to change hands this year.
Mr Simo-Pekka Helander, Opstock's managing-director, believes that the
upward trend could span the next three years, as the economy finally emerges
from recession. While not discounting short-term downside corrections, he
predicts growth of 20-25 per cent a year in Finnish share prices over this
period.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Crisis fails to boost the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL crisis in Moscow continued to throw a shadow over the D-Mark
in Europe, but the dollar weakened in spite of President Yeltsin's
difficulties, writes James Blitz.
The German currency's recent strength inside the European exchange rate
mechanism was sapped, as dealers believed that turmoil in the former Soviet
Union provided a serious political and economic challenge to Germany.
The French franc rose above FFr3.40 to the D-Mark at one stage, closing
almost unchanged at FFr3.404. But the dollar closed at DM1.6315, down more
than  1/2 a pfennig on the day.
In times of international crisis, the dollar tends to rally because of
perceptions that it is a safe haven currency. Its weakness yesterday may
have been due to a belief that the Russian crisis had not yet reached
boiling point.
A more concrete factor was the feeling that the Bundesbank was showing a new
caution about easing its money market interest rates.
The German central bank announced yesterday that it would be offering
wholesale funds to German commercial banks at variable interest rates in its
weekly money market operation today.
This may cause its main money market rate - or repo - to rise above the
current level of 8.25 per cent due to the strong competition for funds among
commercial banks, which are aiming to meet the end-of-month minimum reserve
requirements.
The latest inflation figure for North Rhine Westphalia, which rose 0.4 per
cent in February for a year-on year rise of 4.2 per cent, was also higher
than the market expected.
'All of these factors underlined recent statements from Bundesbank officials
that they have done as much as possible to ease rates for the time being,'
said Mr Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America in London.
Mr Steve Hannah of IBJ International in London believes the scene may be set
for a dollar fall below DM1.60 in the next few days. In his view, German
call money is unlikely to fall very far before the end of the month, making
it expensive for dealers to stay long of dollars. There will also be little
to support the dollar until the end of next week when the Bundesbank council
meets and the US non-farm payroll figure for March appears.
The dollar was sharply weaker against the yen, falling to a new record
closing low of Y115.33 in Tokyo on Tuesday. In London, the dollar closed a
little stronger at Y116.2.
The Japanese currency continues to be buoyed by repatriation of funds by
Japanese banks and corporates before the financial year-end on March 31.
There are also signs of green shoots in the Japanese economy, with the
industrial production figures yesterday showing their first month-on-month
rise since last September.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Repo is disappointing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN futures contracts fell back sharply yesterday after the Bundesbank
disappointed dealers by announcing a variable rate repurchase agreement in
its weekly money market operations, writes James Blitz.
For several months, the Bundesbank has been trying to wean the market away
from thinking that policy is being eased mainly through alterations in its
officially posted rates. There has been a strong focus on the repo rate,
which the Bundesbank uses to provide short dated funds to commercial banks.
There had been a strong expectation that the repo rate would be cut below
8.25 per cent this week. Instead, the Bundesbank yesterday announced a
variable rate tender, which means banks must offer competitive rates for
wholesale funds today.
Dealers believed last night that the lowest accepted bid today could be well
above 8.25 per cent because of strong competition for funds.
According to Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets in London, banks
are particularly anxious to comply with the new minimum reserve requirements
at the end of this month, which is why cash rates are currently tight in
Germany. Call money rose as high as 8.75 per cent yesterday, close to the
Lombard rate ceiling of 9.00 per cent, before falling back to 8.58 per cent.
The Bundesbank might counter a rise in the repo rate by adding funds.
Yesterday, it pumped a large amount of liquidity into the market via
currency swaps and section 17 funds.
But the tight conditions dampened sentiment, with the June Euromark contract
falling back 19 basis points from its opening level, to close at 92.87. At
this level it is pricing 3-month money in June at 7.13 per cent, some 71
basis points below yesterday's cash level. The contract was some 37 basis
points down from last Tuesday's price, showing how much expectations have
been revised.
Short sterling futures yesterday retraced Monday's losses, in spite of a
sell-off of sterling on the currency markets. The June contract was up 5
basis points at one stage, at 94.17, but later closed unchanged at 94.12.
Three-month money closed  1/16 per cent higher at 6 1/8 per cent. The view
prevails that base rates will stay at 6 per cent in the medium term.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CRA saves Pounds 90m on iron
ore project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Ralph, chief executive of CRA, Australia's second-largest mining
group, said yesterday the company had 'very closely re-examined' its
proposed Marandoo iron ore project in Western Australia and now estimated
the capital cost would be ADollars 362m (Pounds 174m), one third less than
the first estimate of ADollars 550m.
Ironically, CRA had time to complete the reassessment because it took about
16 months for environmental approvals for the mine to be completed - about
twice as long as usual.
Mr Ralph said the huge savings came partly because of a change in the
industrial relations atmosphere in Australia and the 'more mature' working
relationships between CRA and its employees.
This enabled changes to be made that saved money without compromising the
engineering. For example, originally cranes were to be incorporated into
every building because it was assumed it might not be possible to have a
driver bring a mobile crane quickly to the right place. Once it was
established that built-in cranes were not needed, building structures did
not have to be so solid.
Planned buffer stocks between processes had been eliminated and the
stockpile area reduced to take 30,000 instead of 100,000 tonnes.
Mr Ralph, at an Association of Mining Analysts meeting in London, said CRA's
Century zinc-lead-silver project in Far North Queensland, originally put on
a 'fast track' for development by 1995, would now not be operating before
1998 because of unexpectedly high levels of silica.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price fall forces cut by
biggest platinum producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSTENBURG PLATINUM, the world's largest producer, yesterday sent a strong
distress message to the market by announcing its first production cut in 12
years.
Rustenburg said the Boschfontein trackless mining shaft would be closed
'because the current low level of platinum and rhodium prices has rendered
production from Boschfontein uneconomic'. The announcement adds that at
current price levels it is cheaper to purchase metal in the market than to
mine it.
Apart from seeking to protect its financial position - a fall in interim
profits recently forced a cut in the dividend - Rustenburg is clearly trying
to restore some stability to a market that has been volatile and depressed
in recent months. It is also seeking to convince customers that the
financial health of the industry requires higher prices.
The effect of the production cut is that Rustenburg's contractual
commitments will be greater than its reduced level of production. The group
will be purchasing metal from the market to make good the shortfall.
Although Rustenburg did not detail the extent of the cut, analysts estimated
that it would be about 10-15 per cent of annual production of 1.4m troy
ounces.
The announcement follows a sharp weakening recently in platinum group metal
prices that placed severe strain on South African producers, which account
for about two-thirds of world production.
The cut at Rustenburg will probably be a little less than the production
coming on stream in the second half of the year from PPRust, the new
producer in the Johannesburg Consolidated Investments group. Rustenburg is
also in the JCI group. From the group point of view expensive production is
being replaced by cheaper production as PPRust is lower down the cost curve
than Rustenburg.
Rustenburg and Impala, the second largest producer, were last forced to
announce production cuts owing to weak markets in 1981. Production was then
cut by 15-20 per cent, and it took the industry about four years to return
to prior production levels.

Most metal prices closed softer on the LME as Monday's gains were not
sustained. LEAD finished near 6 1/2 -year lows. Dealers said the lead market
finally broke below long-standing support, and looked set for further
declines. Meanwhile, metals such as ALUMINIUM and NICKEL, which were boosted
on Monday by concern over Russian political tension, lacked follow-through.
COPPER also eased, with three-month metal drifting below Dollars 2,200 a
tonne, although underlying producer buying stemmed the decline, as did
general supply-side concerns. On the London bullion market GOLD prices
displayed an easier trend. Dealers said that the market would probably move
to test support around the Dollars 331-a-troy-ounce level after failing to
breach resistance at Dollars 333. New York raw SUGAR remained broadly lower
at midday but was well above the lows logged on the opening. Traders said
profit taking after Monday's extension of three-year highs weighed on values
but the market remained supported by tightening global supply and bullish
chart signs.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed feelings about Venezuelan
gold rush - Over-enthusiastic prospectors are driving up land concession
prices

<TEXT>
depending on your point of view - blame for the world's latest gold rush,
tries to convey his excitement. 'There was visible gold in many of the
rocks. It was stunning. I had seen nothing like it.'
He communicated that enthusiasm about his visit to the so-called Kilometre
88 gold camp in south-east Venezuela in a report distributed to clients of
Burns Fry, the Canadian stockbroker that employs him. Kilometre 88 was, he
suggested, 'shaping up to be the most important gold discovery in ten years'
 -the most important since gold was found on the Carlin Trend in the early
1980s and triggered Nevada's gold rush.
His comments were perfectly timed. Speculators who had been pouring money
into Canada to feed the diamond exploration rush in the Northwest
Territories were ready for something new to satisfy their appetites. Mining
stock promoters were casting round for another way of lightening the wallets
of nutty or naive investors while the markets were still 'hot'.
The share prices of a number of small, Vancouver-quoted Canadian companies
with Venezuelan connections soared as Freeman's opinions became widely
circulated. Many prices doubled in a few weeks. Other small Canadian mining
companies moved into the area. Controversial, high-profile promoters such as
Robert Friedland and Murray Pezim are aggressively promoting their
Venezuelan holdings.
No wonder Mr Freeman suggests: 'Kilometre 88 will likely become the hottest
exploration play in 1993'.
Canadian companies swarming into Venezuela are finding the local mining laws
and laws of title exceptionally complex. So they are attempting to buy
existing mining concessions and driving prices up wildly. Mr Freeman says
that one Venezuelan group recently talked to five Canadian companies in two
days. 'The Venezuelans are asking some fancy prices for concessions now,' he
says. Concessions recently priced at Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m are now being
touted for Dollars 10m or more.
'The Venezuelans might not be very good miners, but they are darned good
businessmen,' says Mr Freeman wryly.
All this activity has produced mixed feelings in the boardrooms of companies
that have been gold hunting in Venezuela for some years. While executives
are happy that their foresight in choosing Venezuela is at last being
recognised, they despair at the reckless claims being made and at the
rocketing prices for land concessions.
Mr Tony Ciali, chief executive of Monarch Resources, a London-quoted company
that has been operating in Venezuela since 1987, says the rush is affecting
his company's negotiations with local land owners by giving them an entirely
false perspective of what their property is worth.
Ironically, Monarch, which probably has the biggest single land holding in
Venezuela - but some way from the Kilometre 88 camp - originally decided to
restrict its activities to Venezuela because of the country's history of
gold production, stable government and lack of competition from big gold
companies.
The country has a long history of gold mining, concentrated principally in
the El Callao mining district of Guayana province but, in spite of political
democracy and relative stability since 1958, there has been limited foreign
investment because of an inhibitive tax regime. This included a 60 per cent
corporate tax rate, which was not reduced (to 30 per cent) until last year.
Most upset by the Venezuelan brouhaha is Placer Dome, one of North America's
biggest gold producers, which has a joint venture property, Las Cristinas,
88 km (50 miles) south of Eldorado, near Puerto Ordaz on the Guyana border.
Placer has a 70 per cent interest in Las Cristinas with the rest in the
hands of the state-owned CVG (Corporation Venezolana de Guayana).
Las Cristinas is in an area where about 10,000 local wildcat miners or
garimpeiros worked in the 1980s, using primitive equipment that allowed the
extraction of gold only from the first 15 to 30 metres of weathered bedrock.
They are estimated to have removed about 1.6m troy ounces of gold.
Placer has spent Dollars 2.4m to drill about 120 holes in a 400-by-200 metre
grid, each hole being an average of 160 metres deep and enabling the company
to collect about 7,000 metres of core samples. Burns Fry originally
suggested Placer eventually would outline 'in excess of 10m gold ounces on
the property,' but has backed away from that prediction recently.
Mr John Willson, Placer's new chief executive, says crossly: 'We don't want
to be associated with guestimates. We are very pleased with the way
exploration is going (at Las Cristinas) but it is far too early for us to
estimate resources there. We might have a partial resource estimate by the
middle of this year. I don't want investors buying Placer Dome stock because
of other people's estimates of what we have in Venezuela. When we know what
resources we have there, we will tell them.'
Nevertheless, you can't stop analysts speculating. Mr Euan Worthington, head
of the mining team at SG Warburg Securities, suggests: 'It seems likely that
Las Cristinas will be developed as an underground mining operation.'
He points out that some geologists believe Venezuela's Guayana shield
contains about 10,000 tonnes of recoverable gold. 'Geologically, there is no
doubt that the country has huge potential and in years to come could emerge
to rival Australia and Canada as a leading gold producer.'
However, analysts also suggest that small mining companies of the type that
are at present making much fuss about their Venezuelan credentials are
unlikely to win many of the potential spoils. Burns Fry's Freeman points out
that the Kilometre 88 area is designated a 'wilderness area'. This means
permission is required before any disturbance to the environment is
permitted.
The garimpeiros flouted this law and also employed traditional methods to
win their gold - using mercury which devastated many areas in the Kilometre
88 region. Consequently, says Freeman, environmental law is enforced by the
National Guard, 'so violators are faced by a man carrying not a clip-board
but a machine-gun'.
Venezuelan law also requires a number of reports to be filed regularly with
the government and simply fulfilling these obligations takes time and money
in Venezuela. So, 'when added to the environmental restrictions, it makes
acquiring properties in that country a much more tricky proposition than,
say, getting into the US'.
Mr Ian Austin, Placer Dome's chief financial officer, goes even further. He
suggests that only big mining companies will be able to develop gold mines
in Venezuela because only big companies will be able to offer responsible
environmental programmes.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China plans drive to woo
foreign mining investors

CHINA WILL soon embark on a drive to attract much-needed foreign involvement
in its flagging minerals development sector, following a comprehensive
review of its resources policy.
Mr Zeng Shaojin, director of exploration for the Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources, said in an interview that China was accelerating attempts
to involve foreign companies in both the exploration and development of its
minerals under what he described as its Prospecting Treasure Plan.
This aimed at providing China with the additional mineral resources needed
to support its booming economy, which is expected to grow at between 8 and 9
per cent annually for the rest of this decade. It registered growth last
year of 12.8 per cent.
Mr Zeng said China planned to invite foreign miners to Beijing in May to
discuss about 30 projects that might be available. United Nations bodies
would help to organise the conference.
The Chinese official admitted that the response of foreign mining companies
to earlier overtures by China had been disappointing. He hoped that new
regulations to be released later this year would be more appealing.
In Beijing, the representative of a foreign mining conglomerate described
existing mining regulations - these date from 1986 - as 'strongly
nationalistic' and a disincentive to investment. What was needed, he said,
was both a change in the regulations to link development with exploration
under favourable terms and, perhaps more importantly, a shift in philosophy.
Mr Zeng seemed to indicate the latter was possible when he declared that
China was now anxious to secure foreign assistance because it had neither
the funds nor the advanced minerals treatment technology required.
China's mineral resources were rich and diversified, he declared, but were
under-developed. Per capita yield of minerals is only half the world's
average.
The Chinese official indicated that priority minerals included copper (China
imports about half its requirements of copper concentrate, an intermediate
material), lead, zinc, iron ore, coal, diamonds, rare earths, uranium and
possibly gold.
While Chinese regulations effectively prevent foreign exploitation of gold
reserves at present, Mr Zeng indicated that this might change if 'certain
gold deposits need high technology and funds for development.'
He conceded that China had in the past two decades devoted too big a
proportion of its minerals exploration and development budget to the search
for gold. This had absorbed about 60 per cent of all funds devoted to solid
minerals exploration. He estimated China's 'in-ground' gold reserves at
3,000 tonnes, and these were being added to at the rate of about 10 per cent
annually. China mined about 100 tonnes of gold a year.
In anticipation, possibly, of a more encouraging environment for foreign
mining companies in China there appears to have been a revival of interest.
Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia recently signed an agreement to
investigate a lead-zinc deposit in Sichuan province.
But foreign mining representatives indicated that they would proceed
cautiously until they could be sure China had indeed experienced a change of
heart and was genuinely open for business in the sensitive minerals area.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US farmers 'face more income
cuts and cost rises'
</HEADLINE>

US FARM groups yesterday warned that budget cuts and a new energy tax
proposed by President Clinton would put many of the nation's efficient
middle-sized farmers out of business.
Mr T. Ray Chancey, national office director of the American Agriculture
Movement, said farmers had borne the brunt of previous budget reductions.
'While we are still trying to adjust to those 'savings', we are told that we
are going to have to 'save' some more. We are just about to be 'saved' out
of business,' he said.
Mr Clinton's struggle to reduce the US budget deficit will be initially
hampered by this year's leap in the cost of farm subsidies, which are likely
to exceed Dollars 15bn, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Although the new budget puts most of the cuts off until after the 1995 farm
programme is written, the payments will again decline to about Dollars 8bn a
year between 1994-1995.
Huge crops and continued high outlays for export subsidies and disaster
payments will push the cost of maize subsidies to almost Dollars 3bn this
year, the CBO said.
Maize subsidies would be even higher were it not for projected increases in
exports and industrial use. By 1998, CBO projects, ethanol use will be 70
per cent up from 1991.
Wheat subsidies are likely to rise by 24 per cent this year to Dollars
2.1bn. Unlike maize, use of wheat is expected to fall, and prices may fall
below Dollars 3 a bushel later this year.
Agriculture will also suffer the pain of increased fees on inland waterway
usage. This could raise the cost of grain and soyabeans by 8 per cent a
bushel. The president's proposed energy tax will raise production costs by
Dollars 1bn a year, American Farm Bureau Federation estimates.
Mr Ronald Knutson, director of the Texas-based Agricultural and Food Policy
Center farm predicted that programme payments over the years 1996-1998 would
decline by 14 to 20 per cent. Average net cash income will fall about 7 per
cent for a large Iowa maize and soyabean farm and up to 36 per cent for a
Kansas wheat farm.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Long-dated gilts tumble as Bank prepares
Pounds 3bn auction
</HEADLINE>

UK government bonds shed nearly a point yesterday at the long end on news of
a larger-than-expected gilt auction.
The Bank of England said it would auction Pounds 3bn of the 8 per cent
Treasury stock due 2013 on March 31, creating a 20-year benchmark stock.
Dealers said the size of the auction took the market by surprise, as most
participants had expected the Bank to sell about Pounds 2.5bn.
The stock is partly paid, with the final instalment of 50 per cent payable
on May 17. Although the gilt is a so-called Fotra stock (which means that
non-resident investors receive the interest gross), dealers expected the
issue to attract more interest from domestic than foreign investors.
The Bank of England said after the Budget that it would hold larger and more
frequent gilt auctions to meet the government's heavy borrowing requirement.
Auctions of between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn of stock will take place
roughly once a month.
The 9 per cent gilt due 2011 fell  13/16 to 105 13/32 to yield 8.42 per
cent, while the Liffe future fell from 105.31 to 105.13 on the auction news.
Shorter-dated issues edged lower, as hopes of another cut in the base rate
evaporated.
GERMAN government bonds closed lower following the Bundesbank's announcement
of a variable rate repo, and the bund market's weakness pulled some of the
higher-yielding European bond markets lower during the day.
Dealers said news that the Bundesbank's securities repurchase transaction
would be set at variable bid rates left market participants wondering where
money market rates would settle following last week's discount rate cut. The
repo results are due today.
The release of inflation figures for one of the four key German states
yesterday added to the weak state of the bund market.
Consumer prices for North Rhine-Westphalia in the month to mid-March climbed
4.2 per cent, showing a slight year-on-year acceleration from the 4.0 per
cent year-on-year rise in February. The Liffe bund future opened at 95.30,
rose to a high of 95.68 and ended the day lower at 95.25.
THE high-yielding Italian and Spanish government bond markets closed lower,
taking their cue from the weak of the German market. The BTP futures
contract fell from 96.53 to 96.27.
Spanish government bonds, which fell sharply on Monday, continued their
decline with the yield on the 10-year benchmark moving from 11.51 per cent
to 11.56 per cent.
SWEDISH government bond yields rose sharply after news that S&amp;P, the credit
rating institution, had downgraded Sweden. Yields rose about 20 basis
points. The four-year bond yield rose five points to 8.70 per cent, while
the 10-year bond traded at 9.54 per cent, up two basis points.
JAPANESE government bonds closed weaker, with the market largely ignoring
the continued strength of the yen against the dollar and the firm tone for
US bonds.
The yen reached a historic closing high of 115.33 to the dollar in Tokyo
trading. However, traders said that with the approach of the financial
year-end on March 31, few investors were willing to change their holdings
substantially.
In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 issue moved in a range
of 4.045 per cent to 4.10 per cent, and closed at 4.075 per cent, against
its opening of 4.065 per cent.
The June futures contract opened at 110.17, traded up to 110.27, and ended
at 109.89.
US Treasuries rose yesterday afternoon in quiet trading as the market waited
for today's durable goods report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 higher at
104 1/2 , yielding 6.764 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
up  1/16 , to yield 3.839 per cent.
There was little reaction to the Johnson Redbook report of US retail store
sales for the week ended March 20, which showed a 1.8 per cent rate of
decline on a seasonally adjusted basis from the average level in February.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Swedish foreign debt rating
reduced by S&amp;P
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, yesterday downgraded Sweden's
senior long-term foreign currency debt rating to AA+, from AAA.
It said the decision, which affects Dollars 14bn of debt, reflected the size
of Sweden's budget deficit, its rising foreign debt, and the risk of slow
and uncertain economic recovery because of political pressures and the
banking crisis.
The move follows last month's downgrading by fellow US rating agency,
Moody's, which cut Sweden's long-term debt rating from Aa1 to Aa2.
S&amp;P said Swedish government debt was set to reach 80 per cent of GDP at the
end of 1994, after nearly doubling in four years, while external debt would
rise fourfold to 75 per cent of exports over the same period. Plans to cut
spending had been hampered by unemployment outlays and assistance to the
banking sector.
However, S&amp;P revised its outlook for Sweden from negative to stable as an
expression of confidence in its measures to tackle economic problems.
Mr Staffan Crona, director-general of the Swedish National Debt Office, said
S&amp;P's downgrading came as no surprise and would have only a marginal effect
on the country's borrowing costs.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Allianz Finance equity-linked paper
raises DM950m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANZ Finance, part of the Allianz insurance group of Germany, yesterday
raised DM950m through one of the last equity-linked warrant Eurobonds likely
to emerge from the German corporate sector for some time.
Allianz was one of the few remaining German companies which still had
authorisation from its shareholders to raise equity-linked financing without
offering shareholders pre-emptive rights.
In recent years, German companies have been discouraged from seeking further
authorisations at annual meetings due to growing shareholder opposition.
Veba, the large German utility, had been in a similar situation earlier this
month. It raised Dollars 300m through a seven-year Eurobond issue with
equity warrants
Allianz's authorised but unissued capital used to back its five-year issue
was due to expire later this year. Linde, the German fork-lift truck
manufacturer, is believed to be the last German company which still has
authorised but unissued capital at its disposal.
An official at lead-manager Dresdner Bank said demand for Allianz's bonds
was such that they rose as high as 125 bid at one stage from an issue price
of 124, in spite of the uncertainty weighing on the German equity and bond
markets.
The bonds later came back slightly to trade just above their issue price,
while the warrants were quoted at DM44 bid and the ex-bonds were quoted at
99.80 bid.
The dilution on Allianz's earnings when the warrants are converted into
shares is a marginal 3 per cent, and the funds raised from the issue are for
Allianz's general financing purposes.
Elsewhere, borrowers continued to tap the Canadian dollar market to take
advantage of the attractive arbitrage opportunities on offer in the
five-year area of the yield curve.
The Kingdom of Norway raised CDollars 500m through a 5 1/2 -year Eurobond
issue. The bonds were priced to yield 52 basis points above the 6 1/4 per
cent Canadian government bond due February 1998, at the higher end of the
indicated range of 50-52 basis points.
Some syndicate managers said the pricing on Norway's bonds was on the tight
side but an official at the joint lead manager, IBJ, said that the pricing
was fair and reflected the fact that the borrower was a sovereign which only
launched large issues once in a while. When the bonds were freed to trade,
the spread was little changed.
Eurofima, the European rolling stock financing company based in Basle,
launched a CDollars 125m five-year Eurobond issue priced to yield 42 basis
points over comparable Canadian government bonds.
The pricing took into account Eurofima's triple-A rating and its popularity
with retail investors on the continent, an official at the lead manager
Goldman Sachs said. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened
slightly.
The spreads on Norway's and Eurofima's issues were well inside the 73 basis
points offered on Ontario Hydro's CDollars 1.5bn five-year global bond issue
which was launched on Monday. The tighter pricing reflected the smaller
amounts being raised, the borrowers' superior credit ratings and the fact
that they do not tap the international bond market as frequently as Ontario
Hydro. Yesterday's issues were said to be have been swapped into other
currencies.
Syndicate managers are advising borrowers wanting to raise Canadian dollars
to hold off until the supply has been absorbed by the market. They added
that the arbitrage opportunities might be too hard for them to resist.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Equities: Two big Spanish issues in wings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN will be the source of two substantial international equity issues over
the next month with offerings from Repsol, the state-controlled energy
group, and Argentaria, the state-owned banking group.
Repsol hopes to raise Dollars 700m to Dollars 800m with the sale of about
30m shares. The offering, to be priced late next week, will result in a
reduction in the state's stake from about 50 per cent to just over 40 per
cent. The offering can be increased by 15 per cent if there is strong demand
for the shares.
Repsol has quite a broad international investor base. Under the global deal,
12m shares will be offered in the US, 7m in the UK, 6m in continental
Europe, 3.5m in Spain and 1.5m in the rest of the world. The Spanish tranche
will be offered to institutional investors as Repsol is widely held by
Spanish retail investors.
Meanwhile, investment bankers expect Argentaria to wait about a month until
Repsol is out of the way before proceeding with its IPO. The bank is 100 per
cent owned by the state, and is expected to sell up to a quarter of its
shares with Spanish retail investors likely to dominate the issue, bankers
said.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Fuji Heavy expects third
consecutive annual loss

<TEXT>
FUJI Heavy Industries, the Japanese automobile manufacturer, yesterday
revised down its forecast for results to the year ending this month, and now
expects to post a pre-tax loss of Y4bn (Dollars 34.7m).
This compares with a previous forecast of Y1bn pre-tax profits and would
mean the third consecutive year of losses for the company. Fuji Heavy said
the main reasons for its revised forecast were the continuing weakness of
demand for automobiles, the yen's appreciation and Y1bn of stock appraisal
losses.
Sales for the year are expected to be Y870bn, instead of Y900bn, and
after-tax losses Y8.5bn instead of Y1bn. Fuji Heavy will incur extraordinary
losses of Y10bn due to the poor performance of Subaru of America, its US
subsidiary.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: JSH to raise USDollars 358.5m
through rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JARDINE Strategic (JSH), the Jardine Matheson group's investment holding
company, is to raise USDollars 358.5m through a rights issue of convertible
preference shares. This follows the successful launch of Dollars 200m of
convertible preference shares in April 1992.
The latest convertible issue is to fund JSH's recent acquisition of a 16 per
cent stake in Singapore-listed Cycle &amp; Carriage and provide the Dollars 94m
necessary to take up its 46 per cent rights entitlement to the Dairy Farm
convertible share issue.
JSH also announced profit estimates for 1992, indicating that it would
report net profits of Dollars 262m for 1992, a 12 per cent increase over
1991.
A final dividend of 7.7 cents per share will be announced when the company
releases full details of its results tomorrow.
The JSH convertible preference shares have a yield of 7.4 per cent, and will
convert at HKDollars 24, compared with yesterday's closing price of
HKDollars 20.60. Some analysts believe the issue may be the prelude to an
acquisition.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: VME and Hitachi join forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VME, the Brussels-based construction equipment producer, and Japan's Hitachi
Construction Machinery will today announce that they have agreed to work
together in the rigid dumptruck and mining equipment business.
The deal is potentially one of the most important tie-ups between western
and Japanese construction equipment companies. It also creates a third force
in the world mining equipment market, after Caterpillar and Komatsu.
Hitachi will take a substantial minority stake in VME's Euclid brand rigid
dumptruck business. By joining forces, the two companies believe they will
be able to offer better service to customers, which will increase the
competitiveness of both lines in the mining industry.
The backdrop to the deal is the overcapacity and lack of profitability in
the world mining equipment industry. Its customers, large mining and quarry
companies, make big, but infrequent capital investments.
'The market is even more cyclical than construction equipment,' said Mr Tuve
Johannesson, VME's president and chief executive. 'We need to have muscle
where ever there is a market.'
Mr Johannesson stressed that the deal was a way for VME to increase its
involvement in mining equipment without making heavy investments to produce
the very large excavators used by mining companies. These will be supplied
by Hitachi, which does not produce rigid dumptrucks.
The two types of equipment are used together by mining and quarry companies;
Caterpillar, the equipment market leader, produces both.
VME and Hitachi plan to co-ordinate closely the sale of larger mining
excavators and rigid dumptrucks. But Mr Bengt Ovlinger, VME's senior
vice-president for marketing, said reciprocal manufacturing - especially of
larger components - would also be explored.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Zaiteku becomes a tainted custom
in Tokyo - Making money from money not production lines has got a bad name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZAITEKU is a tainted word in Tokyo. During the late 1980s, two-thirds of
listed Japanese industrial companies indulged in zaiteku - financial
engineering that ranged from the innocent exploitation of interest rate
differences to massive speculation in the stock market.
Japanese companies are still counting the cost of that 'engineering'.
Mitsubishi Corporation, the core company of Japan's largest corporate group,
this week rescued M. C. Finance, a financial subsidiary, which has Y28bn
(Dollars 237m) in unrealised losses on securities investment funds.
And two members of the Kosugi family were forced to resign at Kosugi
Industry, a textile company which makes Jack Nicklaus brand casualwear.
Kosugi is expected to announce heavy consolidated losses for the year to
January arising from a stock investment programme begun before the market
peaked in late 1989.
From the machine tool manufacturers to the great trading houses, zaiteku was
an important supplement to operating profits in the late 1980s. It was
originally defined as the management of surplus corporate funds, but took on
a speculative meaning in the late 1980s, when otherwise conservative
companies established aggressive financial subsidiaries.
Happy to support zaiteku operations when the stock market was rising,
Japanese banks, creaking under the weight of non-performing property loans,
are now wary of lending to companies with a zaiteku reputation. And even
though many of the better known manufacturers indulged, a post-'bubble'
shift of opinion now condemns companies which make money from money and not
from their production lines.
The banks' tougher line on lending comes as the burden of stock investment
losses has risen. Mitsubishi itself had unrealised losses of Y80bn on its
Y310bn in securities investment funds as at the end of September. Other
large trading houses had similar losses, including Y98bn at Marubeni and
Y92bn at Itochu, and all are now attempting to reduce their exposure.
But Itochu said not all zaiteku activities were bad, adding companies, such
as trading houses, must employ surplus funds as profitably as possible. 'For
a trading house, financial dealings are part of the main business, and so we
are not going to stop zaiteku. We are reducing securities investment funds,
but we will not stop completely,' Itochu said.
While the trading houses have the resources, including latent profits on
their long-term cross-shareholdings, to cope with losses on investment
stocks, the situation is more serious at manufacturers such Nachi-Fujikoshi,
a maker of bearings and machine tools. Nachi hoped a stock price recovery
would save it the embarrassment of writing off investment losses. But it was
forced to report a net loss of Y16.4bn for the year to November and to
suspend dividend payments for the first time since 1968.
The stock price collapse hit Nachi on two fronts. The parent company had
stock appraisal losses of Y7.96bn last year and was also forced to write off
Y5.5bn in loans and guarantees for a financial subsidiary.
'Originally, we had no intention to make profits from zaiteku, but two
ex-managers were reckless. Of course, we don't want to do any more zaiteku,
and we regret what happened in the past,' Nachi said.
Mitsubishi adds that M. C. Finance, established in 1986, was not a
securities investment company but an umbrella financial company for other
subsidiaries and affiliates. It was supposed to borrow large sums at
discount rates from banks and pass on the savings to smaller companies,
which would otherwise have paid higher interest rates.
But M. C. was later encouraged by Mitsubishi management to invest in stocks.
As with many other players, an initial windfall prompted even more ambitious
forays.
Before the stock crash, as a car machinery maker in Nagoya explained,
shareholders were asking why a company was not dabbling in stocks to boost
profits.
Mitsubishi has told M. C. to go back to basics, 'concentrating on core
activities of providing financing, accounting and related services' to group
companies. The theme is prevalent among manufacturing companies, which
confess to having strayed too far into finance and away from their core
skills.
Some companies which invested in stocks are still unable to accept that they
bore full responsibility for the risk involved. Several trading houses are
known to be negotiating with trust banks about compensation for losses
incurred, negotiations apparently prompted by the trading houses' perception
that returns were guaranteed.
There is also resentment at the tough line taken by commercial bankers, who
fear that risks may be hidden in their customers' books. An executive at a
large steelmaker said the banks have become 'obsessed' by property and stock
market exposure, and that if 'you use the word zaiteku now, bankers get
nervous'.
His sentiments were echoed by a finance manager at a leading food
manufacturer: 'There is nothing wrong with us issuing commercial paper,
depositing the money in a large lot account and reaping the benefit of the
difference in interest rates.'

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Dairy Farm advances 21% and
launches rights issue
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIRY Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine
Matheson group, yesterday reported a 21 per cent increase in net profits to
USDollars 177.8m in 1992, up from Dollars 146.8m the year before.
The results exceeded market expectations, and were accompanied by the
announcement of a rights issue of convertible preference shares to raise
Dollars 202m.
Operating profits increased to Dollars 159.3m, from Dollars 153.6m in 1991,
and much of this growth resulted from a Dollars 12m drop in tax, due to
over-provision in previous years.
Under the rights issue, one Dollars 1,000 preference share will be offered
for every 8,000 ordinary shares held. These will convert into ordinary
shares at a price of HKDollars 11.40 (USDollars 1.47), compared with
yesterday's closing price of HKDollars 10.40, and will pay a yield of 6.5
per cent.
The proceeds will be used for Dairy Farm's expansion programme for its
Wellcome supermarket chain in Taiwan and its Franklin's discount chain in
Australia.
The group's Australasian businesses performed well. Franklins and New
Zealand Woolworths contributed USDollars 91.6m before interest costs,
compared with Dollars 81.7m.
The group's 1990 acquisition of Simago, the Spanish retail chain, is
straining financial resources, contributing losses of SDollars 21m before
interest costs. Mr Owen Price, managing director, said new management had
been installed, and its performance had improved in the final quarter of
1992.
Kwik Save, in which Dairy Farm recently increased its stake to just over 28
per cent, announced record profits for 1992. This was translated into Dairy
Farm's profits at the average rate up to the UK retailer's August year-end.
The subsequent fall in the sterling exchange rate is likely to lead to a
decline in Kwik Save's contribution in 1993.
The Taiwanese operations became profitable in the second half of 1992, and
significant growth is expected.
The company recommended a final dividend of 3.9 US cents per share,
representing a full year pay-out of 5.38 cents, compared with 4.6 cents in
1991.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hudson's Bay takes over Canadian

<TEXT>
HUDSON'S BAY, Canada's biggest department store group, is taking over
troubled Woodward's, the oldest name in western Canada retailing. The deal
is estimated to be worth nearly CDollars 100m (USDollars 80.3m).
The Bay intends to turn some of Woodward's best store sites into Bay and
Zellers units. Bay's national market share will rise from 22 per cent to
almost 25 per cent.
'We will buy Woodward's shares and gain all its assets, including
accumulated tax losses,' said Mr Gary Lukassen, the Bay's executive
vice-president for finance.
The Toronto-based retailer, now 25 per cent owned by the Kennes Thomson
family, will dramatically raise its market share in western Canada and gain
valuable properties.
Woodward's had filed for court protection after heavy losses and mounting
debts. It had closed its Vancouver flagship store and laid off 1,500
employees. The group has 14 stores in British Columbia and 11 in Alberta. In
the nine months ended December 31 last, the company lost CDollars 80.6m on
revenues of CDollars 245m.
The Bay said it would close some Woodward's stores and lay off more
employees.
Under the Bay deal, senior creditors of Woodward's, including Cambridge
Shopping Centres, will be secured in full. Cambridge holds 23 per cent of
Woodward's stock, and loaned CDollars 20m to the retailer last year.
Unsecured creditors will get 35 cents on the dollar, unsecured noteholders
30 cents, and common shareholders between 35 and 45 cents a share.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Metall Mining improves offer for
Minnova shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METALL MINING, the Canadian mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has
sweetened its bid for the publicly-held minority shares of Minnova, a
Canadian explor-ation and development company.
Metall bought 50.4 per cent of Minnova from Noranda for CDollars 131m
(USDollars 105m) last year.
Late in February, Metall bid one of its own common shares plus CDollars 4
cash for each of the Minnova publicly-held shares. Now it is adding half a
warrant. A full warrant allows the holder to buy one Metall share at
CDollars 14 for five years. Alternatively, Minnova holders can take 1.43
Metall shares for each Minnova share held.
Metall said it improved its offer to meet institutional objections to the
original bid. It plans to amalgamate Minnova with a unit of Metall.
Laurentian Bank, Canada's fastest-growing chartered bank, is buying a
CDollars 325m portfolio of residential mortgages and matching deposits from
a Quebec City mutual insurance group for an undisclosed sum.
This is the fifth expansion, mainly in the trust services sector, that
Laurentian Bank - part of the Laurentian financial services group - has made
in two years.

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Tele-graph is to call in five long-term debt issues
totalling Dollars 1.75bn for early redemption, Reuter reports from New York.
The US telecommunications group said it expected to use cash reserves and
new debt to fund the redemptions.
Associated one-time costs are expected to cut first-quarter 1993 earnings by
about 4 cents a share. However, interest expense reductions in subsequent
quarters will reduce the full-year impact to less than 2 cents a share.
AT&amp;T forecast the refunding would increase earnings by as much as 3 cents
share annually beginning in 1994.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Creditanstalt helped by hidden
reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITANSTALT Bankverein, Austria's second-largest bank, avoided a large
loss last year only by realising more than Sch4bn (Dollars 347.5m) of hidden
reserves to help cover provisions for bad loans.
Net income at Sch1.25bn was, nevertheless, 22 per cent lower than the
previous year, which itself had been propped up by Sch2.17bn from
realisations of hidden reserves.
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chairman, said provisions for bad loans soared 76
per cent to Sch5.66bn last year, mainly because of the slump in the Austrian
economy. In December, the bank revealed it would cut its dividend to Sch6
from Sch15 a share and cancel staff annual bonuses. It then forecast that
provisions would reach Sch5bn, but the directors later decided to make an
additional Sch600m general provision in anticipation of more problems this
year.
Mr Schmidt-Chiari said yesterday provisions would be high in 1993, but he
hoped not to have to resort again to hidden reserves to cover them. The
bank's hidden reserves were 'still substantial'.
He was hopeful that earnings would improve, and held out the prospect of at
least a partially restored dividend.
The Austrian government holds 49 per cent of the shares and 70.5 per cent of
the voting power in Creditanstalt, but is committed to full privatisation.
In November, it was revealed that General Electric of the US had been in
discussions about taking a 20 per cent stake.
Mr Schmidt-Chiari said yesterday he anticipated the government's stake would
be dispersed among portfolio investors rather than with strategic investors.
Creditanstalt's earning power remained strong last year, with operating
profits up 19.5 per cent to Sch3.43bn. Total assets grew 6.2 per cent to
Sch517.9bn at year-end. The capital ratio, under BIS guidelines, eased from
8.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: USAir tie-up with BA gets the
hard sell - How two airlines are planning to build on their new relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO airlines, one vision: this is how British Airways and USAir are
hammering home the message that they are now linked.
The advertisements, for which USAir footed the bill, hit TV screens in the
US within hours of the Department of Transportation giving approval to a
code-sharing agreement between the two carriers.
Mr Seth Schofield, chief executive at USAir, is the first to acknowledge
that there is a useful 'halo' effect for his carrier from the relationship
with BA.
USAir had two troublesome mergers back in the late 1980s, acquiring a heavy
debt load in the process. It fell into the 'financially-troubled' class, and
its reputation suffered accordingly.
But do the ads over-hype the practical impact of BA-USAir relationship? Or
can the two carriers use the next 12 months - the period to which
code-sharing approval applies - to establish meaningful operational ties?
Executives from both companies are tackling this issue. Meetings between
nine senior staff at British Airways and 11 from USAir got under way on
Monday night, the first top-level forum since the carriers announced their
engagement last July.
Some plans are already clear. On the code-sharing front, for example, the
airlines intend to start operating synchronised flights, sharing the same
designator code in computer reservation systems, between London and three US
cities - Syracuse, Rochester, Cleveland - on May 1.
By January 1994, 'code-share' flights should have expanded to 38
destinations, with the domestic and transatlantic portions connecting at
four USAir hub airports (Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Charlotte and Baltimore).
On these flights, passengers will find one ticketing point and one baggage
check-in. They will then board a USAir jet, still in its familiar USAir
livery, for the US portion of the journey. They will switch to a BA
aircraft, with BA cabin staff, for the transatlantic segment.
In addition, there is to be a 'wet-lease agreement' on London-Baltimore and
London-Pittsburgh routes. USAir will provide the cabin crews working on
these flights and also the aircraft. However, the flights will look like,
and be marketed as, a BA service. The cabin staff will wear BA uniforms,
on-board service will match the BA brands, and the Boeing 767 aircraft will
be refurbished internally and externally in BA colours.
This set-up carries some training implications; USAir employees who are
selected to work these routes will be required to learn BA procedures.
But Mr Schofield has no doubts that the carriers' operational tie-up can go
significantly further, within the confines of existing US approval.
It would be possible, he suggests, for USAir to provide ground-handling
services for BA in the US, and for BA to do the reverse in the UK.
Co-ordination of flight schedules, even when there is no code-sharing, is a
likely prospect. Joint buying - whether for fuel, food or aircraft - is
another area described as flush with opportunities.
In many of these cases, it would be necessary to structure the arrangements
carefully, so that the two carriers have 'an arm's length business
relationship'.
But, via joint-venture companies, and provided each carrier is 'using its
business judgment of what is in its own interests', Mr Schofield sees few
problems and real savings.
The code-sharing agreement itself, meanwhile, requires that the carriers set
to work on integrating their computer software for these flights within a
specified time-period.
The obvious problem in pushing the relationship too far is US anti-trust
law.
Northwest Airlines and KLM, the Dutch carrier which acquired a minority
stake in the US airline in the late-1980s, laboured for some years to build
a relationship based on code-sharing and the like.
However, according to their submission to the DoT last year, 'a
comprehensive alliance . . . between a US carrier and a foreign carrier
exposes those carriers to the very real risk that their collaborative
planning, scheduling, pricing and marketing of services could be challenged
as being per se price-fixing and market allocation agreements between
horizontal competitors'.
Accordingly, these carriers argued that they were only able to achieve
limited benefits, and that the more substantial advantages of 'a truly
integrated air service' required anti-trust immunity.
Mr Schofield is fairly sanguine that none of the proposals he is outlining
will encounter this danger.
'I think we're fine as far as the Justice Department is concerned,' he says,
noting that there has been consultation with the authorities on this score
and that USAir has been careful to state that it will divest its own US-UK
route authorities as part of the deal.
So what, at the end of the day, will the revised USAir-BA tie-up lack
operationally which the earlier version of the deal would have provided ?
Under the first investment agreement announced last year, BA's financial
commitment would have been larger - Dollars 750m at the outset, for a
potential 44 per cent stake, compared with Dollars 300m for a 19.9 per cent
interest. BA would also have had greater control over its US partner, and
been able, for example, to veto certain board decisions.
Thereafter, it is the full 'principles of integration' - the detailed
arrangements which could have led to a common logo, one livery and so on -
which are missing. 'Common branding will not be able to go forward,' says Mr
Schofield.
Whether that will have a big impact on the bottom line is debatable.
Northwest/KLM argued that there was an appreciable difference between full
integration and their attempts at a more limited blending of operations.
Mr Schofield sees it differently: 'From a revenue point of view, I do not
believe it will make that much difference'.
However, BA insists that its original proposal, involving broad integration
of the two airlines, remains its preferred option.

BELLSOUTH, the US tele-communications group, is to co-operate with France
Telecom, the state-owned operator, to build a mobile data transmission
network, worth more than Dollars 80m, in France.
The US group is to take a 12.5 per cent stake in the French company's
recently-created mobile data business, France Telecom Mobiles Data, for an
undisclosed price.
This is the latest of a series of foreign partnerships struck by France
Telecom in the two years since it was given semi-autonomy from the
telecommunications ministry.
But it is believed to be the first time a foreign company has worked with
France Telecom on an important project on its home territory.
The network, which will allow computer data to be sent by portable
telecommunications sets, will be introduced in Paris this year and other
cities in 1994.
The two companies will co-operate on development and marketing and plan
other alliances with equipment makers, software providers and computer
systems groups.
France Telecom and a private operator have been licensed to run two
competing systems, as is already the case in mobile voice telephones.
The data network will use technology by Ericsson, the Swedish group, which
is already in use in the UK, north America, Finland, Norway and Sweden.
BellSouth also announced it would develop a nationwide mobile data network
in the Netherlands, AP-DJ reports.
Initial construction of the system has begun with service expected to be
available in several markets by the end of the year. When the network is
finished in 1994, it will provide in-building coverage in important
commercial centres such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, and
comprehensive mobile coverage in smaller cities and major traffic corridors.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Murdoch considering bid for NY
Post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, is considering entering the
battle to determine the future of The New York Post, the troubled tabloid
newspaper he once owned.
The newspaper has been traumatised over the past 10 days by the arrival of
Mr Abe Hirschfeld, an eccentric New York car parks magnate who has sacked
and re-hired a number of staff, including Mr Pete Hamill, the paper's
editor.
Last week, a New York bankruptcy court approved Mr Hirschfeld's plan to take
control of the paper, even though a rival bid is being offered by Mr Steven
Hoffenberg, a debt collector who is being sued for fraud by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Mr Murdoch, who was forced to sell the paper in 1988 as a result of federal
legislation, is understood to be watching developments at The Post very
closely. He has put senior executives on standby in case he becomes actively
involved in a formal rescue of the newspaper.
Given the unprecedented venom being directed at Mr Hirschfeld by the paper's
editorial staff - a headline last week about Mr Hirschfeld read 'Who is this
Nut?' - the future of the newspaper is by no means certain.
Mr Murdoch could only intervene if the paper were in danger of foundering
once again.
He would need a government waiver allowing him to own both The Post and his
local Fox television station in New York.
The 73-year-old Mr Hirschfeld, when informed of Mr Murdoch's possible
interest, said: 'Every Tom, Dick and Harry wants to get on the news because
of me, Mr Hirschfeld. There are homeless people who want to buy The Post.
'If Mr Rupert Murdoch wants to come to me I would be happy to talk to him,'
he added.
Although Mr Murdoch's US interests are predominantly in film and television,
he has told friends there are times when it is 'difficult to resist the
temptation' of buying newspapers when the right opportunity presents itself.

BEKAERT, the Belgian producer of wire and steel cord, has announced net
profits of BFr2.71bn (Dollars 80m) for 1992, against a loss of BFr652m the
previous year, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The results included a capital gain of BFr1.05bn on the sale of shares in
its Japanese steel cord joint venture. However, Bekaert's net profit still
tripled between 1991 and 1992 when adjusted for exceptional gains and
charges.
The directors have proposed a net dividend of BFr250 for the year, against
only BFr100 per share in 1990 and 1991. Belgian analysts have long said that
Bekaert will be one of the first Belgian industrial companies to profit from
any improvement in the economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENI, the state-owned energy and chemicals concern implicated in Italy's
political corruption scandal, plans to rationalise its network of foreign
subsidiaries.
The aim is to improve transparency and accountability at the group, which
had sales of L50,883bn (Dollars 32bn) in 1991 and 209 subsidiaries
registered abroad.
The Eni group comprises the parent company and 12 main subsidiaries, all but
one of which, Eni International Holding, are based in Italy. The biggest
subsidiaries in terms of sales are Snam, involved in gas supply and
distribution; EniChem, Italy's biggest chemicals concern; Agip, the upstream
oil and gas operation; and Agip Petroli, which handles the downstream side
of the oil business.
While Eni International Holding, a purely financial operation, has four
subsidiaries, all abroad, Eni's other big subsidiaries have many of their
operations registered outside Italy.
Agip Petroli and EniChem together have around 60 non-Italian companies,
while Agip has 30 subsidiaries registered abroad. Among the most common
locations are financial centres or tax havens such as Geneva and Jersey.
Details of the streamlining are still vague, but the changes are expected
principally to affect the Eni group's financial subsidiaries or holding
companies, rather than trading or sales operations.
Eni has become a focal point for investigations into political corruption
and illegal financing of Italy's main political parties.
Illegal payments to politicians and kickbacks on big contracts have
allegedly been channeled through Eni's foreign operations.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nordbanken ends sector's season
with record loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORDBANKEN, the Swedish state-owned bank, ended the sector's reporting
season on a grim note yesterday when it announced a SKr16bn (Dollars 2.07bn)
operating loss for 1992, the biggest deficit ever disclosed by a Swedish
bank.
However, it said it could rebound to a break-even result this year,
following a recent financial reconstruction, provided economic conditions
for its activities did not worsen.
The 1992 result represents a sharp deterioration on Nordbanken's 1991
deficit of SKr5.8bn, and mainly reflects a sharp jump in credit losses to
SKr19.2bn, or 7.5 per cent of lending, from SKr10.5bn, or 3.9 per cent.
'The accelerating crisis in the real estate market and the recession with
its high interest rates placed exceptional pressures on the shareholders'
equity of the bank,' it stated.
The result is much worse than the SKr8.4bn deficit revealed at the
eight-month stage, as credit losses deepened by SKr9bn in the final four
months of the year because of higher interest costs and customers' foreign
exchange losses. A total of 70 per cent of its credit losses were related to
the real estate loans, and just 2 per cent to personal customers.
The bank also saw a big rise in non-performing loans and interest
deferments, which cut its result before credit losses to SKr3.18bn from
SKr4.66bn. Non-performing loans doubled from SKr19.3bn to SKr39.4bn, against
which it has made provisions of SKr22.4bn.
Net interest income fell 17 per cent to SKr7.06bn, with other operating
income unchanged at SKr3.06bn. Running costs were also virtually static at
SKr6.9bn.
The bank's net loss was cut to SKr1.89bn from SKr5.54bn thanks to a SKr10bn
capital injection from the state.
The bank said it was facing 1993 in a much stronger position following a
reconstruction which has transferred SKr50bn in problem loans to a bad bank
entity called Securum, which was taken over by the state at the start of
this year. This move has cut the bank's risk-weighted assets from SKr230bn
to SKr210bnm, while increasing its international capital adequacy ratio to
8.9 per cent.

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hoechst declines 7% in first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS at Hoechst, the German chemicals group, have fallen by around 7 per
cent in the first quarter of the current year, Mr Jurgen Dormann, finance
director, said yesterday.
The year had got off to a 'miserable' start and there was no sign of
improvement, according to Mr Wolfgang Hilger, group chairman. Price
pressures had increased, and there were now fears that volume sales would be
hit by falling demand.
The continuing decline in Hoechst's profits, following a 17.7 per cent
pre-tax fall during the whole of 1992, and a 26 per cent slump in the first
three months of last year, would force the group to make further savings, he
added.
'This has become the bitter truth, not only in chemicals but in other
important sectors,' Mr Dormann said.
Uneconomic plant would be shut and the German workforce, reduced by 4,100
last year to 81,000 would fall further. Some 3,000 places would go at the
parent, reducing the payroll there to 50,000.
Around 3,900 people were currently working on short-time in Germany and they
would be joined next month by a 500 PVC film workers.
Although Mr Dormann gave no details, he said the German business, which
accounts for almost half of group turnover, had been hit especially hard in
the first quarter.
Pharmaceuticals sales had fallen 17 per cent in the first two months, under
pressure from health spending cuts.
Mr Hilger added that while the group's overall foreign turnover fell 2 per
cent in January and February, domestic business had declined by an
'alarming' 15 per cent, resulting in a 5 per cent decline to DM7bn. Sales
had fallen in all sectors.
The company spent DM770m during 1992 on restructuring, of which DM565m went
on job reductions.

<TEXT>
THE BAYERISCHE Hypothe-ken-und Wechsel-Bank, one of Germany's two large
Bavaria-based banks, yesterday became the third of Germany's 'big five'
banks to announce a large leap in 1992 profits.
Group partial operating profits - which exclude a contribution from
own-account trading - rose by 21.2 per cent to DM1.5bn (Dollars 920m) over
the year. Total operating profits, including DM89.2m earnings in own-account
trading, were up 16.3 per cent to DM1.6bn.
The Bayerische Vereinsbank, the other large Bavarian bank, last week
announced a 24 per cent increase in 1992 partial operating profits to
DM1.48bn, and on Monday the Commerzbank, Germany's third-biggest bank,
reported a 53 per cent surge in group net profits.
The headline profits figures do not reflect a sharp deterioration in credit
risks in the last few months of 1991. Hypo-Bank said it was increasing its
provisions for bad and doubtful debts by 48 per cent, from DM620m in 1991 to
DM917.4m. Earlier this week, the Bayerische Vereinsbank increased its
provisions against domestic commercial debt by 38 per cent to DM860m.
Commerzbank said it would be making substantial provisions against bad and
doubtful debts, details of which will be released on Friday. Dresdner Bank
and Deutsche Bank, Germany's two biggest banks, report next week.
Mr Eberhard Martini, Hypo-Bank's chief executive, said there had been a
'healthy single-digit percentage rise' in general banking and mortgage
banking in the first two months of the year.

<TEXT>
DRESDNER BANK, Germany's second-biggest bank, is planning to take advantage
of the sharp rise in its share price this year to make a big rights issue in
the next few weeks. The two-for-19 issue is expected to raise between
DM1.2bn (Dollars 732m) and DM1.6bn.
The bank, which next week is expected to report double-digit profit growth
for 1992, gave no details on the purpose of the capital-raising measure, one
of the largest rights issues ever undertaken by a German company.
It said proceeds of the issue would be used to finance growth. The cash was
not needed to meet capital adequacy guidelines, and it ruled out using it to
buy shares in the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) to accompany's Dresdner's
co-operation with the state-owned French bank. The agreement is likely to be
cemented with a 10 per cent share swap.
Dresdner intends to issue 4m new shares before its annual meeting on May 14.
Further details will be disclosed only after the bank's supervisory board
meets on Monday, but analysts are predicting a price of around DM350 per
share. The shares closed down DM6.30 at DM399.20 yesterday.
The bank's shares have outperformed the rising DAX-30 index over the year,
rising nearly 13 per cent, compared to a market increase of 6.7 per cent.
This reflects investors' hopes about the impact of lower interest rates on
the bank's performance and expectations of a sharp rise in 1992 operating
profits.
In December, the bank reported partial operating profits, excluding
own-account trading results, up by nearly 19 per cent to DM2.09bn. The
figure for the full year is expected to exceed DM2.5bn, up from DM2.21bn in
1991.
Dresdner has not given any growth predictions for the current year. Growth
in business volume actually fell at the parent company in the first 10
months of the year, reflecting the bank's cautious approach to new lending
in Germany's worsening credit environment.
The rights issue will rank with Daimler-Benz's DM1.95bn issue in 1989 and
RWE's DM1.64bn issue this year as one of Germany's largest ever.

<TEXT>
BSN, the leading force in the French food industry, saw net profits before
exceptional items rise by 5.6 per cent from FFr3.44bn in 1991 to FFr3.64bn
(Dollars 633m) in 1992 thanks to a strong performance from its fresh food
and mineral water interests.
The group, a participant in last spring's bid battle for Perrier, also
managed to increase sales from FFr66.07bn in 1991 to FFr70.84bn last year,
despite the sluggish state of consumer spending.
BSN was also affected in the final quarter of 1992 by the franc's strength
after the September currency crisis. Morgan Stanley estimated that BSN's net
profits would have risen by 9 per cent in 1992, without the negative effect
of the currency crisis and Italian tax changes.
Despite the competitive state of its markets BSN increased operating profits
from FFr6.7bn in 1991 to FFr7.12bn in 1992. Operating profits from fresh
foods rose from FFr2.08bn to FFr2.54bn over the period, beers from FFr806m
to FFr899m and mineral waters from FFr719m to FFr908m.
Earnings per share rose from FFr53.30 in 1991 to FFr55.60 in 1992. However,
BSN raised FFr461m in 1991 from selling a champagne business, thereby making
1992's total net profits 6.7 per cent lower than the previous year.

Sunset + Vine, the television programming and video group, reported profits
of Pounds 329,000 pre-tax for the six months to December 31 - a decline of 9
per cent on the comparable Pounds 363,000.
Mr Colin Frewin, chief executive, blamed the shortfall on reduced interest
income - down from Pounds 89,000 to Pounds 18,000 - and 'temporary adverse
cashflows' on sponsored series. These had since been reversed, he added.
Cash balances at the period-end were in excess of Pounds 1.1m.
Turnover dipped to Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 2.46m). The interim dividend is
maintained at 1.5p, payable from earnings of 4.2p (4.6p).

FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: A sweet prize for the successful
suitor - The sale of the Irish government's Greencore stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CORPORATE courting of a prized daughter of Ireland's food industry,
wooed by two incompatible visions for her future, reaches a climax today.
The seductive colleen is Greencore, a near-monopoly concern in Ireland's
sugar, milling and malting industries, which is considered one of the most
efficient in Europe.
Paternal guidance and control was fully exercised by the Irish government
until Greencore's partial flotation in 1991. Then last month, strapped for
cash, the government put its remaining 30.4 per cent stake up for sale.
Tenders close today and offers could range as high as IPounds 70m.
An independently-minded offspring though, Greencore has already been out
courting and has firmly declared her own choice for the future.
After careful preparation, Mr Gerry Murphy, chief executive of Greencore,
last month finally introduced its favoured groom to the family mandarins at
the Finance Ministry - it was Archer Daniels Midland, the US agribusiness
conglomerate.
Much huffing and puffing followed. 'A foreigner will take the sugar quota
overseas and leave our farming cousins jobless. A foreigner will not have
Greencore's and the whole country's best interests at stake. Can't Greencore
find a suitable Irish suitor?' were some of the objections.
Accordingly, the government made an appeal for a politically acceptable
suitor. But few seem to have been found, and Greencore appears unwilling to
be forced into a marriage of convenience. In a letter to employees last
month, Mr Murphy stated that: 'The board does not believe that any potential
Irish investor could bring the same benefits to the group in our drive to
become a more significant and more successful Irish-based international food
company'.
Greencore's preferred choice he said 'apart from supporting the group with
capital for development, would bring unparalleled access to world class
technology in our core business, global market intelligence and distribution
capability'. And, 'the board will do everything in its power to ensure that
our ability to pursue our stated strategy is at least safeguarded, and
hopefully enhanced, by the ultimate owner of the government's stake'.
The company can call an EGM for shareholder approval of any purchase of a
stake greater than 15 per cent in the group. Existing shareholders are
likely to support the board.
The key issue for Greencore is how to finance a European expansion. It is a
mature company at home with few prospects for further growth. Management
strategy therefore is to target the UK and other EC markets for large
acquisitions in its core business sectors.
According to Mr Joe Gill, a food sector analyst at Riada stockbrokers in
Dublin, 'Greencore will have to acquire scale, and not in small units, which
will require major investments. From a shareholders' and institutional
investors' point of view, a trade partner with the financial muscle such as
ADM is the best option, as it gives the best possibility for expansion and
of adding value to the company'.
The Irish food companies, the majority of which are either directly or
indirectly controlled by dairy co-operatives, have in recent years been
undergoing rapid expansion themselves, both overseas and at home, borrowing
heavily to do so.
Efforts by IAWS, Ireland's biggest supplier of animal feed ingredients, to
put together a bid for Greencore together with its parent dairy
co-operatives, has apparently not been well received by the co-ops.
Fyffes, the fruit and vegetable distributor, with a cash hoard of IPounds
100m, is the only Irish food company considered to have sufficient resources
on its own to buy the stake. It has indicated an interest, but analysts are
sceptical.
Greencore does not fit with Fyffes' main strategic objective, which is to
secure a foothold in the mainland EC fruit distribution market. Its only
interest, therefore, is considered to be in rationalising parts of Greencore
and using it to generate more cash to pursue its prime goal.
This would be unlikely to win government approval. It is under pressure from
farmers and trade unions, and from the Labour party ranks within the
government coalition, to keep Irish control of Greencore. They will be quick
to remind the government of Fyffe's IPounds 25m capital gain in selling its
20 per cent stake in Irish Distillers in 1988, thereby ceding control of
Ireland's main whiskey producer to Pernod Ricard, the French drinks company.
A compromise solution under consideration is a share placement with
institutions. This, however, will not address Greencore's central objective
which is to seek a trade partner with the wherewithal to finance
acquisitions, and will not realise as large a return to the government as a
sale to a single buyer which can be expected to pay a premium over market
prices.
As the sale is vital to this year's budget arithmetic, the government cannot
procrastinate for long and needs cash to bale out Aer Lingus, the ailing
state airline. Its main worry must be whether, when it opens the tenders
today, Greencore's favoured suitor will still be there. If not, the jilted
lover is likely to bear a grudge about the missed opportunity, and, as with
most grudges, it may resurface again in the future.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trinity jumps 27% to Pounds 16.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRINITY International Holdings, the publisher of Merseyside's Daily Post and
Liverpool Echo, reported a 27 per cent increase, from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds
16.9m, in pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 26 on turnover
reduced from Pounds 135.5m to Pounds 115.4m.
The outcome reflected the sale of the papermaking and packaging division 13
months ago at a profit of Pounds 1.66m. There was also a Pounds 2.04m
contribution to profit from Scottish and Universal Newspapers, acquired in
July.
UK operations made profits of Pounds 14m (Pounds 7.92m), a rise of 76 per
cent. This offset a 38 per cent decline to Pounds 2.04m (Pounds 3.3m) in
North American.
Earnings per share were 17.1p (15.6p). The proposed final dividend is 6p,
making a total for the year of 8.7p (8.4p) per ordinary (limited voting)
stock unit.
Dividend cover is 2 and gearing 14.5 per cent.
Mr Phil Graf, who succeeded Mr David Snedden as chief executive last month,
said yesterday: 'We think the dividend cover is sufficient to protect the
long term fabric of the business.
'We continue to be interested in acquiring other UK publishing operations,
but we also have some work to do on our existing businesses this year,' he
added.
Display advertising was up on Merseyside, despite recession, together with
several classified advertising categories. A continuing attack on the cost
base had also proved important, Mr Graf said.
North American operations were hit by recession because of the dependence of
Alberta and British Columbia - where Trinity publishes local newspapers
against fierce competition - on natural resources.
In Pittsburgh, where community newspapers have benefited from a prolonged
strike at a leading competitor, results have been improving recently.
Management changes, new union agreements, and closure last month of two
loss-making businesses - resulting in a Pounds 1.53m provision - are
expected to make an impact this year.
Mr Graf said a Pounds 16m investment programme would be completed in the
Liverpool press hall this year, reducing four printing lines to three and
enabling full-colour printing of the Daily Post from next autumn.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ferrum declines to Pounds 711,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferrum Holdings, the engineering group, announced a drop in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 2.64m to Pounds 711,000 in 1992.
Mr Simon Miller, chairman, blamed the fall on continuing recession in the
UK, economic slowdown in the Netherlands and a lower level of activity in
the North Sea.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 38.5m (Pounds 44.3m). Earnings per share dropped
to 1.7p (7.13p) basic, but the directors propose to hold the dividend at
2.5p with an unchanged final of 1.4p.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 4.35m.
Following disclosure of difficulties at Teredo Petroleum, which acquired
Ferrum's Spanish oil interests in 1989, Ferrum has written down the value of
the convertible loan notes then acquired from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 1.1m and
made further provisions of Pounds 350,000.

Ex-Lands, which is involved in a number of projects in Europe for the
construction and development of golf courses in conjunction with Mr Mark
McCormack's International Management Group, recorded a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 822,000 for the six months to December 31, against Pounds 33,000.
Operating losses from continuing operations was up from Pounds 567,000 to
Pounds 768,000 and administrative expenses from Pounds 891,000 to Pounds
1.12m, but included was a profit of Pounds 1.03m relating to the part sale

Mr David Marshall, chairman, pointed out that adjusted net assets, after
incorporating the unrealised valuation surpluses on projects at June 30
1992, amounted to about Pounds 31m or 45p per share.
Earnings were 1.19p (0.05p) per share.

<TEXT>
A SHARP recovery was mounted by Clinton Cards, the retailer of greetings
cards and associated products, in the year to January 30 with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2.31m, compared with a loss of Pounds 163,000.
Mr Don Lewin, chairman, drew attention to the 'significant change' in
accounting policy with regard to the treatment of reverse premiums received
from landlords, a change which had been incorporated in the current results.
Until 1992, reverse premiums were credited to the profit and loss account;
however, for the year under review, reverse premiums totalling Pounds
327,000 (Pounds 120,000) had been capitalised and would be written off over
a period of five years.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 80m (Pounds 70.5m) and underlying sales showed
an increase of 8.2 per cent. Earnings per share emerged at 9.76p (0.96p
losses) and the total dividend is increased by 13 per cent to 4.25p (3.75p)
with a proposed final of 2.75p.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Iceland advances to Pounds 55.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICELAND FROZEN Foods, which plans finally to cast off its traditional
freezer centre image by changing its name to Iceland Group, yesterday
announced a 20 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 55.4m.
The increase from Pounds 46.3m for the 53 weeks to January 2 was achieved on
sales ahead 17 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn. The results were largely in line
with forecasts made last month when the group announced a Pounds 27m placing
to fund the development of 48 Iceland stores in Littlewoods, the private
retailing chain.
Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman, was ebullient when speaking of the group's
achievements in the past year. 'It was an absolutely brilliant year,' he
said.
Growth was achieved by drawing in more customers, with the average number
per week rising by 700,000 to 3m. Mr Walker said this level equalled the
Christmas peak trading period of the previous year.
However, the average spend per customer had remained steady at about Pounds
7 due to the increasing proportion of chilled and fresh foods being
provided.
Like-for-like food sales rose by 10 per cent in existing stores, while new
space contributed 7 per cent of the increase. Iceland opened 45 new stores
during the year, and planned a further 110 openings in 1993 - including the
Littlewoods outlets. The expansion programme will create over 2,500 new jobs
in 1993.
The Littlewoods deal had accelerated Iceland's development as a mass market
high street retailer of convenience food, Mr Walker said.
No longer a frozen food centre as in the 1970s and 80s, the group would
continue to evolve to meet market demand, he said. Frozen foods now
accounted for some 56 per cent (60 per cent) of food sales. Chilled foods
increased from 11 per cent to 13.5 per cent.
A final dividend of 6.9p makes a 10p (8.5p) total. Earnings advanced by 19
per cent to 41.31p. A 2-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.
COMMENT
There is no shame in being the poorer man's Marks and Spencer. Indeed,
Malcolm Walker virtually crows about the potential of his market niche. He
has increased his forecast of 1,000 stores in the UK to a bold 1,500 and has
no fears of reaching saturation point while he remains in the packaged food
market. The Littlewoods deal has added weight to his argument, although it
is unlikely to have a full impact until 1994. There is big scope for
improving the old Littlewoods food margins, while customer numbers in those
outlets are far higher than in normal Iceland stores. Iceland's experiences
there will be valuable as the group seeks to change its product mix in other
stores. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of Pounds 68m this year, with a
prospective p/e of 16 times. Marketability of the shares will improve
following the planned scrip issue. Although there is good reason to stick
with Iceland in the long-term, the high premium rating compared with others
in the food retailing sector leaves little room for slippage.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A third consecutive year of profit growth at Mayborn Group saw the
USM-quoted fabric dyes, baby products and florists' sundries concern raise
pre-tax figures by 30 per cent from Pounds 2.73m to Pounds 3.55m in 1992.
Turnover was up 9 per cent from Pounds 33m to Pounds 36.1m.
The group continued to be cash generative during the second half resulting
in net borrowings being cut from Pounds 2.44m to Pounds 194,000 at the year
end, giving gearing of 2 per cent (35 per cent).
In view of the profit and cash improvement, the final dividend is raised to
3.4p for a total of 5p (4.2p). Earnings per share rose from 10.1p to 12.4p.
Mr Ian Peacock, chairman, said the fabric dyes division had another
particularly successful year, and after adjusting for the recent contraction
of the Dylon France operation turnover was up 14 per cent and operating
profits ahead 47 per cent to Pounds 1.5m.
Turnover of the baby products side increased by 12 per cent, while profits
grew 15 per cent. The florists' sundries side, however, incurred a small
operating loss on turnover 6 per cent higher.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Minorco makes Pounds 55m Spanish
acquisition from Redland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINORCO, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of
South Africa, has agreed to pay Pounds 55m to acquire a Spanish aggregates
and concrete business from Redland, the UK building materials group.
The deal marks a further expansion of Minorco's growing European quarries
operations.
It is buying Steetley Iberia, purchased last year by Redland when it
acquired the Steetley group in a contested takeover bid worth Pounds 613m.
The Spanish business, comprising 14 quarries and gravel pits and 21 ready
mix concrete plants, is the leading supplier or aggregates and concrete to
the Madrid market.
The sale price constitutes an exit p/e of almost 18 on profits of Pounds 5m
last year, assuming a 38 per cent tax charge. Spanish construction output,
however, is forecast to fall by up to 4 per cent this year.
Profits of Steetley Iberia could slip to between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m
this year, putting the sale on a prospective exit p/e of about 30. In that
case Redland would have received a good price for the business, said
analysts.
Minorco has built up its European quarries business from a standing start
two years ago beginning with with acquisition of Elbekies in the former east
Germany for Dollars 108m. This was followed by the purchase of the Lausitzer
hardstone quarry business, also near Berlin, for Dollars 17m. In the UK
Minorco paid Dollars 207m to ICI for Buxton Lime Industries.
Mr John Draper, who recently took over as managing director of the
industrial minerals division, said the company had every intention of adding
more acquisitions and more countries to its European business.
In the six months to December 31, these reported operating profits of
Dollars 23m (Pounds 16m) on sales totalling Dollars 75m.
Redland, which announces its 1992 results on Thursday, has raised more than
Pounds 150m from disposals since the autumn, including more than Pounds 90m
from former Steetley businesses. Despite this, gearing is still thought to
be between 55 per cent and 60 per cent after the sale to Minorco.
Redland said that Steetley had originally bought the Spanish operations for
more than Pounds 80m but that had subsequently been written down to Pounds
55m in Redland's books.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Invergordon little changed at Pounds 32.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER SCOTCH whisky volumes and weaker prices took their toll on pre-tax
profits at Invergordon Distillers Group.
Profits of Pounds 32.5m for the year to December 31 were less than 1 per
cent ahead of the previous year's Pounds 32.2m.
On an FRS 3 basis, however, the accounts showed an increase of 16 per cent,
with the 1991 figure restated at Pounds 28m after an extraordinary charge of
Pounds 4.2m for the defence against the bid from Whyte &amp; Mackay was
reclassified as an exception-al.
Earnings per share - on the same basis - were 30 per cent ahead at 17.5p
(13.5p). A final dividend of 4.2p lifts the total to 7p, an increase of 7.7
per cent.
Turnover declined 8 per cent from Pounds 92.4m to Pounds 85m as prices came
under pressure; but the fall in operating profit was held to 3.8 per cent at
Pounds 35.3m.
Mr Chris Greig, managing director, said that overall sales volumes were 1
per cent higher. Sales in the UK rose 6 per cent as the group maintained its
leading position in the own-label Scotch whisky sector, but export volumes
were 3 per cent lower, due to a 14 per cent reduction in bulk sales, mainly
to Japan and Australasia.
'However, there was a favourable movement in the mix of export business as
bottled-in-Scotland volume increased by 12 per cent,' Mr Greig said.
Volume sales of the group's Cluny brand increased 18 per cent; Isle of Jura
single malt sales rose 9 per cent; and Invergordon single grain whisky
volumes were 45 per cent higher.
Invergordon's grain distillery continued to operate at more than 90 per cent
capacity, but its four malt distilleries reduced output from 65 per cent to
60 per cent of capacity and a further 15 per cent cut is planned this year.
The new white spirit distilling joint venture at Greenwich is expected to
make a small contribution to profits this year.
The group, which has benefited from increasing use of its own whisky stocks,
continued to add to them. Stocks were valued at Pounds 59.7m compared with
Pounds 55.5m in 1991.
Borrowings were reduced from Pounds 33.5m to Pounds 25m, bringing gearing
down from 73 per cent to 42 per cent. Interest charges fell 38 per cent to
Pounds 2.8m.
COMMENT
Invergordon's strength in the own-label sector - one of the few
beneficiaries of recession - and its stocks of mature whisky enabled it to
ride the difficulties of the market with some success until late last year.
But with continuing pressures on volumes and margins, the strain is
beginning to show and is likely to increase this year. Analysts forecast a
decline in profits for 1993 to between Pounds 30m and Pounds 31.5m, putting
the group on a prospective p/e of 16, still a 15 per cent premium to the
market and a rating 20 per cent to 25 per cent higher than Guinness. That
reflects expectations of a renewed bid from Whyte &amp; Mackay, now biding its
time in the wings with its 41.3 per cent stake. It could make an entrance
later this year.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Secure Trust climbs to Pounds 7.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURE TRUST, the financial services group, reported a 9 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.71m to Pounds 7.32m for the year to
December 31.
The group's profits come from three main sources: fee income, from the
provision of cash management services to consumers; commission income, from
general and motor insurance broking; and interest income, from investments
and loans.
Fee income rose from Pounds 6.67m to Pounds 7.42m despite the number of
customers being static. A contribution from Arbuthnot Fund Managers and an
increase in the annual fee were responsible for the gain.
Commission income rose by 24 per cent, from Pounds 5.32m to Pounds 6.62m,
helped by the inclusion of OBC Insurance Consultants for a full year.
Interest income fell from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 3.42m, with the effect of
lower interest rates being partly offset by a bigger loan book.
The company has recently purchased Peoples Bank for Pounds 4.8m. Mr Henry
Angest, chairman, said that the acquisition would expand the range of
products, which the group could offer.
Gross income was Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 15.6m) and pre-tax profits were struck
after administrative expenses of Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 8.84m).
Earnings per share rose 8.9 per cent to 34.3p (31.5p). The final dividend is
increased to 9p, making a total payment of 13.5p (12p).
Mr Angest said he was confident the group would make sound progress in 1993.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: French buy and recovery in US helps
Wolseley rise 41%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLSELEY, the heating and plumbing distributor which owns Plumb Center,
reported a 41 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 47.6m for the
six months to end-January.
The figure was helped by recovery on the US East Coast and a first full
contribution from Brossette in France.
Brossette, acquired in the second half of last year, contributed Pounds 9.3m
after using fair value provisions of Pounds 1.3m.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman, said that despite the results, recovery was
'patchy' in its main markets.
He added that conditions in Europe remained difficult - 'the last six months
won't linger in my memory.'
In the US, operating profits increased 33 per cent to Pounds 18.3m while
turnover increased 13 per cent to Pounds 542m.
On the East Coast, Carolina Builders and Ferguson performed strongly but the
Californian market remained depressed.
US profits were lifted by about Pounds 600,000 due to exchange rate
movements following sterling's fall.
In the UK, Plumb Center lifted profits slightly for the first time since the
recession started.
The rise reflected months of cost cutting rather than a stronger market.
However, sales in February were higher than a year ago, the company said.
Mr Lancaster said Brossette's results were better than expected. Although
recession in the French construction sector was likely to worsen, Brossette
would be helped by savings because of reduced labour costs in the second
half.
Net borrowings increased more than Pounds 60m to Pounds 122.6m, lifting
gearing from 17 per cent to 32 per cent. However, most of the increase was
due to exchange rate movements on overseas debt.
Earnings increased 30 per cent to 12.86p. Because of a previous imbalance
between the interim and final dividends, the interim payment is lifted 14.5
per cent to 3.55p.
COMMENT
The unconventional Mr Lancaster has become well known for his pessimism, but
his dismissal of the last six months' trading conditions as forgetable is
more than churlish. These results were much better than the market had been
led to expect, and the shares rose 10p to 604p. In the US, Carolina Builders
lifted sales 23 per cent and in Europe the combined buying power of the UK
and French operations is starting to bear fruit. All of which is wonderful
news if one is already a shareholder. If not, given that the share price has
more than doubled since last September and forecast full year profits of
Pounds 105m put the shares on more than 20 times, they are expensive.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bridon back in the black with Pounds 1.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIDON, the maker of ropes and other engineered products, returned to profit
in the year to December 31 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m compared to
restated losses of Pounds 4.9m.
Although turnover was down at Pounds 316m (Pounds 319.3m), reflecting
recession in the UK and European markets, an elimination of rationalisation
costs, which led to a Pounds 2.6m charge in 1991, saw operating profits rise
from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 5.2m.
Mr Brian Clayton, chief executive, said the company, which sells mainly to
the construction, mining, fishing and offshore oil and gas industries, had
seen an improvement in orders in the early months of 1993.
He said the company was concentrating on developing its high-technology
products with higher added-value, and was seeking to improve marketing of
core products such as general purpose wire ropes.
He said Bridon had this week confirmed a Pounds 6m contract with Norsk Hydro
for a mooring system for a drilling platform in the Troll field in the
Norwegian North Sea sector.
He added, however, that the outlook remained patchy. Although the company
was benefiting from the weaker pound, especially in the US, this was
balanced by poor growth prospects in France and Germany and the continued
negative effects on new contracts of the political scandal in Italy.
Earnings per share were 1.9p (losses of 8.3p). The final dividend is 2.75p,
holding the total at 4p.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clyde calls for Pounds 34m as losses hit
Pounds 40m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLYDE Petroleum, the UK exploration and production company, yesterday called
on shareholders for Pounds 34m and at the same time reported an after-tax
loss of Pounds 39.8m for 1992.
That compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 1.2m, a figure restated to
conform with accounting changes which forced the company to write off Pounds
80m of previously unsuccessful exploration expenditure.
Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the rights issue would give the company a
cash cushion following the go-ahead of its development of the Gryphon field
in the North Sea later this year. 'This is a major sea-change within Clyde -
we're moving to the fast track development of Gryphon,' he said.
Originally, Gryphon was due to come on stream in 1996 but Clyde now plans to
start production in the final quarter of this year. That would involve
investment of Pounds 90m - Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in Gryphon - this
year which would push the company's debt to equity ratio to over 100 per
cent. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said: 'We're at a peak of our
expenditure this year and the rights issue will help keep that under
control'.
The rights issue, of 79.86m shares on a 1-for-4 basis, will give the company
the flexibility to continue its exploration programme overseas while it
proceeds with UK developments.
Clyde is also involved in the offshore development of the Wytch Farm
oilfield in Dorset, the Stirling oilfield and several gas fields in the
Netherlands. Some 90 per cent of the company's commercial reserves will come
on stream by 1994.
Cashflow will increase to Pounds 350m next year as the company's production
rises to 55,000 barrels a day in the second quarter from a current level of
23,874 b/d.
With the strong cashflow, the company plans to pay down its debt quickly and
reduce gearing from the 100 per cent level to 60 per cent by 1994 and 15 per
cent by the end of 1996.
The company is looking at break-even this year with possibly a small profit
or loss. For 1994, when it hopes to return to profit, it plans to pay an
interim dividend of 0.5p followed by a final of 1p.
Clyde is continuing its exploration efforts in the Yemen and Syria as well
as some small developments in the Netherlands.
Turnover for 1992 dropped to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 87.2m).
COMMENT
Investors taking up the rights issue are demonstrating their faith in the
management to continue growing the company beyond its production peak in
1994. But at 44p a share, the rights issue is priced at a discount to the
company's net asset value, which is estimated to be between 50p and 56p a
share. The company will reach a peak in production and see a big increase in
earnings and cashflow in the next few years. But investors must ask how
sustainable this is. Clyde is clearly hoping for good exploration success in
the Yemen, the results of which will become apparent towards the end of the
year. Without good success in exploration, the company will be looking at
making an acquisition over the next 18 months. Investors should be able to
bank on a dividend in 1994, but they will be hoping to see some clear
evidence of oil discoveries before then.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat turns in Pounds 7.75m for 15
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle of New Zealand entrepreneur
Sir Ron Brierley, yesterday reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7.75m in the
15 months to December 31 1992, on total operating revenue of Pounds 34.2m.
Sir Ron said the results reflected the group's efforts to restructure itself
and restore its corporate image.
GPG, which is currently considering making a cash bid for Brown Shipley
Holdings, the investment and broking business, returned to the Stock
Exchange last November after a two-year suspension imposed because it was
considered a 'shell' company with no underlying business activity.
The restated accounts for the year to September 30 1991, showed a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 27.4m after an exceptional charge of Pounds 32.7m made to
conform with new UK accounting guidelines on the treatment of goodwill.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: All-round margin growth at UniChem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at UniChem, the pharmaceuticals group, jumped 49 per cent
from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 31.9m in 1992 as both wholesale and retail
operations showed sharp improvements in both volume and margins.
The acquisition of retail chemists shops in the UK and three wholesale
companies in Portugal helped push turnover over the Pounds 1bn mark for the
first time, reaching Pounds 1.05bn - a 14 per cent rise.
While the Portuguese companies produced Pounds 43.4m in overseas sales,
wholesale turnover in the UK grew by 6 per cent to Pounds 977.6m (Pounds
916.9m).
Improved margins at home, attributable in part to greater automation in
UniChem's warehouses, pushed up UK wholesaling profits from Pounds 21m to
Pounds 28.4m.
The acquisition of Moss chemists and other additions saw the number of
UniChem's pharmacies rise from 130 at the beginning of 1992 to 209 at
present.
Retailing turnover surged from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 79.7m, while operating
profits grew seven times to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 700,000).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.45m (Pounds 1.03m) arose from the
disposal of its nappy manufacturing business, which left the net
attributable balance at Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 13.3m).
Fully diluted earnings per share were up at 15.1p (13.3p). The proposed
final dividend is 3.75p, for a total of 5.65p (5p).
COMMENT
From a standing start, UniChem has now become the UK's third largest retail
chemist chain, after Boots and Lloyds Chemists. It is now seeking to extend
its retail reach through instore pharmacies in superstores, having already
established outlets in Asda. The idea is that the group's expertise in
wholesaling will allow it to extract good margins at the retail end. But it
has not neglected its traditional operations. Wholesale margins have been
pushed up by concentrating on warehouse automation and with six of its 11 UK
warehouses still to be upgraded there appears to be room for more
improvement. Meanwhile, the move into Europe looks less clear cut. The
company says its solo Portuguese acquisitions will not set the pattern; it
intends to play a part in Europe, but sees a long timescale and development
through companies such as PHE, a joint venture it is involved in Germany.
The company may be vulnerable to any moves by the UK government to cut the
health service drugs bill, but its growing involvement in the
over-the-counter market - as distinct from prescription medicines - should
provide a cushion. Pre-tax profits for 1993 are seen at about Pounds 36m, a
prospective p/e of 14 times.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: JW Spear shows 46% improvement to Pounds
3.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JW SPEAR, the maker of Scrabble and other games, yesterday announced profits
up by more than 46 per cent to Pounds 3.71m for the year to December 31,
compared with Pounds 2.53m.
The group switched pension fund managers from Scottish Amicable to Scottish
Widows at the beginning of 1992 following 'lacklustre performance', Mr Paul
Lipscombe, finance director, said.
Last July the routine actuarial revaluation had revealed a further charge to
the profit and loss reserve bringing the total to about Pounds 700,000 over
the last two years.
The charge was partly due to a shortfall between the fund's performance and
its projected liabilities.
The advance in profits came on turnover up 20 per cent, from Pounds 27.3m to
Pounds 32.8m.
Margins improved to more than 12 per cent (10.5 per cent).
Distribution costs rose some 40 per cent to Pounds 9.77m against Pounds
7.99m for the preceding year, mainly because of royalties paid under a
licensing arrangement for Atmosfear, the interactive video game.
A proposed final dividend of 11.5p (8p) brings the total distribution for
the year to 14p (10p) payable from earnings per share ahead from 32.3p to
47.3p.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Prudential doubles to Pounds 406m -
Mercantile &amp; General non-life loss grows from Pounds 60m to Pounds 143m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL CORPORATION, the financial services and life insurance company,
shrugged off heavy losses at its reinsurance subsidiary, Mercantile &amp;
General, to more than double 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 406m, compared
with Pounds 182m.
Earnings per share were 15p (4.7p). The final dividend is raised to 7.8p,
lifting the total from 11p to 11.9p.
The company also announced that - as expected - reversionary and terminal
bonus rates are to be cut this year as a result of lower levels of
anticipated investment returns.
Profits on life business increased to Pounds 444m (Pounds 385m), but were
partly offset by losses on the general insurance business of Pounds 110m
(Pounds 58m) and further losses on discontinued lines of general business of
Pounds 11m (Pounds 91m). Shareholders' other income amounted to Pounds 134m
(Pounds 86m). Interest payable fell to Pounds 51m (Pounds 55m). The accounts
have been prepared in accordance with FRS 3 accounting principles.
Pre-tax profits from home and motor insurance - the only significant general
insurance business owned by the group - grew to Pounds 33m (Pounds 2m),
reflecting milder weather, premium increases and a reduced incidence of
claims.
However, losses from Mercantile's non-life operations were Pounds 143m
(Pounds 60m), with an underwriting loss of Pounds 187m, partially offset by
an investment return of Pounds 44m.
Mr Mick Newmarch, group chief executive, described the performance as
'dire'. Although Mercantile appointed new management last year, it was hard
hit in 1992 by two North American hurricanes which produced losses of Pounds
56m.
The group has been forced to increase its reserves against losses from
catastrophe reinsurance underwritten between 1988 and 1990. Losses from
marine London market excess business amounted to Pounds 58m.
Mercantile's non-life exposure has already been sharply curtailed. Mr
Newmarch said the group was 'determined not to allow Mercantile's general
business to detract from its life operation.'
By contrast profits from life business rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 444m,
with worldwide premiums up by 23 per cent to Pounds 7.6bn. UK life profits
rose to Pounds 276m.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CIA better than expected at Pounds 3.65m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIA GROUP, the USM-quoted independent media-buying concern, reported higher
than expected pre-tax profits, up 29 per cent from Pounds 2.83m to Pounds
3.65m, for the year to December 31 1992.
CIA's share price, which closed unchanged at 285p, had risen by 16p earlier
in the week on rumours of better than predicted results.
Turnover increased to Pounds 235.3m (Pounds 172.4m), while operating margins
were 16 per cent. The group benefited from net new business wins of Pounds
76m in 1992, compared with Pounds 51m. Operating costs of its UK operations
were reduced by 7 per cent, and it ended the year with Pounds 8m cash.
Earnings per share improved by 15 per cent to 15.72p (13.62p).
The total dividend is increased 16 per cent to 4.35p (3.75p) with a final of
3.03p.
Mr Chris Ingram, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We expect continuing
opportunities for growth, both organically and acquisition, in the UK and
internationally.'
Analysts are now revising their 1993 forecasts; cautious estimates suggest
possible growth of 10 per cent this year.

plastic pipes and fittings, reported a 9.5 per cent increase in interim
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 5.85m to Pounds 6.4m.
Turnover in the six months to December 31 increased by 7.4 per cent to
Pounds 49.2m (Pounds 45.8m) and included a full contribution from Aquapipes
and GCA Windows, both acquired in October 1991.
Together the two businesses contributed more than Pounds 2m to turnover and
about Pounds 150,000 to profits.
Earnings per share rose 9.4 per cent to 2.78p (2.54p) and the interim
dividend is raised to 0.66p (0.63p).
Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman, said the results reflected the continuing
strength of the core plastic pipe and fittings business, which accounted for
Pounds 32.4m (Pounds 30.2m) of sales, and the development and successful
integration of more recently acquired domestic plastic product activities.
Polypipe and Paragon increased their share of the above-ground rainwater,
soil and waste market as did Derwent MacDee in the market for flushing
cisterns, toilet and other bathroom fittings.
Capital expenditure during the first half totalled Pounds 4.96m and will be
about the same level in the second half when new machinery to produce large
diameter twin-wall pipes comes on stream.
The balance sheet remains strong with no net debt.
COMMENT
Polypipe continues to buck the recession helped by some astute acquisitions
including Aquapipes whose lightweight twin-walled corrugated pipes use 40
per cent less raw material than their solid counterparts and are set to
gradually replace clay and concrete. Only 12.5 per cent of the group's
business is related to new housing with the the bulk coming from the much
less sensitive repair, maintenance and improvement markets where new
products are helping margins. The group has so far resisted pressure from
its raw material suppliers to pass on price increases, which might not stick
anyway. Given the seasonally-stronger second half has already shown some
signs of improvement, full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 17m look
reasonable. However, the shares have climbed sharply in the last six months
and at yesterday's close of 137p now trade on a lofty multiple of over 18
and look fully valued.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: More O'Ferrall slips to Pounds 5.04m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE O'Ferrall, the international billboard and bus shelter advertising
contractor, posted a 13 per cent decline in 1992 pre-tax profits mainly
reflecting weak trading conditions in its core UK and Ireland markets.
Profit fell from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 5.04m on turnover higher at Pounds
62.5m (Pounds 61.7m) reflecting a an expansion of the site portfolio,
particularly in the UK and Belgium. On a like-for-like basis turnover fell
by about 5 per cent.
Net interest charges dropped sharply to Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 3.36m)
reflecting lower rates and reduced net borrowings which fell to Pounds 7.4m
(Pounds 8.6m) representing end-year gearing of 25 (26) per cent.
Turnover in the main UK and Ireland market slipped slightly to Pounds 38.5m
(Pounds 38.9m) but operating profits in the home market slumped to Pounds
4.15m (Pounds 7.09m) reflecting a particularly weak market in the final
quarter and high investment costs in new sites.
In contrast overseas operations increased their contribution to the group
with the business in Belgium in particular lifting its operating profit to
Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 1.37m) on turnover which grew to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds
9.43m).
Overall, 41 per cent of group operating profits came from outside the UK and
Ireland compared with 23 per cent in 1991.
This was despite the sale of the group's loss-making US business which was
completed shortly after the of the year and resulted in an extraordinary
loss of Pounds 4.8m, including Pounds 2.2m of goodwill transferred from
reserves.
Earnings per share, excluding the extraordinary loss, fell to 11p (14.9p).
However, the group is maintaining the 10p final dividend making an unchanged
total for the year of 13.2p.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;O slightly ahead of forecast at Pounds
270m as conditions improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENINSULAR and Oriental Steam Navigation Company yesterday announced
slightly higher than forecast profits for last year and said conditions had
improved for a number of divisions.
Pre-tax profits increased 16 per cent, from Pounds 233m to Pounds 270.4m,
after restatement of the previous year's figure under FRS 3. Under the old
accounting standards, profits increased 4.5 per cent to Pounds 227.1m. At
the interim stage, profits increased 38 per cent to Pounds 101.1m.
Lord Sterling, chairman, said the performance was 'very creditable'. He said
Bovis Homes, the housebuilding arm which suffered during the year, had
improved and 'gone along quite merrily' in the last few months.
Turnover increased 12.9 per cent to Pounds 5.53bn. Excluding discontinued
operations such as the business service companies sold yesterday to Granada,
turnover increased 13 per cent to Pounds 5.04bn.
P&amp;O's cruises and ferries division performed well, lifting operating profits
19 per cent to Pounds 153m despite recession in its main markets of the US
and UK. Container and bulk shipping saw flat operating profits of Pounds
36.2m, despite lower freight rates, thanks to cost cutting.
Other divisional profits were: service businesses fell 5 per cent to Pounds
77.3m; investment property increased 38 per cent to Pounds 90.9m.
Housebuilding, construction and development reported operating losses of
Pounds 39.8m (Pounds 25.1m) after a Pounds 30m write down on land values.
The profits were struck using year end exchange rates, and would have been
about Pounds 10m lower if average rates had been used. Lord Sterling said
the company was discussing with its auditors whether to move to average
rates.
Net borrowings rose nearly Pounds 300m during the second half of the year to
Pounds 1.89bn on stockholders capital and reserves of Pounds 2.25bn, to give
gearing of 84 per cent. Following the sale of businesses to Granada, gearing
will fall to about 60 per cent, the company said.
Earnings were affected by a Pounds 20m increase in the tax charge and fell
from 35.2p to 32.9p. A maintained final dividend of 17p is recommended, for
an unchanged total of 30.5p.
P&amp;O's shares added 2p to 603p.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bowater ahead 49% in line with rights issue
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER, the packaging and industrial films company, yesterday announced
profits in line with its own forecast, and will pay a second interim
dividend rather than a final as a way of beating Budget changes.
Pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 were Pounds 147.2m, a 49 per
cent increase on 1991, as forecast last month when the company launched a
Pounds 295m rights issue to fund its acquisition of Specialty Coatings
International, the US coatings company.
Turnover improved from Pounds 1.27bn to Pounds 1.57bn, again in line with
expectations, and the operating profit margin rose to 9 per cent against 8.6
per cent.
Bowater's shares closed unchanged at 490p as the company announced it would
pay shareholders a 'second interim' dividend of 6.65p in place of a final.
The pay-out will be made on April 2 to take advantage of the existing tax
credit of 25 per cent.
Mr Norman Lamont announced in last week's Budget that investors' tax credit
on dividends would fall to 20 per cent from the start of the next financial
year on April 6.
If Bowater had waited to get shareholder approval at the annual meeting in
May to pay the final dividend in June, it would have cost the company about
Pounds 1m more to fund the same distribution.
The total dividend for the year is 11.5p (11p), payable from earnings per
share ahead 12.5 per cent to 25.2p.
'The financial results are commendable when compared with UK plc' commented
Mr Norman Ireland, chairman.
'The overall improvement in earnings in the last quarter of 1992 and into
January 1993 reported in the rights issue document has continued into
February.
'We remain cautious on the out-turn for 1993 but Bowater remains ready to
move wherever the upturn in the business is sighted.'
Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said he was particularly pleased that it had
been able to integrate DRG and Cope Allman, the two companies it bought in
March last year for Pounds 444m, so quickly.
Together, they contributed Pounds 338m to turnover, which had exceeded the
company's expectations.
Bowater said its business in the UK had remained steady, although it had
shown some decline in continental Europe, especially in Germany.
The US had been showing signs of recovery for the last 18 months, and
Australia was also showing signs of an upturn.
COMMENT
Bowater is a very different group from the one the present management came
to in 1987. The City has been impressed by the speed with which it has
realised its goals, first of focusing the company on its core businesses,
and then achieving through acquisitions a 'critical mass' in the added-value
areas of health care packaging, personal care packaging and coated
industrial films. Now the challenge is to develop the synergies between
divisions and harness the potential of a group spread over a large
geographical area and with a wide range of expertise. Judging by its
performance to date, the management is up to the task. Pre-tax profits this
year are forecast at about Pounds 195m, and the shares, on a prospective
multiple of 17.5, look a good long-term buy.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bluebird in the black with Pounds 1.55m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUEBIRD Toys yesterday announced a return to profits for the year to
December 31 with Pounds 1.55m pre-tax against losses of Pounds 3.55m.
The 1991 outcome reflected exceptional costs of Pounds 3.46m incurred as a
result of restructuring over 1990 and 1991.
Turnover rose to Pounds 46m (Pounds 42.6m) and margins increased to 7.5 per
cent (5.3). The group now does more than a third of its business in the US,
continental Europe and Japan. Overseas sales have increased every year since
1988.
The group manufactures 50 per cent of products sold in the UK in China and
also 57 per cent of the products it sells overseas. It had no plans to
repatriate production from China to the UK to take advantage of sterling's
comparatively low value.
It said its Knock Your Block Off, Whack Attack, and Skull Krusher products,
sold under the Peter Pan brand, remained popular. It rejected the threat of
'politically correct parents' preferring 'non-violent' or 'unisex' toys.
Mr Angus Fisher, operations director, added: 'There is some evidence that
boys are playing with the Polly Pocket toys (miniature dolls) - and that's
outside the employees of the company.'
Stocks had been reduced to about Pounds 2.9m from a peak in 1990 of Pounds
8.8m.
The board is proposing to resume dividends with a proposed 4.5p, payable
from earnings per share of 16.9p (losses of 35.8p).

Relyon Group, the furniture maker, reported pre-tax profits down slightly
from Pounds 2.67m to Pounds 2.64m over the 12 months to December 31.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 41.2m (Pounds 42.5m). Gross margins were
maintained but bad debts contributed to a weakening of profitability in the
core bed and cabinet furniture side, said Mr Ralph Platt, chairman.
Closure costs at Solent were taken as an extraordinary charge of Pounds
2.59m. Earnings per share were 8.86p (8.37p). The final dividend is held at
3.15p for a maintained total of 4.9p.

FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hambros floats services arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMBROS, the merchant bank, yesterday floated its Hambros Insurance Services
subsidiary at a price which values the new company at Pounds 86.7m.
The issue will raise Pounds 35m, of which some Pounds 13.9m has been
earmarked for HIS. Hambro Group, which will retain a 50.1 per cent stake in
the new group, will receive between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m.
Mr Christopher Sporborg, chairman, said the bank's investment in the HIS
companies has amounted to under Pounds 10m.
Some Pounds 13.5m of the proceeds - Pounds 9m in cash - will be paid to
Hambro Countrywide, another insurance subsidiary, in return for its 51 per
cent stake in Hambro Legal Protection. HLP offers legal expenses insurance
and telephone advice services.
Various existing shareholders, including the management of Beale Dobie, a
company which specialises in the sales of second hand endowment policies,
will receive a further Pounds 6m in return for their shares.
Mr Nicholas Page, managing director, said that the group identified
'run-off', the business of handling claims of insurance companies which are
no longer actively trading, as one possible new market.
In addition Cunningham Hart, which has recently expanded into the
Netherlands and already has other overseas operations, hopes to increase its
profile elsewhere in Europe and in the US.
Further expansion at HLP is also likely. Since 1988 when HLP launched its
legal advice service, new telephone help lines have been launched to provide
medical advice and help on travel, tax and various other areas.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to March 31 1993 are expected to amount to
Pounds 9.4m, with earnings per share of 10.39p and a notional dividend of
5.19p. The dividend would be covered twice.
Of the 25.36m new shares, 12.68m will be placed with institutional and other
investors and 12.68m shares, conditionally placed by Panmure Gordon, will be
offered to intermediaries.
The placing price is 138p per share. Applications for the intermediaries
offer close at midday on Friday.
COMMENT
Although investors might be concerned that less than half the new money
raised by the issue is to be directed into expansion, HIS's prospects appear
attractive. Recent growth, especially of the loss adjustment business, has
been impressive and trends in the insurance industry mean that the outlook
for the group's range of telephone-based advice services are reasonably
good. Overall, at a price of 138p and prospective multiple of 13.3, the
share seems reasonable value.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new symbol for the Share Shops handling the forthcoming sale of the
government's BT stock remains a state secret. But Observer hears that there
is a good chance that it will involve a bull and a bear.
The public has to be made aware that the market for shares goes down as well
as up - hence the need for the services of the stock market's two best-known
animals. However, the finer details of the symbol still have to be worked
out. Suggestions that the bull may be pictured dominating the bear may be
ruled out on grounds of good taste - although 'that's what we hope will
happen in the sale,' says one of the government's advisers.

Eric Broadley, the crusty chairman of Lola Cars and an elder statesman on
Britain's racing car circuit, has been having an unusually good week.
On Sunday, Nigel Mansell, the former grand prix world champion, won his
first IndyCar race in one of Broadley's Lolas. Yesterday Broadley took to
the podium and picked up the Castrol Institute of the Motor Industry annual
gold medal for 'outstanding' achievements in road transport.
Admittedly, he was receiving the award not on behalf of Lola but for the
entire UK motor sport industry. It now employs 50,000, produces 90 per cent
of the world's racing cars - and made a net positive contribution of Pounds
400m to the UK's balance of trade last year.
With a record like that how long will it be before John Major starts
rewarding a few of these knights of the road?

It sounds like the oft-criticised Association of British Insurers is the
latest trade body to think that its problems would be solved if only it
could find a strong, crusading director-general from outside the industry to
fight its corner.
Stung by one public relations upset after another, the ABI has retained
headhunters to look for its first director-general. Presumably Mike Jones,
the ABI's 49-year-old chief executive, who has been loyally peddling the
industry line for the last 27 years, will be in the running for the job.
But the preference is for an outsider, someone with political savvy, such as
an ex-Treasury minister. John Maples, who lost his seat in the last election
and failed to get selected for the Newbury by-election, might be a
possibility.
Pressure for creating a new top post at the ABI has come largely from a
group of big composite insurers, like the Prudential, which feels that the
industry needs someone who can present its case strongly to government as
well as to the public.
But the headache for any would-be DG is that the ABI has 450 members and
draws its support from two insurance camps, general and life, which often
have contradictory interests. It is just as important that any new DG can
stand up to bullying from the likes of Mick Newmarch, the Pru's rumbustious
boss, as from the Office of Fair Trading.
Hard to imagine who would fit the bill given the ABI's current structure.

North Sea oil companies, livid about the chancellor's plans to abolish tax

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are signs of quiet satisfaction in London over news that Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's foreign policy adviser, Peter Hartmann, is pretty certain to
be the next German ambassador - but not because he will be even more
anglophile than his predecessor.
Far more the gentlemanly diplomat than Horst Teltschik, the acute political
operator who previously inhabited the position within the chancellor's
office, Hartmann has been careful to maintain good relations with Downing
Street. Indeed his courteous contacts have underpinned the good personal
chemistry between the chancellor and John Major, which has stood up
remarkably well to the UK government's strange antics over the Maastricht
treaty.
But his winning point is not as a London-lover but rather as an intermediary
who so obviously enjoys the chancellor's confidence, in contrast with
Hermann von Richthofen, the present ambassador, whose diplomatic mildness
has not always found favour with Kohl.
In London since December 1988, von Richthofen still has no definite job
lined up in Bonn, though the German foreign ministry insists his return is
wholly unconnected with the embarrassing decision to publish a letter from
Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger shortly after the rout of sterling
last September. The elegant incumbent, a superb dinner host, went down a
treat in his own way. But back home, the anglophilia was viewed with
suspicion. Hence there are those who think a more sceptical character could
carry greater weight.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, the home secretary, yesterday announced details of his
plans to reform the police service in England and Wales to improve its
efficiency and effectiveness. As with other government reforms of public
services, local managers - in this case chief constables - will be given
much greater freedom to manage. At the same time, the police authorities to
which chief constables are accountable will be overhauled to make them 'more
powerful and businesslike'.
To achieve this latter aim, Mr Clarke proposes to reduce the number of
elected representatives on the 43 police authorities from two-thirds of the
places to half. The balance will be allocated to local magistrates and Home
Office-appointed business executives. The chairman of each police authority
will be nominated by the home secretary, rather than being elected by the
members.
This will certainly make the chairman more powerful. But it will dilute the
power of locally-elected representatives over the police service. In effect,
the police service will be run by 43 quangos, with weak local control and
strong direction - through the appointment of the chairman - from Whitehall.
This is a recipe for the sort of divided managerial and public
accountability which was responsible for the recent debacle over
computerising the London Ambulance Service.
The dilution of accountability could also make it harder to improve the
effectiveness of policing if it weakens public confidence in the police.
That confidence is essential to encourage the flow of information from the
public which is needed to prevent crime and catch criminals. Restoring it
needs better community relationships and more sensitive policing practices,
neither likely to be fostered by a quango largely beholden to the home
secretary.
Apart from this change in the composition of police authorities, much of the
rest of Mr Clarke's programme is commendable. Chief constables are to be
freed from Home Office controls over manpower levels and capital
expenditure, leaving them to decide what resources are needed according to
local preferences and objectives. Performance indicators are to be published
for police forces to show how successful each is in solving crime, meeting
targets for answering emergency 999 telephone calls and responding to urgent
incidents. And a police authority is to be created for London where up till
now the police have been accountable only to the home secretary.
Mr Clarke has also sensibly drawn back from leaked plans to amalgamate the
43 forces into 25 or fewer. There is no evidence that larger forces are more
successful in solving crime. If mergers are necessary for some forces, they
should be postponed until plans for the reorganisation of local government
by Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission are ready. Meanwhile, the
government should think again before weakening the local accountability of
police authorities.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Kenya's crisis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN DECIDING this week to reverse economic reforms introduced in February,
President Daniel arap Moi has taken a step as impractical as it is
dangerous. His move stems from his frustration over conditions attached to
aid, rather than a considered appraisal of the country's options. The
reforms that donors are urging on Kenya are far from easy, but the
consequences of Mr Moi's retreat into an economic laager will prove more
painful.
The retreat is motivated in part by the impact of adjustment on the system
of patronage and corruption that permeates the government. Transparency and
accountability, the key donor principles, make the life of top government
officials more difficult. What is now at stake, however, is not only the
stability of Kenya. Mr Moi's action poses an uncomfortable challenge for
those western governments and institutions that endorsed the president's
controversial election victory last December.
If Mr Moi had been fairly elected and presided over a sound administration,
he would deserve a sympathetic hearing when he complains of having to
implement 'dictatorial' IMF policies. But there is every reason to fear that
this is not the case. If the IMF's post-election assessments of Kenya's
performance reveal serious economic mismanagement which allowed state funds
to reach party coffers and helped to buy electoral success, Mr Moi's plea
would lose its credibility.
The president now faces a volatile period: a plunging exchange rate and no
recourse to foreign aid; a rapidly rising rate of inflation; high
unemployment; and growing resentment over corruption. As ex-president
Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia belatedly discovered, there is no alternative to
reforms backed by the IMF.
It is possible to understand Mr Moi's frustration without endorsing his
action. In November 1991, the donor community suspended most aid
disbursements to Kenya, pending political and economic reform. On the
political front at least, Mr Moi can argue that he has done what the donors
wanted, but has received no tangible benefit. The ban on multi-party
politics was lifted by the end of 1991. A year later Kenya conducted its
first multi-party poll for 26 years.
In the view of some observers, the election process was seriously flawed.
The majority of donor governments, including Britain and the US (as well as
the Commonwealth observer mission) came to a different conclusion: the
elections, while not entirely free and fair, were acceptable.
Had the west refused to endorse last December's poll, it could today advise
Mr Moi that the only way out of his crisis would be to put his party to the
test of a rigorously supervised general election. Since that option is not
available, donors can now do no more than hope that Mr Moi soon comes to
terms with economic realities. They may find themselves having to conclude
that he is the problem, and not, as they hoped last December, part of its
solution.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Personal View: Return trip to familiar ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS TOMBS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The original objectives of Britain's privatisation programme were laudable
and to a considerable extent successful. They involved the replacement of
monolithic state monopolies with the forces of the free market, and the
replacement of institutionalised management with the entrepreneurial skills
of private management.
The successes were in those areas where competition was real, such as road
transport, British Aerospace, British Airways and Rolls-Royce. However, the
quite different considerations and results which emerged after telephones,
gas, electricity and water were privatised raise serious doubts about the
prospects for British Rail, which the government remains determined to
include in its privatisation programme.
The doctrine established earlier in the privatisation process did not change
fundamentally to take account of the public utilities' lack of a free market
in their products and their effective monopolies; rather, an economic model
was substituted for the reality of competition. Thus, in the case of
telecommunications, competition was introduced by the development of
alternative providers; the inevitable snail's pace of such developments,
coupled with the oppressive market-power of Telecom, made the
government-appointed industry regulator the residual legatee of the dream.
In a similar way, the gas regulator has had to substitute for the
shortcomings of the chosen organisation, with its inevitable lack of the
assumed mainspring of the process - a free market. Such substitution is
taking place in the water and electricity industries.
Against this background, it is clear that privatisation of the electricity
supply industry was ill-conceived. Attempts to create competition were based
on a flawed organisational structure in which electricity production was
separated from its distribution and sale, except in Scotland. A duopoly of
production was created in England and Wales and nuclear power was retained
in state ownership, but subsidised by the newly liberated companies.
Competition began with a big distortion, made worse by the price mechanism
of the 'power pool' of the producers and their virtual freedom from
regulation.
But this was not the most important shortcoming of the privatisation
process, for the privatised industry has no mechanism for developing a
strategy of plant or fuels for the future. Since that future tends to be 10
years or more, the market process is simply incapable of recognising, much
less dealing with, the problem. Such a strategy vacuum led, inevitably, to
the recent pit-closure proposals which were the result of a 'dash for gas'
driven by market forces, without consideration of the long-term interests of
the industry, the consumer or the nation. The short-term gains were
hypnotic; responsibility for the long term rested nowhere.
To the surprise of no intelligent observer, this vacuum forced the
government back into the role it had so precipitately abandoned. The price
of the competitive pretence of privatisation is the reversion to government
of a responsibility it had sought to escape. Where this leaves the original
objectives of privatisation is an interesting question, and one is forced to
conclude that the government's objectives of management freedom and
competition have been supplanted by the Treasury's desire for financial
rewards.
These problems offer pointers to the difficulty of privatising the railways.
Here we are again offered a hypothetical market, but with a multitude of
supervisory bodies. Experience should suggest that the 'freedom' of
management will be heavily circumscribed by the new bureaucracy and that a
strategic vacuum - and probably a safety vacuum too - will result. Even
worse, from point of view of the Treasury at least, government may find it
has not succeeded in hiving off its national responsibility.
For the passenger, there is little hope of improvement from the combined
efforts of the various constituent bodies - Railtrack, the franchising
authority, the Safety Commission, the operators and so on. Much more likely
is a paralysis of decision and planning, with a built-in system for 'passing
the buck'. Once again, finally, government will find itself the residual
legatee of its reorganisations.
I hope that it will reconsider its proposals. By all means try to introduce
private-sector methods and management into the railways, but do so by means
which leave management in effective control of their industry's future.
Target-setting, management agencies and contracts are the way forward - not
the limited nostrum of yesteryear.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Letter: Duty should encourage LPG use in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AIDEN ROE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The European Commission has accepted the case made by the European
Autogas Association and has proposed minimum excise duties on liquid
petroleum gas (LPG) of Ecu50 ecus per thousand litres compared with Ecu337
for leaded petrol, Ecu207 for unleaded and Ecu245 for diesel. These rates
reflect the relative environmental damage caused by the respective fuels. I
offer two examples of good practice which reflect this:
i) In the UK LPG is the only fuel that fork-lift trucks powered by internal
combustion engines are allowed to use when operating in a confined space.
ii) In Tokyo taxis are supplied with factory fitted LPG tanks and gas
carburettors by law. Petrol and diesel engines are not allowed.
In many EC countries - France, Belgium and the Netherlands being the nearest
examples - LPG is the cheapest road fuel available.
Until Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, or his successor, reduces duties on
LPG, in order to encourage its use, it will be difficult not to conclude
that the environmental justification for across-the-board increases in road
fuel duty is being used rather cynically.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Childcare pays off for the parent: Sony is starting to reap
the benefits of its Hollywood investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This summer it will be difficult to escape the media blitz for Columbia
Pictures' Last Action Hero, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. With production
costs of Dollars 55m and another Dollars 20m budgeted for marketing, it is
one of Hollywood's most expensive movies.
At first glance, the figures seem extravagant for Sony of Japan, which has
been criticised for lavish spending since 1989 when it bought Columbia and
TriStar Pictures and formed Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) as a new
combined Hollywood studio.
But the amount seems less outlandish given the extent to which SPE's
operating profit will this year help to offset declining profits from Sony's
core consumer electronics business, which has been severely affected by the
global recession. In the quarter to December 31, the Sony group reported a
62 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, to Dollars 405m.
Wall Street's judgment on Sony's Hollywood acquisition has revolved around
three issues - the financial logic of the deal, the degree to which
much-vaunted synergies, or interdependence, could be achieved between the
hardware (consumer electronics) and software (film) sides of the group, and
the ability of Sony to rebuild the Columbia and TriStar studios, which were
battered three years ago by low morale, weak management and a lack of
box-office hits.
After the takeover, industry critics added up Sony's costs in buying CBS
Records in 1988, its Hollywood acquisition and subsequent studio
investments, and concluded that once debt-servicing expenses were deducted
the return on investment would be low. They suggested that it would be at
least five years before Sony would reap benefits from its Hollywood
adventure.
The group's Dollars 7.9bn of entertainment investments included: Dollars 2bn
on buying CBS Records, and Dollars 3.4bn on the Hollywood studios, which
came with Dollars 1.5bn of debt. Sony then injected a further Dollars 1bn of
capital to rebuild the studios and to acquire the film production company
owned by Mr Peter Guber, who became chairman of SPE.
These days the Tokyo-based owners of SPE may be forgiven for smiling at some
of the Wall Street sceptics. In the financial year that will end next
Wednesday the entertainment side of Sony (films, television, music and
electronic publishing) is likely to provide nearly Dollars 900m of operating
profits before depreciation and debt servicing, or about 45 per cent of the
group's worldwide total.
The figures indicate that Sony's entertainment operations appear to be
bailing out its core consumer electronics business. What is more, the
non-electronics side is producing an annual return on investment of about 11
per cent at the operating level, compared with 6 per cent at the end of
Sony's first year in Hollywood.
Mr David Londoner, an entertainment analyst at Wertheim Schroder, the New
York investment bank, says Wall Street's first impression of Sony's
Hollywood acquisition 'was that they overpaid for a company that was limping
along'. The new perception, he adds, 'is that they have gone a long way
toward making a respectable return on investment'.
When it comes to synergy, Mr Guber says: 'What we are really talking about
is a mutuality of interests in products and marketing between the
entertainment and the electronics businesses'. No one in Tokyo, he explains,
'is telling us to synergise'. Instead the aim is to seek ways of marrying
the technology resources on the electronics side of Sony with the
entertainment side in Hollywood, he says. The Schwarzenegger film is merely
the most graphic example of how the two sides of Sony could work together.
The film, released by Columbia Pictures, will be accompanied by a soundtrack
manufactured by Sony Music. Cinemas showing the film will use the Sony-made
digital sound systems that claim to represent a technology advance beyond
Dolby sound systems. Sony will also sell electronic video games based on the
film that will work on Sony products.
Some cinemas will also introduce 'virtual reality' games made by Sony and
based on the movie. Finally, there are plans for the joint marketing of Sony
television sets and VCRs and the film, with electronic shops across the
country showing extracts from the film on Sony products.
The degree to which hardware-software links can produce significant revenues
still remains to be proved, but a senior Sony executive in the US admits
that in profit terms 'over the past year the software has been carrying the
hardware'.
The man most responsible for the turnround is Mr Guber. He presides over two
studios, Dollars 3bn of annual revenues, 20 per cent of total US box-office
market share and a budget of about Dollars 600m for more than 20 movies a
year.
In the financial year now ending, SPE is estimated to have made an operating
profit of more than Dollars 300m from its film and television productions
and cinema chain subsidiaries. That is 22 per cent better than the previous
year and double the profit level of 1989-90, when Sony first bought into
Hollywood. However, despite the improvement, the return on Sony's total
investment of Dollars 4.4bn is just 7 per cent and still short of the return
made on the much cheaper music business.
At Wertheim Schroder, Mr Londoner stresses that SPE still has more work to
do to reach the operating profit levels of studios like Warner and Disney,
both of which earn more than Dollars 400m a year.
In New York, Mr Guber's boss, Mr Mickey Schulhof, the vice-chairman of Sony
USA, the US subsidiary which controls SPE, agrees that Warner and Disney
earn more, but stresses that with a 20 per cent market share, SPE is now
among the top three Hollywood studios. He adds that it is not unreasonable
to expect the entertainment side to achieve a 15 per cent return on
investment within the next couple of years.
Mr Guber used much of the estimated Dollars 1bn of fresh capital over the
past three years to rebuild the two studios, taking on staff and forging
deals with directors and producers. That has meant producing flagship films,
such as last year's Hook, based on the Peter Pan fairytale, which have not
reaped critical praise but which have been box-office hits and helped to
renew confidence in the studios among cinema chains and distributors.
Another top priority was the studio's television division, which last year
generated operating profits of Dollars 175m (see chart), equal to the film
side. The business was restructured, and while its profits will dip next
year because of a cyclical reduction in its earnings from programme
syndication, it is now being expanded internationally. Mr Mel Harris, the
new head of the TV division, is exploring co-production deals with RTL in
Germany and the Berlusconi group in Italy.
Globalisation is as much a buzzword at SPE as it is elsewhere in corporate
America, and Mr Guber says he is increasingly sensitive to non-US markets,
which provide about half of all box-office proceeds. 'We feel the impact
here when England is not doing well and Germany is slipping into recession.'
Mr Guber's senior aides, and especially Mr Jonathan Dolgen, president of the
motion picture division, say they are working hard to trim costs where
possible. 'The cost side has to be managed, but in a way that is not
intrusive into the creative side. No one is going to cut production or
marketing costs in half, but we can make and market some pictures for 5 per
cent less,' Mr Dolgen explains.
Cost-cutting is evident on a visit to the back lots and executive suites of
Sony Pictures. Shooting schedules have been tightened, and editing and
marketing costs have been trimmed. Morale is higher than it was a year ago,
the result of the rebuilding programme, tighter management and box-office
success. It also reflects the growing awareness that Hollywood is bolstering
its Sony parent company back in Tokyo for the first time since the Japanese
entered the business. As one studio executive put it: 'It's nice to feel
that we're needed.'

FT  24 MAR 93 / Letter: Tailored aid to Russia crucial to success of
transition process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr CHRIS DOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The present situation of the Russian reformers holding a plebiscite
could, if the outcome endorses Mr Yeltsin, result in a considerable increase
in presidential power. A strengthening of the power of the presidential
office has attractions in the present climate but carries the risk of a
military-backed dictatorship if opponents seek to overthrow Mr Yeltsin.
While the strengthening of the presidential office seems the most compelling
short-term remedy to restore the momentum of the Russian reform programme it
is a view that must be held with trepidation because it raises the spectre
of a militarily mismanaged economy. On the other hand, without increased
presidential powers the Russian Federation is likely to disintegrate and
civil disturbances proliferate as the reform programme collapses and
regional differences accelerate; the latter would have global implications.
Confronted with the possibility of political repression and global adverse
consequences the west faces a serious dilemma vis-a-vis its political
support and assistance programmes ('The choice over Russia', March 17). It
has been argued by some, such as presidents Clinton and Mitterrand ('US and
France seek early G7 talks', March 10), that by speedily increasing aid it
will result in support for the reformers. However, increasing short-term
western aid may exacerbate problems, as it is likely to be poorly targeted,
and being a panic like measure it could serve to strengthen the position of
those opposed to Mr Yeltsin who will seize on it as further proof of
Russia's decline under Mr Yeltsin.
The resolution to the problems of Russian transition will rest largely on
internal politics and for this reason short-term financial measures designed
to influence the outcome of the forthcoming plebiscite will at best play a
marginal role. Nevertheless, carefully tailored support of the kind
suggested by Professor Nuti (Letters, March 23) will be crucial in ensuring
the success of transition in Russia.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK SCHEINBAUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Those of us who have reached the magical age of 45 might be intrigued
by one aspect of Diane Summers and Catherine Milton's article 'On the Shelf
at 45' (Management, May 19). The authors remind us that 'Ageism is against
the law in the US - but unlike racism and sexism it is not outlawed in job
selection in the UK.' There is no requirement that your newspaper perpetrate
the de facto although not de jure inequities in appointments advertising in
the FT.
I often wonder about the age of the editors and sub-editors who glance
through the myriad notices in your paper and read phrases such as 'the ideal
candidate will be 26 to 35 years of age'. I work with 70-year-olds who have
the vitality and vision of any starry-eyed young executive you would want to
meet. I have worked with 30-year-olds who are stodgy fossils dragging down
an organisation.
The place to begin ending the stereotypes is in your own advertisements.

Sir, I would like to comment on your article, 'On the shelf at 45'. My
company employs 19 personnel, average age 51, average service 13 years. Sick
leave is negligible and staff turnover less than 10 per cent a year,
including retirements. Any staff turnover we have suffered has tended to be
among the young and this has not been due to any lack of affinity with their
aged colleagues. We are proud of our team.
It is ironic that you should quote a representative of the financial
services industry where the turnover of personnel is among the highest. My
fond hope is that the Office of Fair Trading recommendations for the life
industry are fully implemented.
The young may be bright, dynamic and so forth but they lack one thing -
wisdom.

FT  24 MAR 93 / A race against time: The west must help Russia before it is
too late
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The west should by now have learnt the lesson, in other parts of the world,
that it is dangerous to go on supporting a foreign leader because his
policies fit in with our own interests, or even because he claims his
sympathy with our values, if he lacks the support of his own people and
therefore cannot apply those values in his domestic policy.'
I said this two years ago when I argued that it was a mistake for the west
to go on supporting Mr Mikhail Gorbachev when he was clearly far less
popular than Mr Boris Yeltsin, and was increasingly resorting to
authoritarian methods.
Does the same logic apply to Mr Yeltsin now? I think not. We do not know
whether the Russian president is now less popular than the parliamentarians
he is confronting, but at least, by holding a referendum, he is trying to
give us a chance to find out. Meanwhile, his democratic credentials are
better than theirs: he was elected more recently, and by a direct popular
vote. Many of the parliamentarians were chosen under the old Soviet system,
which gave seats to organisations, usually communist-controlled, as well as
to territorial constituencies.
Politically, Mr Gorbachev in early 1991 was delaying economic reform and
trying to hold the Soviet Union together, and to do so was relying more and
more on neo-Stalinist conservatives in the party, the KGB and the armed
forces. During this past winter Mr Yeltsin too seemed unduly willing to
compromise with opponents of reform. But now he has grasped the nettle he
deserves support.
That said, support should never be given unconditionally. What must concern
us is not the man in charge but his policies, and his ability to implement
them. The west's interest, as well as that of Russians themselves, clearly
lies in the successful conversion of the Russian economy to market
principles, so that it can engage intensively in exchanging goods and
services with the rest of the world; and in the development of an open
society so that the exchange of ideas and information can be mutual too.
In the long run both these things, and especially the latter, must involve
some kind of pluralist democracy. Whether they can be reached by a purely
democratic road is less certain. We may have to accept that some corners
will be cut, so long as the overall direction of change is clear.
But does it make any difference what we think? Can we, in fact, 'help'
Yeltsin, however much we want to? May it not be that, the more audibly and
visibly he is backed by the west, the more he will be hated by Russians, who
will see him simply as the west's chosen instrument for imposing its own
social and political system on them, at the price of terrible hardships, and
for obtaining Russian compliance with western geopolitical interests?
Clearly there are Russians who see things that way. Some see proposed
foreign investment in the Russian oil and gas industry as simply an effort
by greedy foreign capitalists to get their hands on Russia's natural
resources. But people who think like that will not be won over by a western
hands-off policy. On the contrary, such a policy would confirm many Russians
in their growing conviction that the reforms are an illusion, doomed to
certain failure.
It is late in the day, but what could still help the cause of reform would
be a spectacular demonstration of the west's commitment to it, done in ways
that can be seen to make a tangible difference in a matter of months.
Debt relief is essential, because if Russia has to service its debts in full
it will have nothing left to spend on domestic programmes, but it is not
enough. People will not be grateful for debt relief, because they will not
believe that without it they would be even worse off than they already are.
Debt relief aside, it is not a matter of handing over cash to Mr Yeltsin or
his government. But western governments should be prepared to put their own
resources at risk by providing guarantees to private investors. And, while
insisting that the Russian central bank stops printing money to keep
state-owned companies afloat, western governments must be prepared to help
put in place a social safety-net for those thrown out of work as a
consequence.
To attempt this for the whole of Russia may be too ambitious, but at least
it could be targeted at those towns and districts whose entire population -
sometimes hundreds of thousands of people - depends on military production.
Similarly, there should be a fund to provide housing for Russian
professional soldiers (mainly officers) displaced by withdrawal from former
Soviet republics or Warsaw Pact members.
A big effort is also needed - it seems too obvious to need saying - to
improve the safety of Russia's civilian nuclear facilities.
These and other items will cost money, but nowhere near as much as we shall
end up spending if we have again to defend ourselves against a closed,
resentful and revanchist post-Yeltsin regime. In fact, one virtue of the
collapse of the rouble is that every US dollar represents a small fortune in
terms of Russian living-standards. What matters is that the money should be
visible, clearly targeted, and that the various programmes should be
properly co-ordinated.
At present, western aid programmes are a bureaucratic tangle rivalling that
of Russia itself. The Group of Seven countries should set up a single office
to co-ordinate all these efforts, headed by a political figure able to cut
through bureaucracies, and one in whom ordinary Russians would have some
confidence.
Why not Baroness Thatcher?

Sir, Mr Julian Smith's example (Letters, March 19) of the ludicrous results
possible under the German system of proportional representation should not
blind anyone to the obvious merits of the single transferrable vote.
This preserves constituencies and ensures that the most popular candidate
wins the seat. It is happily accepted and works well in the Oxford and

FT  24 MAR 93 / Letter: Treasury only tinkering at edges of problems facing
pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL DUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to the letter, 'Widely differing views on long-term effect of
Budget measures on cost of pensions' (March 20).
The effect on pensions of the various Budget measures (tax credits, income
cap, and VAT on fuel) should not be the main point of concern. What should
be is that pensions policy is being decided as a by-product of Treasury
mathematics.
Tony Cairns' last point touched on this. It is well known that there are
fundamental long-term problems in pension provision arising from changing
demographics.
It is time that these problems were solved with with a coherent plan. That
is why it is so worrying to see the Treasury tinkering at the edges; it
appears that the government has no intention of devising such a coherent
plan.
Perhaps, even worse, it has forgotten that there is a problem.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Arts: Mariss Jansons and the LPO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beyond doubt, the revelation of Sunday's London Philharmonic concert with
Mariss Jansons - its principal guest conductor, new this season - was a
Shostakovich song-cycle, one of his last and bitterest works. He composed
the Six Poems of Marina Tsvetayeva, op. 143a, in 1973 for contralto and
piano; the next year he orchestrated them, strangely and sparsely, and in
1975 he died. Until Sunday I had never heard them in the concert-hall. One
would be lucky to hear them delivered with more searching eloquence than
they were here, by the Dutch mezzo Jard van Nes.
Tsvetayeva had been forced into exile from Russia for much of her life. She
returned there with her family in the late 1930s, but soon lost her husband
and daughter to state repression, and killed herself. Of the poems
Shostakovich chose for his song-cycle, he set the first as a defiant hymn to
the durability of poetry and the last - a rapturous eulogy of her friend and
fellow-poet Anna Akhmatova - as a grand expansion of the same message.
In between come an erotic idyll dedicated to Osip Mandelstam, Tsvetayeva's
onetime lover; a 'Hamlet'-study in stricken conscience - always an anxious
concern of this composer; and a pair of sour elegies on the death of Pushkin
and the belated, hypocritical honours granted to him by Tsar Nicholas I.
Just as Schoenberg's Ode to Napoleon used Byron's satirical diatribe to
excoriate Hitler, so Shostakovich made the philistine Tsar a dummy for the
monstrous Stalin, and the unlucky Pushkin a stand-in for Tsvetayeva herself.
Miss van Nes was superlatively forceful with all that. Never strident, but
humanely angry, and still proud. Though I cannot vouch for how a native
speaker might react to her Russian diction, she wielded it here to scathing
musico-dramatic purpose. In perfect sympathy Jansons called up as required
his divisi strings, his minatory pair of horns, the irruptions of xylophone,
chimes and celesta - always well balanced and well paced, always to
penetrating effect.
Earlier, the LPO strings on their own were svelte and acutely appreciative
in Schoenberg's plushy expansion of his Verklarte Nacht sextet. To my ears,
which recently heard the Arditti Quartet and friends sear their way through
the original chamber version, the collective arrangement never sounds so
febrile and poignant. Still, Jansons found a rich scale of gradations for
the riper string-writing, and faultless control. As for Strauss's Also
sprach Zarathustra, he drew finely modelled playing from the LPO, vivid but
not garish.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Arts: Two American sopranos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the remarkable dominance of American sopranos at the moment it is
hardly any surprise to see three in London on the same weekend. On Friday
Kathleen Battle appeared in the Queen Elizabeth Hall's International Song
Recital series, where Carol Vaness was to be found in the audience, and
three days later Barbara Hendricks gave a recital of her own at the Wigmore
Hall.
For Miss Battle, the occasion marked the start of a European tour to four
other capitals and Birmingham (March 26). No doubt she is wise enough to
pick her recital halls carefully. The voice is perfectly formed, light as a
meringue, sweet as one as well, but very small. Roger Vignoles worked minor
marvels finding all sorts of delicately different varieties of quiet playing
at the piano.
He is a gentleman accompanist; there was not a moment when the singer was
upstaged, although on that score one imagines so wily a Zerbinetta can look
after herself.
She flitted like a butterfly across the lightest songs of the romantic era,
from Schumann's roses and snowdrops, to Strauss's 'Standchen' and
'Wiegenlied'. All were exquisite sugar-coated bonbons which only
occasionally suggested they might have a hard centre.
The surprise came when it was least expected. A selection of songs from
Andre Previn's Honey and Rue looked as though it was promising a popularist
ending, but this new cycle, composed for Kathleen Battle last year, is an
important addition to the song repertoire, jazz-based perhaps, with a touch
of the blues to end, but the sort of serious popular American music that
Bernstein used to do so well. Battle sang marvellously in it, giving Toni
Morrison's poetry a real presence, and the whole recital gained enormously
from its inclusion.
Barbara Hendricks, another light-voiced American with the art to make her
little go a very long way, sang Schubert and Wolf in the first half of
Monday's Wigmore recital and melodies in the second. In all of it, very
little was less than delicately turned and finely finished; in spite of
that, the artistic temperature only began to warm up once German was
exchanged for the French. The soprano does all the right things in her
Lieder - she was limpid in Schubert's 'Liebesbotschaft', steady in his
'Nacht und Traume', and notably skilful with notes, dynamics and colouristic
effects in Wolf's 'Ganymed' and 'Kennst du das Land?' - but on a strangely
small scale, and at a puzzling emotional remove from the words and their
suggestive shadings.
Singing in French does something wonderful to this singer's communicative
address. It is not so much that she utters the language with more decisive
emphasis, but rather that it lies on her bright, sweetly vibrant tones with
winning grace. Miss Hendricks and her pianist, the alert, sensitive (though
sometimes rather impulsive) Staffan Scheja, moulded Faure's Bonne Chanson
cycle as though well aware that it is one of the shining masterpieces of the
song literature  - but, at the same time, with the deftness and security of
taste not to insist vulgarly on the point.
Taste, indeed, is Miss Hendricks's strong point: she can take a group of six
melodies (two each by Chausson, Gounod and Bizet) and distil the charm of
each with the minimum of fuss or show. Hard to imagine anything more
precisely controlled or exquisite than the account of Bizet's 'Adieu de
l'Hotesse arabe' with which she closed the recital: cool, warm, exotic and
tenderly tactful, all at one go.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Arts: Quartermaine's Terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you seen The Edward Fox Performance? Observed once, it is very
interesting and rather touching. It embodies a classy English eccentric of
terminal affability. He exists in a cocoon apart from everyday communication
and ordinary life. Every main vowel is drawled into a complex diphthong
('upside dahn,' 'smairshing'.) The way he adjusts from one tilting stance to
another is deployed for maximum effect. Each of the half-dozen chief facial
expressions is held for a minimum of five seconds, then contrasted with
another. The mouth, in particular, goes through a range of gaping positions
 -as if posing for Munch.
If he chooses his repertory carefully, he might go on giving this
performance ad infinitum. Alas, the signs are that he intends to do so.
Returning to Simon Gray's Quartermaine's Terms, in whose 1981 West End
premiere and subsequent TV production he enjoyed success, he gives not only
the same performance he did in '81 but also the same as in The
Philanthropist in the West End in 1991 (and before that at Chichester), and
much the same as when he played Higgins in the tour of My Fair Lady last
year.
The first time around, Fox's performance is an icon of Englishness as
marvellous as a Beefeater or a bowler hat. (And the deep furrow down each
cheek is so fascinating that you want it hung in the Tate.) The more you
watch, however, the less there is to see. The same goes, I am sorry to say,
for Quartermaine's Terms. This revival is staged by Kevin Billington, who
directed the tour of the original production; and the cast includes another
actor from the original production and another from the TV version. Almost
everyone gives a flawless performance. Flawless except that the whole affair
now seems too pat, too formulaic.
The trick of Quartermaine's Terms is that it applies farce methods to
produce a comic surface over a situation which continually becomes more and
more pathetic. The situation is a staff room and the lives of its seven
staff members. One running joke is the accident-prone new teacher; another
is the mistakes people make over his name or the title of the play currently
on at the local theatre; another is Quartermaine's mindless
hail-fellow-well-met dazed charm. Others teachers have personal crises and
change from scene to scene. Quartermaine, who alone never changes and
undergoes no crisis, is in fact the most pathetic character of all.
Quartermaine is one of those uncommunicative types who recur in English
literature and drama, from Evelyn Waugh to Harold Pinter, and his apparent
stalemate (actually a helpless decline and fall) is, of course, a deliberate
portrait of English decline in general. Simon Gray handles it all very
entertainingly, but the formula is not a rewarding one to reexamine. In this
revival, Clive Francis, James Grout, Sarah Badel and Lucy Scott contribute
excellent pieces English character acting. Best of all is Peter Barkworth as
Eddie Loomis, the school's fussy, pedantic, and increasingly decrepit
director. His every detail is eloquent, like the way he leans sideways
suspiciously before saying 'Oh good'.
At the Richmond Theatre until March 27

The popular perception of William Cody stems almost entirely from his famous
Wild West Show which, for 30 years around the turn of the century, brought
cowboys and indians to the cities of Europe. Timewatch (8.10, BBC2) digs out
rare film footage and talks to some who knew Cody to re-evaluate the story
of the man who was better known as Buffalo Bill. Joan Shenton who, via her
Channel 4 programmes, has done more than anyone to undermine the dogma of
the Aids fanatics, continues her work today in Dispatches (9.00). Goggle
Eyes, described as a 4-part comedy drama, is adapted from Anne Fine's award
winning novel about a one-parent family. Mother Rosie falls for an older
'rather conventional' man with glasses and the resultant mayhem is seen
through the eyes of 12-year-old Kitty, played by the wonderfully named
Honeysuckle Weeks (9.25 BBC2). With the incidence of skin cancer rising
rapidly, QED investigates the causes: sunbathing and the thinning of the
ozone layer (9.30 BBC1). BBC2 begins a new comedy written by the creator of
Rab Nesbitt: I, Lovett. The central character is an eccentric inventor
(10.05).

FT  24 MAR 93 / Arts: More embarrassing questions, please - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Billions of pounds are spent on Aids, television personalities jump eagerly
on the bandwagon (did anybody at the BAFTA Awards have the courage to defy
the herd and leave the 'Aids awareness ribbon' on the table?) and in the
whole of British television, it seems, there is just one woman willing to do
a journalist's proper job and keep on asking embarrassing questions. Tonight
in Dispatches on Channel 4 Joan Shenton does it again. She visits Africa and
dares to throw doubt on the central plank in the religious faith of those
who are determined that the disease shall be an equal threat to us all: she
asks whether the sub-Saharan 'pandemic' really exists.
Her answer is that it probably does not. It seems that many cases of Aids
are routinely diagnosed in Africa not from tests in the pathology lab (too
costly) but from medical observation. Fever, persistent cough and diarrhoea
are enough to get you listed as an Aids victim, though your real trouble may
be malaria or TB. Why should medical staff be so casual? Shenton points out
that Uganda, for example, can afford to spend less than a dollar a head on
annual health care and just Dollars 57,000 a year on malaria prevention
while foreign agencies are now pouring in Dollars 6m in Aids funding. Anyone
who watches tonight's programme after seeing the recent pair in BBC2's
Assignment on malaria and Aids in the far east will surely conclude that we
need another Jonathan Swift to illustrate this problem. As well-meaning
hysterics in the first world dash from one television studio to another
demonstrating how to put a condom on your finger, people in the third world
continue to die not in their thousands but in their millions . . . from
malaria.
There has surely never been a programme on television more ponderous than
the BAFTA Awards on BBC1 on Sunday. Why do we need Griff Rhys Jones to
introduce Mel Smith to introduce Amanda Donohoe to introduce the winner of
the award for Best Supporting Actress? The BBC's own recognition of the
ghastliness of these evenings was proved on the previous day by BBC2's
screening of the BOFTY (Bore Of The Year) Awards. The trouble is that the
real thing is beyond parody; the spoof was itself a pretty tedious occasion.
The only interesting awards night this month has been The British Television
Advertising Awards on ITV. For an hour Alastair Stewart stood in front of
the prize ceremony and introduced interviews with those who make commercials
 -Ridley and Tony Scott, for example - and bits of film showing how they do
it. The 'how to throw a car out of an aeroplane' routine was wholly
engrossing, and the programme was made enjoyable because we were never
subjected to the actual presentations. Given that the clips are the real
attraction, perhaps that is the answer.
ITV's high-class sentimental romance on Mondays, September Song, benefits
from much the same trick as Dad's Army. In the comedy, role reversal in the
casting created extraordinary strengths: instead of the languid public
school type, John le Mesurier, playing the officer while Arthur Lowe, with
all the necessary stereotyped characteristics, took the NCO, the tables were
turned to wonderful effect. In September Song you might expect professional
comedian Russ Abott to play the ageing stand-up comic Billy Balsam while RSC
actor Michael Williams played the middle aged school teacher who loses his
wife. Once again the reversal has succeeded: Williams turns out to be a
splendid stand up comedian and Abbot a highly professional straight actor.
It is time the BBC stopped describing Carla Lane's work as 'comedy'. Her
idiosyncratic view of life gives great strength to her writing, but since
Butterflies in 1978 little of her material - Bread was an exception - has
been consistently funny enough to be categorised with such series as Drop
The Dead Donkey (which supplied much the best TV awards ceremony of the
week) and Red Dwarf as situation comedy. Her new series, Luv, on BBC1 on
Tuesdays has, as ever, whimsical situations such as the wife's attempts to
get a divorce without telling her husband for fear of offending him, and
unusual characters such as Darwin, one of the adopted children, who sleeps
all day in order to have his nights free to release rabbits from
laboratories. But you would not describe Hamlet as a comedy, despite the
inclusion of the gravediggers and some funny lines, and Luv is, once again,
closer to situation tragedy.
Having taped last week's Without Walls I read the reviews of Camille
Paglia's essay on the Princess of Wales, 'Diana Unclothed', before watching
it. Judging from those what I had in store was a farrago of psycho-babble
and feminist bile. What I actually found was a somewhat chaotic and
confusingly gabbled analysis of the princess as photographic icon which,
however, included two debatable but fascinating assertions: that she
combines motherhood and sexuality in a way that has scarcely been seen since
the goddesses of antiquity; and that she has achieved world fame without
uttering a single memorable word so that we might regard her as the last of
the silent film stars. It is true that Paglia's language can be opaque with
jargon (she says 'auto-eroticism' when the context suggests she means
eroticism, talks repeatedly of the princess's virginity which seems plain
daft, and so on) yet there is a lot of thought behind what she says, much of
it original. It seems significant that, once again, it is Channel 4's
culture magazine which carried the provocative item.
We are told repeatedly that the new director-general, John Birt, intends
that the BBC will give more attention to programme quality and
distinctiveness. These are admirable aims, but when do we start seeing the
evidence on screen? At present we keep on getting new series such as BBC1's
Entertainment Express which looks like nothing so much as a television
version of the showbiz gossip page from a pop paper, and BBC2's Soundbites
in which the pretty presenter introduces snippets of music even shorter than
those on Classic FM and then frequently talks across the music, like a DJ on
the worst sort of commercial pop network. Surely the intention is not to be
distinctively awful?
The best parts of Dennis Potter's Lipstick On Your Collar are the set-piece
mimes where the stuffy desk wallahs from the War Office lip-synch to some
magnificently inappropriate hit from the 1950s such as 'Blue Suede Shoes' or
(funniest of the lot so far) 'I See The Moon'. There is so much in this
production which is memorable (Roy Hudd's performance as the crazed cinema
organist Harold Atterbow) or new (the unknown Louise Germaine in an
astonishingly polished performance as the tart/goddess Sylvia) or eerily
accurate (the entire fifties' ethos) that it seems unfair to complain. But
we have learned to expect a lot from Potter and while this is, of course,
better than any other drama on television at present, it does seem
uncharacteristically slow, at times even plodding, a word you might have
thought would never be applied to Potter. Could it be that he is now so
eminent and putting so much detail into his scripts (this one has been
published as a Faber paperback, Pounds 8.99) that the power of the director,
in this case Renny Rye, is damagingly circumscribed? Take out all the
slow-motion activity, cut the running time by about a third, and it would
surely be improved.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Arts: Jackie Mason - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone should see Jackie Mason at least once, even Gentiles. The ex-Rabbi
from Brooklyn has an indefatigable zest that makes it hard for him to know
when to stop. Unless Jews really are different from other people, however,
even they might begin to see through the formula.
Mason has a marvellous talent for persuading an audience that he is up with
the latest news, whatever country he is in. On a previous visit, London was
in the throes of the salmonella crisis. 'This is the only country in the
world,' he remarked, 'where the sex is safer than the food.'
This time he seems to be equally up with the Maastricht Treaty and has fun
about people claiming to understand it when plainly they do not. Any attempt
at explanations ends in one of his many raspberries. That is in the first
half and you go away to the interval thinking how clever he is.
The trouble is that in the second half he uses exactly the same technique on
Shakespeare. 'Everyone says he's the greatest writer who ever lived . . .
How can you tell if no-one can understand a word of what he said?' He quotes
a few Shakespeare lines to no particular effect: the result is bathos for
the technique has been exposed - Mason trades on headlines, not subtleties.
The show falls into two interspersed parts: one (about two thirds of it) is
heavily Jewish, the other about broadly contemporary events such as the
arrival of President Clinton and the marital failings in the British royal
family. The first is hard for Gentiles (as he keeps calling us) to judge,
except to say that the joke about prime minister Rabin wanting to give back
the West Bank, but he can't because it's in his wife's name, is quite funny,
and that a long story about why Jews steal towels from hotels is, well,
laborious. Surely all Jews can't be as awful, the men so timid, the women so
dominating, as he suggests. Yet maybe the largely Jewish audience, which
kept up a murmur of approval throughout, think otherwise.
Even the jokes pegged on Britain are largely about money and sex, picked up
from the newspapers. 'Do you believe he had an affair with the caterer?'
Mason throws in early on. Then on to the Duchess of York: 'You can't play

It sounds better than it reads, but still wears thin. It is a pity he does
not use talents more widely. He does a sparkling tour d'horizon of the

gibberish and an excellent exposure of Sinatra who never seems to finish a

FT  24 MAR 93 / Management: Going is good for Ladbroke 'riders'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ladbroke Retail Management Challenge could well be another name for the
3.30 at Haydock Park. It is, however, a competitive distance learning course
for 650 'riders' - betting shop managers, area managers and regional
controllers from Ladbroke Racing - which ended this week with the
announcement of the winner in London.
Pinnacle, as the initiative was dubbed, is intended to address the general
problem of motivating a far-flung management team. The game started six
months ago with two preliminary rounds in which participants had to draw up
a detailed business plan for their betting shop or area for the next
financial year, as well as ideas for better marketing and expansion.
The 'field' was whittled down to 60 for the semi-final (each had to make a
presentation to the Ladbroke sales director), and to eight for the final
(same again in front of a panel of judges).
Richard Carter, sales director of Ladbroke Racing, believes one reason for
Pinnacle's success is the way it combines fun with a serious purpose.
The early rounds - completed with the help of guidance notes from the centre
 -encouraged a better understanding of the profit and loss account and threw
up detailed local strategies for targeting customers and improving the
business mix in betting shops.
'There is a strong top-down as well as a bottom-up approach,' says David
Richards of co-sponsors Ernst &amp; Young. 'A lot of games like this are
abstract, but this one is relevant because participants have to deliver.'
Carter is toying with the idea of a further challenge which rates
participants on actual results. In the meantime, the eight finalists can
look forward to having their bonuses doubled and the winner to visiting
betting operations in California, Hong Kong and Berlin as part of a
round-the-world trip for two.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Management: Settling down to small talk - Xerox has
undergone sweeping organisational changes in its internal makeup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Xerox is at it again. The US document processing company, which became a
by-word in the 1980s for its adoption of cutting-edge management theories,
has been undergoing another big upheaval.
A year ago Paul Allaire, its chairman, unveiled a radical redesign of the
company's management structure, or what he calls its 'organisational
architecture', in an attempt to solve one of the central problems facing
large companies everywhere: how to retain the entrepreneurial flair and
flexibility of a small business.
'We are trying to get the benefits of a small company of quickness in time
to market, decision-making and the elimination of bureaucratic activities,'
he says, 'without losing any of the advantages of a big organisation.'
Xerox is hardly alone. US giants ranging from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
to General Electric have gone through wrenching organisational upheavals
over the past few years in pursuit of this 1990s Holy Grail.
And International Business Machines also unveiled a scheme similar to
Xerox's last year.
But Xerox offers some distinctive lessons, partly because of the revolution
it went through in the 1980s and partly because of the way it has approached
its make-over, seeking to change not just the outward architecture of the
company but its internal culture too.
Xerox invented the plain paper copier in 1959 and became one of the fastest
growing companies in the US.
But then a combination of complacency, anti-trust problems and executive
infighting allowed Japanese rivals to make large inroads in its market
share.
But the company fought back in the 1980s under the then chairman, David
Kearns, and became one the few US businesses to win back market share from
the Japanese. This was due in large measure to its embrace of total quality
management, which involves a business committing itself to the highest
quality in everything it does and making customer satisfaction its number
one goal.
But while total quality management can dramatically improve the performance
of a business, it is no guarantee of continued success.
Allaire, a 26-year veteran of Xerox who took over as chief executive in
1990, decided that the company needed a complete redesign of its structure.
However, he emphasises that his shake-up is not a break with the Kearns era,
but builds on the company's past quality achievements: 'If David had still
been here, we would probably have to do the same kinds of changes,' he says.
The re-design also owes much to Xerox's long-standing practice of
benchmarking, or comparing its organisation and performance with those of
other well-managed businesses.
Before implementing its reforms it took a close look at AT&amp;T, Corning and
Alcoa, which had previously introduced 'act small' restructurings.
Xerox was advised by David Nadler, a prominent management consultant, who
helped steer the company through its total quality transformation in 1980s
and who also acts as an adviser to AT&amp;T and Corning.
Its shake-up stems in large part from sweeping change in the office
equipment business, where digital technology, which allows images to be
captured electronically, is replacing traditional light-lens technology.
This means that the stand-alone copier is becoming part of the much larger
information technology business - a device which can form part of an
electronic information network and can incorporate a variety of additional
functions, including fax, full-colour printing and the scanning of documents
to put them in digital form.
That, in turn, is likely to bring new competitors into the industry from the
computer field and force out some of the less efficient traditional copier
manufacturers.
Allaire insists that for Xerox this is much more an opportunity than a
threat. But it means the company needs to be more responsive to changing
customer needs and keep on the leading edge of technology, and he believes
its old structure was ill-equipped for this.
The document processing business, with some Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9.8bn) in
annual sales, was organised as a classic monolithic company, divided into
departments such as sales and manufacturing and with a large central staff.
But this, he says, means that, 'people get too accustomed to sitting on
their hands and waiting for a decision to come down from above'.
Under the new system, Xerox consists of nine separate stand-alone
businesses, each organised around particular products and markets and each
with total responsibility for their profit and loss account.
Allaire likes to describe this as turning the traditional, vertically
organised business on its side: at one end, there is an integrated research
and development arm, which feeds ideas into the nine businesses.
These in turn supply products to a unified customer operations division,
which sells, installs and services equipment and is organised by geographic
region.
The sales force was not divided up among the nine businesses because Xerox
felt it important to keep a single face to the customer, and did not want to
run the risk of salespeople from different operations competing with each
other.
Wayland Hicks, executive president, operations, insists this arrangement has
not diluted the financial accountability of the nine operations. 'We have
broken up the financial system so the business heads have a clear idea of
what their sales costs are, and they work very closely with the operating
people.'
The new system also ties Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre (Parc) more
closely into the business. During the past 20 years, the Parc has made some
of the most important inventions in information technology, including the
personal computer and laser printer, but Xerox repeatedly failed to
capitalise commercially on its ideas, allowing rival companies to do so.
Sceptics still wonder whether the company will speed up its notorious
tardiness in bringing products to market. But Hicks says there is some early
evidence that the new structure is helping.
For example, two variants of one of its machines were recently brought to
market in a time 'unheard of under the previous organisation,' thanks to 'a
management team that saw a market-place need and was able to make and
implement decisions in a way which involved a lot fewer people and fewer
levels of the organisation'.
However, Allaire points out that changing the formal structure of an
organisation is the easiest part of architectural change. Two other vital
elements are harder to engineer: getting people with the right skills in the
right place and changing the organisation's 'software', its informal network
of relationships and culture.
Xerox discovered it had a dearth of general managers a few rungs down the
corporate hierarchy - just at the point where these were now critical to
success. Previously people at this level tended to be specialists, lacking
all-round management skills.
As for culture, Allaire was anxious for the new businesses to keep in mind
the needs of the group as a whole, since much of Xerox's strength comes from
its combined technological and global marketing abilities.
One important way of doing so was to change the pay system. The bonuses of
middle managers are now based on an arithmetic calculation which multiplies
the achievements of their part of the business with that of the group,
rather than just adding the components together. Multiplication makes the
group's performance far more critical to the size of the individual's bonus.
A year into the new world, Allaire says he's 'pleased with progress. We're
on track, though if you talk to a number of people they'd say it's tougher
to do than they thought.'
The company has also just announced plans to sell off its poorly performing
financial services businesses, which were acquired in the early 1980s to
shore up the copier business.
It is too early to say how much of a lift all these initiatives will give to
the company's financial performance, although Wall Street is reasonably
impressed by the shape of the business. Its product range is strong relative
to its rivals, and its 1992 results showed a 12 per cent increase in
document processing income, despite the weak global economy.
There is, however, no room for complacency. Xerox, says Allaire, will 'have
to change more in the next five years than we have in the past 10. We cannot
sit back on our laurels'.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Management: Time is still right to be flexible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession has put paid to much of the talk by employers of having to
evolve 'family friendly' policies in order to attract and retain staff. In
particular, the need to woo women back into the workforce is not the red-hot
issue it once was.
Nevertheless, a strong business case can still be made for employers to
examine the economics of providing subsidised childcare and allowing
flexible working hours, according to a report* published last week by
Opportunity 2000 and the Institute of Personnel Management.
For example, the potential cost of having to replace a junior manager
earning Pounds 15,000 a year totals Pounds 6,688, found the study. At the
same time, an annual employer subsidy for a workplace nursery for 40
children costs Pounds 62,359, or just over Pounds 1,500 per child.
The cost of sick leave and absenteeism for other reasons also has to be
costed out and balanced against the price of administering job-sharing and
flexible hours schemes, says the report.
Case studies show the gains to be made from providing benefits in practice.
Debenhams, the high street retailer, piloted Childcare Vouchers - which can
be swapped by the employee for childcare of their choice - at its store in
the Lakeside shopping centre in Essex. The store reported a 50 per cent rise
in the retention of employees working peak trading hours after the initial
year, compared with similar retailers in the shopping centre.

One member of the government's National Advisory Council for Education and
Training Targets, a high-powered committee unveiled last week, is Carol
Galley (right), one of the City's most successful female fund managers.
Galley, deputy chairman of Mercury Asset Management, points out that, given
her close involvement in investment decisions, it would be inappropriate for
her to sit on the board of a company. But she says she has agreed to work
for Nacett not only because she believes generally in the importance of
vocational training to the success of British industry but because of her
faith in the abilities of Peter Davis, chief executive of Reed Elsevier and
of Post Office chairman Michael Heron, the council's chairman and vice
chairman respectively.
'I have observed them in the corporate sector. If anyone has a chance of
making something like this work, it is these people,' she reckons.
She joined Warburg Investment Management as a librarian in 1971 straight
from university.

Sir John Quinton, the former chairman of Barclays Bank, has combined his
experience in lending with a return to his roots by becoming a non-executive
director of the Norwich and Peterborough Building Society. He was born in
Norwich and educated at Norwich School as well as going to university in
Cambridge.
Sir John, who retired as chairman of Barclays in December has since become
non-executive chairman of Wimpey. His experience at Barclays, which is
suffering from having made Pounds 2.3bn provisions against possible bad
debts last year after an expansion in property lending in the late 1980s, is
likely to come in useful at the Norwich and Peterborough Building Society.
The society is 21st in size in the UK and is among those affected by the
downturn in house prices in the southern housing market. It has placed
emphasis on diversification into services such as stock broking to increase
its commission income.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Poisoned chalice - A Japanese
gift of 35,000 litres of pesticide to Cambodia has caused uproar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET

<TEXT>
The brown plant-hopper, an insect pest which eats Asia's staple rice crops,
is playing a leading role in a drama about the future of Cambodian
agriculture, but it is not the true villain of the piece. If
environmentalists and scientists are to be believed, the villain is the
Japanese government.
Japan's decision to supply Cambodia with free pesticides has provoked sharp
criticism from environmental pressure groups and from officials of respected
bodies such as the International Rice Research Institute and the Food and
Agriculture Organisation.
Cambodia, after more than two decades of war, has no legislation or controls
on the use of pesticides. Nor do farmers or agriculture ministry officials
have much experience in handling chemicals.
The Japanese government is therefore suspected of donating the pesticides
not to help Cambodian farmers but to help the Japanese chemical industry
secure a new market for its products. These suspicions are fuelled by the
knowledge that Japan may eventually be forced by world trade negotiations to
open its rice market to foreign suppliers. Japanese farmers account for only
2.5 per cent of world rice production, but they are heavy buyers of
pesticides.
Although the amounts are small - Japan has shipped 35,000 litres of
diazinon, fenitrothion and fenvalerate worth Y100m (Pounds 592,000) to
Cambodia as part of a Y500m 'food production increase grant' - many aid
workers believe the gift sets a poor precedent for a country struggling to
develop its agriculture.
The objections arise because evidence from Indonesia, Thailand (see graph)
and elsewhere shows that broad spectrum insecticides such as the three
donated by Japan, far from reducing the number of pests, actually worsen
pest infestation in tropical rice. That is because the insecticides kill not
only the insect pests but also predators, such as spiders, which normally
eat the pests. Pest populations often recover more quickly than the
predators.
Adult brown plant-hoppers, for example, may be exterminated in a field by
chemical spray, but only after laying their eggs safely inside the rice
plants. When they hatch, the young pests breed rapidly and their population
explodes in the absence of predators. All three insecticides donated by
Japan are now banned for use on rice in Indonesia.
'Every other country that has had massive use of pesticides has created
their own problems,' says Gregory Woodsworth, a Canadian environmental
planner based in Phnom Penh. 'To date Cambodia has not had any severe pest
attacks. If they start using these pesticides they sure as hell will.'
Critics of the Japanese aid are concerned not only about the agricultural
implications but also the effects of the pesticides on humans and fish.
Diazinon and fenitrothion are organophosphates which disrupt the nervous
system and are dangerous to humans. Protective clothing should be worn by
anyone applying such pesticides, but even if they were available, they would
be impractical in Cambodia's stiflingly hot climate.
'A human being can't apply it in any way that's practical in the tropics,'
says Peter Kenmore, an expert on the control of pests in Asian rice at the
FAO in Manila. 'Organophosphates cannot be applied safely by small farmers
in tropical conditions.'
All three chemicals donated by Japan are in some measure toxic to fish and
crabs, which live in rice fields and nearby ponds in Cambodia and account
for much of the protein consumed by villagers.
Japan's response to the uproar over its gift has done little to allay the
fears or suspicions about the pesticides.
Japanese diplomats say seminars have been arranged to teach Cambodians how
to use the chemicals, which will, in any case, only be sufficient to treat
some 40,000 hectares of the country's 2m ha of farmland.
Toru Imamura, the first secretary responsible for aid at the Japanese
mission in Phnom Penh, described the protest campaign as 'very politically
oriented' and said that he thought the protestors were 'over-reacting'.
He acknowledged, however, that Japan was not providing any protective
clothing, although it was donating the machines to spray the insecticides.
Japan insists the distribution and safe handling of the pesticides is the
responsibility of the Cambodian agriculture ministry, a stand which appears
to take no account of the fact that the ministry's headquarters are barely
functioning; the ministry is part of a corrupt, financially crippled and
moribund government that is likely to lose some or all of its power in the
UN-sponsored elections in May.
The Japanese diplomatic mission also points out that the former Soviet Union
and its allies sent pesticides to Cambodia in the past, and the mission can
produce a list of 56 pesticides available in the country in 1989 to prove
it.
Japan - by no means the first aid donor to have given something apparently
unnecessary or harmful to a recipient country - says it is fully aware of
environmental concerns and has reduced both the quantity and the range of
pesticides originally earmarked for Cambodia.
But neither the decision to reduce the amount nor the justification that the
Russians sent pesticides in the past adequately explain why the Japanese
pesticides are being sent, when there is so much evidence against them,
particularly in the absence of any detailed research into their probable
impact on Cambodia.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: America reaches the bottom of
the barrel - Worldwide water / Efforts at conservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY Californians had already made up their minds, but after one more big
snowstorm over the Sierra Nevada at the end of February, Governor Pete
Wilson made it official: the state's six-year drought is finally over.
The latest blizzard left snow equivalent to an estimated 44m acre feet of
water; only the Columbia and upper Missouri basins are still dry. But the
end of the drought seems unlikely to halt a significant change in water
policy, particularly in the west, where for 90 years government engineering
works have wrestled the region's rivers out of their beds to bring water to
city pipes or - accounting for 80-90 per cent of water use in the west -
farm irrigation.
Even without the drought, the west was coming to the bottom of the barrel in
its search for new rivers to dam and divert; there will be no more Hoover
dams. 'The big projects may return about the same time as dinosaurs come
back to earth. We can't afford them, and there is no place to put them,'
says David Getches, a specialist in water law at the University of Colorado
School of Law.
Now, more attention is being paid to in-stream uses - fisheries, recreation
and the preservation of ecosystems. 'The challenge is that most of the water
is already allocated under a system that did not recognise the value of
these in-stream uses,' says Craig Bell, executive director of the Western
States Water Council, which groups representatives from the governments of
each state.
Indian nations, too, are claiming their water rights under the terms of
their treaties with the US. Wyoming's supreme court recently awarded nearly
half the water from the Bighorn river to the Shoshone and Arapaho.
Recently, there have been notable examples of re-allocation. Dams in the
Pacific north-west must now control their outflows in the interests of the
local salmon species which their construction put in peril, while the Glen
Canyon dam, on the Colorado River, has been forced to stop the water
releases that were eroding the beaches of the Grand Canyon.
The Central Valley Project, California's largest water delivery system, last
month announced it would allow nearly a fifth of its throughput, some
600,000 acre feet, to flow straight into the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta to
help restore the habitat of such species as the endangered delta smelt -
even though this leaves farmers in the San Joaquin valley, the project's
biggest beneficiaries, with barely a quarter of the water they requested.
This reassessment is not confined to the west. The Kissimmee river in
Florida, which the Army Corps of Engineers spent millions of dollars
canalising in the 1960s, will now be restored to its natural state at the
cost of further millions in order to save the wetlands around Lake
Okeechobee, at the northern end of the Everglades.
Rivers are not the only source of water, but states such as Arizona are
pumping groundwater at unsustainable rates, and excessive pumping has caused
widespread land subsidence in states as far apart as California and Florida.
Efforts to conserve water, meanwhile, have gained momentum, especially in
the west, and are expected to continue despite the formal end to this
drought.
The average water bill in Los Angeles has doubled in the past six years, and
the Metropolitan Water District, southern California's biggest supplier,
plans a further 22 per cent price rise this year. Many cities have adopted
new, water-saving construction requirements such as smaller toilet cisterns
or low-flow showers, and some local governments allow the use of 'grey'
water, which has been used once for something relatively clean, such as
bathwater, to be used for other purposes - flushing toilets or watering
lawns.
At the same time, the beginnings of a market in water are starting to
emerge. California and Idaho now have water banks run by the state. Some
deals, for instance between Los Angeles and the Imperial Valley system, have
built on the principles of conservation, with farmers agreeing to adopt more
economical irrigation methods or to grow less water-intensive crops in order
to free water to be sold to the city.
Getches foresees such exchanges reaching across state lines, with California
buying water from the states of the upper Colorado basin, which under-use
their allocations under the 1922 Colorado River Compact.
But quantity is only one side of the water equation; quality, too, is at
issue, with the Clean Water Act likely to come up for reauthorisation by
Congress this year. Since the first act, in 1972, many of the problems of
sewage and industrial water pollution have been largely addressed. But
non-point source pollution, especially run-off of pesticides and fertilisers
from agricultural land, has not been dealt with.
Some estimates put the cost of complying fully with the Clean Water Act,
which sets the goal of making rivers fishable and swimmable, at Dollars
110bn (Pounds 77bn) - although the Environmental Protection Agency has
estimated that 58,000 jobs are created for every Dollars 1bn invested in
sewage treatment.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Jobs: Moving tale of a fair day's work - The issue of pay
equity at the workplace and the pressures that may decrease productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Odd things sometimes happen during office moving. Recently members of a
group of American life assurance underwriters of varying degrees of
seniority (ranging from trainees to associate underwriters to underwriters)
were assigned for a fortnight to the offices of their co-workers while their
offices were refurbished.
Some were assigned to the offices of a higher status person; others were
assigned to the offices of lower status people; still others were assigned
to the offices of equal status people. In addition, one group continued
working in their own offices throughout the period. During this fortnight,
productivity was measured, taking into account the number of hours worked
and the difficulty of the cases reviewed. The result was curious.
Although all the underwriters performed equally well before the office moves
began, these office re-assignments had a profound effect on productivity.
Those assigned to higher status offices dramatically improved their
performance; those assigned to lower status offices dramatically lowered
theirs. Employees whose workspace rewards were unchanged had performance
levels that remained much the same during the study.
As soon as the underwriters returned to their own offices, their performance
returned to its original level.
Why did their productivity change? One answer is that people respond to, and
'correct', inequities created not only by the money they receive but also
other rewards such as the status value of their offices. Therefore if people
in a state of equity get more they work harder; take things away and they
produce less.
But what is equity? Consider the example of a group of friends going out for
a meal who agree to share the cost. They usually divide the bill (plus tip)
by the number of people present. Everybody pays the same despite the fact
that they have eaten differently priced dishes. This means, of course, that
those who choose modestly priced food and drink tap water subsidise those
who have more expensive tastes and drink alcohol. The anorectics as it were
pay for the gluttons.
As a consequence, people who dine together tend to choose dishes of similar
cost. They either all do or do not have a starter, a drink or dessert so
that no-one in the group eats more than the others.
If, however, somebody wants an expensive item and the others do not, it is
frequently agreed that he or she pays for it separately. The principle of
equality - people all pay equally irrespective of what they eat - is
replaced by one of equity, where people pay differently depending on what
they eat.
There is one other option: the richest in the group pays proportionally
more. This principle, taxation, is the least popular.
Nearly everyone faced with the choice argues for equity, certainly in the
world of work, and particularly when it comes to pay nearly everybody
favours equity over equality because they feel it is the fairest system.
Climate surveys, which are snapshots of a company's health, frequently show
people are most unhappy with the pay system because appraisal is not
directly linked to pay.
Strikes, walk-outs and go-slows are often the result not of complaints about
absolute pay but comparative pay. One person discovers that he or she is
paid less for work of equal skill or responsibility than a colleague and all
hell is let loose.
Where people feel unfairly dealt with and inequitably rewarded - nearly
always undervalued in the sense that they feel they give more than they get
 -they nearly always attempt to rectify the position. There are two ways
working people bring about a sense of pay equity: they seek to increase
their rewards or decrease their effort (or both).
The first aims to get more reward for one's work in term of pay or benefits,
sometimes called a package. That is neither easy nor even feasible in poorly
performing companies or during a recession.
There are, however, other things people can take. For instance, shoplifting
(politely called shrinkage) is more often carried out by employees rather
than by customers, partly because it is easier. Certainly stealing goods is
one way of increasing rewards - if one's organisation produces or has
something worth stealing.
On the other hand, one can steal time by coming late, going early or simply
going absent frequently. Time is money as the adage has it and can be
relatively easily stolen, as national absenteeism figures (especially those
for local authorities) show. The easiest way of increasing one's pay is to
work fewer days for the same money.
It is frequently difficult, dangerous, or even impossible to increase
rewards, and consequently it is much more common to find employees reducing
their input: their enthusiasm for the job; the amount of effort they put
into their work; their willingness to do (unpaid) overtime; and their
attitudes to customers.
In the last resort, the worker convinced he or she is unfairly dealt with
might leave the organisation. The most common reaction, however, is the
alienated, uncommitted, unhelpful worker; the sort we have all encountered,
even in customer service industries.
Sometimes a feeling of inequity comes after promotion because, although
promotion usually means an increase in salary, status and benefits, it also
means an increase in responsibility and workload, and the two might not
increase proportionally.
I know many people in the academic world who refuse promotion because,
although they feel equitably dealt with at their level, on the next level
increased responsibilities simply outweigh rewards; hence the fact that in
some jobs people frequently eschew promotion until the equity balance is
re-instated. Most frequently, the feeling of inequity and unfairness occurs
when we compare ourselves to others doing almost the same job but in
different organisations in different countries.
People at work need to feel fairly, equitably rewarded. Their perception of
fairness may differ from that of their employers because the value attached
to rewards or outputs such as free meals, sports/fitness facilities, company
cars and inputs such as hours of work, attention to detail and customer
responses may not be shared by employer and employee. If people feel
unfairly dealt with, they will do something about it.
Not everybody in a state of inequity feels it because they are
under-benefited; some, the theory goes, feel it because they are
over-benefited. To overcome this imbalance, the fortunate over-rewarded
individuals can either not take their full benefits or they can work harder.
Lady Thatcher, when prime minister, did both; she did not take her full
prime ministerial salary (taking only that of a minister) and worked
preposterously long hours.
What, one wonders, did she feel guilty about?

FT  24 MAR 93 / Life fund exercise leads to share rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES of life insurance companies rose sharply in London yesterday
following an announcement from United Friendly Group that it is studying
ways to allocate a greater portion of its reserves to shareholders.
United Friendly's shares closed 65p higher at 715p on the news. Industry
analysts estimate the exercise, which requires the permission of the
Department of Trade and Industry, could as much as double the value of
shareholders' assets.
Mr Roman Cizden, analyst at stockbroker Smith New Court, said 'This company
has been even more squirrel-like than some' in building reserves against
future liabilities.
While life funds must hold reserves to cover past bonuses awarded on
policies that have not yet matured, individual companies have scope to vary
the amount of reserves they need to hold for future bonuses.
Mr George Mack, finance director, said the company was examining its
so-called unallocated reserves within the Pounds 2bn life fund to see
whether a portion of them can be safely allocated to shareholders.
'The question is how much of these unallocated reserves are needed to
protect the reasonable expectations of policyholders,' he said.
If United Friendly decides it has been too conservative in building
reserves, assets per share could rise to as much as Pounds 6.40 from the
current level of Pounds 3.25, industry analysts said.
Mr Mack said that the exercise was in line with that taken by several other
UK life insurers, partly out of concern that failure to display the full
value of shareholders assets would leave the company vulnerable to a
predator.
The acquisition of Pearl Assurance in 1989 by Australian insurance group AMP
was widely seen as undervaluing the shares of Pearl. Since then, life
insurance companies have been examining ways to reflect the true value of
shareholders' funds in their balance sheets.
United Friendly has appointed an independent actuary, Mr Richard Squires,
partner at R Watsons and Sons, to make an independent assessment of the
company's roughly Pounds 2bn life fund.

NEDERLANDSE Reassurantie Groep, one the world's top 15 reinsurance groups,
yesterday announced it intended to withdraw from general reinsurance,
signalling further contraction in a market hard hit by recent losses.
The move is an embarrassing one for the group, part of the Amsterdam-based
Internationale Nederlande Groepe (ING), which radically increased its
involvement in reinsurance in 1990 when it bought Victory Re for Pounds 120m
from Legal &amp; General, the UK insurance company.
Mr Willem Dikland, chief executive, said reinsurance 'doesn't offer us a
sufficient return on capital. Catastrophes are getting bigger. You cannot
get any retrocession (reinsurance of reinsurance) protection and original
rates, especially in France and Germany, are totally inadequate.'
In a separate development Prudential Corporation, the UK's insurance group,
reported that its reinsurance subsidiary, Mercantile &amp; General Re, had
recorded underwriting losses in 1992 of Pounds 187m.
Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential group chief executive, said the results were
'dire'. Pru has already radically scaled back its involvement in non-life
reinsurance, following the appointment of a new management team last year.
Like NRG it will concentrate its efforts on less volatile life reinsurance
business.
The developments are the latest in a succession of gloomy news for the
London reinsurance market, where capacity is shrinking sharply following a
string of catastrophe losses. Last month NWRe, a joint venture owned by
Winterthur of Switzerland, Chiyoda of Japan and Norwich Union, pulled out of
the general reinsurance business after sustaining heavy losses from
hurricanes Andrew and Iniki.
A number of other smaller companies have either closed or reduced their
involvement in recent weeks.
NRG's latest move marks ING's complete withdrawal from the market for large
risks such as ships, aircraft and natural disasters.
Last year it effectively closed Orion Insurance, a medium sized player in
the battered London insurance market.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Granada buys caterer from P&amp;O: Sutcliffe included in Pounds
360m sale of groups with Pounds 500m sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA, the television and leisure group, is increasing its business
services activities with the Pounds 360m acquisition of catering, work wear
and other companies from P&amp;O.
Sutcliffe, the largest company being acquired, is the third largest contract
caterer in the UK behind Compass Group and Gardner Merchant. For Mr Gerry
Robinson, who joined Granada as chief executive in 1991 from Compass, the
purchase takes Granada into contract catering and gives opportunities to
save money through joint purchasing with Granada's motorway catering
business.
'It's an excellent strategic fit,' Mr Robinson said. 'My own knowledge of
catering also makes it a very safe affair,' he said.
The other companies being acquired include Spring Grove, the UK's third
largest textile rental operator. P&amp;O chairman Lord Sterling said all the
businesses being sold were UK based and the money would develop P&amp;O's
international business.
The companies being sold had combined turnover last year of Pounds 500m and
made trading profits of Pounds 29m. Sutcliffe had trading profits of Pounds
15.2m on turnover of Pounds 358m. It had more than 2,000 contracts, of which
more than 90 per cent were on a 'cost plus' basis. Sutcliffe's operating
margins of 4.3 per cent compared with about 10 per cent for Compass, Mr
Robinson said. The acquisitions would be 'at least' earnings neutral this
year.
Granada hoped to improve margins in Sutcliffe and Spring Grove by improved
purchasing and control of overheads.
Following the acquisition, Granada's TV rental division would account for
less than 50 per cent of trading profits for the first time for 'many
years', the company said.
Granada will use Pounds 212m of existing resources, and is raising a further
Pounds 148m through a vendor placing to institutions at 350p a share. The
issue was well received by the stock market, where the shares gained 20p to
385p. The placing was underwritten by Hoare Govett and Swiss Bank
Corporation.
Borrowings for the deal will increase Granada's net debt to Pounds 350m,
equal to gearing of more than 80 per cent. Mr Henry Staunton, finance
director, said gearing would fall to about 50 per cent next year.

FT  24 MAR 93 / BT sale managers poised to compete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGIONAL lead managers in the UK government's forthcoming sale of BT shares
are expected to compete with each other to sign up institutional
shareholders.
For the first time in any UK privatisation, the Treasury is considering
having one global offer with 10 regional managers competing to get
institutions around the world to put in bids for BT shares.
The government is expected to sell most, if not all, of its 22 per cent BT
shareholding, which is worth Pounds 5.5bn. The sale may take place as early
as July.
It yesterday expanded its share shop scheme, set up as part of the second
tranche of BT shares sold in 1991.
In the last BT sale the institutional offer was split between 10 syndicates
throughout the world in which the lead managers had exclusive rights, apart
from the global co-ordinator, to market the shares.
The government has already decided to reduce the number of syndicates and
may abolish them in favour of a single global market.
Regional managers would still be appointed to look after retail demand. But
they would be expected to compete with other regional managers to sign up
institutional investors.
International sales have already moved away from giving as many as 10
regional managers exclusive rights to drum up institutional support.
Although no decision has been taken on the timing of the BT sale, SG
Warburg, the government's lead adviser, said the earliest date was in July,
with a marketing campaign starting in the last week of May.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, yesterday invited
100 banks, building societies and stockbrokers to participate as share
shops. This compares with eight 'preferred retailers' in the last BT sale.
Once a member of the public registers with a share shop, the bank or
stockbroker will be able to start marketing other share offers unconnected
with the BT sale.
In the last sale share shops had to wait until after the flotation before
offering small BT shareholders inducements to buy shares in other companies.
Mr Dorrell said: 'The plans are designed to further the government's
commitment to wider and deeper share ownership.'

FT  24 MAR 93 / China names former HK chief as adviser on colony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S former top civil servant, Sir David Akers-Jones, is to be
appointed to the ranks of China's advisers on the colony's affairs.
Sir David - the first expatriate appointed by China to such a role - was
chief secretary of Hong Kong from June 1985 until February 1987. In the
aftermath of Sir Edward Youde's death in 1986, he served as acting governor.
He stepped down as chairman of the HK Housing Authority this week.
Having someone of Sir David's stature as a Hong Kong adviser is seen as a
propaganda coup for Beijing and an important step in the building of a
'united front' against governor Chris Patten's proposals for wider democracy
in the colony.
Beijing is due to announce within a fortnight a second tranche of advisers,
which is expected to number more than 50 and to include leading conservative
political figures. A year ago it selected 44 prominent Hong Kong citizens in
the first round of appointments.
According to one mainland Chinese official, Sir David, 65, who still lives
in the colony, would be able to provide Beijing with unparalleled advice on
the working of the Hong Kong government. He may also be able to advise China
on how it can protect its interests from penetration by the British
intelligence community in the colony.
But the official said the symbolism Sir David's appointment carries is
perhaps more important. 'He will be an example to senior Hong Kong civil
servants that they have a life after 1997, if they follow his lead.'
Last night, Sir David said he was unable to confirm or deny reports of his
impending appointment. But he said he thought Britain had gone back on
agreements and understandings it had reached with China in early 1990.
Sir David said that Mr Patten's plans for more democracy in the colony were
'not worth the candle' and warned of the potential damage to Hong Kong and
British interests in China of the UK pursuing its current policy. 'I believe
the way forward lies in co-operation rather than antagonism and
confrontation,' he said.

FT  24 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: BBA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week BBA sold an Australian business, this week it buys in Switzerland
and Germany and throws in a rights issue too. The pace of deals and issues
in the past few years is such that shareholders might be forgiven for being
confused about what the company actually does. The management says it is
focusing on eight core businesses; yesterday's offering makes a total of
four rights issues in eight years.
The market forgives such shuffling from the likes of Hanson because it has a
consistent earnings record. But BBA's earnings were 8.4p in 1985, hit a peak
of 20p in 1989 and were back to 8.3p in 1992 - or 5p on the new accounting
basis. BBA stresses growth in shareholders' funds, yet since 1985 the
majority of that has come from rights issues.
Granted, turnover has risen from Pounds 230m to Pounds 1.32bn while the
dividend is up fourfold. And the recession has been particularly severe in
engineering. The dividend, however, is now out of line with the underlying
performance of the business. Those buying the rights for the 6.7 per cent
yield may thus not see much growth. Investors might be more comfortable if
the dealing was slower and the earnings more predictable.

<TEXT>
Mr Mick Newmarch has spent the best part of three years clearing dead wood
at the Prudential. Even Mercantile and General, the reinsurance business
which blighted yesterday's figures, has been chopped down to size since the
year-end. Earnings growth from here on may depend on the core life and
pensions business. It remains an open question whether Mr Newmarch will
prove as adept at delivering organic growth.
But the Pru may now be inclined to look at acquisitions. Its stubborn
refusal to reveal the state of its balance sheet yesterday - hardly the
standard of disclosure one might expect from a large institutional investor
 -suggests an unusual degree of sensitivity. Still, the Pru is right that a
conventional balance sheet would ignore the value of its life fund. Making
an acquisition through the fund could be one way of unlocking that value for
shareholders.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada's shares may have rebounded strongly but they were always likely to
flatten out as the market began to worry about the group's continuing growth
prospects. The acquisition of Sutcliffe catering group may neatly solve the
dilemma.
A price tag of Pounds 360m, representing an exit multiple of 18, hardly
looks excessive for a company with expansion opportunities. Although the
acquisition may only be earnings neutral in its first year it should boost
profits thereafter.
Granada should gain advantages from joint buying with its motorway services
division. It can also apply its proven cost-cutting skills to improving
Sutcliffe's somewhat meagre margins. Even so, P&amp;O sold because it feared UK
catering was bound to face increasingly tough competition from international
competitors. So Granada has some hard pounding ahead.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O is in the seemingly paradoxical position that it pays its stockholders
too much while rewarding them too little. From one perspective, it was a
considerable relief that the company maintained its year-end dividend
underpinning the doubling of the share price that has occurred since
September. From another viewpoint, though, it has merely exacerbated P&amp;O's
financial strain by distributing the bulk of its earnings. Last year, P&amp;O
paid out dividends of Pounds 178.6m from distributable profits of Pounds
191.9m. With gearing hovering above 60 per cent, P&amp;O needs an economic
upturn in order to secure a decent return on its substantial past investment
programme.
One option might be to tap shareholders for more funds - as P&amp;O did in 1991
with a Pounds 604m rights issue. But the group may now have found another
means of keeping the cash merry-go-round in motion. Yesterday's sale of its
catering business to Granada reveals the worth of just one of its many
hidden gems: a business with net tangible assets of Pounds 49.2m was sold
for Pounds 360m.
With a diversified portfolio crammed with assets of more than Pounds 4bn,
P&amp;O may well be tempted to make more disposals to realise shareholder value.
The rest of the business service division may follow. Property sales also
look likely when markets harden. The question is whether P&amp;O really is set
upon achieving shareholder value in this way.

FT  24 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: A zest for life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
United Friendly, one of the minnows of UK life assurance, has done its bit
for the inexorable rise of the sector. Life assurance shares have
outperformed the market by 50 per cent since 1989, when the Pearl first
pointed to the value locked away in its life fund during its vain takeover
defence against AMP. Yesterday's announcement takes the argument one stage
further, since United Friendly's surplus may be large enough to justify a
special distribution to shareholders. That accounts for the 10 per cent rise
in the shares yesterday. Refuge and Britannic, which boast an equal
embarrassment of riches, were dragged along in sympathy.
There is plenty of scope for disappointment. Sizing up the surplus will be a
long actuarial process. There are good arguments for leaving some surplus
assets in the fund. That would allow their fund managers to take some risks
in the pursuit of higher investment returns, and pay higher bonuses to
policyholders in future. Any distribution to shareholders would also have to
be approved by the Department of Trade and Industry. Now that the Office of
Fair Trading's criticism of policy marketing has turned the spotlight on the
industry, the DTI might take a tougher line over distributing surpluses.
But there is more than one way to unlock value. L&amp;G, for example, has also
sold part of its property portfolio and fund management arm to the life fund
for cash. While the smaller life companies are starting to look fully valued
at these levels, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that AMP picked up Pearl
on the cheap.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Not an open and shut case: The EC-US dispute over public
purchasing rules could escalate into a tit-for-tat trade war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We have not sold a steam turbine in Europe since the Marshall Plan,'
protests Mr Michael Gadbaw, vice-president for international policy at
General Electric, the US manufacturing and services conglomerate. 'No US
supplier has succeeded in penetrating the EC heavy electrical equipment
market in any country with indigenous manufacturing.'
The reason, GE says, is that protectionist public purchasing rules have
effectively closed the market, shutting the door on potential orders for
steam turbines worth about Dollars 1bn a year.
The complaint, echoed by other leading US utilities groups, particularly
AT&amp;T in the telecommunications sector, is at the heart of an EC-US dispute
over government purchasing practices which threatened to spill over into
trade sanctions on Monday. In the event, President Bill Clinton told Mr
Jacques Delors, EC president, he would suspend sanctions - which would have
amounted to a token Dollars 40m on EC exports - to facilitate a temporary
ceasefire.
The US is not alone in feeling aggrieved. EC exporters insist they are
barred from the US market, in particular by state-level procurement rules
that favour local manufacturers. The French telecommunications group
Alcatel, Europe's biggest, has so far not been able to penetrate the US
market, while the German electrical group Siemens and Sweden's Ericsson
telecommunications company have only made limited inroads.
One thing that both EC and US officials agree on is this: if the clash over
procurement - a long-ignored area of commerce which accounts for an
estimated 8 per cent to 12 per cent of global gross domestic product  - had
happened in isolation, it would have been 'one of those normal skirmishes'.
Unfortunately, the disagreement has not occurred in isolation. It coincides
with friction over steel exports - the US last month imposed 'dumping'
duties of up to 110 per cent on steel exporters from 19 countries, charging
them with exporting at below prices in home markets  - and over Europe's
subsidies for Airbus. It has also added to confusion over the overall trade
posture of the US administration - not just towards Europe, but towards the
Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations on global trade.
As with the EC-US row over farm subsidies which came to a head in Washington
last November, the procurement dispute has been simmering for many years. It
has its roots in the 1970s when US negotiators agreed to a procurement code
drawn up as part of the Tokyo Round of world trade liberalisation.
It has erupted now because the EC's Utilities Directive, which came into
force in January, includes small but formal discrimination against US
competitors for utilities contracts - particularly in the power and
telecommunications areas. US officials concede that the directive is,
nevertheless, a significant market-opening initiative because it forces EC
governments to open thousands of contracts for public tender that were
previously notified only to local companies.
Article 29 of the directive lies at the heart of the row. This gives a 3 per
cent price preference to EC bidders for any government contract and allows
an EC purchaser to ignore a bid completely if the bidder has a European
content of less than 50 per cent. So a cheaper US bid may fail on domestic
content grounds alone.
'The two combined create a tremendous deterrent even to bidding,' said Mr
Gadbaw, who argues that few US companies would commit the time and funds (up
to Dollars 1m) on preparing a bid if they saw price preferences and local
content rules blocking the chances of success.
It was the EC's refusal to delete Article 29 after the start of the year
which triggered the US threat to impose trade sanctions last week. A
resolution now rests in the hands of Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EC counterpart, when they meet in
Brussels next week.
The bilateral procurement negotiations have become muddled largely because
the two have different definitions of public purchasing. For the US,
procurement means nothing more than purchasing by central government and
publicly owned utilities in telecommunications, power and water. By this
definition, the US is strikingly open, and the EC virtually closed.
But the EC defines procurement to include purchasing by local government
authorities (such as US states), and by private companies in
government-regulated sectors which have 'special and exclusive rights', such
as mass transit systems, airports or ports. By this measure, the US comes
out less well, in particular because state governments apply 'buy local'
price preferences of 6 per cent to 60 per cent.
At present, the procurement code regulated by the Gatt since the mid-1970s
covers only a small part of the market being argued over - basically, goods
purchased by central governments. In 1990, these were worth Dollars 62.15bn
worldwide, according to figures notified to the Gatt.
The market would be much bigger if utilities, such as telecommunications and
power, and mass transit systems, were included. For example, the EC says the
world market for telecommunications equipment alone amounts to Dollars 128bn
a year, with the US accounting for Dollars 44.8bn (35 per cent), and the EC
for Dollars 30.7bn (24 per cent).
EC officials agree that buy-local policies across Europe have kept markets
closed. But they insist that the recent trend is towards openness. Gatt
figures endorse this claim. Procurement opportunities notified to the Gatt
by the EC have risen from Dollars 7.45bn in 1987 to Dollars 18.66bn in 1990.
Meanwhile, US notifications held steady at Dollars 28.8bn.
The EC claims that the Utilities Directive opens the entire procurement
market to foreign bids. They say 1,000 contracts worth Dollars 17.5bn have
been announced in the first 10 weeks of this year that would not previously
have been open to foreign bidders.
US negotiators generally agree with this view, but are seeking reassurance
that standards and other technical requirements are not being used in place
of preferential bidding systems to keep foreign manufacturers out. US
officials echo the view of Mr Gadbaw: 'We welcome the EC effort to
liberalise in the procurement area, but they have used Article 29 of the
directive to close us out.'
EC negotiators have been perplexed by recent developments. 'We knew where we
were moving, and saw evidence that we were getting close to a solution,'
said one negotiator. They are also concerned that what they regard as a
significant market-opening reform should have been condemned by US try.
The solution to the dispute, according to the EC, is for the US to bring
rights to bid for transport sector contracts to the negotiations - including
mass transit systems, ports and airports. They are also seeking access to
state utilities contracts.
The US might be close to accepting some of these demands once Article 29 is
dropped. Though the US constitution prevents the federal government from
imposing curbs on the 'buy local' practices of state governments,
negotiators say they are in the process of getting voluntary commitments
from the states to open up their markets. Such commitments account for 65
per cent of total local purchasing.
A serious stumbling block to any resolution of procurement policy is the
tangled argument over the numbers being used by both sides. 'We say the
disagreement is due to different kinds of statistics,' says an EC
procurement expert: 'We are not saying the statistics lie. It's just the
nature of the statistics. Neither is right or wrong, but to compare them is
folly.'
US officials agree statistics can be interpreted in conflicting ways, but
have baulked at the EC proposal for a jointly funded study to settle the
dispute. This smacks of 'yet another EC effort to drag its heels on an
issue', one said.
No negotiators are forecasting a procurement deal will be reached in
Brussels next week. But pressure is mounting on Sir Leon and Mr Kantor to
lay the foundations for agreement - not just on procurement, but on steel
and Airbus too. If they fail, a deluge of tit-for-tat trade retaliation
looks increasingly likely - with ominous consequences for world trade.

The heritage lobby howled when London's Royal Holloway College sold its
famous Turner to California's overly endowed Getty Museum for Pounds 11m.
However, the college's entrepreneurial flair in negotiating the highest
price paid for a British work of art at auction has clearly impressed one
section of the community. Enquiries from prospective students have doubled
since the sale a month ago.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Sixteen arrested after clashes with police outside Timex
plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S worst picket line violence for seven years erupted yesterday
outside the Timex plant in Dundee as an increasingly bitter strike entered
its fifth week.
Sixteen people were arrested when up to 600 demonstrators battled with
police as replacement workers were taken by bus through picket lines into
the plant, which makes printed circuit boards.
Angry strike supporters sat down in front of the gates to try to stop the
bus. Some union officials accused the police of over-reacting and losing
control. Timex last night deplored the violence and said the demonstrators
were trying to intimidate its workforce.
The dispute is rapidly becoming a cause celebre in Scotland. Last Saturday,
more than 7,000 people marched through Dundee in support of the striking
workers, who were dismissed for refusing to accept cuts in benefits. The
sackings went ahead despite the fact that the workers had agreed to return
under protest.
More and more supporters from organisations including Militant Tendency and
the Socialist Workers' party are turning up at Timex to demonstrate their
solidarity with the strikers.
Britain has not witnessed such violent scenes in an industrial dispute since
the 1986 siege of News International's plant at Wapping in east London by
print workers. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering
union, said yesterday his union had become 'ensnared in the draconian labour
laws that did not help to solve industrial disputes'. He added the AEEU was
ready at any time to talk with Timex about the dispute and prepared to use
the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service to settle the strike.
Yesterday's escalation in the dispute followed the legal victory gained by
the AEEU in the Court of Session in Edinburgh last Friday, when Timex failed
to secure the extension of an existing interdict - or injunction - which
would have banned all meetings, marches and demonstrations held by the union
within 50 yards of the plant. Timex was also ordered to pay the union's
legal costs. Union officials believe the company has already spent up to
Pounds 70,000 in legal expenses since the dispute began.
On Friday, a further confrontation will take place in the Court of Session
when the AEEU will appeal against the original injunction secured by the
company to limit pickets to six at the main gate. Union officials claim the
strike is having a severe impact on Timex's business.
The US-owned company has recruited up to 190 workers to replace the 320 it
dismissed but the AEEU said yesterday the newcomers were not skilled enough
to do their jobs.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Montedison sells drug arm to
Procordia for Dollars 1.3bn

<TEXT>
MONTEDISON, the Italian agro-industrial group, yesterday agreed to sell its
Erbamont pharmaceuticals subsidiary to Kabi-Pharmacia, the Swedish
pharmaceuticals company, in a deal worth up to L2,100bn (Dollars 1.3bn).
The transaction will create one of Europe's 10 biggest drugs producers and
push Kabi-Pharmacia, controlled by Sweden's partially state-owned Procordia
group, into the world's top 20.
The combined group will have annual sales of about Dollars 2.75bn, 18,000
employees and a research budget of more than Dollars 375bn. Its combined
products should give it a strong market position in five niche sectors:
cancer drugs, growth defects, eye surgery, patient feeding and laboratory
testing for allergies.
Apart from Sweden and Italy, it will be strongly represented in the US,
Japan and the main western European countries. Last year, Kabi-Pharmacia had
sales of L2,770bn and operating profits of L538bn, while Erbamont had
operating earnings of L140bn on sales of L1,600bn.
Kabi-Pharmacia will pay an initial L640bn in cash and take on debt worth
L642bn in return for a 51 per cent stake in Farmitalia Carlo Erba,
Montedison's listed Italian pharmaceuticals subsidiary, and its Erbamont
operation in the US. It will also have the right to buy, or Montedison to
sell, the remaining shares between next January and December 1995.
The overall sale should net the heavily-indebted Montedison, controlled by
the Ferruzzi Finanziaria holding company, about L2,100bn. Montedison will
also receive income from certain recent Erbamont drugs for a number of
years, providing a further sum of between L400bn and L500bn, according to
its estimates.
The two companies justified the deal in terms of reducing costs, improving
their combined marketing clout and reinforcing research capabilities. Mr
Hakan Astrom, Kabi-Pharmacia's president, said annual savings of SKr1bn
(Dollars 130m) were expected within four years through administration,
marketing and manufacturing synergies.

WESTINGHOUSE Electric of the US and Finland's Haka-Stroi have formed a
co-operation agreement to identify, develop and supply power generation
projects in the Baltic countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Westinghouse, one of the world's main suppliers of power generation plant,
will supply the power island and related equipment for each project under
the two-year deal.
Haka-Stroi, a civil engineering company, will manage plant construction
activities. It is a subsidiary of Haka, a big Finnish construction company
which has been active in CIS markets for 20 years.
Babcock International has won contracts worth about Pounds 30m for boiler
repair work in Kuwait and ship unloading and bulk materials handling
equipment from customers in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Taiwan and Thailand.
The deals include a Pounds 10m order from Kuwait's Ministry of Electricity
and Water for the reconstruction of three boilers at Shuwaikh Power Station,
which were extensively damaged during the Iraqi invasion.
GEC Alsthom Electromecanique, a Quebec-based subsidiary of the Anglo-French
engineering group, has won an order from Korea Heavy Industries &amp;
Construction to supply a nuclear reactor calandria for the Wolsong IV power
station in the south-east of South Korea.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Chessmen lure five white knights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE rival bids to stage the breakaway world chess championships were opened
at a sometimes surreal ceremony in London yesterday. One was in early
20th-century Reichsmarks and another was locked in a metal box.
Amid the ornate splendour of Simpson's-in-the-Strand the players, on a
makeshift podium, revealed that four of the bids were higher than that from
the original venue chosen by the Swiss-based international chess federation
(Fide).
As the 18-month-old daughter of British challenger Nigel Short gurgled into
the microphone, her father said the bids vindicated the players' move last
week to set up a rival championship in opposition to Fide. Garry Kasparov,
the reigning world champion and his arch-rival over the chessboard, was at
his side.
'This vindicates our original decision. The world championship had been
undersold,' said Mr Short. Under the auspices of Fide, Manchester had
originally won the bidding with an offer of about Pounds 1.17m. This time
the city declined to bid.
The highest offer, for Pounds 2m, is from the London Chess Group, a
consortium of four London-based companies which has backing from the
Barbican Centre and Corporation of London. The group had insisted on
submitting their bid on Friday in a locked metal box, fearing envelopes
might be secretly opened over the weekend.
'We've never seen anything like this before,' said an accountant involved in
the consortium, who admitted to being baffled by the series of plots,
counter-plots and closed-door dealings that had accompanied the bidding
process.
The other bids included a Pounds 1.7m offer from Times Newspapers and
Teleworld Holdings, a Pounds 1.4m offer from the Brain Trust, and a Pounds
1.2m offer from the catering organisation Monsi. Although the Brain Trust
requested that the match was played in seven different British cities, the
London Chess Group and the Monsi bid both cited London as the preferred
venue.
The most colourful bid came from a Warrington chess enthusiast, who offered
'10m marks' to stage the match in a village hall. Although it was originally
assumed that the bid represented DM10m, Mr Noel Alms, of the economic
consultancy Investment Chartwork and co-ordinator of the bid, later admitted
that the figure was in Reichsmarks, a defunct German currency worth a small
fraction of a US cent.
'We have done this to secure publicity for chess,' said Mr Alms, a keen
member of the local chess league, who is campaigning to have more chess on
television. A final decision on the bid will be made in the next couple of
weeks.

TWO OVERSEAS companies are among the four shortlisted to take over the
telecommunications system linking government offices across Britain when it
is privatised this year.
OTC Australia, the international arm of Australia's state-owned
telecommunications carrier, and Sprint, which is the third-largest
long-distance carrier in the US, are bidding against British Telecom and
Mercury for the three-year contract.
The contract, worth about Pounds 11m a year, is to operate the 13 switch
centres and subsidiary centres linking about 250,000 officials in 1,000
government office locations.
The Government Telecommunications Network, with assets of about Pounds 10m,
handles more than 66m calls a year.
It is served by the Government Centre for Information Systems, an in-house
concern. The long-distance part of its business is being privatised under
the government's market-testing policy.
Although the trunk lines linking the locations are leased from BT or
Mercury, the foreign suppliers see the contract as an opportunity to
establish a presence in the UK telecommunications market, and a vantage
point from which to exploit the European market, which is gradually being
liberalised.
OTC Australia is also applying to the Department of Trade and Industry for
an international simple resale licence, under a competition regime for
international calls established at the end of last year. The licence would
enable OTC to lease international circuits and resell services.
If OTC gains the licence it is likely to seek to undercut BT tariffs for
calls to Australia. OTC's goal is to build Pounds 1bn of business outside
Australia in the next five years.
In the past two years it has lost a tenth of its domestic business in the
newly liberalised Australian market to carriers including BT and Cable and
Wireless, which owns Mercury.
Sprint, which is similarly anxious to break into the European market, has
applications pending with the DTI for licenses to provide local, trunk and
international services on its own network.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Dreams of privatisation: The restructuring of the German
steel industry as part of the upheaval in the sector throughout Europe has
elicited widespread protest. FT writers report on the hopes and fears of two
communities in east and west Germany

<TEXT>
THE workers at Ekostahl, Eisenhuttenstadt, reckon they have done their bit
in reducing the workforce and capacity. 'There are only 5,000 people now
working here,' says Mr Gunther Reski, head of the plant's workers' council.
'But in practice, only 3,500 have full-time jobs. The rest are part-time, on
training, or else are on job creation schemes. Before 1990, 11,000 people
were employed here.'
Ekostahl, 100km east of Berlin and near the Polish border, was built by the
former East German communist regime in 1951. The 50,000 inhabitants of
Eisenhuttenstadt, an annex of the giant steel mill, are dependent on the
plant, which used to buy iron ore from Russia and sold its finished products
back to the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
'We were producing over 2.1m tons a year. We've brought production down to
900,000 tons. Now we are looking for a break,' says Mr Reski, a 51-year-old
steelworker who has spent the past 30 years with Ekostahl.
The workers are pinning their hopes on an ambitious plan that would
eventually result in the privatisation of parts of the company. The first
phase, already agreed in principle by their owner, the Treuhand - the agency
responsible for privatising the east German economy - entails modernisation
of the cold steel works, for DM310m (Pounds 131m). The second phase would
turn Ekostahl into a mini-mill, inspired by the highly successful Nucor
plant in North Carolina. That would require an additional DM750m.
The workers are waiting anxiously for a decision on the aid package. But
they are also hoping that IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering trade
union, will not press for a strike at the plant.
'A strike is the last thing we need,' says Harold, a 32-year-old Ekostahl
employee. 'IG Metall wants a 26 per cent wage increase to equalise wages
between eastern and western German workers. But if that means a strike, I
would opt for a job, not a higher wage. Many of my friends think the same.'
Eisenhuttenstadters also worry about a strike, due on April 1 after IG
Metall has balloted its members. 'We can't afford strikes, because the
workers will lose money. We can't afford strikes, because it might deter
buyers for Ekostahl,' says Britta, who has recently set up her own food
shop.
Local IG Metall officials, and owners of new, small businesses, are aware of
the dilemma. Job security is vital for their future, and the town's. They
explain how the 36 ancillary work shops formerly owned by Ekostahl have been
privatised, and are surviving. Mr Kurt Rakoczi, manager of a local insurance
company, says if Ekostahl does not get the go-ahead for modernisation, the
town, and the fledgling privatised sector, would die.
They have already set up a solidarity fund for unemployed workers. 'We are
still prepared to make sacrifices for Ekostahl because we believe the
mini-mill could work here,' says Mr Reski. 'What is the alternative?'

FT  23 MAR 93 / Legal threat ends blockade of port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLOTILLA of fishing boats from north-east England blockaded one of
Britain's biggest ports yesterday to publicise fishermen's opposition to the
government's fisheries policy.
The 8-hour blockade, from dawn, of the mouth of the River Tees disrupted
shipping movements in and out of the Port of Tees and Hartlepool. It delayed
10 vessels, including two carriers exporting Sunderland-made Nissan cars.
The protest was called off after threats of legal action against the
fishermen from the Port of Tees and Hartlepool Authority. As they sailed
away the men warned of more action, at unspecified locations, this week,
despite fisheries minister Mr David Curry's condemnation of the protest as
'a waste of time' which would not influence government policy.
Yesterday's action by men from ports from North Shields to Scarborough was
organised by the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which
represents most fishermen in England and Wales.
NFFO chief executive Mr Richard Banks joined the blockade on board the
Whitby trawler Sarb J. He highlighted two main objectives of the protest.
One was to press for import controls, particularly on cheap Russian fish
entering Britain. Fishermen claim that Russian cod is entering the UK at
roughly half the minimum EC price.
The second aim is to force the government to abandon the new Sea Fish
Conservation Act which will restrict the number of days British fishermen
can go to sea. Mr Banks claimed the act would cut up to 30 days off the
average total that fishermen work at present. He said this was equivalent to
a 10 per cent or Pounds 2,000 drop in annual income.
The decision to disrupt shipping had not been taken lightly, he added. 'We
want to bring to everybody's attention we are in dire straits,' he said. The
fishermen also called for more advertising of fish and immediate
implementation of the EC's payment scheme for decommissioning fishing
vessels.
Mr Curry is tomorrow meeting the NFFO and the fish processors, who depend
heavily on imports. Responding to Mr Banks' comments, he said British
fishermen must accept the need to take action to conserve stocks.
Mr Curry said the industry's problems included insufficient consumer demand
for fish and large landings by British fishermen, glutting the marketplace.
'The whole problems of the industry can't all be blamed on other people,' he
said.
Last week's Brussels meeting of the European Council of Fisheries Ministers
had, he said, ruled out a blanket ban on non-EC imports. The protectionism
wanted by the protesting fishermen contradicted moves towards liberalising
trade.
Shipowners and agents using Teesport expressed concern at the protest. 'I'm
very disappointed the fishermen should take an illegal step,' said Mr Derek
Munt, managing director of ferry owner Ferrymasters. The departure of the
company's MV Elk was delayed. Two of the 10 vessels affected yesterday were
diverted to Hull.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Marriage that makes sense: Robert Peston examines a comeback
by Morgan Grenfell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was not exactly love at first sight. But Mr John Craven, chairman of
Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, will never forget an autumn night
three years ago when Mr Rolf Breuer, a Deutsche Bank executive, asked:
'Should we be talking?'
The venue was Washington, where both were attending the annual meeting of
the International Monetary Fund. Two months later, Morgan and Deutsche were
engaged to be married, amid predictions from some friends and rivals that
disaster would follow. Deutsche was paying far too much (Pounds 950m), they
said, for a merchant bank whose business it could not possibly understand -
and anyway, Morgan was in inexorable decline.
Three years later, the bridegroom feels vindicated. Morgan yesterday
disclosed a record financial performance for 1992, while profits of UK
rivals, such as Barings and S G Warburg, are under pressure.
'As far back as the records show, we have never done as well, in terms of
the after-tax return on capital, which was 15 per cent,' said Mr Michael
Dobson, Morgan's chief executive.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 80.2m, 49 per cent higher than the previous year,
would also have been a record, if the bank had not made contributions of
several million pounds to a scheme designed to pay bonuses to staff over the
next few years.
The performance was surprising because only a few years ago Morgan appeared
a spent force. In the mid-1980s, it became embroiled in two financial
scandals, the Guinness affair and an insider trading case. It also made a
series of poor acquisitions in preparation for Big Bang, the 1986
de-regulation of the UK securities markets.
By the beginning of 1987, the institution seemed to be irreversibly
deteriorating. Following the scandals, Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor,
pressured Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, to
force the resignation of Mr Christopher Reeves, Morgan's chief executive,
and Mr Graham Walsh, head of the corporate finance department, which had
traditionally been responsible for 80 per cent of group profits.
There were widespread predictions in the City that Morgan's clients, which
included many of the UK's biggest companies, would desert en masse and that
the bank would wither.
Mr Craven's arrival in mid-1987 started the rebuilding process. Clients
stopped leaving and Morgan's financial performance was stabilised after he
sold or closed all seven businesses bought over the previous five years,
including its UK equity trading businesses.
But it took five years for the bank to regain some of its former sparkle and
confidence. Rivals today acknowledge that Morgan has made a comeback. Mr Win
Bischoff, chief executive of Schroders, the merchant bank, said: 'It seems
to me they are doing well.'
Morgan's record profits have come at a time when there is overcapacity in
the merchant banking business, particularly in the area of advice to UK
companies on mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), which for decades was the
dominant activity within Morgan.
In London, there are a dozen well-established merchant banks chasing a
shrinking amount of M&amp;A business. UK companies are questioning whether
takeovers are sensible given the uncertain outlook for the economy.
Morgan's comeback is also noteworthy because commercial banks have
traditionally been bad owners of investment banks or securities firms. Big
banks from Asia, the US, continental Europe and the UK have all bought City
firms over the past few years and most have made low or negative returns on
their investments.
Most commercial banks have not been able to resist the temptation to meddle
with their newly acquired businesses. They have often placed their own
managers in charge of the firms or tried to integrate them with existing
operations. The results have sometimes been disastrous, primarily because
lending bankers rarely have investment banking skills.
In contrast to many other commercial banks, however, Deutsche took a
long-term view of its investment. 'In our planning, we said to ourselves
that we thought the results would go down in 1990 and would still be
disappointing in 1991,' Mr Hilmar Kopper, speaker of Deutsche's board of
managing directors, said. 'Our main disappointment is that our judgment was
right.'
Deutsche stuck to its position and has not encroached on Morgan's autonomy.
Mr Kopper said: 'We recognised that we should not impose Deutsche Bank
culture and German style on the businesses we buy. All business has strong
local characteristics, especially in our trade.'
Morgan has continued to be run by Mr Craven and by Mr Dobson, who has been
at Morgan since 1973. Mr Kopper says Deutsche's main involvement is in
assessing Morgan's budget at the beginning of each financial year.
Since it took over, Morgan's business has become better balanced. Mr Dobson
said that more than half Morgan's revenues are generated outside the UK.
Perhaps more important, its corporate finance department, whose speciality
is M&amp;A, is no longer the dominant force in generating profits.
Equally important departments are asset management, which manages funds
totalling more than Pounds 20bn, money market trading, various forms of
sophisticated commercial banking (such as raising funds for big
infrastructure projects) and the trading of less developed countries' debt.
Profits which stem directly from working jointly with Deutsche are small, Mr
Dobson said. 'You can interpret that in different ways,' he added. 'Either
we are not doing enough or there is plenty of scope to grow.'
The main benefit to date for Morgan of ownership by Deutsche is that it has
been freed of the short-term performance imperatives it experienced as a
public company.
There are several more tangible advantages. As an independent, for example,
it could never have become the world's biggest trader of less developed
countries' debt. But the team it recruited from Libra, the international
consortium bank, in 1991, was able to trade with Deutsche's portfolio of
poor-performing loans to developing countries.
Similary, Morgan could never on its own have become the leading adviser to
German companies on M&amp;A.
The maxim of Mr Kopper and Mr Craven is 'co-operation not integration'
between the two organisations. They accept that their investment banking
businesses have an unusually complex structure, in that Deutsche's
substantial securities trading operations are managed independently of
Morgan's M&amp;A businesses.
Indeed the structure is about to become more complicated, because Mr Kopper
said Deutsche is planning within a few days to hive off the activity of
giving advice to companies on new issues of securities from its corporate
finance division into a separate primary markets department.
But Mr Craven is adamant: 'There will not be a big bang integration of the
businesses.' Big bangs, as most commercial banks admit today, can often
cause big headaches.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clark board decides on bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of C&amp;J Clark last night decided to recommend one of three
potential bidders for the family-owned shoe manufacturer after a marathon
meeting lasting almost 12 hours.
The board convened at 10.30am, but by early evening had still not chosen
between the three rivals: property and commodities group Berisford; shoe
manufacturer FII and an investment consortium of existing shareholders
backed by Electra Investment Trust.
Although the decision is not expected to be announced until after
shareholders have been informed, speculation centred on the success of the
investment consortium. As Clark shareholders, the institutions have
pre-emptive rights over the sale of its shares.
The board is believed to have rejected a fourth bid in cash or shares from a
group of institutions which was pitched at approximately Pounds 2.
The board's decision not to consider the fourth bid is thought to have been
strongly opposed by the four directors who last year sought to unseat the
chairman at an extraordinary general meeting. It is likely the directors
will try to reconvene the egm, which was adjourned until no later than the
annual general meeting planned for this month.
All the bidders were seeking majority control although Berisford was
believed to be demanding at least 90 per cent. The investment consortium is
thought to be looking for at least 51 per cent.
The board faced three options in its choice of potential bidder: Berisford
has made no secret of its desire to build an international industrial
holding company spanning Europe and the US. Clark's would be just one of
four divisions, with the emphasis on making it more competitive in an
international environment.
FII, on the other hand, argues its knowledge of the shoe industry would
bring considerable benefit to both companies and few jobs would be lost. A
significant supplier to Marks and Spencer, FII would be able to introduce
Clark's range of children's and casual shoes to this market.
The investment consortium, meanwhile, is prepared to back the company's
existing management and is aiming for an eventual flotation.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Turtle toy maker slumps 59% -
Hong Kong Results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLAYMATES International, the toy distribution company that launched the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, recorded a 59 per cent drop in net profits to
HKDollars 363m (USDollars 47m) in 1992, due to dwindling demand for the US's
top-selling action figure toys.
The company retains HKDollars 872m in cash reaped from the Turtle phenomenon
and is continuing to search for alternative revenue sources, expanding into
new toy lines and into property development.
The directors slashed the dividend with a final payout of 13 cents, making a
total of 20 cents for the year, compared with 80 cents in 1991.
Playmates, the world's most profitable toy company in 1991, saw turnover
fall to HKDollars 1.58bn from HKDollars 3.07bn, but management claimed
Turtle sales had now reached a sustainable level as a 'classic toy line'.
Mr Thomas Chan, managing director, said: '1992 represented a challenging
transitional year for the group. Playmates took a decision to put into place
and implement new initiatives in both toy and non-toy sectors specifically
designed to support future growth.'
This year, the company is banking on the third Turtle film to sustain
interest. Its products based on characters from the film Star Trek: The Next
Generation have recorded strong early sales.
The company purchased in August a 37.5 per cent stake in Ideal Loisir,
France's leading toy maker, for HKDollars 232m. It hopes to use this both to
expand sales in Europe and broaden its product range. Playmates has also
invested in property developments in China and Hong Kong.
But performance remains unpredictable, and the stock market reacted to the
results, with a 25 cent fall in the share price to HKDollars 2.70.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Strong advertising boosts TVB -
Hong Kong Results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION Broadcasts (TVB), Hong Kong's leading television company,
yesterday announced a 46 per cent jump in net profits to HKDollars 365.6m
(USDollars 47m) for 1992, up from HKDollars 249.7m the year before.
The results were ahead of expectations and reflected strong demand for
advertising airtime, due to the buoyant local economy.
The outlook remains positive as the government has lifted restrictions on
advertising property and financial services, and is also reducing the
company's royalty payments for its franchise.
However, TVB is facing increasing competition from Star TV, a regional
satellite broadcaster, and from a cable TV network which is due to be
launched in Hong Kong by the end of 1993.
TVB's full-year profits were made on turnover of HKDollars 1.82bn, up from
HKDollars 1.55bn in 1991. Profit margins have improved, due to a
rationalisation of the company's cost base and improved production
efficiency.
Companies controlled by Sir Run Run Shaw own 35 per cent of TVB, and an
equal stake is owned by Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok. TVB recommended a
final dividend of 47.5 cents a share for 1992, up from 40 cents in 1991.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: USAir says BA ties may
strengthen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR SETH Schofield, chief executive of USAir, said yesterday the alliance
with British Airways could extend well beyond the two carriers' code-sharing
agreement. This was regardless of whether further investment by the British
carrier in his airline was approved by the US government.
BA has invested Dollars 300m for a potential 19.9 per cent stake in the US
airline.
Mr Schofield was speaking before a meeting between 20 senior executives of
both airlines - the first such gathering since the US Department of
Transportation formally approved the code-sharing arrangement and a
wet-lease agreement, on a one-year basis, two weeks ago. The meeting, he
said, was designed to set the agenda and tone for the relationship between
the two airlines, and to assign tasks for exploring joint business
opportunities.
There is a four-man task force, made up of two representatives from each
carrier, studying the operational opportunities.
Mr Schofield said the code-sharing agreement aimed to encompass 38 cities,
and involve four USAir hubs, by January 1994. Under the arrangement, BA
would operate the transatlantic portion of a flight and USAir the internal
US element, but the flight would carry a common designator code in computer
reservation systems.
The USAir chief executive said there was scope for extending the alliance.
This could involve connecting flights more broadly and rescheduling flight
times.
Another possibility would be to combine the two carriers buying power - for
example, over fuel or even aircraft - and to blend operationally in areas
such as ground handling.
Mr Schofield said he was fairly confident there was little threat of
anti-trust litigation - a concern which Northwest Airlines claimed hampered
any significant operational integration with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
'I think we're fine with the Justice Department,' he said, adding that the
BA-USAir arrangement had been structured differently from Northwest-KLM.
In the case of joint buying, Mr Schofield stressed such action would have to
benefit both carriers' business, and might have to be handled by a joint
venture.
The link-up between BA and USAir has been contentious with the big three US
carriers arguing that BA was essentially gaining access to the US domestic
market without the British government giving them additional entry to the UK
and continental Europe.
A Dollars 750m plan which envisaged full integration of BA and USAir and
common branding was withdrawn by BA last December when the US transportation
secretary indicated he would not approve it.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Baltica moves to avert collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BALTICA, Denmark's largest insurance-based financial services group,
yesterday announced moves aimed at averting financial collapse and ending
months of turbulence in the Scandinavian insurance industry.
The group hived off Baltica Holding, the lossmaking parent company, and cut
its shareholding in the insurance arm, Baltica Insurance, from 50.7 per cent
to 24 per cent.
The group also announced that the 1992 group loss climbed to DKr4.4bn
(Dollars 700m), compared with a forecast last October of a loss of between
DKr2.5bn and DKr2.8bn and a profit of DKr271m in 1991.
Baltica Holding's shares, which were suspended on Friday, fell by DKr55 to
DKr100 when the suspension was lifted yesterday. The two biggest
shareholders in Baltica Holding are its troubled Danish rival, Hafnia, with
33.4 per cent, and France's Suez/Victoire group, with 23 per cent.
In a further step, Baltica Insurance offered to buy Hafnia's insurance
operations in what would be an all-Danish solution to a scandal that has
rocked the country's financial sector.
Hafnia Holding, Hafnia's parent company, suspended payments last August. Its
insurance and banking operations have been put up for sale by international
tender.
However, Baltica's chairman, Mr Nils Wilhjelm, admitted yesterday that the
fall in the value of Baltica Holding's shares would not make it any easier
for Hafnia to find a buyer.
Hafnia's board yesterday said it was 'positive' towards Baltica's offer, but
Mr Wilhjelm - who said he would not seek re-election to the boards of either
Baltica Holding or Baltica Insurance - emphasised that no deal had been made
and that the offer would only apply if Hafnia could not find another buyer.
Mr Wilhjelm added that the 1992 losses were so big that the holding company
faced the risk that banks would cancel long-loan agreements.
The proposed solution to Baltica's problem is complex. Baltica Holding is to
set up a wholly-owned subsidiary, which will take over DKr2.1bn of bank debt
in Baltica Holding and shares to the same value in Baltica Insurance. The
new subsidiary would be merged with Baltica Insurance, which would mean that
Baltica Insurance would own 27 per cent of its own shares. It would have to
dispose of these within three years, or write down the value of its shares.
Baltica Insurance's equity capital after yesterday's move would be worth
DKr5.8bn, but after a DKr440m net loss last year, no dividend will be paid.
Baltica Holding's remaining assets would be worth about DKr3bn, Mr Wilhjelm
said. Its liquidity needs have been provided for as part of yesterday's
arrangements, he added. The company will continue to own the loss-making
Baltica Bank and property investments in Gibraltar and Denmark, which are
one of the main sources of the financial problems.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden declines 39% - Housebuilder
confirms revival in UK property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILSON BOWDEN yesterday reported a 50 per cent increase in agreed house
sales in the first 11 weeks of the year, confirming the revival in the UK
property market reported since the new year by estate agents, building
societies and other builders.
The increase follows a dreadful 12 months for the housing market; Wilson
Bowden yesterday announced a 39 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds
16.9m last year.
Since the new year net reservations, sales upon which a deposit has been
paid less cancellations, have risen by 50 per cent compared with the
corresponding period last year. Completed sales over the same period rose by
15 per cent.
Most encouraging was the fact that reservations, after dipping the week
before the Budget, rebounded back to previous high levels last weekend
following the Chancellor's statement.
The final dividend is held at 6.2p, making a maintained total for the year
of 8.7p. This was despite a 40 per cent fall in earnings per share to 14.6p
(24.5p).
The results, although disappointing, were better than many housebuilders
would be reporting for 1992, said Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief
executive. He said the company was well placed to take advantage of
increased sales.
Net debt of just Pounds 16.8m, compared with net cash of Pounds 7m 12 months
previously, meant that gearing was still only 10 per cent of shareholders
funds.
The group, therefore, did not need a rights issue to finance increased sales
but could purchase all the land it needed from its own resources and
borrowings. Gearing was expected to rise to no more than 20 per cent to 25
per cent this year.
During the past 14 months the group has increased the number of housing
sites it owns with planning permission from 7,900 plots to just under
10,000.
The share price rose 3p to 384p following the statement that the group
expected to build at least 20 per cent more homes this year.
Housebuilding profits fell by more than a third last year, from Pounds 21.5m
to Pounds 13.8m, despite a 3 per cent increase in the number of houses sold
to 1,367. Operating margins slipped from 20.3 per cent to 13.5 per cent,
reflecting pressure on house prices, the need to offer discounts to buyers
and other sales incentives as well as higher operating costs.
Commercial property profits fell from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 4.4m as turnover
from property sales slipped from Pounds 30m to Pounds 25.2m.
Mr Wilson said that there was no sign of a pick up in the industrial and
commercial property market which he expected to lag the housing recovery by
at least 12 months
COMMENT
Following its rights issue two years ago, Wilson Bowden largely stayed out
of land buying in 1991. It made up for this last year, raising the number of
plots with planning permission by about a quarter as well as significantly
increasing the number of selling outlets. The timing looks to have been
perfect coinciding with a recovery in house sales. The decision to raise
gearing rather than equity is to be applauded and reflects the strength of
the balance sheet. Margins should increase as sales incentives, worth about
Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 3,000 a house, are eroded. Profits, given a fair
wind, could approach Pounds 20m this year putting the shares on a
prospective p/e of more than 20. A class act but one which, unfortunately
for stockholders, is already recognised in the share price.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Refocused Bunzl leaps to Pounds 45m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REFOCUSED Bunzl, the paper and packaging group, more than doubled pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 21.1m to Pounds 45.1m, for the year ending December 31.
Sales fell back from Pounds 1.4bn to Pounds 1.3bn due to a series of
disposals which took place last year.
Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, said the group had completed its
rationalisation programme and refocused the business. 'We are now looking at
a series of strategic acquisitions'.
Trading profit increased to Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 49.7m before exceptionals)
with average margins rising from 3.6 per cent to 4.4 per cent.
Bunzl's biggest earner, the papers and plastics operations, increased
operating profit from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 31.6m. Fine paper's profits
slipped from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 13m. Mr Habgood said the division's
expansion in Germany was proving difficult in the midst of a recession.
Cigarette filters increased profits from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 10.4m and
recently expanded by opening a US factory.
Building supplies reported a fall in profits, from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds
700,000, after taking the costs of further restructuring through the trading
line.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 108.8m to Pounds 100.6m, representing
gearing of 46.7 per cent.
A strong focus on working capital increased net cash flow from Pounds 8m to
Pounds 34.7m. Shareholders' funds rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 215.3m - the
first year-end increase in six years.
Earnings per share rose to 6.7p (1.5p). The final dividend is maintained at
2.2p making an unchanged total of 4p.
COMMENT
Bunzl's new management has achieved what it set out to do 18 months ago. But
after identifying the core businesses following a big restructuring
programme, investors may be wondering how the increase in earnings can be
sustained. Although most of the rationalisation has been completed, Bunzl
has by no means exhausted the opportunity of tightening operational
procedures and increasing efficiency. If this continues then so should the
increase in margins. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 57m, the
shares, up 2p to 132p, are on a prospective multiple of 16.3. With its
continued potential to move forward, its premium to the market looks
justified.

<TEXT>
ASARCO, THE North American integrated copper producer, has renewed efforts
to establish links with KGHM, the state-owned producer from Lubin, in South
Western Poland.
Yesterday Asarco together with Mitsui and Bechtel met with representatives
of KGHM in nearby Wroclaw to discuss proposals 'for the development of the
environment protection industry' in Poland, a cryptic communique stated.
KGHM last year paid 395bn zloty (USDollars 23.8m) in pollution fines and
would have paid a further Z344bn if the government had not reduced the
charges last autumn.
Last year Asarco proposed a management agreement to KGHM after exploring the
prospects for capital investment. However feeling against foreign investment
within KGHM continues to run high and Asarco have now withdrawn their
proposal. Western Mining of Australia has also shown interest in investing
in KGHM.
Last year the combine produced 387,000 tonnes of copper, 2.3 per cent more
than in 1991 despite a 32-day strike last summer. KGHM also produced 914
tonnes of silver last year. Net profits reached Z1,160bn of which Z606bn was
spent on capital investment.

Shanghai wine project

<TEXT>
REMY Pacifique, the Hong Kong subsidiary of Remy Cointreau, has nearly
doubled its stake in a Chinese wine production joint venture.
The investment follows a four-year experiment growing French vines near
Shanghai where the climate was once considered unfavourable.
The first wine from the 60-acre vineyard - 150,000 bottles of Imperial Court
sparkling wine produced in the methode champenoise - went on sale locally in
January.
Remy has increased its holding in the venture from 32 per cent to 60 per
cent, with the remaining 40 per cent split equally between its partners,
Shanghai Foodstuffs and Shanghai Malu Xian.
The Shanghai venture is Remy's second investment in wine production in
China. It has been involved since 1979 in the Dynasty Winery in Tiajin.

YVES Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, suffered a sharp fall in net
profits to FFr130m (Dollars 23.4m) in 1992 from FFr233m in 1991.
The group was hit by the sluggish state of the global luxury goods market
and a FFr40m loss on the launch of a new skin-care range. This may aggravate
the political row over its FFr3.6bn acquisition earlier this year by
Elf-Sanofi, a subsidiary of Elf-Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group.
YSL turnover slipped from FFr3.01bn in 1991 to FFr3.0bn, but operating
profits declined dramatically to FFr379m from FFr512m over the same period.
The group was also affected by the impact of the rationalisation of its
licensing interests and of its perfume business, where it reduced sales to
certain countries to counter the threat of the 'grey' market, or discount
sector.
The group hopes to improve in 1993, given that most of the problems that
depressed its results in 1992 would not recur. The skin-care range should
make a positive contribution, as should the new women's perfume that the
group is launching later this year. YSL also expects to benefit from a
reduction in financial costs, due to a debt reorganisation.

THE US Department of Justice announced yesterday it would file an anti-trust
suit to prevent Boston-based Gillette from purchasing Parker Pen on the
grounds that such a sale would have an anti-competitive effect on the market
for premium fountain pens, writes Lisa Bransten in Washington.
The suit could block Gillette's attempt to become the world's largest seller
of all types of pens. Gillette holds approximately 7 per cent of the world
pen market, while its leading competitor, Societe BIC, holds about 8 per
cent.
With Parker, Gillette would control 15 per cent of the world market. The
Justice Department contends that Gillette and Parker, together with one
other company, control 80 per cent of the premium fountain pen market.

Under the agreement negotiated by the two companies in September, the deal
will be voided if there is still any litigation pending in May.
Gillette believes the purchase will not have an anti-competitive effect. The
company expressed disappointment with the government's decision to go ahead
with the suit.
They said that 80 per cent of Parker pens were sold outside the US, and the
governments of the UK, France, Germany and Canada had approved the sale.
Gillette sees the purchase of Parker as a way to round out its existing
product line.

FT  23 MAR 93 / US brewer in Mexican deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANHEUSER-Busch, the giant American brewer has agreed to buy 18 per cent of
Grupo Modelo, Mexico's largest brewer, for about Dollars 477m (Pounds 335m).
The deal would represent one of the largest foreign equity investments in
Mexico, and the first in the tightly controlled beer market.
Mr Juan Sanchez Navarro, vice-president of Modelo, said the joint venture
'is an example of strategic associations that will be increasingly seen in
other sectors' as Mexican businesses gear up for the implications of free
trade in North America.
Modelo's only rival in Mexico, Femsa, is also looking for a foreign partner
in its soft drink and beer businesses.
Under the terms of the venture, Anheuser-Busch will buy a 10 per cent stake
in Grupo Modelo and another 10 per cent in its fully-owned subsidiary Diblo,
giving it an effective 17.7 per cent of the Modelo Group.
After Anheuser acquires its stake, the privately controlled Grupo Modelo
intends to seek a listing on the Mexican stock market. It plans to issue 13
per cent of its capital split equally between Mexican and international
markets, for which it hopes to receive around Dollars 270m.
Modelo controls 51 per cent of Mexico's domestic beer market and makes
Mexico's best selling international beer, Corona. It has sales of around
Dollars 1.5bn, making it the tenth biggest brewer in the world. Exports - to
56 countries - are worth Dollars 150m.
Anheuser has an option to increase its stake to 35 per cent. It will take
three seats on Modelo's board of directors, while Modelo will have one on
Anheuser's.
The two companies will exchange personnel and information in areas such as
finances, marketing and distribution.
Modelo will remain the sole importer of Anheuser beer, including the
Budweiser brand, continuing an agreement it has had since 1989.
Because of Modelo's existing contractual agreements in the US, Anheuser will
not import Modelo beer into the US. But Corona will work more closely with
Anheuser in exports to Europe and other markets.
Mr Sanchez Navarro said the money raised from the stake will help finance
Modelo's eighth brewery, which is being built in Zacatecas, Mexico. This
will be Mexico's largest brewery and will benefit from Anheuser's
technology.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Train route to the Channel must cross credibility gap: The
difficulties facing the latest plan for a tunnel link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST people who have followed the saga of the Channel tunnel rail link have
lost count of the versions of the project that have appeared over the past
five years. So the big question arising out of the Pounds 2.5bn scheme
announced yesterday is: can this be the real thing?
When international express train services start running through the tunnel
next year passengers will experience very different travelling conditions on
either side of the Channel.
In France the express trains will run on purpose-built high-speed lines at
up to 200mph. On the British side they will have to mingle with commuter
trains on existing tracks and could be lucky to average 60mph.
British Rail has been trying since 1988 to even things up by building a
high-speed line on the British side of the tunnel. Two obstacles have stood
in its way. First, the objections of property owners in this
densely-populated corner of England, and second, the sheer cost of embarking
on what would rank as one of the biggest UK construction projects of the
century.
BR's opening attempt to get the line built came in July 1988, when it
produced a choice of four routes from the coast to the capital. This
provoked uproar in the Tory heartland of Kent, and the cost of the project
soared as BR accepted the inevitability of putting more and more of the line
in tunnel.
The following year BR narrowed the options down to a proposal for a southern
approach to the capital with terminals at Waterloo and King's Cross. But the
government baulked at the Pounds 3.1bn cost and asked for private-sector
involvement to bring the project under control. The result was the creation
of Eurorail, a consortium consisting of BR, Trafalgar House and BICC.
By spring 1990 Eurorail had produced a plan to build a line similar to BR's
but for Pounds 500m less. Even with that saving, however, the project failed
to produce a commercial return. So the consortium asked the government to
give it Pounds 900m in cash grants and Pounds 1.1bn in interest-free loans
to get the scheme under way. The government angrily refused and threw the
project back to BR.
Another year passed as BR went through the motions of reassessing all the
route options. To no one's great surprise, it eventually concluded that the
route it had always favoured was the best, and asked the government for
Pounds 3.5bn to build it. This time the government not only refused the
money but threw out the route. It told BR to go away and draw up plans for
an eastern approach to the capital that could be funded entirely by the
private sector.
The fruits of that exercise came yesterday, when Union Railways, the BR
subsidiary in charge of the project, produced its Pounds 2.5bn plan. But
even before the ink had dried on its proposals the government had embarked
on another U-turn, conceding that a private-sector scheme would need a
'substantial' injection of public-sector cash.
So will the government come up with the money? One obstacle is section 42 of
the Channel Tunnel Act, which forbids the British and French governments
from subsidising Channel tunnel rail services, on the grounds that this
would provide unfair competition for the ferries and airlines.
The government can get around this by paying grants in recognition of some
of the domestic benefits the line will bring - first, through the
introduction of new, fast Kent commuter services, and second, through the
regenerative effects it will have on the east Thames corridor.
Union Railways calculates the potential commuter benefits at Pounds 1.1bn,
while the environment department calculates the potential regeneration
benefits at Pounds 500m.
That should be enough to tip the project into profit. The only questions
remaining are where the money is to come from and when it is going to be
paid.
Unfortunately these are very big questions, and Pounds 1.6bn is a very big
sum - particularly in the context of present constraints on public spending.
Given the Treasury's unwillingness to put its hand in its pocket each
previous time the Channel tunnel rail link has come up, there is unlikely to
be widespread confidence that things will be very different this time.
Most will believe the project is going ahead when they see the first sod
cut.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (4): IBM
strategy for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING IBM's 1992 losses, chairman John Akers said: 'Our financial
results are not acceptable to us or our shareholders. We are taking
aggressive actions to improve our competitiveness and profitability.'
The actions include: intensifying the focus on key growth areas: IBM will
continue to invest in growth areas such as client-server computing,
networking, RISC technology and multimedia.
IBM's marketing and services units will dedicate extra resources to growth
areas including consulting, systems integration and services.
Revenue from sources other than hardware sales amounted to 48 per cent of
total revenues in 1992, compared with 43 per cent in 1991.
Further reducing costs: IBM cut its workforce by more than 40,000 employees
in 1992. In 1993, another 25,000 jobs will go, primarily in businesses
related to large systems.

<TEXT>
NET PROFIT at Interbrew, the Belgian brewer which owns the Stella Artois and
Jupiler beer brands, slipped to BFr1.54bn (Dollars 45m) from BFr2.14bn in
the year to September 30 1992.
The family-owned group, Europe's fifth-largest brewer, said yesterday that
operating profits had risen by 11.2 per cent from BFr2.1bn to BFr2.43bn in
the same period, after depreciation, but increased financial charges and
taxes cut into the profit.
Interbrew is looking for a permanent successor to Mr Jose Dedeurwaerder, who
unexpectedly resigned as managing director last month. Mr Jean-Marie
Descarpenteries, who was brought in to maintain continuity, said yesterday
he hoped to find a successor 'as soon as possible', probably from within the
company.
Mr Dedeurwaerder, a US citizen, was given the task of turning the company
round and giving it an international dimension when he took over in
mid-1988. He resigned 'for personal reasons'.
Mr Jacques Thierry, Interbrew's chairman, yesterday denied he had fallen out
with the family shareholders or the rest of the board.
Mr Descarpenteries paid tribute to Mr Dedeurwaerder's achievements and said
he would concentrate on improving profit margins and developing the group's
beer and soft drinks business on the European market, including eastern
Europe.
He pointed out that Interbrew's long-term aim of a stock market flotation
would be impossible while the company was less profitable than its principal
European competitors.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Galeries Lafayette shrugs off
retail sector problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GALERIES Lafayette, the French department store, managed to stay in the
black last year despite the sluggish state of the French retail sector and
the problems of its recently-opened New York store.
The group, which made net profits of FFr300.8m (Dollars 54m) in 1991,
refused to comment on the exact level of profits last year before its
financial results are published in late April. However, it stayed in profit
last year in spite of a fall in turnover to FFr31.9bn from FFr33bn in 1991.
Galeries Lafayette was also hit by the cost of opening its store on Fifth
Avenue in Manhattan. It has made provisions on the cost of the New York
venture, which it said would be 'substantial'.
Another difficulty has been the cost of financing the group's FFr2.87bn bid
for the Nouvelles Galeries chain. Galeries Lafayette made a partial
FFr2.15bn bid in 1991 for a 72.5 per cent stake in Nouvelles Galeries, but
last year bid FFr718m for the remaining shares.
The strains on Galeries Lafayette last year demonstrate the general
pressures within French retailing, and the turbulence within the department
stores sector, which has been destabilised by a series of deals including
the Pinault group's takeover of the Au Printemps chain. Galeries Lafayette
has recently been cited as a potential purchaser for Prisunic, the general
stores owned by Pinault.

FT  23 MAR 93 / German politicians threatened by series of scandals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S battered political establishment, facing a wave of public
indifference and voter apathy, is being further undermined by a series of
petty scandals threatening the good names of its leading politicians.
None of the offences would on its own seem likely to cause a resignation, in
spite of the enthusiasm with which they are pursued by the German media. Yet
together they have knocked the political establishment several points
further down the scale of public popularity, and could yet cause heads to
roll.
Top of the hit list are Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social
Democrats, and Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the
Bavaria-based Christian Social Union.
Close behind comes Mr Gunther Krause, the transport minister whom motorists
love to hate for threatening to introduce a motorway tax. He has been
accused of claiming a social security subsidy for employing a cleaning lady.
Bringing up the rear are Mr Max Streibl, prime minister of wealthy Bavaria,
a close ally of Mr Waigel, and Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader to Mr
Engholm in the SPD and prime minister of Saarland.
Mr Streibl took a free holiday to Brazil with a leading Bavarian
businessman; Mr Lafontaine was accused of employing as his bodyguard a
well-known criminal with gangland connections.
Most of them deny their alleged offences, or if they admit them, insist that
they were pecadilloes of the greatest political insignificance.
Yet all are acutely aware that less than three months ago Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, the former economics minister and aspiring leader of the Free
Democratic party, lost his political head in just such a second-rate
scan-dal.
Mr Engholm's scandal is perhaps the most complex. He is accused of - and
firmly denies - knowing about how close associates paid cash to an official
working for their Christian Democrat opponents in Schleswig-Holstein, after
the official had exposed a dirty tricks campaign by the CDU against Mr
Engholm.
The sum of money is modest - DM40,000 (Dollars 24,000) - and Mr Engholm's
offence is no more than denying any knowledge of the payment. Yet his public
popularity has plummeted in recent days, and his party colleagues seem less
than enthusiastic about rallying to his defence.
Mr Waigel is the latest to stumble into the line of fire, accused of
protecting a Bavarian meat trader from being brought to court for allegedly
claiming export subsidies illegally.
Big guns were brought out yesterday to defend him, including a firm
statement of support from Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLISH government said yesterday it would push ahead with a programme
for mass privatisation despite parliament's rejection of the plan, Reuter
reports from Warsaw.
In a shock defeat for the government and its economic reforms, parliament
last week threw out the plan to privatise 600 state companies via
western-managed investment funds and distribute shares to the public.
Government officials said the cabinet had decided to amend the long-delayed
programme, taking account of some opposition objections, and send it back to
parliament.
But they said the cabinet was ready to start implementing the plan if
parliament delayed it.
Privatisation ministry director Jerzy Thieme told a news briefing that
existing laws did not prohibit the government from creating the funds,
although it could not start handing out shares without parliamentary
approval.
Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka's ruling coalition sees the programme as an
essential plank of radical market reforms begun after the collapse of
communism in 1989.
The 200 companies, all of which have taken the first steps towards
privatisation, would be transferred to between five and eight investment
funds.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Wave of immigration at new peak: Western Europe and North

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WESTERN Europe and North America each received more than 1m immigrants in
1991 and 1992, a United Nations Conference on European population, which
opens today in Geneva, is to be told.
The total, mainly relatives joining earlier immigrants and a new wave of
asylum seekers, is higher than the previous peak in the early 1960s,
according to Mr David Coleman, a demographer at Oxford University.
Immigrants are not generally economically beneficial to their host
countries, he argues, although they may solve short-term labour problems.
'Only around 60 per cent of the potential workforce in western Europe is
actually working and there is plenty of slack to cope with future labour
demand,' he says. The past availability of cheap labour may be one factor
behind Europe's relative lack of investment in high technology industries,
he adds.
The immigration numbers include 250,000 leaving Yugoslavia last year.
Germany last year took 438,000 asylum seekers, two thirds of the European
total.
But so far 'it is Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia which are taking the
brunt of Russians, gipsies and Romanians from the east,' Mr Coleman says.
An outbreak of fighting in Russia could intensify the pressure for westward
migration, and pressure will come too from the projected rise of nearly 2bn
in the populations of the south Mediterranean, tropical Africa and south
Asia in the next 12 years.
The conference, one of five regional debates before next year's UN World
Population Conference in Cairo, is expected to call for more money to be
spent on family planning to curb high rates of population growth in
developing countries.
The UN Population Fund wants the total amount of money spent each year to
double from the present level of Dollars 4.5bn by the year 2000. Developed
countries contribute only Dollars 800m of the total, and the Population Fund
the main UN family planning agency, has seen its budget frozen at Dollars
238m.
The conference will also hear warnings that current projections of the
world's population could need considerable revision.
By the year 2050, the world's stable population could be anywhere between
5bn and 20bn, according to Mr Miroslav Macura, of the UN Economic Commission
for Europe. Present estimates of a doubling in population from the present
5.5bn by that date could be altered by small changes in fertility rates, he
said.
Scientists are also arguing that traditional assumptions between economic
development and falling birth rates - captured in the phrase 'Development is
the best contraception' - no longer appear true. Gulf states have seen
fertility rates - the average family size if the current birth rate were
maintained - of around three, compared to a European average of around 1.7,
despite a huge increase in wealth. Mr Macura also points out that Thailand,
Sri Lanka, and Bulgaria have seen sharp falls in birth rate despite low
prosperity levels.
Social changes in Europe are causing sharp fluctuations in birth rate. East
German fertility rates, which were 1.6 before German unification compared to
West Germany's 1.4, have now fallen to 0.8 because of uncertainty. However
the increasing prosperity of Italy and Spain is thought to be responsible
for the fall in fertility rates to about 1.2, below West German levels.

J Rothschild Assurance, Sir Mark Weinberg's latest life insurance venture,
has recruited another establishment figure to its board. Anthony Loehnis,
57, a former overseas director of the Bank of England, has become a
non-executive director.
Loehnis, who resigned as a vice chairman of SG Warburg at the end of last
year, is already on the board of J Rothschild International Assurance. His
decision to increase his involvement adds to the credibility of a new
financial services venture which is already starting to make a mark in the
fiercely competitive life insurance business. Dennis Stevenson, 47, chairman
of SRU Group and the trustees of the Tate Gallery, as well as being a member
of the City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers and a non-exec-utive director of
Pearson, is also an outside director.
In its first year of operation J Rothschild Assurance put on over Pounds
100m of new life insurance business. Set up by Lord Rothschild's St James
Place Capital and Scottish Amicable, it has opened 14 offices and has a
national salesforce of over 400. Chief executive Mike Wilson, 50, who has
worked with Sir Mark Weinberg in his previous ventures, such as Abbey Life
and Allied Dunbar, says that the intention is to float the company on the
stock market by 1997.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Business Law: Air crash verdict - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A jury in Rochester, New York, has awarded Dollars 107.3m, the largest
verdict in aviation crash history, to the estate of a family of four who
died in a crash in North Carolina in November 1986. A jury found the
aircraft's engine manufacturer, Teledyne Continental Motors, negligent
because it had known about problems with the engine from correspondence with
the pilot.
Unusually for a verdict of this size, none of the award was for punitive
damages. The previous highest jury award for an air crash victim was Dollars
8m against Delta Airlines for the 1985 death of the head of IBM's personal
computer division and his wife.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Business Law: More US states seek share of punitive awards -
Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The debate on large awards of punitive damages in the US, fuelled by the
recent award of Dollars 101m against General Motors, has prompted three more
states - Texas, Indiana and New Jersey - to introduce legislation making a
percentage of any punitive award payable to state funds.
The Texas bill calls for 50 per cent of punitive awards to be paid to the
state. Indiana proposes that 75 per cent of any punitive award should go to
its Victim and Witness Assistance Program, and New Jersey wants 75 per cent
of any punitive award paid to the state's Uncompensated Care Trust Fund,
which reimburses hospitals for those patients who cannot afford to pay.
Meanwhile, a plaintiff in Florida who lost 60 per cent of his Dollars
512,600 award under similar legislation has appealed to the US Supreme
Court, alleging that such legislation is unconstitutional. The court has
already ruled against similar laws in Colorado and Georgia.

FT  23 MAR 93 / People: Bowing to Japanese wisdom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape, the motor and business services group, has appointed a senior
Japanese executive, Hachiro Koyama, as non-executive chairman of the UK
company's Japanese subsidiary, Inchcape Dodwell.
Koyama, 70, is vice-president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation in
Japan and also representative director and chairman of SmithKline Beecham
there. He previously held executive positions with Standard Vacuum Oil,
Mobil Oil and Johnson Wax Japan.
Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, says the appointment of someone
of Koyama's stature underlines the importance of Japan to Inchcape, and the
group's efforts to develop a strong cadre of Japanese management.
The Tokyo-based subsidiary employs 2,000 people, nearly all of whom are
Japanese.
Inchcape's motors business in Japan consists of a new joint venture with
Peugeot to import and distribute the French group's cars, and a
Mercedes-Benz dealership in Tokyo. The UK group also represents nine
Japanese manufacturers, such as Toyota and Mazda, in world markets.
Inchcape's Japanese marketing businesses in Japan cover consumer goods,
industrial products and business machines, and its service businesses are
involved in shipping, insurance and testing.
In January Sir John Whitehead, former British ambassador to Japan, was
appointed to advise Inchcape's London board on Japanese affairs.
Inchcape has also announced the retirement of Peter Laister, 64, after
nearly 10 years as a non-executive director. A former chairman of Thorn-EMI
and the Maxwell Communication Corporation, Laister will now concentrate on
his other business interests, including the chairmanship of the Nimbus Group
of companies, which are involved in records, compact discs and CD-ROM
technology to store technical information.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Business Law: Challenge to legal basis for waste directive
rejected - European Law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice last week rejected a joint challenge by the
European Commission and the European Parliament to the legal basis chosen by
the Council for a directive on waste.
A proposal for the directive was first put forward by the Commission in
1988. The legal basis suggested by the Commission for the directive related
to the establishment and functioning of the single market. The Council
adopted the proposal but chose a different legal basis related specifically
to the protection of the environment.
At stake was the relative power of the Commission and the Parliament to
influence the final shape of the directive. Under the single market
legislative procedure the Commission and the Parliament have greater powers
of negotiation with the Council over the adoption of amendments than under
the environmental legislative procedure.
The Court said the choice of legal basis had to be based on objective
criteria capable of judicial control. The most important criteria were the
aims and content of the legislation in question.
It ruled that although there were certain elements in the directive which
impacted on the functioning of the single market - for instance the
introduction of a common definition of waste and related activities  - the
main aim and contents related to environmental protection. The legal basis
chosen by the Council was therefore correct.
The Parliament attempted to introduce a new ground for judicial review which
had not been raised by the Commission. The Court rejected it on the grounds
that an intervening party is limited to supporting the arguments put forward
by one of the main parties.
C-155/91: Commission (with the European Parliament intervening) v Council
(with Spain intervening), ECJ FC, 17 March 1993.
German rules on foreign seamen upheld.
The European Court has ruled that German rules which allow its merchant navy
to employ seamen from outside the Community who are neither domiciled nor
resident in Germany on less favourable terms than German seamen are not
contrary to the Rome treaty.
The case arose out of a dispute between a ship operator and its works
council. The ship operator wanted to employ a Filipino radio operator and
five other Filipino ratings. Under German law non-EC seamen can be employed
on ships flying the German flag without being subject to German law and in
particular without the necessity to pay the social security contributions
payable for German workers.
The dispute went before the national court at which point the works council
claimed the relevant German rules were contrary to Rome treaty provisions on
state aid and general social conditions.
The European Court said the national rules, effectively allowing Germany to
discriminate in favour of non-German seamen, were valid.
The rules did not constitute state aid. The Court rejected the Commission's
argument that they did because their aim - to make the German merchant navy
more competitive by granting advantages to it - clearly encapsulated all the
elements of state aid.
In order for a measure to come within the scope of the Rome treaty
provisions on state aid it was necessary to show that the advantages in
question arose directly from a grant by the state in question or through
resources of that state.
In relation to social conditions the court said implementation of the
objective of the rules was for the national authorities to determine.

FT  23 MAR 93 / People: Aldridge sweeps away from Hays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ronnie Frost, executive chairman of business services company Hays, has
lured on to his board 42-year-old Mark Aldridge, chief executive of the
cleaning services division of BET, another, considerably less successful,
business services group. Frost hereby puts the final touches to a senior
management structure that he thinks will see the company through the next
decade.
He admits he has been looking to fill this position for 18 months and has
been talking to Aldridge for the last six. 'In the end, despite what was
offered him by John Clark (BET's chief executive) he was not persuaded to
stay on.' It is understood that, having turned around the cleaning division,
he was about to be transferred to another problem area.
Aldridge wins plaudits for his performance at Biffa, a business he started
from scratch and built into one of the UK's leading waste disposal concerns.
BET sold Biffa in 1991 to Severn Trent at a multiple of 18 times earnings.
At the cleaning division, meanwhile, Frost says Aldridge 'cut a hell of a
lot of staff and won several worldwide contracts'. But despite the efforts
of Clark, who has been trying to revive BET since he arrived two years ago,
the group is 'too broad and has too many problem divisions', in the opinion
of Frost.
Whereas Aldridge was not on the board of BET, he will be in charge of the
commercial and personnel divisions of Hays, between them currently
furnishing about 43 per cent of group profits.
Personnel, Frost claims, is now bouncing back, after a difficult period, and
the chairman is keen to see 'growth by acquisition as well as organically'
in the commercial division. 'Mark is a great ideas man. He is just the boy
for that.'
In December, Michael Proffitt and Dennis Matthewman joined the Hays board.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Business Law: Crime and the City solution - The American
approach to tackling market misconduct may not work in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A central theme of the debate in the UK on reform of long fraud trials has
been whether more white-collar 'offences' should be taken out of the
criminal justice system and dealt with by City of London financial
regulators.
Advocates of making greater use of the administrative and regulatory regimes
for tackling market misconduct base their case on the apparent success that
the US has enjoyed in recent years with such an approach. However, research
published last week by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, chaired by
Lord Runciman, casts doubt on the benefits to be gained from adopting
similar methods in the UK.
The study, the first large-scale review of serious fraud since the 1986
Roskill Fraud Trials Report, concludes that there is considerable doubt in
the City and elsewhere about whether self-regulatory organisations would
have taken disciplinary action in recent high-profile cases, such as Blue
Arrow and Guinness, unless put under political pressure. The report
concedes, however, that there have been some cases, or parts of
prosecutions, which could have been dealt with outside the criminal justice
system.
The author of the report, Professor Michael Levi of Cardiff University, also
casts doubt on the notion that the US approach has been measurably better at
tackling white-collar crime than the UK system.
Allied to the suggestion that greater use should be made in the UK of
regulatory bodies when dealing with market 'offences' is the notion that the
UK has too many overlapping regulatory bodies and that some agency
equivalent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission is needed to reduce
inter-organisational rivalry, which may allow some white-collar 'offences'
to slip through the net.
Prof Levi points out, however, that the perceived superiority of the SEC
when it comes to dealing with market misconduct is largely because it is
underpinned by an extensive edifice of stock exchange and state securities
regulators.
Indeed, because most securities dealing is done under state jurisdiction
rather than federal, most official action in the US is taken by state
regulators, rather than by the SEC. In 1989, for example, the 1,258 state
personnel involved in regulation initiated a total of 3,678 enforcement
actions, including 335 criminal proceedings resulting in 253 convictions.
This compares with 310 actions taken by the SEC over the same period,
including less than a dozen criminal prosecutions initiated as a result of
SEC referral.
The reputation of the SEC was built in part on the spectacular junk-bond
insider-dealing prosecutions of Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky and Michael
Milken in the late 1980s. But it should not be forgotten that for over two
years before these successes the SEC had made 20 failed attempts at
investigations into what turned out to be Levine's insider trades. It was an
anonymous letter from Venezuela to Merrill Lynch, via the firm passing the
file on to the SEC, that finally led to the successful prosecution of
Levine. This in turn triggered the wave of plea-bargaining with him and
Boesky which led eventually to Michael Milken.
The fact that the UK insider-dealing prosecutions have produced nothing of
an even remotely comparable status may be due to any number of reasons. It
may show that the UK system is badly designed, or that such offences are
inherently unprosecutable, or that no such important figures are involved in
Britain. But it is difficult to say that an SEC-style system in Britain
would have produced such spectacular results.
For many people the SEC's attraction lies in its ability to combine civil
and administrative remedies and the use of 'Wells submissions' - an informal
bargaining process between the SEC and the 'accused' designed to filter
cases which should not proceed to criminal prosecution.
The ability to freeze assets held in America and overseas and to fine
'offenders' vast sums - such as the Dollars 250m fine imposed on Salomon
Brothers for breach of the US Treasury bond auction rules (compare that with
the largest UK insider-dealing fine to date of Pounds 25,000) - certainly
has superficial attractions.
But the US system is not without its critics. The American Bar Association
has accused the SEC of using administrative actions as a way of evading
constitutional safeguards for the accused and winning cases which they could
not hope to prove to a criminal standard of proof. The failure of a number
of recent securities fraud prosecutions in the US suggests that courts and
juries are also beginning to react against the whole approach to tackling
market misconduct.
Prof Levi's point is that none of these facts or observations 'prove' the
superiority of the administrative/regulatory approach over the criminal
process or vice versa. If the UK was to move towards a regulatory approach
to market misconduct it would need to be sure that a number of conditions
would be met.
Regulators would have to be able to show that they are capable of working
more quickly, cheaply and fairly than the criminal courts. They would have
to show they could handle the sort of heavyweight cases such as Blue Arrow
that the SFO has been criticised by some people for prosecuting.
The government would also have to be sure that the sanctions available to
them were sufficient to satisfy the public that disciplinary action was not
a soft option and that the regulatory bodies had the political will to act
against leading corporate and professional figures.
Prof Levi says it is difficult to be confident of any of these things. In
particular he says it is hard to see which cases dealt with recently by
either the fraud investigation group of the Crown Prosecution Service or by
the Serious Fraud Office could plausibly have been dealt with by
disciplinary means, although some complex parts involving market practice
might usefully have been hived off.
Many securities cases involve theft of assets and it would be a very big
step to take them out of the courts. Even if people in the City agreed that
something was 'a regulatory breach rather than a crime for gain, the public
might not see it in quite the same light', he says.
These views are echoed by Mr George Staple, director of the SFO. Writing
recently in the Modern Law Review, Mr Staple asks whether it would be right
for someone alleged to have committed fraud to go before a self-regulatory
disciplinary tribunal which had no power to send him to prison and without
the public opprobrium which attaches to being found guilty in a criminal
court.
'Most people would take the view that the criminal justice system could not
possibly abdicate responsibility for dealing with serious criminal conduct
of this kind,' he said.
There is a further problem with placing greater emphasis on the regulatory
process - what to do with people such as Mr Roger Levitt, head of the
collapsed Levitt Group, and Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck,
both of whom are due to stand trial in September and who are not required to
be members of any authorised body.
Clearly it would be wrong for the method of dealing with those accused of
white-collar offences to be determined by whether they belong to a
regulatory body.
The Royal Commission's views on long fraud trials will not be known until
the summer. But it already seems clear that the scope for taking more
white-collar offences out of the criminal justice system is limited.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Technology: A cautionary computer tale - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE acquittal last week of Paul Bedworth, the 19-year-old former hacker
charged under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, begs several questions, not
least whether the act is ripe for review and redraft.
Before the UK lawmakers start to fiddle with the fine detail, however, two
points need to be resolved.
First, is Bedworth's case evidence of a genuinely new social phenomenon, in
which immature and susceptible minds are being damaged through prolonged
exposure to personal computers?
Second, what measures can individuals and organisations take to protect
their computer systems against unauthorised access, whether motivated by
malice or not?
Bedworth's case raised widespread interest because it was the first test of
the Computer Misuse Act, designed specifically to put a stop to hacking and
other attempts to interfere with computer systems. He admitted he hacked
into a number of systems including one operated by the Financial Times.
To secure a guilty verdict under the act, the prosecution had to show he
intended to modify the systems he broke into. His acquittal was secured on
psychiatric evidence that he had become clinically addicted to hacking; he
no longer knew why he did it and was no more able to stop than a heroin
addict can give up the drug without help.
There are fears Bedworth's acquittal could form the basis of a 'hackers'
charter', the green light for an army of computer-literate hooligans to
pillage the world's databases at will, pleading insanity when caught.
Certainly, future cases will require the most careful assessment. Assuming,
as one must, that the psychiatrists interpreted Bedworth's symptoms
accurately, however, there are profound questions to be asked about our
understanding of the effects of exposure to computers.
Bedworth, as his barrister pointed out, is a second-generation hacker, an
individual who grew up as familiar with computers as earlier generations did
with television. There are still unresolved arguments about the influence of
television on individual behaviour, so it is no surprise that almost nothing
is known of the consequences of close contact with personal computers over a
protracted period, especially where individuals with personality disorders
are concerned. Computers are now bought for young children on the grounds
they are educational accessories.
It is clearly an area that would repay further study. The computer is the
most complex machine mankind has invented; for some it can be a tool, a way
of amplifying personal abilities. For others, as Bedworth and others have so
amply demonstrated, it can be an escape to another kind of existence where
the rules and disciplines of the real world have been suspended.
Computer users and suppliers have to live in that real world and it is high
time they took their responsibilities seriously. It is a nonsense that a
youngster with a cheap microcomputer was able to break into important
computer systems with, apparently, no great effort.
As the British Computer Society observed, the law can no more protect those
who do not safeguard their information systems than it can prevent burglary
at unprotected premises.
The greatest benefit of the Bedworth case may be to raise awareness of the
threats to computer systems through the telecommunications links which
connect them together. Premises are locked on the assumption that an open
door is an invitation to crime. Computer users have to assume their systems
are under continuous threat and apply the appropriate safeguards. Some are
cheap and simple - an automatic call back device which only allows access
from authorised telephone numbers, for example.
Unless computer users protect their systems adequately, invoking the law
against obsessed individuals as Bedworth has been portrayed seems merely
vindictive.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Technology: Putting a price on research - How Britain's
privatised companies are costing their R&amp;D activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT BT's world-renowned telecommunications laboratories, at Martlesham Heath,
Suffolk, the days of research for its own sake are over. That is a luxury
that a commercially orientated, competitive BT cannot afford.
Since the public share flotation in 1984, BT has undergone a radical
transformation driven by the need to identify and then service the
requirements of its customers, namely BT's three operating divisions - from
which comes up to 80 per cent of the R&amp;D budget - and corporate
headquarters.
Historically, the research and development operations were operated as a
conventional hierarchy, easy to administer but inflexible. Today, 30 R&amp;D
divisions deliver projects - up to 800 different ones are in progress at any
one time.
The bulk of BT's R&amp;D work is still carried out at Martlesham, which employs
more than 3,000 people, and at other laboratories in London, Ipswich,
Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. The emphasis is on providing Britain's
telephone network with an ever-increasing degree of intelligence; about two
thirds of the work is highly practical software engineering.
While privatisation forced BT to determine how to put a price on its
research and development programme, other recently privatised companies had
already tackled the problem. British Gas, for example, has had to grapple
with how to cost-justify its R&amp;D since 1972, says Gerald Clerehugh, group
director of research and technology. But only for the past two years has it
started billing its customers - other parts of British Gas - for its
research work. The result, says Clerehugh, is sharpened accountability.
British Gas's research includes everything from offshore computer modelling
to gas-powered vehicles, tumble driers and air-conditioning units. Deciding
which of the pile of proposals to adopt is pure economics, says Clerehugh.
'We pick the ones with the best returns to the company.'
Within British Gas, all the 'customers' are asked what a particular project
is worth to them and how much expenditure it will save. Projects which get
the go-ahead - 'even the dizzy ones' - have been evaluated to get some idea
of their value, implementation costs included.
Clerehugh says he likes to pay for his R&amp;D budget in a year twice over.
(Total R&amp;D spending for British Gas for the coming year is in the region of
Pounds 90m.)
The task is not clear-cut and assumptions have to be made. If a safety
device prevents accidents happening, then how much is that device worth,
asks Clerehugh. Environmental savings are also 'quite nebulous', he says.
Elsewhere, there are 'a hundred different ways' of prioritising projects,
explains Carlos Lopez-Caciecedo, director of research and technology at
National Power, the privatised electricity generating company. 'The most
important point is discussion between those who are going to do the research
and those who are going to implement it,' he points out. 'That's the most
important phase of the prioritisation exercise.'
At BT, Alan Rudge, a main board director and managing director of BT's
development and procurement division, encourages the operating divisions to
compare BT's internal R&amp;D services with those available outside. If
customers are dissatisfied with the quality, they can go elsewhere.
Clerehugh says that at British Gas the selection process means he has a
clear idea of where the research is heading. 'I've always got at the back of
my mind where we want to go. I know what we want the research for.'
About 70 per cent of the total budget is for near-term work, for which
customers are billed. A further 15 per cent is for something 'the end-user
might like', while another 10 per cent is for work which 'I have to persuade
him he wants,' says Clerehugh. The final 5 per cent is for work 'I'm willing
to have a crack at'.
Clerehugh acknowledges that the very long-term work is not economically
evaluated. 'They're fliers. It's like putting your money in a raffle.' But
he believes companies such as British Gas have to do the basic research so
that they can ask the right questions when procuring equipment.
And, he adds, many of the company's developments - such as a burner for
which the company won a Queen's Award for technological achievement in 1992
 -had to be developed by British Gas because no outside manufacturer was
prepared to do the work. But, adds Clerehugh, 'we're not manufacturers,
we're persuaders and stimulators'.
Neither National Power nor BT manufacture equipment either, which means both
can reduce research spending. BT spends about Pounds 240m a year, 1.8 per
cent of turnover. That is well below many international competitors, which
spend 5 per cent or more of their turnover on R&amp;D.
To keep costs down further, National Power tracks the more esoteric advances
by participating in a small way on projects conducted around the world
rather than taking on the whole research burden itself.
British Gas, too, is doing joint research with other European gas producers,
particularly in areas of common concern, such as offshore safety which is
'phenomenally expensive'. In these areas, says Clerehugh, 'there's nobody
going to say: 'We're better than you are'.'
Although core research carried out at National Power consumes some Pounds
14m a year, a further Pounds 8m is spent on outside research and special
projects, many in conjunction with universities.
Clerehugh is also an advocate of university research. 'I'm still a great
believer that universities are the best place to do basic research.'
BT has a Pounds 3.5m programme of university research into advanced
technologies. But even universities have a customer inside BT who needs
results. In return for investment, BT demands a managerial role in projects
it supports.
While the newly privatised companies in Britain have only recently learned
the lessons of working with 'customers' within their organisation, most
companies have long had to pursue this discipline.
Researchers at Hewlett-Packard's Bristol-based laboratories have always
worked closely with customers throughout the company, says John Taylor,
director of the laboratories.
'Our goal is to get out in front of where this business wants to be. It's
long term,' he explains. 'We have to be looking at three to five years out
in their planning cycles.'
As a high-tech manufacturing organisation, Hewlett-Packard spends some 11
per cent of its turnover on R&amp;D, compared with just 1 per cent in British
Gas. But like the newly privatised companies Taylor has seen a shift in
research.
Applied industrial research used to be technology focused, he says. Nowadays
there is an 'applications pull', in which technology has to be combined with
new areas of business to solve problems. This is changing the balance
between development and research work, a move which has been compounded
because basic research is increasingly carried out in an open, collaborative
international ventures.
'A lot of people lump R&amp;D together. We think 'R' is very different,' Taylor
points out. Hewlett-Packard spends about 10 per cent of turnover in
development laboratories attached to the 55 or 60 operations divisions. Only
1 per cent is spent on research. 'We debate pretty carefully whether that is
right. But there is no right answer,' says Taylor.
Hewlett-Packard has helped ensure that it funds appropriate areas of R&amp;D
through its 'business development' scheme. A handful of employees with both
a technical and business background put together the first round of a five-
to 10-year business case.
Taylor says the company also experimented with using completely
non-technical people to guide the research teams, but this was unsuccessful.
The final assessment on whether research has given value for money is
whether the customers have been persuaded to change their plans, says
Taylor. 'If they say: 'We'd have done that anyway', then the research does
not have much value.'

FT  23 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Revamp for the loan
guarantee scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budgets may come and go but the loan guarantee scheme, one of the most
enduring government support schemes for small business, soldiers on. Like a
well-worn suit, the LGS has been taken in, let out and restyled over the
past 12 years but, unlike many other government programmes, it has survived.
Last week's budget saw further alterations to the scheme, which provides a
government guarantee for loans to businesses which cannot provide the
collateral or track record a bank manager would normally require. One
requirement of the scheme is that the business owner has already committed
all of his assets to the business.
In the view of most small business organisations, the changes will make the
scheme considerably more attractive to companies. But will it prove more
attractive to the banks which provide the loans and which carry the risk for
the minority share of the loan which is not covered by the guarantee? Since
its inception the scheme has depended on the willingness of the banks to
make the loans.
Some 20 lenders currently take part in the scheme, including the large
clearing banks, many of the smaller banks and organisations such as the
Doncaster Business Advice Centre, 3i, London Enterprise Agency and Yorkshire
Enterprise.
The latest changes to the scheme will see a reduction in the premium
charged, an increase in the size of loan that can be made and an increase in
the percentage covered by the government's guarantee.
The premium will be cut from 2 1/2 per cent to 1 1/2 per cent for variable
rate loans and to just  1/2 per cent for fixed rate loans. The lower charge
for fixed rate loans is intended to encourage businesses to take a longer
term view of borrowing and to compensate for the higher cost of fixed rate
loans.
The premium reductions are less generous than at first appears because the 2
1/2 per cent charge applies only to the guaranteed portion of the loan, and
is equivalent to 1 3/4 per cent of the whole loan, while the revised rates
apply to the whole loan.
The maximum size of the eligible loans has been increased from Pounds
100,000 to Pounds 250,000 while the proportion guaranteed has risen from 70
per cent to 85 per cent.
Small businesses frequently complain that bank managers are not aware of the
loan scheme, or feign ignorance, and that the banks do not give it much
publicity. At least one bank replies that this policy is deliberate. 'If we
were to market the scheme aggressively we would find that security which
might otherwise be available for a conventional loan would disappear and
customers would ask for an LGS loan,' says David Laverack, Barclays Bank
head of small business services.
Customers who ask for an LGS loan make the bank manager uneasy. Barclays, at
least, prefers the suggestion for an LGS loan to come from the bank manager
once it becomes clear a business does not have the collateral to qualify for
a conventional loan. But the big four clearing banks all came out with
expressions of support for the LGS after the budget and it makes sense to
remind reluctant bank managers of head office policy, says Stephen
Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses. It is also worth shopping
around for a loan and approaching some of the less well-known providers.
Business owners, for their part, often resent the requirement that they must
have already committed all of their assets before they qualify for the
scheme. 'I have done my market research and I am all geared up to expand but
my business assets are fully committed and I don't want to pledge all my
personal assets to get an LGS loan,' said one businessman last week.
It is hardly surprising, given the reservations of both banks and business
owners, that the LGS has not taken off on the scale originally envisaged.
Shortly after its launch the banks were making 1,500 guaranteed loans a
quarter. But many of the early recipients went bust and loan numbers fell
sharply after the government increased the premium and reduced the scope of
the guarantee. The terms were eased again in the mid-1980s and in 1992-93
about 2,400 loans were made.
In total Pounds 1bn of guaranteed loans have been made to more than 33,000
businesses and Pounds 184m has been written off in losses since the scheme
was introduced in 1981. Compared with the amounts advanced each year under
the equivalent German scheme, the LGS has had a marginal impact.
For all its limitations, the LGS represents an attractive option for the
many businesses that have seen their balance sheets eroded by recession and
that may not now be able to provide the security necessary for a
conventional bank loan.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): From lender to investor -
Banks appear increasingly willing to take equity stakes in small companies

Looking for equity? Forget the venture capitalists - they are too demanding.
Leave aside private investors or 'business angels' - they are difficult to
track down. Why not try your high street bank? It is very early days, but
there are signs of a growing willingness on the part of banks to consider
providing equity.
In many cases this has been forced upon them. Sometimes the best way to save
a business from failure is to convert loans into equity. Last month,
shareholders in Trencherwood, a quoted housebuilder, approved a refinancing
package which gave the company's banks a 37 per cent stake, rising to a
maximum of 67 per cent if they converted their preference shares.
'The bank takes the view that a 'gone concern' is not attractive to anyone,'
says Jim Tracey, a manager in the corporate recovery department at Royal
Bank of Scotland, one of the three banks involved. 'If we can keep them
alive, we do so and we look to take an equity holding. We swap lost money
for a potential upside in the years ahead.'
Putting equity into a business in trouble, rather than calling in the
receiver, represents a shift in bank attitudes. But Tracey's department is
part of a unit at RBS, called Specialised Lending Services, which aims to
help companies by taking an equity stake.
Since the end of last year it has been headed by a venture capitalist, Derek
Sach, former managing director for UK investments at 3i. Midland Bank has
also launched an ambitious programme to provide equity to unquoted companies
through its branches and a network of small regional venture funds.
Midland is ready to refinance well-managed businesses where interest charges
threaten to overwhelm the company, says David McMeekin, a corporate banking
director. 'If we convert a loan to equity, it may give us something to set
against the provision we have to make. But this is not the way I want to see
the banks ending up with equity stakes in their customers.' The model
envisaged by Midland is for the bank to take a modest equity option,
starting as small as 2 or 3 per cent, to help a customer complete a
fund-raising. 'If all went well, we would sell the stake back to the
company,' says McMeekin. Midland has completed a dozen equity deals since
launching its new policy.
An important reason for the banks' move into providing equity is a desire to
share in the high returns which successful equity investments can provide.
The narrow margins on much conventional lending can soon be eaten up by
failures.
'It has always frustrated me that if a company did well, the bank was repaid
and the shareholders went off with big amounts of money,' comments Hans
Blankvoort, UK general manager of Bank Mees &amp; Hope, part of the Dutch ABN
Amro banking group. Mees's corporate finance department has begun providing
equity alongside debt finance to a small number of customers.
The frustration felt by bankers was highlighted in a recent study* of
investment returns carried out for National Westminster Bank. A survey of
the fortunes of more than 100 small business customers between 1986 and 1990
showed the bank increased funding at a faster rate than the owners boosted
their investment. Firms that borrowed performed better than those that did
not.
Yet while the average return on the owner's invested capital was 48 per
cent, interest payments on the bank loans provided a return of only 10 per
cent.
Jane Bradford, head of NatWest small business services, says: 'When small
business owners invest their own funds they assess the risk for a
potentially unlimited return, whereas the return on a bank loan is limited
to the interest rate charged. But both stand to lose equally, if a small
business should fail.' Business owners may have little sympathy for this
argument. The banks have not endeared themselves to their small business
customers, with increased charges and reductions in loan facilities.
But a more serious issue is whether bankers are capable of assessing equity
risks. The flip response, though one with an element of truth, is that much
of their lending in the late 1980s involved an equity-style risk anyway.
Crucial to success will be the sort of company they back. Mees &amp; Hope says
it will target the more established business with turnover of Pounds 10m or
more and a good business plan. Of the four companies backed so far, one was
a management buy-out of Bolton Brady, the industrial door-making subsidiary
of Tarmac, and another was Foster Church, a start-up company. Mees has taken
a 20 per cent stake in Foster Church, which provides working capital finance
to young companies and, with a Dutch investment company, a stake of just
over 50 per cent in Bolton Brady.
'Combining loans and equity is the way forward for banking,' says Darryl
Keys, corporate banking manager. Mees plans to provide equity backing of
between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 1m to about a dozen companies. Clearly, a
Dutch merchant bank has a different culture and approach than the UK
clearing banks. For the UK clearing bank, equity investments involve a leap
of the imagination.
NatWest found how difficult it was to get equity investments right when it
was forced, in January 1991, to acknowledge the failure of its Growth
Options venture, launched five years earlier. Growth Options started out
taking equity options alongside loans, but then moved to taking
straightforward equity stakes. But a higher-than-expected failure rate
forced NatWest to merge it with NatWest Ventures, its venture capital arm,
after it had made 65 investments involving Pounds 10m of equity. 'We just
couldn't make money out of these small investments,' said Mark Wordsworth of
NatWest Ventures. 'The costs are the same as for bigger companies. You still
need to spend Pounds 50,000-Pounds 70,000 on accountancy and legal fees
before you start.'
If anything goes wrong with a small company, there is little leeway for a
rescue. 'We can refinance bigger companies with a balance sheet and a
management structure, but with very small companies with Pounds 100,000 of
turnover there is nothing you can take out,' says Wordsworth. NatWest's
experience appears to indicate that if banks are to provide equity it will
be, as Mees has also decided, to larger companies.
Barclays Bank has targeted the slightly larger business through a link with
Baronsmead, a venture capital company. Barclays says it has backed about 40
companies, investing an average Pounds 400,000 in each since 1989. Barclays
uses Baronsmead's venture capital expertise to pick companies, but bank
staff are seconded to the venture firm. Barclays says it has had only one
failure among companies backed, and it expects to continue the joint venture
when the initial Pounds 20m of funds are exhausted.
The banks are attempting to succeed in a field of investment in which their
venture capital subsidiaries have found it difficult to make money. It will
be several years before the results of the present renewal of interest in
equity come through. Meanwhile, the banks will need to be selective in the
companies they back and business owners must be choosy in who they tie up
with.
