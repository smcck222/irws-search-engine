FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: French right in a tough mood - Serious
clash of wills in prospect with President Mitterrand

PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand will no doubt have some soul-searching to do
in the next week or so after last night's crushing defeat of his Socialist
party, its worst general election result for 25 years. The exact make-up of
the national assembly will not be known until the results of next weekend's
second round of voting. But computer projections last night indicated that
the alliance of conservative RPR and centre-right UDF may win all but 100 of
the 577 assembly seats, a record majority.
The Socialists may get 10-12 per cent of parliamentary seats, on 19 per cent
of the vote, thereby losing more than two-thirds of their present MPs.
If voters go the same way in the second round, the new right-wing government
will be able to exert its will against the weakened but still crafty Mr
Mitterrand as never before. The right had a majority of only four seats in
the last 'cohabitation' government of 1986-1988. This time, Mr Jacques
Chirac, RPR leader, has promised that the president will be allowed no
'private domains', suggesting that a serious clash of wills is on the way.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former French president and current UDF leader,
refused to be drawn on what action Mr Mitterrand should take as a result of
last night's humiliation. 'It is a matter for him,' he said.
Mr Alain Juppe, RPR secretary-general, was more blunt. 'To govern, you need
continuity and unity at the head of state. My profound wish is that Mr
Mitterrand draws the consequences if these results are confirmed in the
second round,' he said. While the right would not govern aggressively, it
would make no concessions.
Mr Chirac, by contrast, warned his supporters against 'an excess of
optimism'.
He was perhaps sensitive to the fact that the UPF's (the UDF and RPR
alliance) overall share of the vote, at around 40 per cent, was roughly the
same as in the last general election in 1988, when the Socialists won a
relative parliamentary majority with 37.5 per cent of the vote, which
compares with the 19 per cent or so they were estimated to have gained
yesterday.
Even so, RPR officials were astonished at the size of their forecast
victory. 'It is almost too much. It won't be healthy if there is no
structured opposition in the national assembly,' said Mr Bernard Pons, the
party's chief parliamentary whip.
The next important battle will be between the RPR and UDF, for the choice of
prime minister. By tradition, Mr Mitterrand chooses a prime minister soon
after the end of the second round from the party with the most seats. Under
the written constitution, he is free to choose whom he likes.
Last night, with first round counting complete in more than 500 of the
National Assembly's 577 constituencies, it appeared that the RPR and the UDF
were running neck-and-neck and had each taken between 19 and 20 per cent of
the vote. On this basis it was unclear which of the two parties would emerge
with the stronger claim to provide the next prime minister.
The other big surprise last night was the poor showing of the two ecology
parties, Les Verts and Generation Ecologie, which appeared to have won a
mere 8.5 per cent of votes, less than the extreme right-wing National Front,
which took 12 per cent.
In pre-election polls the ecologists were winning as much as 16 per cent of
the vote. They could now end up with no seats, while the National Front
could win two.
Ecology leaders attributed this to the fact that many of their own
candidates had joined the party as an experiment and therefore lacked
conviction in voters' eyes.
The signs are that their disillusioned former supporters swung right rather
than left, another indication of the strength of last night's broad swing
away from the Socialists.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE MAIN PARTIES: FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Communist leader
Georges Marchais
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Having despised us for 10 years, the Socialist Party has been courting

FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Left, right, or just Fed up? Vote for me]
 -Fringe parties help spoil the chances of mainstream candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRINGING the total number of candidates to a record 5,169 in yesterday's
first round of voting were more than a dozen fringe parties  - ranging from
left- and right-wing splinter groups, to single-issue movements such as
those for and against shooting and fishing, to the 'Fed Up' party.
Most of these several hundred fringe candidates were knocked out last night,
under the rule that only a candidate gaining 12.5 per cent of registered
votes can go on to the second round of voting for the parliamentary
elections on March 28.
But some will have helped to spoil the chances of mainstream candidates. The
Citizens Movement is fielding 52 candidates, many of them drawing votes away
from Socialists, even though this party's founder, Mr Jean-Pierre
Chevenement, the dissident Socialist ex-minister, is still a Socialist party
member and running for re-election himself on its ticket.
Muddying the waters in the centre of the political spectrum is the Movement
of Reformists, inspired by Mr Jean-Pierre Soissons, himself an oddity as the
current non-Socialist farm minister in the government of Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, prime minister.
The countryside has spawned many mini-parties - the 'Hunting, Nature,
Fishing and Tradition' party (strong in Dordogne and Picardy), their more
numerous opponents in the 'New Ecologists' Rally for Nature and Animals',
and the hardline farming opponents of EC farm reform who have formed 'The
Stakes for France' movement.
To complete the political gamut of open-air enthusiasts, there is also the
'Rally for Sport' campaign pledged to give 'sport the place it deserves in
our society'.
Mysterious to most voters is the 'Natural Law' party. Active in Britain in
the general election last year, this movement has now crossed the Channel
with a promise to deal with high French unemployment by levitation.
By contrast, many voters could probably identify with the 'Fed Up'
(Ras-le-Bol) party, but since it fielded candidates only in Lorraine, only
voters there had an actual chance to do so.

FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Le Pen lashes out at 'unjust' system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT ONLY needed his extreme National Front to gain around 12 per cent in
yesterday's first round vote - a couple of points higher than the extreme
right-wing movement was scoring in the campaign opinion polls - to relaunch
its leader, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, into rhetorical orbit.
'It was scandalous', said Mr Le Pen, that the Communists with a lower vote
of 8-9 per cent could get two dozen seats, while the National Front would at
best get only two seats.
The reason, of course, is that the Communist vote benefits from the majority
voting system by being geographically concentrated, while the support of the
National Front, like that of the Greens, is spread thinly.
This 'unjust and anti-democratic system' must be changed, insisted Mr Le
Pen.
The National Front's one incumbent deputy, Ms Marie-France Stirbois, said
yesterday she thought her party's score was excellent, particularly in view
of the fact that the National Front started the race for the parliamentary
seats with 'shoes of lead' because all the media publicity was focused on
the ecologists, rather than the extreme right.
There was no early result from the Nice seat for which Mr Le Pen is running.
He himself said his party's support was 30-40 per cent up on its score in
the 1986 and 1988 National Assembly elections, conveniently ignoring the
fact that it also constituted a decline from the 13.9 per cent which it
gained more recently in last year's regional elections.
The National Front yesterday did well enough for up to 90 of its candidates
to go on to the second ballot on March 28, the leader claimed. Generally,
these candidates would not stand down in favour of other parties'
candidates, though Mr Le Pen hinted that there might be some switching of
support to mainstream Gaullist/centre-right candidates whom the Front
regarded as 'good'.

FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: End is near for dogged prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy can take cold comfort when he steps down as as French
prime minister from the fact that the new conservative government will have
little choice but to carry on his own economically rigorous policies.
Along with several other senior Socialists, Mr Beregovoy was last night
struggling to win a parliamentary seat. He found himself in the unaccustomed
position of having to go through to the second round, next Sunday, to
contest a seat in Nevers, where he is mayor. The last time Mr Beregovoy
fought a general election, he won his seat in the first round. He called on
voters last night to 'prevent the right from exercising a power without
sharing or counterweight'.
The right has promised to make some fine adjustments to Mr Beregovoy's
policies, such as accelerating his partial privatisations. But the broad
approach, especially on the firm franc, will probably be the same.
This is partly because the disciplines of membership of the European
Monetary System leave almost no margin for manoeuvre and partly because the
right's solutions to unemployment are not very different from the failed
prescriptions that contributed to the Socialists' downfall.
It is also a tribute to Mr Beregovoy's doggedness in holding a firm economic
line in a Socialist government that did not always give him whole-hearted
support, from the time he succeeded Mr Jacques Delors as finance minister in
1984 and became prime minister last April. The one achievement for which he
has said he wants to be remembered is the control of inflation, now at a
mere 2.1 per cent, well under half its mid-1980s level.
Mr Beregovoy, 67, has been an effective prime minister in that he was
neither brilliant enough to get in President Francois Mitterrand's way, a
mistake which cost former prime minister Michel Rocard his job, nor erratic,
a mistake which led to the dismissal of Mr Beregovoy's immediate
predecessor, Mrs Edith Cresson.
Steering this middle way has made Mr Beregovoy appear sometimes unexciting,
a criticism also levied at his possible successor, Mr Edouard Balladur. The
moral could be that a low profile is a useful survival quality for French
prime ministers.
Yet despite his alleged greyness, Mr Beregovoy has also been an electoral
asset for the Socialists as one of the few members of the outgoing
government to have solid working class credentials.
His background is very different from that of many of his colleagues and
advisers, who tend to have bourgeois origins and a training in the elite
public administration colleges. Mr Beregovoy never even went to high school
and failed the entrance exam for St Cyr military academy.
The son of a Ukrainian grocer, he started as a machine tool operator before
joining the SNCF railways, where he became a prominent trade union member,
then went to a junior management job at Gaz de France.
He went into politics as a member of the left-wing Parti Socialiste Unifie,
a precursor of the present Socialist party, where he worked for Pierre
Mendes-France, the one-time prime minister whom he cites as his mentor. Mr
Beregovoy joined the inner circle of French politics as Mr Mitterrand's
chief of staff in 1981, just as the Socialist president first took office.
It was from there that he later went to the Finance Ministry.
Mr Beregovoy is said to suspect that some have held his lack of civil
service education against him. Indeed, in one widely quoted jibe, a graduate
of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration is said to have remarked: 'You only
have to look at Mr Beregovoy's socks to see that he is an honest man.' That
remark has lost some of its significance since he admitted receiving an
interest-free loan from a later disgraced businessman.
Whoever Mr Mitterrand chooses from the UDF/RPR coalition as Mr Beregovoy's
successor, the style is at any rate likely to switch back in line with
France's traditional ruling elite. The new incumbent might have smarter
socks, but he is likely to tread roughly the same policy path.

FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Rocard's career in the balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Rocard, the Socialists' expected standard-bearer in the 1995
presidential elections, was last night fighting to keep his political career
alive.
The ex-prime minister, who headed the Socialist government in 1988-91, was
predicted by the opinion polls to have gained only 28.2 per cent support in
his suburban Paris constituency, easily outdistanced by his Gaullist RPR
challenger, Mr Pierre Cardo, who received 38.8 per cent.
Hoping to turn this around in next Sunday's second ballot by gaining the
left-wing support outside the Socialist party, Mr Rocard said that the
Socialists' generally disastrous performance underlined 'the degree to which
we (the Socialists) need to transform our party, to rally other elements' of
the left. Mr Rocard was referring to his recent call for 'a big bang'
recomposition of the French left.
To mark a certain distance from President Francois Mitterrand and the
current Socialist government of which he is not a member, Mr Rocard
described the defeat as only 'partially unmerited'.
As recently as last Wednesday, Mr Rocard repeated open criticism of Mr
Mitterrand, saying that the president had failed following his 1988
presidential victory to reach out properly to parties to the left and centre
of the Socialists. The president, said Mr Rocard, had chosen to deal 'with
individuals and not with political forces'.
Last night Mr Rocard urged Socialists to join other sympathetic political
forces, particularly the badly battered Greens, to limit the right's further
gains in next weekend's second ballot.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Swiss are most satisfied employees in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS employees are the most satisfied in Europe, followed closely by the
Dutch, while UK employees are the least satisfied, according to the latest
survey of employee attitudes in eight European countries by International
Survey Research.
ISR, which interviewed about 310,000 workers for the survey, asked people's
reactions to 15 aspects of their work such as communications, pay, job
security and company identification.
It found that, except for the UK, north European workers are far more
satisfied than southern European employees. After the Swiss and the Dutch
come the Belgians and the Germans, then Spain, France and Italy, with the UK
last.
The Swiss have the most favourable attitudes in all but one of the 15
categories. That category is pay, where the Dutch come top.
UK workers were in the top half of the eight countries in only two
categories, management and benefits, and have the most negative attitudes of
all towards the quality of their work and training and their companies'
communications. They also score lowest on company identification and feel
the most insecure in their jobs.
An earlier survey in 1992, part of the same programme of research for a
group of large companies, found Spanish workers the least satisfied,
followed by Italians. The fact that they have now been overtaken by UK
employees may reflect the severity and depth of recession in the UK.
Spanish employees are still relatively negative about their management, pay
and training but they identify strongly with their employing organisations.
The French have the most unfavourable attitude of all towards pay, work
organisation and working relationships.
German employees feel they are efficient, have good working conditions and
are satisfied with their jobs. But they are critical of the way they are
organised, managed, communicated with and trained. They have the most
negative attitudes of all to their immediate bosses.
The categories attracting the highest average favourable response across the
eight countries are job satisfaction, working relationships and operating
efficiency. The least favourable responses came from pay, communications,
benefits and performance and development.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Germans dislike neo-Nazis: Opinion poll suggests fears of
racism wave are unfounded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANS do not like having neo-Nazis as their neighbours. They like them
even less than drug-addicts, drunks and left-wing revolutionaries.
As for anti-Semitism, it is a feeling still harboured by only a small
minority of the German population, and it is not on the increase. It is no
more significant than it is in neighbouring France.
Those clear conclusions emerge from an opinion poll of the German
population, which suggests that fears of a new wave of racism and right-wing
radicalism in the country are largely unfounded.
On the other hand, it does suggest that Germans are still pretty choosy
about precisely who is coming to live next door to them, but more on grounds
of behaviour than of race.
The opinion survey carried out by the respected Allensbach Institute, the
country's leading polling organisation, decided to test attitudes to
foreigners and political extremism by asking: 'Who would you not like to
have as your neighbour?'
The result showed that 'right-wing extremists' were the nastiest neighbours
of all: 77 per cent of the population want to have nothing to do with them.
That compares with 67 per cent who do not want drug addicts next door, 66
per cent who single out 'heavy drinkers', and 61 per cent who are equally
hostile to 'left-wing extremists'.
The one minority group in the German population which is clearly the object
of prejudice is the gipsies: 64 per cent do not want them as neighbours,
either.
Of all the national, religious or racial groups mentioned, the Jews are
disliked by the smallest proportion: just 7 per cent.
'People with large families' are more unpopular - on 8 per cent - and the
vague definition 'people of a different race' is ruled out by the same
proportion.
A similar poll carried out in France in 1990 showed very similar degrees of
prejudice: 7 per cent did not want Jews next door, 13 per cent did not want
'immigrants' (12 per cent in Germany), and 18 per cent did not want Moslems
(17 per cent in Germany).
The Allensbach institutes concludes: 'The overwhelming majority of Germans
are shocked by and full of contempt for those who believe that German
unification can be used to spark a major nationalist blaze. . . Germans
distance themselves from political extremism, and this distance has not
decreased in the past two years, but rather, it has grown.'
Another poll published on Friday did show, however, that the small minority
supporting the far right is still creeping up in size.
The Republicans, the leading representative of far-right views, gained 6 per
cent support in the latest Polit-barometer published by the ZDF television
channel, compared with 5 per cent in February. At a general election, that
would be enough to gain seats in the Bundestag.
As for the big political parties, the opposition Social Democrats have
slipped back two points to 36 per cent, since their poor showing in local
elections in the state of Hesse. They are now neck-and-neck with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, which means they could well be condemned
to co-operate in a 'grand coalition' if there were an election tomorrow.

FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Voters find no heroes to elect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S imagination this weekend has been caught far more by the courage of
its General Philippe Morillon in Bosnia, standing firm by the besieged
inhabitants of Srebrenica, than by the first round of its parliamentary
elections at home.
With no such heroes to vote for, the French electorate seemed during the
campaign indifferent to the Socialist government's quiet death and unexcited
even by the prospect of a landslide victory for the centre-right parties.
France's leading political commentators reckon this has been one of the
dullest election campaigns for years. Early exit polls indicated a
surprisingly high 69 per cent turnout. Yet the campaign itself was
lacklustre for several clear reasons.
For one thing, the result has been a foregone conclusion since the
Socialists' humiliation in last year's regional elections, in which they
pulled in an ignominious 18.3 per cent of the vote. For another thing,
voters are tired of being asked to choose between parties led by the same
old figures who have dominated French politics for 15 years.
Proof of this is the fact that polls show the UPF alliance of conservative
RPR plus centre-right UDF has taken only very slight advantage from the
Socialists' steep decline in popularity. Socialists and allies won 37.5 per
cent in the last general election, down to around 20 per cent according to
the most recent opinion polls, while the UPF has inched up from just over 40
per cent to around 42.
The gainers have been the two ecology parties, up from almost nothing in
1988 to 16 per cent by the end of last year then down to 8.5 and 9 per cent
according to the first exit polls yesterday evening taken before polling
closed in the big cities, where their support is high. Apart from this
change in their fortunes, the campaign held no last-minute surprises, though
exit polls showed a small recovery in the fortunes of the extreme right-wing
National Front to 12 per cent of the vote.
Not only the personalities, but their ideas too, have failed to galvanise
the electorate. For the campaign has underlined how the general thrust of
the policies of right and left have been broadly similar.
Where there has been a debate on the big problem of the day, the 10.5 per
cent unemployment rate, it has centred on details. The Socialists have
talked of encouraging work-sharing, while the right has called for cuts in
social charges on employers - reinforcing the impression that neither side
really knows what to do about joblessness.
Mr Michel Rocard later tried to grab attention by calling for a political
'big bang', the creation of a centre-left grouping, only to lose the public
relations advantage a few days later by publicly criticising President
Francois Mitterrand.
The right's campaign has been cautious, because it knew all along that the
only thing it had to do to win was to avoid mistakes. On top of this, Mr
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF, and Mr Jacques Chirac, leader
of the RPR, are interested less in yesterday's outcome than in the
presidential election in 1995, when both could be fighting to succeed Mr
Mitterrand.

FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Secret pollsters keep tabs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE possibility of surprise last-minute upsets in French elections exists
because the country's electoral law forbids the publication of opinion polls
within a week of polling day.
But no French government has an excuse for being taken aback by any
11th-hour turnaround in public sentiment, because it has a secretive
political department within the Interior Ministry which continues to feed it
reports on the public mood right up to the moment when the polling booths
open.
This department is known as the Renseignements Generaux, a shadowy force
whose job is to keep tabs on political developments of all sorts within the
country.
The RG used to function more like a secret police in opening politicians'
letters and bugging their offices, but since 1964 it has created a polling
organisation within the Interior Ministry which is the envy of many regular
pollsters.
It is able to call on the services of several hundred inspectors, who often
interview a much wider sample of the public (up to 2,000 people) than the
regular pollsters do.
But, as one RG inspector told Liberation newspaper, they are not
straightforward about their identity. 'When someone asks who we work for, we
say that we are doing subcontract work for some institute whose name is
known. To say that we are policemen would falsify the replies.'
Yet the RG believes it forms a valuable role. 'Weakened by decentralisation,
the state has more and more need of an institution to supply it the
information which will help it take its decisions,' the inspector said.

<TEXT>
THE emergency economic package which Japan's government is drawing up to
stimulate the flagging economy could be worth Y14,000bn (Pounds 81bn), Mr
Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the senior politician in charge of co-ordinating the
plans, said on television at the weekend, writes Charles Leadbeater in
Tokyo.
Details of the package are to be decided in the next three weeks before Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, visits Washington for talks in mid-April.
They are still to be debated, but are likely to include tax cuts for housing
and investment in small businesses, a public works programme which could be
worth more than Y8,000bn, and a special investment programme to develop the
country's telecommunications infrastructure.
A package worth Y14,000bn would be by far the largest ever introduced by the
Japanese government. Its scale is a mark of the political pressure the
government is under, domestically and internationally, to revive the
economy.

According to government figures, growth slowed from 1991's 3.6 per cent
despite a strong increase in total investment of 13.9 per cent and in
private investment of 20.4 per cent. Such investment failed to stimulate
growth further because of rapid depreciation of existing capital stock.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT for Spain's governing Socialist party has fallen sharply, and is now
only marginally ahead of that for the opposition conservatives, according to
an opinion poll published yesterday. The survey suggests that a hung
parliament will be returned when general elections are held later this year,
writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
The poll of 10,000 voters in the newspaper El Pais indicated that the
Socialists would hold just 146 seats of the 175 they won in October 1989 and
that the centre-right Partido Popular (PP) would increase its presence in
the 350-member congress from 107 seats to 143.
The Socialist share of the vote has slipped from 39.6 per cent of the vote
at the last elections to 33.9 per cent and the PP's has grown from 25.8 per
cent to 36.3 per cent.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Tokyo market shines out of the gloom: Experts are at a loss
to explain the surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN Mr Hidenobu Sasaki, the eccentric but popular stock market analyst, is
at a loss to explain it. Surrounded by an array of astrological charts at
Nikko Securities, Mr Sasaki, famed in Japan for his Buddhist-inspired
analysis of the stock market, admits he cannot explain the surge in the
Tokyo market over the past three weeks.
Stockbrokers return to work this morning amid an atmosphere of nervous
anticipation. For more than three years the market had slid, with trading
volumes contracting. If the rally of the past few weeks continues unabated
this week, Tokyo could move above 19,000, touching levels it has not reached
for months.
The backdrop for the rally could hardly be gloomier.
Companies are preparing to announce what for most will be their third
consecutive year of declining profits.
Last week the government announced that the economy grew by only 1.5 per
cent last year, the slowest rate of growth for 18 years, largely because
domestic demand is still feeble. Meanwhile, Japan's political leadership is
again under the shadow of a political scandal, involving tax evasion by Mr
Shin Kanemaru, until recently godfather of the ruling Liberal Democratic
party.
Yet the stock market has thrived in the face of this economic and political
adversity.
The index has risen by 10 per cent over the past two weeks to close last
Friday at 18,537.17. Just as significantly, trading volumes have surged to
levels unseen since the late 1980s. A daily average of 550m shares were
traded over the fortnight, 2.3 times higher than last month's average
figure.
But if the facts are clear, the causes are not. Mr Sasaki and more
conventional analysts cannot agree on whether the market's revival is the
product of clever government intervention or whether prices have ended their
three-year slump. Could the surge be a long-awaited harbinger of a revival
in the rest of the economy?
Politics has had a huge impact on the market. The government is steering
banks and life assurers away from selling shares. It has also pumped in
money from public pension funds.
The passage of the 1993 budget through the lower house of the parliament
cleared the way for the LDP to begin work on another stimulatory package for
the economy. All the signs are that it should be larger than the Y10,700bn
programme introduced last summer. Some LDP officials have suggested a
further Y6,000bn could be devoted to stock buying.
In addition, the performance of one stock, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,
the partly state-owned telecommunications group, has driven the market
higher. The LDP has suggested that NTT may be allowed to raise its charges,
which should boost its profits.
The company is also cutting costs with an aggressive restructuring
programme.
The Bank of Japan has also played its part with a cut in its official
discount rate to an historic low of 2.5 per cent. This is benefiting
equities; as Mr Yuichi Kohashi at Daiwa Securities says: 'Low interest rates
are pushing liquidity into the markets.'
Brokers say the government's support may have sparked genuine buying.
Foreign investors, scared of missing the recovery, have rushed in. For the
week ending March 19, overseas investors bought a net Y304bn, the largest
net purchase since the second week in February 1991.
How long will the rally last? Mr Hideo Sakamaki, president of Nomura
Securities, at the weekend told 400 of his managers the stock market surge
was anticipating a recovery in the economy as a whole.
Many analysts are not so sure. The economy still looks weak. Projections for
corporate profits suggest that earnings will fall for the year to next
March, the fourth consecutive year of decline, which would be a post-war
record.
Once companies close their books at the end of the month, they will not need
higher stock prices to boost the value of the securities holdings on their
balance sheets.
Many analysts expect that after that the stock market will shed some of its
recent gains, mainly because of the political timetable. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
prime minister, must convince the US government, which is unhappy with
Japan's surging trade surplus, that the package will stimulate the economy's
demand for imports.
The package, due to be announced before Mr Miyazawa sets off to Washington
in the middle of next month, could mark the end of the good news on economic
policy for a while, so some analysts are telling clients to be ready to
sell.
As Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, puts it: 'Sell as Mr
Miyazawa steps on the plane.'

BRAZIL'S privatisation programme has resumed after a four-month suspension.
The government stake in petrochemicals company Poliolefinas was sold on
Friday at the minimum price of Dollars 86.1m to Odebrecht, one of Brazil's
leading construction groups.
The sale was seen as a clear indication that President Itamar Franco's
government is serious about modernisation and reducing the deficit.
There is still considerable opposition in Brazil to privatisation. A legal
battle on Friday caused a five and a half hour delay before Poliolefinas
could go under the hammer.
The government is expected to face serious difficulties over the next
auction: that of the Rio-based National Steel Company, scheduled for April
2. The company is regarded as a symbol of Brazil's industrial might. Rio's
governor intends to oppose the sale.
Mr Eliseu Resende, finance minister, says the government will impose 'strict
vigilance' over prices by strengthening the Price Monitoring Department
though it will not reintroduce controls.

reach an impasse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NATO has completed plans to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia, with the
United Nations expected to approve the use of allied fighters this week to
shoot down Serb or other aircraft over the republic, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
At the same time negotiations on peace talks to end the war reached an
impasse at the weekend with mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen
evaluating how or whether to keep the negotiations going.
Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic has refused to participate in
any formal talks with the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, as long
as the siege of the east Bosnia town of Srebrenica continues.
At issue in the peace talks is a map splitting Bosnia into 10
semi-autonomous provinces, largely along ethnic lines. Bosnia's Croats have
accepted this plan but both the government and the Serbs have rejected it.
Nato sources in Brussels said the no-fly zone enforcement operation would be
run from a Nato air headquarters at Vicenza, north-eastern Italy, and would
probably include fighters from the US, Britain and France.
Various plans were available, ranging from simple patrolling of the skies to
bombing airfields in Serbia and elsewhere if necessary.
While Nato will run the operation, it will be under the strict political
control of the UN. The UN imposed the no-fly zone over Bosnia in October to
stop air attacks. The ban has been violated more than 450 times since then,
mostly by Serbs.
The UN Security Council is expected to vote for enforcement this week, after
light aircraft carried out the first confirmed bombing raids against Moslem
villages in Bosnia and then flew off in the direction of Serbia a week ago.
However, the resolution is likely to include a 'warning period' of days or
even weeks before enforcement begins.
In eastern Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon tried to put together a deal
with Serbs and Moslems yesterday to get aid flowing again to starving
Moslems there.
Gen Morillon, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, left the headquarters he has
set up in Srebrenica for talks with both warring parties after 18 trucks
with supplies for the besieged Moslem town were blocked on the
Serbian-Bosnian border.
A UN military source in the border town of Mali Zvornik, where the Danish
trucks were stranded for a second day, said the general had talks in the
Bosnian Serb town of Bratunac before driving on to the Moslem stronghold of
Tuzla.
UN officers said Gen Morillon had struck a deal to evacuate Serbs from
Tuzla. It was also hoped to get agreement to use helicopters to evacuate
more refugees from Srebrenica.
US aircraft dropped more aid over Srebrenica early yesterday, in individual
packets rather than pallets to try to prevent starving inhabitants killing
each other in the chaotic scramble for food.
Meanwhile, the besieged Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, came under heavy
artillery attack yesterday after two days of relative calm. At least eight
people were killed and about 95 wounded as Serb artillery unleashed a
ferocious barrage on the Old Town and the residential quarter of Vratnik.
Shelling, apparently from Moslem positions, also rained down on the airport,
hub of the international relief airlift for the besieged capital, and closed
the road leading from it into the city, UN officials said.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Building equipment demand set to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR construction equipment in Europe is likely to fall by 8 per cent
this year as the boom in Germany caused by reunification passes its peak,
according to a forecast by the London-based Corporate Intelligence Group.
The predicted decline follows a 3 per cent fall in the European market last
year to 95,901 units, and sales are expected to fall by a further 7,000
units this year.
If that happens, the group said, the market would have declined by 15 per
cent since 1989.
The surge in equipment sales in Germany has been the one bright spot in the
industry over the past three years. Unit sales rose by 22 per cent last year
to 44,555, and Germany now represents 47 per cent of the European market,
compared with 18 per cent in 1989 for the former West Germany.
Sales in Germany had benefited from the influx of new citizens from eastern
Europe, and the work to be done in the new federal states.
Wheeled loaders, hydraulic excavators and small earthmovers had been bought
in great quantities.
But 1993 had started slowly, and overall sales were likely to fall this year
by 13 per cent to 38,955, the group said.
'In the bonanza of selling in the east, there are many dealers of very
doubtful financial standing and by the end of 1993 there will probably be
quite a shake-out in progress.
'There is the worry that rental fleets recently created will be under-used,
with banks reclaiming machines and forcing them back on to the used
equipment market at low prices.'
In spite of the decline, however, the German market will still be about 120
per cent bigger than in 1988, and German sales will continue to dominate the
European market.
All other countries apart from Austria and Denmark declined last year, with
the sharpest falls in Finland, Sweden and Spain.
Overall the group said 1993-94 would be a period of continued difficulty for
construction equipment producers, and real recovery was unlikely before
1995-96.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of strikes among eastern Germany's engineering, metal,
electrical, and steel sectors increased sharply at the weekend after the DGB
federation of trade unions said it would organise 'a week of resistance' in
support of higher wages in the region.
But Mr Tyll Necker, president of the German Industry Federation, said
demands for a 26 per cent pay increase on April 1 in the five eastern states
was 'a little mad'.
The DGB said it wanted to show that it opposed the decision by Gesamtmetall,
the employers' association, to renege on a contract made with IG Metall, the
engineering union, in March 1991. That contract would have brought eastern
German wages up to western German levels by April 1994. The 26 per cent pay
rise, due next month for eastern German engineering, metal, electrical and
steel employees, was part of that agreement.
Both the DGB and IG Metall say the employers want to end the system of
collective wage bargaining, which would mean that employers would be free to
set their own wages.

THE COSTS of social compensation for the tens of thousands of European
steelworkers likely to lose their jobs when the industry is restructured
over the next few years could be much higher than expected, according to Mr
Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner. He was speaking after an
informal meeting of EC industry ministers in Nyborg, Denmark at the weekend.
Neither he nor other participants were prepared to quote figures, but the
implication of Mr Bangemann's statement appears to be that redundancies will
be in the upper range of estimates made at the ministers' meeting in
Brussels on February 25.
It was said then that 50,000-100,000 jobs might have to go as crude steel
producers and rolling mills were closed. Social compensation will be paid
out of special funds which it is planned to set up. The Commission and the
industry itself will contribute to the funds, said Mr Bangemann.
Final decisions on the steel industry restructuring programme will not be
made until October, by which time the ministers will have received proposals
for capacity reductions from the industry, according to the commission's
present schedule.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Italian probe claims scalp of fourth minister

MR Gianni Fontana, Italy's agriculture minister, last night became the
fourth minister to resign in little more than a month as a result of the
political corruption scandal.
The move is a further serious blow to the fragile eight-month-old government
of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato. Beside the forced departures, he has had
to contend with growing difficulties in passing legislation.
Mr Fontana, a Christian Democrat, stepped down after being told by
magistrates in the northern city of Verona he could face prosecution on
allegations of abusing laws on financing political parties and illegally
receiving funds. Yesterday, magistrates searched Mr Fontana's house in the
city and his holiday home on Lake Garda as part of corruption inquiries in
Verona which have already involved a number of local politicians
Meanwhile, Mr Alfredo Vito, a Christian Democrat MP from Naples advised by
magistrates he could face prosecution in the scandal, has admitted to
collecting billions of lire in bribes for local party leaders. The admission
could give southern magistrates investigating allegations of widespread
political corruption their first breakthrough in one of the electoral
strongholds of Italy's largest political party.
Until now, the investigations, which began in Milan, have barely penetrated
the political fabric of the Mezzogiorno, or southern Italy, where the
Christian Democrats and the Socialists, the two parties most implicated in
the corruption scandal, draw much of their support.
Bribes and kickbacks to politicians 'are present in every corner of
society', said Mr Vito in television interviews at the weekend. 'I was a
part of this system.' Threatening to take the lid off a decade of political
corruption in Naples, Mr Vito has resigned from the party and will step down
as an MP. 'I hope other colleagues under investigation will follow my
example,' he said.
Mr Vito is closely associated with Mr Antonio Gava, a senior Christian
Democrat senator and leader of an important party faction. Naples is also
the power base for two other top Christian Democrats: Mr Vincenzo Scotti,
the former interior minister, and Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, the ex-budget
minister.
The allegations against Mr Vito, who received over 100,000 personal
preference votes in last April's general election, involve corruption and
extortion. Last week, a parliamentary committee backed the request by
magistrates, investigating a jobs-for-votes scam, for Mr Vito's immunity to
be waived. On Thursday, he offered to testify voluntarily.
The investigations in Naples, Italy's third biggest city, have focused
partly on alleged kickbacks paid by building contractors for modernising the
football stadium for the 1990 World Cup.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Decree revives memories of 1917 bloodshed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CIVIL war which engulfed Russia after the Bolsheviks seized power in
1917 and foreign countries intervened in the conflict is a powerful memory
etched on the minds of most Russians.
It has never loomed as large as now, with President Boris Yeltsin declaring
special rule-by-decree pending a referendum next month to let Russians
decide whether he or parliament should rule the country.
Fears of a new split in the army, seven decades later, prompted Mr Yeltsin,
as commander-in-chief, to order the armed forces to stay out of politics.
But although he declared yesterday that the army would remain neutral, Gen
Pavel Grachev, defence minister, was inevitably taking sides when he signed
a government statement supporting the president.
Gen Grachev, who owes his position to his support for Mr Yeltsin in
resisting the August 1991 coup, was joined by the security and interior
ministers, who also pledged their respect for 'constitutional principles'.
In supporting Mr Yeltsin's gamble to break a constitutional deadlock by
violating a Communist-era constitution, the heads of the three so-called
power ministries must now hope that they backed the right horse in the
conflict with parliament.
For this to happen, they must also rely on the forces they command - the
armed forces, the police and the successor organisation to the KGB - to keep
on obeying orders. Passivity and indifference have been a dominant sentiment
in the armed forces to date.
But the parliament has already picked up a powerful ally: Vice-President
Alexander Rutskoi, who is not only a popular politician but an air force
general. Gen Rutskoi's first concern is to position himself as a successor
to Mr Yeltsin if everything goes wrong. He could, however, also come to
capitalise on discontent in the armed forces if corruption is not dealt
with, living conditions continue to deteriorate and the troops are pulled
into situations where they might have to choose sides.
'We are in shock, we are in a trance about what President Yeltsin did. We do
not like it,' said one Moscow police officer yesterday.

OUTSIDE Moscow's White House, again the epicentre of drama, two rival
demonstrations, each 3,000-strong, were held apart by police. The Communist
one, though, tried to beat up an ABC cameraman.
Inside, too, there was no sign of the unanimity of six months ago, when many
of those present were rallying round Boris Yeltsin as hero of the August
1991 putsch. Now, milling about the debating chamber, were Vice President
Alexander Rutskoi, Mr Valery Zorkin, constitutional court chief, Gen Pavel
Grachev, defence minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister, and,
of course, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker.
They were comrades in arms no longer.
Gen Grachev, with Mr Victor Barannikov, security services head, stuck dourly
to their line: they would observe the constitution and keep the peace.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister and once thought by centrists and
conservatives to be a potential fifth column in the presidential cabinet,
also stuck doggedly to his brief - to support Mr Yeltsin and proclaim the
government would carry on working.
Gen Rutskoi, finally - it seemed - severing his tenuous connection with the
man on whose ticket he ran for vice president nearly two years ago, claimed
the president had put himself beyond the constitution.
Significantly, he said he and Mr Yuri Skokov, Security Council secretary,
had refused to sign the presidential decree declaring 'special rule'. This
means the Security Council loses its organiser and the president a useful
counsellor. Gen Rutskoi and Mr Skokov have wide contacts in the
administration and armed forces and may now use them.
The Supreme Soviet is often placid, usually relatively well ordered.
Yesterday's hastily called session did not make much effort to be orderly:
indeed, it probably lacked a quorum but worked on anyway.
Mr Zorkin, ever the peacemaker, said the proceedings should be restrained,
especially as it appeared the president's decree on special powers had not
been registered and so was not in force.
Even in the shadow of what the majority said was threatened totalitarianism,
the Russian bureaucracy ground on at its own pace: or had Mr Yeltsin drawn
back? Whichever it was, said Mr Zorkin, 'we cannot pretend nothing has
happened'.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Yeltsin maps out the tough road to reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN has always asserted that control over the economy and
faster progress of reforms were the indispensable elements for resolution of
the country's crisis. In his address to the nation on Saturday night he
mapped out how this might be done.
What he outlined was a programme for authoritarian reform of the kind many
of his advisers have long advocated. It blends a populism with a stricter
application of controls and discipline, and seeks to bring the main economic
actors under central control to ensure that they fulfil their reforming
duties.
To begin with, Mr Yeltsin will soon issue a decree giving citizens the right
to own land: special vouchers are likely to be issued which would give
citizens the right to purchase land. For those wishing to become small
business owners, preferential credits and tax breaks will be offered.
Bankruptcies, he said, would go ahead. Indeed, a programme of 'show'
bankruptcies has been prepared for some time. He promised enhanced
unemployment compensation for the victims of these bankruptcies - and it is
to this where some of the new foreign assistance now being considered by the
Group of Seven industrial countries may be directed.
Mr Yeltsin said the struggle against inflation and the limiting of the money
supply will be toughened - though he gave no details. The core issue is the
lack of control on the part of the government of the central bank: though Mr
Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, is now part of the
government (together with the heads of the state pension fund, the Federal
Property Agency and the statistical service) and there is still no agreement
on strategy. This will be a critical test of the new regime.
Citizens who now see their savings disappear under the impact of 30 per cent
monthly inflation will get compensation - not in cash, but in shares in
enterprises and in land.
A new effort is to be made to cut out abuses, especially in the
privatisation of companies - where those with the largest clout have forced
special deals at the expense of the voucher-holding population.
The local heads of administration in autonomous republics and in regions are
to be made 'directly accountable to the president and the Russian
government' because of 'numerous instances of leaders in executive power
hindering the implementation of political and economic reform'.
This should mean that these people have nowhere to hide before the central
government's all-seeing eye: but it will depend heavily on whether the
central government has the competence to bring them to book.
The programme would break a number of blocks en route to the market which
have been erected by parliament, by the laws passed over the past year and a
half and by the constitution itself.
Like much else in the president's statement, it breaks through the
encircling bonds and proposes a relatively unimpeded road to reform.
But it is two-headed: it also puts enormous responsibility on the president
and the government for actions and programmes which they must now effect;
which they can no longer blame parliament for blocking.
Even if they really have shunted parliament aside, they must work with the
same cumbersome bureaucracy, mutinous local leaders, distrustful population,
ailing infrastructure and reluctance on the part of foreigners to invest.
They have not lightened their load: they have increased it.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Clinton resolute but sees perils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has committed himself resolutely, but not
irrevocably, to the cause of Mr Boris Yeltsin.
With a flurry of supportive statements and a concerted effort to put new
wheels on the western aid train, Mr Clinton has made clear he viewed Mr
Yeltsin not just as the current office-holder, with whom the US must deal
willy-nilly, but as the best hope for democracy and market-based reform in
Russia.
But Mr Clinton is also aware of the perils of hitching his policies too
firmly to Mr Yeltsin's wagon - all the more so as he accused former
President George Bush last year of the same misguided adherence to Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union.
Several Russian experts and some newspaper editorialists have accused Mr
Clinton of making the same mistake. Criticism became especially pointed when
an unnamed senior administration official indicated the US would look the
other way if Mr Yeltsin were to adopt unconstitutional means in his battle
with the Russian Congress.
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who has consistently warned
against pinning US policy too firmly to any one leader, sees a strong
possibility of Russia relapsing to Pinochet-style authoritarian rule under
one of a number of contenders, including Mr Yeltsin.
But politicians from both US parties have been more understanding of Mr
Clinton's predicament, generally concurring he has no choice but to support
Mr Yeltsin, at least as long as the Russian leader is committed to battling
the Congress at the ballot box rather than the streets. Some, indeed, would
like Mr Clinton to make even clearer whose side he is on.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: 'I am counting on understanding for my
actions'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following are extracts from President Boris Yeltsin's address to the
nation on Saturday.
'In June 1991 you elected me President, entrusted the government of the
Russian Federation state to me. Then, for the first time in the
thousand-year history of the country, a choice was made, a choice of head of
state and a choice of the path which Russia should follow.
'The choice was extremely tough and responsible - either, as before, head
down the communist dead end, or begin deep reforms so as to take the road of
progress, along which all civilised humanity is moving. . .
'The Congress is trying to limit the president, his strivings to give land
to the people and to preserve Russia. Possibilities of a search for accord
with the conservative majority of the deputies' body are completely
exhausted. . .
'The Congress refused to listen to the voice of the country, it refuted the
opinion of the overwhelming majority of voters, but the Congress is not the
state, the Congress is not Russia.
'In these conditions the president is obliged to take on himself the
responsibility for the fate of the country. On me as president lies the
state obligation, in the conditions of major changes which Russia is
undergoing now, to furnish observation of the very bases of the
constitution, and first and foremost of people's power, federalism, the
division of powers, and human rights and freedoms. . .
'I have given the order to the Ministry of Defence not to allow the use of
the army for political ends.
'I confirm that henceforth concern about the armed forces, about servicemen
will be one of the most important tasks of the Russian state. I especially
want to stress that my order guarantees the observation of human rights in
its full measure. . .
'Esteemed citizens of Russia, I will be frank: I am minded to act
resolutely. I think that there is no other way in the situation that has
taken shape.
'If political squabbling is not halted, if no resolute measures are taken to
resolve the political crisis, if no powerful momentum is given to the
economic reforms, the country will be pushed into anarchy. Viktor
Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Council of Ministers, has been
instructed to present, within two days, a list of priority economic
measures.
'The list should provide first for measures to resolve the land question; a
simple and understandable mechanism for handing land over to citizens as
private property is needed.
'I am counting on the support of the country's main political groupings. I
shall continue my dialogue with them on a draft for a new constitution and
implementation of economic reforms, and on how they can work together with
the government.
'Esteemed fellow citizens, I am proposing a way out of the crisis that is
civilised and based on the fundamental tenets of the constitution, without
extreme or arbitrary measures, without tanks or barricades, without street
rallies or strikes.
'You yourselves, the citizens of Russia, will decide everything by your
vote. This will be your choice, the choice of the people. I am counting on
understanding for my actions and I ask you to support your president. I
believe I have your support.'

FT  22 MAR 93 / Post-communist dilemmas for would-be activists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS ironic, as well as potentially disastrous, that the collapse of
communism and the consequent pleas for western aid and trade arrived at just
the time when western capitalism was slipping into one of its periodic bouts
of recessionary angst. Russian President Boris Yeltsin might feel
disappointed at the rather lukewarm support, financial or otherwise, that
the west has been able to offer him over the past 18 months as his
post-Soviet day of reckoning has approached. Warm words of support, he may
reflect, are one of liberal capitalism's cheaper commodities.
Yet the collapse of the Soviet planned economy has also made economic and
political life very difficult for western governments with activist
inclinations. The electoral failure of the French Socialists suggests that
left-inclined governments must offer something more than monetarism laced
with protectionist rhetoric. The challenge for US President Bill Clinton,
elected to reverse a decade of 'trickle-down' economics, is to find a
government activism which works.
The US administration has chosen to emphasise the need to raise the low
level of US investment in order to raise productivity and growth. Professors
Bradford De Long and Lawrence Summers, previously economists at Harvard
University and now key members of Mr Clinton's Treasury team, have
exhaustively investigated the relationship between investment and economic
growth. Their findings confirm that those countries which achieve a high
level of equipment investment do tend to have higher rates of growth of
output per head.
The link exists, they argue, because the technical expertise of the
workforce depends on the availability of capital on which to learn and gain
experience. Hence equipment investment is much more important for growth
purposes than investment in buildings and residential construction. They
find that each extra percentage point in the equipment investment share of
GDP raises growth by 0.3 percentage points compared to a mere 0.02
percentage points for other investments.
But is the link causal? The correlation is certainly powerful - differing
levels of equipment investment explain about three quarters of the variation
in output growth among relatively high productivity countries and two fifths
when developing countries are included - but does this imply that more
investment means more growth or instead that fast growing economies tend to
attract more investment?
De Long and Summers' answer leads directly to their policy prescriptions. If
the causal chain ran from growth to investment, then the higher demand for
capital goods in fast-growing economies should mean higher prices for
capital equipment relative to other goods. But fast-growing economies tend
to have a lower relative price for capital equipment which in turn makes
investment more profitable. Indeed, investing in Japan is attractive in part
because the relative prices of equipment are 20 per cent less than in
economies with comparable productivity as prices are so high in Japan's
distorted service sector.
Rather than artificially raising the prices of services, De Long and Summers
prefer policies which reduce the relative price of new investment, perhaps a
more permanent version of the Clinton temporary investment tax credit. But
they oppose protectionist industrial policies which tend to raise the cost
of investment and acknowledge that Japan's success can also be attributed to
its high level of national savings. Raising US saving means either higher
taxes or less government spending, thus clipping activists' wings.
The Soviet experience of non-market investment promotion provides a further
qualification. Post-war Soviet economic policymakers certainly succeeded in
boosting the level of capital investment to much higher levels than the US
achieved. But the effects on living standards were disastrous and
politically difficult to reverse, a fact to which Mr Yeltsin can testify.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Yeltsin faces impeachment: Russian parliament says rule by
decree is an 'assault on constitution'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN deputies yesterday set in motion moves to impeach President Boris
Yeltsin, after he declared he would go over their heads to ask the people
whether he or parliament should rule Russia.
But his most diehard opponents appeared to have shied away from more
resolute or immediate steps to try to oust him from office.
In a desperate gamble to retain strong powers to pursue radical reforms, Mr
Yeltsin has called a popular vote for April 25, even though the Congress of
People's Deputies has forbidden a formal referendum. Until then, he
declared, he would rule by decree.
In an angry emergency session of the Supreme Soviet, deputies condemned his
actions as 'an assault to the constitutional foundations of Russian
statehood' and asked the Constitutional Court to review his actions.
If the court finds that Mr Yeltsin has violated the Soviet-era constitution,
he could be impeached by the full parliament, the Congress of People's
Deputies.
But deputies ended their meeting without convening a session of Congress to
consider Mr Yeltsin's impeachment.
As a result, it appeared Mr Yeltsin may have emerged from the day's
manoeuvring stronger than at first expected, though the ultimate outcome of
the battle for power remained unclear.
The deputies' resolution, adopted by 125 votes to 16, with four abstentions,
also called for the prosecution of presidential officials involved in
drafting Mr Yeltsin's appeal to the people, broadcast on
The constitutional court's deliberations are expected this week. Like the
Russian parliament, the court is dominated by conservatives.
In an instant verdict, Mr Valery Zorkin, the court's chairman, described the
president's move as an 'attempted coup'. But Mr Zorkin, who had already put
his supposed impartiality in doubt by coming out against a referendum, was
attacked by one fellow judge for prejudging court hearings.
Mr Zorkin's remarks were a sign of a deepening split in Russia's leadership,
with prominent figures anticipating a final showdown between the
parliamentary and presidential camps. Vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, who
says he favours strong presidency but is against radical economic reforms,
swung firmly in favour of parliament.
He has positioned himself as the man to pick up the pieces if things go
badly wrong for Mr Yeltsin.
Mr Yuri Skokov, conservative secretary of the National Security Council,
also refused to endorse the presidential gamble.
But the entire cabinet of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, parliament's choice for
premier, came out in favour of the president's move.
They issued a statement supporting 'the striving by the popularly elected
president not to allow powerlessness, chaos, political confrontation,
separatism, nationalism, and crime'.
Ministers also vowed the government would guarantee 'constitutional
legality', personal freedoms, and stable functioning of the economy,
transport, and communications.
This means they will try to focus on specific reforms set out in the
government's economic programme, including a restrictive monetary and credit
policy.
The gamble being taken by the west in backing Mr Yeltsin was underlined in a
separate parliamentary resolution condemning western leaders' comments over
the weekend as 'crude interference' in Russia's internal affairs.

FT  22 MAR 93 / French right wing heads for landslide poll win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE was last night on the road to electing the biggest conservative
majority in its parliament this century, threatening confrontation with Mr
Francois Mitterrand who remains president despite his Socialist government's
defeat.
With 566 of the National Assembly's 577 constituencies counted, the Gaullist
RPR and centre-right UDF parties had won 76 seats decided at yesterday's
first round of voting - without a single seat going to the Socialists who
have been in government since 1988.
Polling predictions forecast that after the second round of voting next
Sunday the two conservative parties, fighting under the banner of the Union
pour la France (UPF), might win 440 to 476 seats.
President Mitterrand's choice of prime minister will be largely determined
by the relative showing of the UDF and the RPR. It appeared last night that
each party would gain between 19 and 20 per cent of the vote which leaves it
unclear which of the two parties would emerge with the stronger claim to
provide the next prime minister.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the current Socialist prime minister, acknowledged
defeat, calling the outcome 'a severe failure' which he blamed on Europe's
recession. Mr Beregovoy himself was forced into a run-off ballot next
weekend, after which he is expected to offer his government's resignation.
Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, called on
electors to use the second round to rally behind 'any left-wing, ecological
or progressive' candidate who had done the best in the first ballot
yesterday. But, given the poor performance of all left-wing parties, the
Socialists' best hope of keeping the conservative victory in check is the
possibility that many who abstained from voting yesterday were Socialist
sympathisers and that some may feel driven to vote and UDF did not encourage
such speculation. Mr Chirac warned his supporters of an excess of optimism
and to keep up their effort until next Sunday - a sentiment echoed by Mr
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF.
Mr Alain Juppe, the RPR secretary-general warned that the conservative
victors had 'a terribly difficult task' in front of them to put the economy
to rights, and to accomplish this 'a majority of some 460 seats was not
excessive'.
Mr Mitterrand still has two more years of his seven-year presidential term
to run, and few supporters of the UPF coalition believe he will quit early.
But Mr Juppe said 'the rejection of President Mitterrand is very deep', and
warned that 'we (the right) will apply our programme with aggression but
without concession' to the president.
Early computer predictions gave the Socialists the possibility of winning
fewer than 60 seats on some 19 per cent of the vote, and only 70 seats if
ecologist voters switched their support to the Socialists in the second
round.
Mr Fabius said 'the left risks being crushed in parliament'. He attributed
thedefeat to 'the wear and tear of time, unemployment, and disappointment'.

FT  22 MAR 93 / West rallies in support of president's plebiscite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN governments have rallied in strong political support of President
Boris Yeltsin's decision to call a popular vote on who rules Russia, though
differences persist on what practical help can be given to him.
The US took the lead at the weekend in backing Mr Yeltsin's move as an
'appropriate' way of breaking the deadlock between Russia's president and
parliament. 'President Yeltsin has proposed to break that political impasse
by taking it to the people. That is appropriate in democracies,' the White
House said in a statement issued after Mr Yeltsin's announcement. 'As
Russia's only democratically elected national leader, he has our support as
do his reform government and all reforms throughout the Russian Federation.'
It said Russia must remain democratic and keep moving towards a market
economy. 'That is the basis for a continued US-Russian partnership and for a
better and more prosperous future for the Russian people.'
The US statement was echoed by the European Community, and by members of the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations, some of whom were given advance
notice of Mr Yeltsin's move.
In Bonn, Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said that the 'German
government has understanding for Mr Yeltsin's action towards solving the
constitutional struggle through a referendum'.
But Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, said economic assistance would have
to be increased so that Mr Yeltsin could push through his economic reforms.
France, meanwhile, stepped up its campaign for an emergency G7 meeting to
discuss aid for Russia. 'International aid seems more than ever necessary
and urgent to help the transition to a market economy and consolidate
democratic reforms in Russia,' a foreign ministry statement said.
The Japanese government, which is due to host the next regular G7 summit in
Tokyo in July, pledged it would make further efforts to reach agreement with
its G7 partners on measures to promote reform in Russia. Mr Hisashi Owada, a
senior foreign ministry official, is attempting to clear the way for a
mid-April meeting in Tokyo of G7 foreign and finance ministers.
However, both Japan and EC officials remain deeply sceptical about the
economic case for a large-scale aid programme given the chaotic state of the
Russian economy.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Banks may seek customers' consent for credit checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH STREET banks may soon end the 150-year-old custom of disclosing
information about customers' accounts without their permission .
Confidential proposals drawn up by the British Bankers' Association would
end the practice by most banks of automatically providing personal credit
references when they receive a 'status inquiry' from another bank acting on
behalf of a third party.
The custom has been criticised for potentially allowing private detectives
and companies to mount 'fishing expeditions' about individuals' accounts.
The association is proposing a system under which banks would stop
disclosing information to each other. They would instead respond directly to
inquiries from individuals or companies about a customer, but only with the
customer's written consent.
The new arrangement could be launched later this year, if approved by banks
on the association governing council. It may lead to an amendment to the
banking code of practice, which says only that banks will give details of
their status inquiry policy on request.
It is common for landlords to make status inquiries about potential tenants
to ensure that they can pay rent. Status inquiries are also believed to have
been used by private detectives to establish individuals' creditworthiness
in cases such as divorce settlements.
Although banks traditionally reply to inquiries in coded language, it has
been thought possible to obtain a reasonable level of account detail by
making a series of inquiries about whether an individual can afford various
levels of payment.
Barclays and National Westminster are among banks which currently give coded
replies to other banks that inquire about their customers' creditworthiness.
They do not disclose precise details of accounts, and do not charge the bank
making the inquiry.
The status inquiry system has become fragmented because both Lloyds and the
Co-operative Bank no longer respond to inquiries from other banks. Lloyds
will only provide credit references directly to customers, for a Pounds 20
fee.
The association, which represents all the large clearing banks, admits in an
internal paper that gradual attempts by some banks to change the custom has
now led to a 'somewhat mangled system, largely misunderstood by customers'.
A change in policy could lead to banks starting to charge customers for
providing credit references. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the
Consumers' Association, said it was concerned that charges could restrict
competition among banks.
The association's paper says that the new system would be 'customer driven'
and would allow banks to respond to 'any and every status inquiry direct so
long as the customer concerned has consented and authorised the giving of a
reply'.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Right set for record win in French elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE was last night on the road to election of a record conservative
parliamentary majority, threatening a clash with Mr Francois Mitterrand, who
remains president despite the defeat of his Socialist government.
An exit poll released at 8pm local time (7pm GMT) as the last voting booths
closed, gave the conservative Gaullist RPR and the centre-right UDF parties,
fighting under the banner of Union pour la France (UPF), as many as 484
seats in the 577-member National Assembly with 40.5 per cent of the vote.
The poll, by the polling organisation Sofres, predicted that the Socialists
would win only 57 seats with 19 per cent of the vote.
Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, said 'the left
risks being crushed in parliament' and called on electors to give their
support in the second voting round next Sunday to those Socialists and
ecologists who were best placed in yesterday's vote.
He estimated that rightwing candidates had already won nearly 100 seats
yesterday, while the left had won not a single victory. The extreme right
National Front was projected to win up to 13 per cent of the vote.
Mr Fabius attributed the Socialists' crushing defeat to 'the wear and tear
of time, unemployment, and disappointment'. Even so, he said, 'this is a
harsh penalty'. The Socialists fought their campaign against a background of
recession, a 10.5 per cent jobless rate and a series of scandals.
To win in the first round, candidates needed to get an absolute majority of
50 per cent of votes. A second ballot will be held in most seats on March
28, when the candidate who simply gets more votes than the others wins.
But the surprising development of last night - the relative success of all
parties on the broad right over all those on the broad left - leaves the UPF
parties well placed for their widely predicted landslide victory.
Despite the often fraught relations between the two groups, it had been
expected that the Socialists and the environmentalists would pass their
support to each other next Sunday in order to try to block the
conservatives.
But the Sofres poll gave the joint environmental group, composed of the
Verts and Generation Ecologie a combined vote of just 8.5 per cent, far too
little to gain them any seats in the parliament and to give Socialist
candidates much effective support in the second round of voting.
Mr Mitterrand will choose the next prime minister. But his choice will be
largely determined by the relative showing of the two components of the
coalition.

FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Singer to take control of rival
sewing-machine group
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGER, one of the world's leading sewing-machine makers, is to take control
of Pfaff, its German rival.
Mr Wolfgang Schuppli, Pfaff's largest single shareholder and chairman of its
supervisory board, has agreed to sell his 29 per cent stake to Singer's
parent, Semi-Tech Global. Before the transfer of his holding, Semi-Tech will
acquire an initial 22 per cent through bilateral negotiations with other
stock-holders, Pfaff said yesterday.
No details were given of the price to be paid for the targeted 51 per cent
stake. The deal, supported by the German company's board and now under
examination by the cartel authorities in Berlin, is expected to be concluded
later this year.
The two brands are estimated to command an overall 20 per cent market share
in Germany.
Pfaff, the world's second-biggest industrial sewing-machine maker after Juky
of Japan, has run into difficulties following the collapse of its markets in
eastern Europe.
In 1991 it lost DM18m (Dollars 10.9m) on sales of DM1bn. The books have not
yet been closed on 1992, but turnover fell by 5 per cent during the year and
profits had not improved, according to Pfaff. The group's household machines
business, which accounts for 25 per cent of sales, is still profitable.
Semi-Tech Global, part of the Canadian Semi-Tech International group which
also owns the Japanese Sansui Electric company, is listed on the Hong Kong
stock exchange. The group has annual sales of more than Dollars 2bn. It took
a 51 per cent stake in Singer, a household machine specialist, in 1988 and
has since steered it out of difficulties with continuing increases in sales
and profits, according to Pfaff.
The Pfaff brand will remain, but the implications for its 6,700 workers are
unclear. The agreement announced yesterday followed talks on a co-operation
deal under which Singer was to supply Pfaff with cheaper components from its
far eastern plants.

FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japan's steel makers see sharp
falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading steel makers forecast falls in pre-tax profit of more than
70 per cent, as demand from the car and construction industry falters and
diversification programmes remain a burden on earnings.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel maker, forecasts a 72 per cent fall
in pre-tax profit to Y28bn (Dollars 24m) in the year ending this month, and
a 9 per cent fall in sales to Y2,390bn, as increased competition in
international markets reduces margins and domestic sales fall.
The company said Japanese steel production was likely to decline some 8 per
cent this year, in spite of heavy demand from China, where a construction
boom has led to a four-fold rise in imports from Japan, compared with a year
earlier.
Three makers - NKK, Kawasaki Steel, and Sumitomo Metal Industries - forecast
a net profit of zero, while all expect sharply lower pre-tax profits: NKK at
Y5bn, down from Y37.5bn; Kawasaki at Y7.5bn, down from Y43bn; and Sumitomo
at Y5bn, down from Y40.5bn.
Kobe Steel said it expects sales of Y1,180bn and a pre-tax profit of Y14bn,
compared with Y1,301bn and Y47.7bn in the previous period. It said that net
profit, forecast at Y12bn, would be bolstered by extraordinary gains on
sales of property and stocks.
Each of the leading five makers has suffered along with the Japanese car
industry, which expects sales in the coming fiscal year to rise by a slim
1.6 per cent.
Although construction orders will be assisted by a planned increase in
infra-structure spending, a large inventory of materials has already been
accumulated and steel production appears likely to drop again next year.
With core profits under pressure, the companies are reviewing
diversification programmes launched during the mid-1980s in an attempt to
reduce their reliance on steel production.
The plunge in earnings this year suggests that these new areas have yet to
produce the additional profits that were foreseen when the investments were
made.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Purchase of Southam stakeby The Telegraph delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MR CONRAD BLACK's plan to sell half his private company's stake in the
Canadian Southam newspaper group to The Telegraph, the UK-listed company he
controls through Hollinger Group, was delayed yesterday after The
Telegraph's independent directors learned that another investor is buying
Southam shares much more cheaply.
The directors learned early this week that Mr Black had agreed to Southam's
issue of 13m shares at a price of CDollars 14 (Pounds 7.80) each - only days
after they recommended that the Telegraph should pay CDollars 18.10 a share
for half of Hollinger's 22.5 per cent stake, at a total cost of Pounds
72.3m.
The purchaser of the newly issued shares in Canada's largest newspaper group
is Power Corporation, the holding company of Montreal financier, Mr Paul
Desmarais.
The Telegraph yesterday decided to adjourn an extraordinary general meeting
scheduled for March 30, at which shareholders would have voted on the
purchase. The independent directors said information would be sent to
shareholders 'as soon as possible' once they and their advisers, N M
Rothschild, had examined the new development.
Their scrutiny will focus on the price. It is possible they may demand some
reduction before an EGM, although it is unlikely to be as low as that paid
by Power. Southam's share price rose sharply yesterday on the news of
Power's involvement from CDollars 14 to CDollars 15.88.
Mr Black said from Palm Beach, Florida, yesterday that Power's involvement
would 'considerably' enhance the desirability of the Telegraph investment in
Southam. He said Southam's share price would have climbed to more than
CDollars 20 if Power had bought its shares on the open market. According to
Mr Black, the EGM is being delayed simply to allow time to draw up an
amended circular. 'All our readings are that shareholders are coming in
nicely,' he said.
The arrival of Power at Southam acts as a counterweight to Mr Black. The
deal makes it increasingly difficult for either Mr Black or The Telegraph to
take control of Southam, which last year incurred losses of CDollars 263m
after restructuring charges.
In its circular to shareholders which originally recommended the purchase,
Telegraph directors described the Southam investment as a 'unique
opportunity'. Mr Joe Cooke, Telegraph managing director, had said the group
would be able to influence Southam through three directors nominated by
Hollinger and The Telegraph.
The issue of shares to Power, however, will dilute the Hollinger holding
from 22.5 per cent to 18.7 per cent. Power, which already holds 1.4m Southam
shares, will have roughly the same stake. Both investors will have three
seats on the 16-strong board, and have agreed to vote together.
Each has the right of first refusal on the other's holdings, and each can
own up to 23.5 per cent of Southam. Power said its block was being acquired
for 'investment purposes', but it might buy additional Southam shares
'depending on market conditions' and other factors.
Hollinger has offered a 'put' option which would allow The Telegraph to
require it to buy back Southam shares at the CDollars 18.10 price for up to
a year.

<TEXT>
If minority shareholders in The Telegraph were unhappy at the thought of
investing Pounds 72m in Southam, the loss-making Canadian newspaper group,
they must be doubly so after seeing the terms obtained by Power Corporation.
It is buying shares direct from Southam at CDollars 14.00. The Telegraph is
supposed to buy them from Hollinger at CDollars 18.10, thereby reliquifying
its majority shareholder while saving it from realising a loss on its
original purchase.
The Telegraph will use the proceeds from the sale of its holding in Trinity
International which was also wished on it by Hollinger. Since that stake
made The Telegraph a profit, it is understandable that Mr Conrad Black
should want it to help out again. In the back-scratching world of
independent entrepreneurs, that gives the deal a certain logic. It is
different - especially given the high standards required post- Maxwell -
when those involved also have responsibilities to outside shareholders.
High on the list of those responsibilities is a duty to ensure that any deal
is done at the best possible price. Given the Power terms, The Telegraph
cannot possibly argue that a premium is being paid for control. Nor is the
put option on the stake worth much unless its independent directors can
force the company to exercise it. They made a bad start by recommending the
deal in the first place. At least Power's involvement gives them an
opportunity to redeem themselves by calling a halt.

NIKON, the camera and precision instruments manufacturer, expects to post a
pre-tax loss in the year ending in March - its first loss in 34 years.
The company had expected to break even, but now warns of a pre-tax loss of
Y2.2bn (Dollars 18.8m) on revenues of Y205bn, down from an earlier forecast
of Y210bn.
A weaker-than-expected market for cameras and semiconductor manufacturing
equipment was responsible for the revised figures, Nikon said.
Although overall camera sales were steady and the division had made a
profit, the level of sales had been much lower than the company had
expected.
Demand for single-lens reflex cameras and lenses was particularly weak,
although compact cameras sold well.
The weakness of the semiconductor market had also been a factor behind
Nikon's downturn. Sales were down 30 per cent on the previous year.
The company believes that the first half of next year will remain difficult.
A return to profit depends largely on the extent of the expected economic
recovery in the second half, the company said.
Victor of Japan (JVC) plans to take half-finished digital compact cassette
players from its majority shareholder Matsushita Electric Industrial in
order to save production costs, Reuter reports from Tokyo.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Granada backed in franchise row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDEPENDENT Television Commission has rejected charges that Granada TV
is in breach of the conditions of its broadcasting licence, a claim made
last month by Ms Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary.
Ms Clwyd alleged that Granada was reneging on promises made in its franchise
application that it would make 20 prestige drama and film productions.
She further accused the company of putting profits before quality. Granada
TV issued a vigorous rebuttal of the allegations, which the ITC has totally
supported.
In its ruling yesterday the ITC, the commercial network's supervisory
authority, said: 'There is no evidence that the licence conditions will not
be met.'
The ITC pointed out that while there has been a 'significant number changes
in board membership', 10 of the 17 senior staff members named in Granada's
successful fran-chise bid are still with the company.
Ms Clwyd said that Granada's Liverpool news operation - a key element of its
commitment to regional programming - had been closed down, which the ITC
said was incorrect.
The ruling added: 'The ITC will continue to monitor the performance of all
its licensees against their licence conditions.' It 'totally refutes' Ms
Clwyd's 'unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations that the ITC is failing
in its regulatory duties'.
Ms Clwyd intends raising the matter again in the House of Commons on Monday.
Mr Charles Allen, Granada's chief executive, welcomed the ITC's ruling,
adding that Granada's commitment 'to the highest quality regional and
network programmes continues stronger than ever before'.
The ITC signalled yesterday that it is closely monitoring developments at
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television. Yorkshire took over Tyne Tees in 1992. The
ITC is concerned that the merged company will abide by ITC requirements to
continue regional broadcasting in the former Tyne Tees region.
The pornographic satellite television channel Red Hot Television, formerly
titled Red Hot Dutch, is to be banned in the UK, the government said
yesterday.

<TEXT>
ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the US brewer best known for its Budweiser brand, has joined
forces with Kirin Brewery, Japan's largest beer company, to set up a joint
venture to sell Budweiser in Japan.
Anheuser will provide 90 per cent of the Y9bn (Dollars 77m) capital of the
new company, while Kirin will hold a 10 per cent stake. Anheuser plans to
boost its market share in Japan from the present 1.2 per cent to 5 per cent
by distributing Budweiser through Kirin's network.
The US brewer will terminate its current distributing contract with Suntory,
a medium-sized Japanese beverage company, in September.
The move comes after extensive negotiations with Japan's Fair Trade
Commission, the country's anti-monopoly watchdog. Kirin already has almost
50 per cent of the Japanese beer market, and in an unusual move, the FTC
advised that Kirin take a small stake in the new company.
The agreement comes as Japan's beer market is showing signs of shrinking due
to the slowing economy.
However, Kirin said the joint venture was a long-term commitment, and it
believed that the new company would revitalise the market.

FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Shares in Baltica suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Denmark's biggest insurance group, Baltica Holding, and its
insurance arm, Baltica Insurance, were suspended yesterday after the stock
plunged from DKr216 to DKr155.
The company is negotiating with banks about its financial problems, which
may lead to changes in the group's structure.
Details of the restructuring will be published 'before the end of March', at
the same time as the group's annual accounts.
Baltica was rescued last year when Den Danske Bank bought 32 per cent of the
shares in Baltica Insurance, a move that relieved Baltica's immediate
cash-flow problem.
The group said at the time that it expected to make a 1992 group loss of
between DKr2.5bn (Dollars 393m) and DKr2.8bn and that its equity capital
would be reduced from just over DKr9bn at the end of 1991 to between
DKr4.5bn and DKr4.8bn. Some analysts now expect the 1992 loss to exceed
DKr3bn.
The problems at Baltica are concentrated in the holding company, which was
set up in the mid-1980s to enable the insurance company to venture into
banking and other non-insurance financial activities.
The holding company has had to make large write-offs and provisions on an
office complex development project in Gibraltar and on a Danish property
business, Sanexco.
Baltica is the second big Danish insurer to hit trouble. Last August, Hafnia
Holding, Baltica's main domestic rival, suspended payments after its equity
capital was wiped out by losses on strategic shareholdings in Baltica and
the Swedish insurer, Skandia.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Government faces new row in bid to save pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S problems over the future of Britain's coal industry
deepened last night as it emerged that a five-month review had failed to
provide a guaranteed future for any of the 31 threatened pits.
The Department of Trade and Industry is preparing to publish a white paper
on coal by April 2 even though its concedes it is not possible to secure
deals by then with generators to take additional coal supplies.
Its decision will increase fears that only a handful of the 31 pits have a
long-term future. It also means that thousands of miners' jobs will remain
under threat for several months longer.
A white paper without guarantees will also lay the government open to
potential further rebellion by dissident Tory MPs.
Labour will charge that the all-party trade and industry select committee
was able to produce a formula for saving at least half the 31 pits by the
end of January.
The white paper will stress limitations on expanding the market for coal but
is unlikely to say how many tonnes extra can be created in the market for
coal, or how many pits can be saved.
The publication date will depend on when, and if, the negotiations for the
base contracts between British Coal and the electricity companies can be
concluded. Officials in the Department of Trade and Industry are expected to
work over the weekend to resolve remaining issues through binding
arbitration.
Although considerable progress was made in negotiations in the last two
days, some regional electricity companies are still saying they do not want
to sign anything before the white paper is published. Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, has said the contracts must be signed before
the white paper.
A compromise is likely. Even if the problems over base tonnages can be
resolved, talks with the generators for additional contracts are some way
off conclusion. It is these negotiations which will determine how many of
the 31 pits can remain open.
The white paper will stress that the future of mines should be determined by
the market. It is likely to offer the prospect of providing subsidies to
keep open some of the threatened pits but will leave the detail of how many
to negotiations between British Coal and the generators.
This is likely to take several months. Meanwhile, as a prelude to
privatisation of the coal industry, the government will arrange for private
mining companies to lease pits which are not wanted by British Coal. Leasing
talks cannot begin before the white paper is published and are likely to be
lengthy.
The government is likely to signal the first stage in the privatisation of
British Coal in the white paper, but will need to pass legislation before
any pits are sold off. It is thought that the earliest date of publication
for the white paper would be Thursday next week.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Money supply growth could bolster Tokyo share surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST severe monetary con-traction in Japanese post-war history may be
over, according to figures published yesterday which show that the money
supply has started to grow again.
The Bank of Japan said the money supply in February grew by 0.2 per cent
compared with the year before. In January, the year-on-year figure showed a
contraction of 0.3 per cent.
The money supply's revival may help to fuel the recent strong rally in the
Tokyo stock market. The Nikkei average closed at 18,537 yesterday, down by
190 points on the day, but 10 per cent up from a close of 16,817 two weeks
ago.
Some analysts believe the rebound in Tokyo share prices may mark the end of
a three-year bear market as the decline in the Japanese economy bottoms out
with signs of increased production in some areas such as steel and bulk
chemicals.
The rally, however, has mainly been driven by speculation about the
government's plans for a further package of measures to stimulate the
economy. These are likely to be finalised shortly before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the prime minister, leaves for a visit to Washington on April 15.
The renewed growth in the broadly defined money supply, M2 and certificates
of deposits, follows the Bank of Japan's recent cut in its official discount
rate to a historic low of 2.5 per cent.
The money supply grew by 0.5 per cent from January, when it had contracted
by 0.3 per cent. It fell by 0.5 per cent last September, the first
contraction on record, and then by 0.6 per cent in October and November.
Broad liquidity, which measures monetary conditions more generally, rose by
2.9 per cent in February, up from a growth rate of 2.6 per cent in January.
The Bank of Japan said the rise was due to increased holdings of commercial
paper by financial institutions and reduced tax payments by corporations.
A government savings survey, however, suggested renewed strong growth in
personal consumption, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of gross
domestic product, is unlikely.
The survey by the management and co-ordination agency found that the savings
of salaried workers rose by 5.2 per cent in 1992 to an average of Y11.87m
(Pounds 69,000) compared with the year before, while savings among
non-salaried workers rose by 4.3 per cent to an average of Y21.25m.
The ratio of savings to income stood at 1.6 per cent last year, up from 1.2
per cent ten years before. The report said the increased savings were mainly
to pay for pensions as Japan's population is ageing rapidly.
Toyota and Nissan, the leading carmakers, underlined the economy's
sluggishness by announcing that their domestic production last month fell by
1.2 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.

STORES group Marks and Spencer led a revival in high street retailer stocks
as the sector responded to several factors to move ahead sprightly. Strong
sterling encouraged confidence that the much-vaunted economic recovery was
now showing through. Clothing retailers were also responding to figures
earlier this week which indicated that womenswear sales in January had grown
by 22 per cent and footwear by 23 per cent.
M&amp;S jumped 10 to 359p in hefty turnover of 6.2m. Specialists said the stock
was benefiting from talk in the market that February sales had been buoyant.
Elsewhere, Argos added 7 to 305p, Burton Group 2 1/2 to 83p with 7.2m
traded, Great Universal Stores 33 to 1665p, Next 4 1/2 p to 161p and Sears 4
to 102p.
However, some dealers pointed out that stock shortages had been behind some
of the rises and that technical corrections may follow.

MR JULIAN DAVIDSON, a consultant in design, printing and advertising, was

He was chosen from a shortlist of three which included Mr John Maples, a

FT  20 MAR 93 / Judge rules on NY Post row
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A bankruptcy court judge ruled yesterday that the New York Post will remain
in the hands of Mr Abe Hirschfeld, a car parks tycoon at loggerheads with
the tabloid newspaper's staff.
Judge Francis Conrad said he would not consider offers for the newspaper
from other bidders. New York's governor Mario Cuomo, who has been trying to
organise an investor group to bid for the paper, will now have to deal
directly with Mr Hirschfeld.
Mr Steven Hoffenberg, a debt collection entrepreneur who briefly ran the
paper before a Securities and Exchange lawsuit froze his assets and
prevented him from completing the purchase, was barred from interfering with
the sale to Mr Hirschfeld.

FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Kawakami ousted from board of
Yamaha
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THREE generations of family rule ended at Yamaha, the world's largest maker
of musical instruments, with the decision yesterday to oust Mr Hiroshi
Kawakami, grandson of the company's founder, from the board.
Mr Kawakami, who was suddenly forced to resign as president of Yamaha in
February last year, is also relinquishing his position as a board member in
June. He will become a director of a little-known affiliate company, Yamaha
Resort.
Mr Kawakami's resignation last year as president had been triggered by a
demand from Yamaha's labour union for him to take responsibility for the
company's poor performance.
The latest coup was triggered by the displeasure of company management at
his comments to the media after his resignation from the presidency. Earlier
this month, an article based on an interview with Mr Kawakami and describing
his anger at being ousted in a boardroom coup appeared in a popular weekly
magazine. 'Those comments . . . have damaged the company's reputation,' a
company representative explained.
Mr Hideto Eguchi, president of Yamaha Motor, the motorcycle manufacturer and
member of the Yamaha group, is also resigning as chairman of the musical
instrument maker, just one year after he assumed the post.
Yamaha said it had no plans to fill the chairmanship after Mr Eguchi vacates
the post after a board meeting in June. Mr Eguchi will concentrate on the
motor business, which faces an increasingly difficult trading environment.
Mr Kawakami's departure formally ends the rule of the Kawakami family, which
began in 1897 with the establishment of the company by Mr Kawakami's
grandfather.
Yamaha has been hit by a plunge in demand for musical instruments. In the
six months to September it reported a 43.7 per cent drop in pre-tax profits
to Y3.87bn (Dollars 33.1m) and cut its interim dividend.
Brother Industries, a maker of small machinery, plans to transfer production
of portable electronic typewriters to a US plant for export to Japan and
Asia, AP-DJ reports.
The company manufactures models in the US and Europe for sale in those
areas, but to date has been making units for Asian markets in Japan.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Sour sound of twisted surveys: Dominic Lawson hears
pro-Maastricht politicians utter the most depressing words in English
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ALL have our own ideas about what constitute the most depressing words in
the English language. Sir Kingsley Amis, famously partial to a drink before
lunch, once nominated the phrase 'Shall we go straight through?' As I
recall, Sir Kingsley's runner up for the prize was 'Red or White, Sir?'.
My nomination would have to go to the phrase 'according to a recent survey .
. .' Usually this forms the introduction to the sort of article which
purports to prove that breathing can give you cancer, that advertising pays,
or that pigs can fly. More dangerously, it is a phrase beloved of
politicians hoping to justify a policy or to defend their appalling record.
A horrible example was perpetrated last week by the foreign secretary,
Douglas Hurd, as part of his increasingly desperate attempts to persuade
members of his party that they should support the government's Maastricht
Bill. Hurd quoted a survey by a body calling itself the European Policy
Forum - a disinterested body, I am sure - to the effect that if Britain
failed to ratify the Maastricht Treaty 'the cost to our national income of .
. . a policy of detachment . . . would be some Pounds 50bn over five years.'
This fantastic figure was later given the highest political authority, by
being quoted in a speech by the prime minister.
You are probably wondering how the European Policy Forum arrived at this
figure. Simple. It supposed that foreign direct investment in Britain would
amount to 3 per cent of output, or Pounds 20bn a year. It further supposed
that this figure would be halved if Britain pulled out of the Maastricht
process. This is the truly heroic assumption, which the prime minister and
the foreign secretary apparently share, and which enables them to claim that
Britain would 'lose' Pounds 10bn a year, and hence Pounds 50bn over five.
QED, I don't think.
Not surprisingly this piece of arithmetical mumbo-jumbo failed to impress
anti-Maastricht Tory MPs. So the government's faithful euro-hound, the
Confederation of British Industry did its bit by circulating a brief to MPs
and peers which claimed that: 'If the UK fails to ratify the Maastricht
Treaty and is perceived to be part of a second tier in a two speed Europe,
this would have a negative effect on half the (foreign) investors'.
It later turned out that of the 16 foreign companies questioned by the CBI,
only one said categorically that a failure to ratify Maastricht would have a
serious impact on its investment in Britain. According to the Sunday
Telegraph, one of the companies, a Japanese car maker, was typical of the
general tone, saying: 'Disinvestment is unthinkable regardless of the
political situation. We have made a commitment to the UK and disinvestment
will not happen, no matter what.'
Possibly that response contains an element of diplomatic exaggeration, but
is it not odd that Major and Hurd did not give this part of the survey the
publicity they gave to the more negative aspects? They are always
complaining about those who knock Britain. Yet here was a Japanese company
prepared to say it would invest in Britain regardless of Maastricht, and the
government attempts to suppress the good news.
The truth is that politicians use only those survey answers which suit their
political objectives. That is why the government will not wish to draw
attention to another, heartening, survey, which was reported in the FT on
Monday.
KPMG Peat Marwick Consultants interviewed 50 EC banks, and found that most
assume that Britain will be in the slow lane, and that monetary union will
take place with an inner core of Germany, France, and the Benelux countries.
Bad news for Britain? Not a bit of it, say the banks, who 'anticipate a
trend towards centralised currency trading in London in the aftermath of
union, irrespective of whether or not Britain rejoins the EMS.'
Why does the government keep twisting surveys to prove that Britain will
become an economic pariah, if it does not ratify Maastricht? The answer is,
because it has no positive reasons for wanting the treaty. So it is left
only with negative ones, which amount to no more than handwringing and
bedwetting. It does not take a survey to see that.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Private View: Challenging the new gods - Science critic
Joseph Schwartz explains how he evaluates the most complex of theories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUSIC critics and theatre critics we know about, and literary critics, art
critics and ballet critics. But what on earth is a science critic - apart
from a contradiction in terms?
Dr Joseph Schwartz is a New Yorker with a west coast drawl, a Harpo Marx
hairstyle and a gift for polemics. As a child, he stood on garment workers'
picket lines; as a youth, he produced pi meson particles in Berkeley. In his
20s, he was inspired by the civil rights movement. He took up psychology and
now he is a psychotherapist in Belsize Park, London.
Also, Schwartz writes. He is a science critic.
Opera, he will tell you, is another way of singing, just as painting is
another way of seeing. Science is simply another way of understanding the
world. It is not so pure, after all. It is as susceptible to an informed
critique as any other human activity.
'I don't paint the pictures,' he said. 'I don't make up the theories. But I
evaluate them. A painter can talk about a painting: we don't have to agree
with what the painter says is in the painting. We look to see what it says
for ourselves.
'Well, waddya think?' he said, jumping up from the kitchen table. 'When the
man in the white suit says radiation won't hurt you, waddya think? I'd like
people to have confidence with their own assessments. Sure, they have to be
open to information. I suppose I'm attacking the authority, the inflated
authority of science.'
And attack he does. Today's particle physicists are autistic, he says,
staring vacantly at mathematical expressions of their own creation. 'String
theory' may be the dernier cri, but is boring and cannot be tested
experimentally. DNA has replaced the Deity as the agent of predestination.
We have lost confidence in our capacity to understand, and our science
writers - whether of the 'gee-whiz' or 'shock-horror' school - have not
liberated us from primitive notions of what science really is.
What does it mean, I asked Schwartz, to say that a work of science, like a
work of art, is 'poor'? Either a theory works or it doesn't.
'Well, you could say it doesn't work, or it has too many assumptions, it's
not testable, can't be compared to experience; or it's unsatisfying, it's
unaesthetic . . . What I'm trying to do is formalise the kinds of
conversations you could have quietly, in the corridor, with scientists at a
scientific meeting.'
Schwartz began an imaginary dialogue. 'What do you think of 'strings'?
(You're not going to get an active physicist saying it's the truth or
anything like that.) They might say: well, it really stinks. What do you
think of quantum mechanics? Well, I don't see how to do anything better, but
yeah, I was always bothered by it as a student . . . That kind of thing.'
In 1959, CP Snow gave us the phrase 'the two cultures' to describe a state
of mutual incomprehension between science and the humanities. Today the
sociology of science is itself in conflict: one group continues to see
Western science as anonymous, universal, dispassionate and privileged. The
newer, relativist group, describes scientific knowledge as a social
construct whose focus and direction owe as much to history and culture as to
empirical analysis. Lobbies have formed and tempers have frayed, with
exaggeration and misrepresentation on both sides.
We are watching a replay of the 19th-century Darwinian controversy, Schwartz
said. The traditionalists will not recognise that science is a human
activity - that we create our understandings. The anti-science lobby will
not acknowledge the power and utility of our understanding.
Schwartz is of the new school but not, he would insist, its militant wing.
He agrees that we are looking at a real world and that science is a 'special
kind of understanding' of that world; he is simply reluctant to accord it
supreme status.
He took an example from aesthetics. 'A hundred years ago we said art was
Beauty. We don't believe that any more. We don't believe beauty is so
simple. We see it is not eternal but historically formed: what is
aesthetically pleasing varies over time. The same is true for science and
truth. What is perceived to be true in one epoch may be completely
unsatisfactory in another.'
It follows, of course, that Schwartz's critique is itself under the
influence of his own history and culture.
His father, a furrier and trade union activist in the 1930s, came from
Bessarabia in the former Soviet Union. His mother's family had migrated from
a town near Chernobyl in the Ukraine. They moved to Los Angeles when the
elder boy was eight. He went to Berkeley in 1955 to read sociology and
physics at a time when America was actively recruiting scientists, impelled
by a talent for maths but also by his sense of being a misfit.
As well as being Jewish, 'foreign', left-wing and from the East Coast, he
was afflicted by being intellectually ahead of his contemporaries and
younger than his peers. 'While they were developing socially I was still a
little kid.'
The sociology proved to be a bore, but the physics was 'terrifically
exciting.' Berkeley then was the leading centre for particle physics and
Schwartz joined the group around Luis Alvarez, later a Nobel prizewinner.
'It was top of the world, just one of those rare experiences. Everybody, no
matter what their age, who was involved with Alvarez in that period would
call it the high point of their career.' He did a PhD in particle production
using high-energy pi mesons in a hydrogen bubble chamber.
Did you feel you were adding real knowledge, or was it a kind of game?
'No, it didn't have a game quality for me , nor for other people. It's quite
a good question, really because I think physics has become removed from that
sense of adding significantly to human knowledge; there is a real malaise in
the field, a certain kind of boredom and gimmickry.'
Schwartz was a leftwing student activist, not so much a hippy, he said, as
an amateur beatnik. Deciding he had had the best of physics, he was drawn to
Mississippi and the civil rights protests. It changed his life. Impressed by
the sophistication of the black militants and of their 'group
psychodynamics', he underwent psychoanalysis himself and landed a research
fellowship ('people felt physicists could do anything') in psychiatry at
Columbia, New York. Much later he trained as a counseller, met a British
psychotherapist and moved with her to London.
Are you still a left-winger?
'I would say so. Most people would say so.'
Is your critique a product of your early commitment to the Left?
'It sort of is and it sort of isn't'
Are you offering a Marxist-driven analysis?
'Well, you know I've been very seriously attacked by Marxists, so there's
tremendous disagreement among them about science as well. I mean, I would
flatly reject the traditional Marxist interpretation of science which is
gee-whizzery, basically. If you wanted to place me politically, I suppose
you could say it's New Left. We have to look at what actually has gone on:
we have to look at stories like the atomic bomb.'
Schwartz gently turned the tables. 'What would you say about journalism?
That reporters just go out and get the news and tell us the truth? Well, it
doesn't really work that way. Why would a journalist write a book about
journalism? What would be the motivation? A critical sensibility, an
anti-elitist sensibility, perhaps, an irritation with the bullshit? It's
kind of left-wing.'
He talked about genetic determinism, theories which he said had been
discredited but which refused to die. They were kept alive, a comforting
explanation for 'frightened, frightening lower-middle-class professional
people who cannot take on the serious problems that our society poses for
us. Of course you have to take the claims seriously but they've been wrong
for 100 years.'
Aren't your views influenced by your own experience, your backgound, a wish
to believe that such claims are wrong?
'In a way that's fair comment. But that's exactly where the debate has to
get started. What's been missing from the debate about nature versus nurture
is why we believe what we do believe. What makes genetic theory so
attractive to us?'
I asked Schwartz how he would de-mystify science and restore it to its place
in the common culture.
'When one is dealing with a deep structural problem good intentions don't go
very far - as we have seen ever since Snow enunciated the Two Cultures.
'We believe we ought to know more about science but somehow our interest
wears thin: and any subject deprived of a larger audience for a long time
tends to grow narrow. Our science at the moment is not in fact very
interesting: 'strings' and 'chaos' theory are hyped beyond measure in an
attempt to capture the excitement of the 19th century. But it won't wash.
'We need a far more critical, sardonic, humorous science reporting - much
more in fact like arts reporting. But will editors buy it?'
Better, he said, to forget about high science for a decade or so and go back
to talking and writing about technology instead.
'Because if we can get interested in our productive culture, and begin to
reclaim it, then our scientists will have more interesting things to work on
as well.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: Greenwich observed - The re-opening of the observatory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD NEWBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT A quarter of a million people a year visit the Old Royal Observatory
at Greenwich and stand upon a brass line in the pavement outside. The line
marks the Prime Meridian or Longitude Zero, and to straddle it is to have
one foot in the eastern hemisphere and one in the western.
If visitors have not given sufficient regard to the wider historical and
scientific importance of the Royal Observatory, it is partly due to the
outmoded displays and confusing information that has so far been available
to them. This has now been corrected, for the observatory re-opens next week
following the installation of new galleries and permanent exhibitions and
the redecoration of the 17th century apartments.
The observatory was founded by Charles II in 1675 to provide astronomical
data for the improvement of navigation. The main building is known as
Flamsteed House, after the first astronomer royal, John Flamsteed (1646 -
1719). The press release describes Flamsteed House as 'a masterpiece by
Christopher Wren', although in fact Wren was, to quote the architectural
historian John Summerson 'only in some degree responsible' for the design.
As far as the alterations of earlier times allow, Flamsteed's modest
personal apartments have been restored and furnished to give an impression
of his occupancy. However, the jewel of Flamsteed house is the Octagon Room,
above Flamsteed's apartments. Essentially a large belvedere with tall
windows on all sides to allow for the 360 degree tracking of the night sky,
this beautiful room has now been re-equipped with telescopes and
astronomical instruments of the period. An attempt has also been made to
restore the original decorative scheme.
Flamsteed House was added to in the 18th and 19th centuries and adjacent
buildings were built to contain the equipment required for positional
measurements of the stars. The Octagon Room, although a showpiece and a
statement of national pride, itwas never practical for accurate celestial
cartography and Flamsteed himself constructed a small building behind the
house for this purpose. Later astronomers made their own additions and since
the result does not form an architectural whole, licence has been taken to
thoroughly modernise the interior spaces of these later wings.
The introductory galleries address the history of astronomy in general terms
and the pioneering contribution of John Flamsteed in particular. Flamsteed's
work in mapping the stars using a new and accurate system of measurement
reveals him to be the founder of modern astronomy. His observations were of
great help to Newton, with whom he later fell out when Newton and Halley (of
comet fame) published some of his findings without his consent. Edmond
Halley (1656-1742) succeeded Flamsteed as the second astronomer royal in
1720.
However, even though these luminaries had made great progress in astronomy
and certain related areas, their observations had not helped to solve that
most obstinate and fundamental problem of navigation, namely how to
determine longitude at sea. This basic inability to fix a position was the
cause of so many disasters that Parliament established the Board of
Longitude in 1714 to consider any suggestions that might be forthcoming. It
also announced a Pounds 20,000 reward for anyone who could solve the
problem.
Enter John Harrison (1693-1776), the 300th anniversary of whose birth
coincides with the re-opening of the observatory. For centuries the
potential contribution of a marine chronometer had been recognised. Since
the earth rotates through 360 degrees every 24 hours, if the mariner were to
have a clock showing the exact time at a fixed meridian such as Greenwich,
he could, knowing local time (which could easily be established by observing
the position of the sun) translate the time difference between the two into
degrees of longitude.
Harrison, a Yorkshire carpenter, had produced a number of clocks with wooden
mechanisms. He visited Edmond Halley at the Greenwich observatory with a
proposal that he build a clock that would keep accurate time at sea,
notwithstanding the motion of the ship and temperature variations.
The story of Harrison's remarkable achievements from the successful
completion of his first marine chronometer in 1736 to the time he received
the full reward from the Board of Longitude reward in 1773 is a fascinating
chronicle of dedication, despair and eventual vindication. His chronometers
were the height of technology in their day, and it would be hard to better
his own description of his final and most successful design: 'I think I make
so bold as to say that there is neither any other mechanical or mathematical
thing in the world that is more beautiful or curious in texture than this my
watch or timekeeper for longitude.' Captain Cook took a copy of Harrison's
final chronometer on his second and third voyages where it helped him to map
the coasts of Australia and New Zealand with a precision that is still
admired today.
Harrison's four major chronometers are excellently displayed in the new
galleries, each accompanied by a video that uses computer graphics to
explain the principles and design of the mechanism. There is no sound track
which means that the tick of the marvellous machines may be heard. John
Redfern, an horologist turned producer of computer graphics, deserves the
highest praise for these tapes.
Video is also used to good effect in the chamber housing Sir George Airy's
telescope, where it is obviously impossible to activate the machinery
itself. Airy was astronomer royal between 1835 and 1881, and it is his
telescope that defines Longitude Zero for the world. What finally clinched
the argument in favour of Greenwich rather than, say, Paris, was that the
new American railways had also started using Greenwich for their time zones.
Another gallery is assigned to the London instrument makers of the 18th and
19th centuries who contributed to the scientific progress of the age with
astonishing ingenuity and technical skill. A fine selection of instruments
are on display with captions that make them intelligible to the layman.
The re-development brings to prominence the most important monument to the
scientific aspirations and achievements of the Enlightenment. And as an
expression of the scientific confidence of our own age, the brass strip
marking the Prime Meridian has been taken up and replaced with a line of
pulsating lights. Such is the march of progress.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: A conductor with a vision - The man behind the the
rising fortunes of the San Francisco Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON WEDNESDAY in the London Festival Hall and the following evening in the
Birmingham Symphony Hall, the San Francisco Symphony will be winding up its
latest European tour: ten concerts in eight cities in 14 days. Nothing
special in that: American orchestras regularly cross the Atlantic these days
 -not just the Famous Five (Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York,
Philadelphia) but several other bands (such as Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and
St Louis) risen to international prominence in recent decades, in equal part
because of their own improved standards and increased 'visibility' via
records.
There is now a widely shared perception that, of all those formerly
second-rank orchestras, San Francisco's has achieved the most remarkable
advances; and since this is most plausibly attributable to the seven-year
partnership forged with the conductor who is leading the European tour, the
American-born Swede Herbert Blomstedt, a special interest must attach to the
latest British encounters with the orchestra.
In the summer of 1990, when the Edinburgh Festival formed the sole British
stopping-point of another European tour, the San Francisco Symphony's two
concerts provided perhaps the purely musical high point of the whole
three-week programme. As I wrote at the time, 'Under Blomstedt the orchestra
has developed into a first-rate ensemble, (and) should be regarded as a
prize catch (for Edinburgh). The first concert was an occasion for broadly
authoritative music-making - not splashy or show-off (Blomstedt, a
restrained, rather sober figure on the podium, would hardly countenance
that) but honestly and powerfully guided by musical concerns'.
Since then, the orchestra's star has continued to rise internationally -
aided by its output of uniformly fine recordings, mainly but not exclusively
on Decca, of 19th-century and late-Romantic symphonies, choral and
orchestral showpieces, and new works by such important American figures as
Charles Wuorinen.
All are made in the Davies Hall, the orchestra's specially built (in 1980)
concert hall, whose acoustics, problematical at first, have recently been
improved by a Dollars 10m programme of overhaul. Serious programme-building,
which the range of San Francisco Symphony recordings reflects, has been a
hallmark of concerts during the Blomstedt years. A Nielsen and Sibelius
specialist, he has also concentrated on Bruckner, in spite of (as he says
himself) a tendency of American audiences to lose concentration during those
spacious long movements.
In addition, new American music has been assiduously promoted - not just
West Coast Minimalists like John Adams but such 'tough nuts' as Carter and
Sessions (whom he cracks himself). Yet Blomstedt has maintained not just the
San Francisco orchestra but San Francisco concert-goers in step with his
vision of what an orchestra should be and do.
Down the Pacific Coast, the youth and good looks of Esa-Pekka Salonen are
hugely magnified on a Sunset Boulevard billboard advertising the LA
Philharmonic. The San Francisco Music Director cuts an altogether different
and, on the face of it, less likely West Coast figure - a lean, Nordically
sharp-featured 65-year-old whose conversation resonates with dry wit and
quiet, cast-iron conviction (he is a devout Seventh Day Adventist).
It was, initially, something of a long-shot appointment. Blomstedt came to
San Francisco highly respected in the profession for his association with
(inter alia) the Danish Radio Symphony and, particularly, for the ten years
(1975-85) he spent with the Dresden Staatskapelle. (A mid-'70s Festival Hall
concert by the Dresden orchestra under Blomstedt, with Strauss first and a
naturally-flowing, magnificently solid Eroica afterwards, has stayed
intensely vivid in my memory.) But he exuded no PR-heightened 'glamour', and
brandished no recording contracts (those came after the partnership was
already launched).
Success came in the most rewarding way - in terms of steadily enriched
orchestral sound, profile and personality. The healthy artistic situation is
economically mirrored: at a time when many American cultural institutions,
and certainly the majority of orchestral ones, are struggling to balance
their books, the San Francisco Symphony has kept its consistently in the
black.
I visited the orchestra at its home base at the end of last year, catching
at the same time the premiere of the Oboe Concerto (coolly lyrical, catchily
percussive, more complex and interesting than first impressions suggest) by
John Harbison which - characteristically - Blomstedt is including in one of
his European tour programmes. (It will be heard in London, alongside the
Bruckner Fourth.) I found that pride in the achievement of the Blomstedt
years runs, unshowily but insistently, through every level of the
organisation. And yet, prior to the December concerts, the conductor had
just shocked everyone by announcing his intention to quit the music
director's post in 1995. The loss will be soothed by his occupation
thereafter of the Conductor Laureate title. But why the departure?
'It is time. I have had a very good period with the orchestra. The quality
of all the sections has improved. The orchestra is now full of fantastic
players. It needed building up, and we have worked on that together. In some
senses an American orchestra finds the great Classical symphonic repertory
harder than the modern music they play: they are very quick in learning the
notes, but there is perhaps a shorter interest span than we are used to in
Europe.'
He has felt cut off from Europe. Artistic connections from the past have had
to be loosened or even put aside for San Francisco. As the fine print of his
work so plainly testifies, Blomstedt is not a conductor for whistle-stop,
minimum-rehearsal guest engagements (he has never appeared with any of the
London orchestras, although probably not for want of invitations). He speaks
movingly of his years with the Dresden players, of the hardships they
endured in GDR times and the uncertainties that now beset them, and above
all of the orchestra's character - 'so warm, with its rich string sound, so
full and natural'.
Where will Blomstedt go after 1995? He is keeping that secret; but wherever
it may be, the appointment must surely promise the conditions in which this
first-rate musician and orchestral trainer can flourish - as he so obviously
has in San Francisco.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: Marvels in Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE PARISIAN lady at the Maastricht arts fair this week sniffed that in her
opinion the event was 'moins spectaculaire' than the Biennale antique show
in Paris. Madame was wrong: less theatrical it may be, but once you forget
the hideous warehouse they stage it in and examine the marvels on the
stands, the Maastricht European Fine Art Fair, which closes tomorrow after
10 days, has to be the most 'spectaculaire' accumulation of antique
excellence anywhere.
Maastricht attracted 160 art dealers this year compared with 147 in 1992 and
has been doing better business this year than last. Curators from the US and
Europe were on the prowl and mediaeval and Renaissance art specialist Edward
Lubin, from New York, was understandably upbeat after selling two south
German polychrome statues of captive Turks, made to commemorate the Battle
of Vienna in 1683, to the Zeughaus Museum in Berlin on the first night. In
the textile section Eskenazi, from Milan, sold an historic piece, a unique
early 13th century animal carpet from eastern Anotolia to a German buyer
within minutes of opening.
For the second year, Harry Winston, Cartier, Garrard and Buccellati are
manning a jewellery section to waylay the rich. Winston boasted the Garuda
brooch, set with the largest green diamond (8.19 carats) in the world for
just over Dollars 3m. There is a new antiquities section with ancient
Chinese art specialist, Gisele Croes, from Brussels, among others. Her stand
includes two miraculously-preserved terracotta Han ducks and seven extremely
rare Dian bronzes (475-109BC), which she rapidly sold. One of them was a
belt-buckle in the form of a buffalo attacked by a tiger and a leopard,
watched by a puzzled rabbit, all in marvellous detail.
Next door, HA Cahn, from Basle, is exhibiting an array of Greek and Roman
antiquities, including a rare 6th century BC Corinthian bronze helmet and a
ceremonial gold pomegranate from Lebanon, second millennium BC, wondrously
intact, for 75,000 Swiss francs.
There is an abundance of silver this year: Koopman and Son, from Chancery
Lane, wanted Pounds 1,250,000 for two George II three-light candelabra, a
marvel of foliage and nude bodies made by Charles Frederick Candler in 1738.
Philips - which on the first day alone did three-quarters of the business it
managed in 1992 - wanted slightly more for an enamelled gold and glass
tankard made in Zurich in 1608, signed by Hans Jacob Sprungli, from the
Kremlin treasury.
Maastricht began making up for its weakness in furniture this year. Adriano
Ribolzi, from Monte Carlo, boasts a secretaire by 18th century French Royal
cabinet- maker, Riesener, in rosewood, sycamore, burr elm, stained wood
veneer and marquetry. Partridge, over from London for the first time, have a
pair of console desserts with Sevres plaques, made for the dairy at
Fontainebleau in which Marie-Antoinette played (Pounds 750,000) and, from
Upton House, in Oxfordshire, a Louis XVI tulipwood bureau stamped J Stockel,
for Pounds 220,000.
Waddington Galleries made the trip from Cork Street and bucked up the dire
quality of the 20th century painting section, always a weak spot at
Maastricht, with a wide range of good contemporary works. Within 24 hours of
opening, it had sold some Pounds 250,000 worth including a Leger gouache of
1949, a Jean Arp bronze and two Henry Moore drawings.
Some great Old Masters shine through the acres of 17th century tulips,
oceans of Dutch seascapes and innumerable Flemish tavern scenes, which
dealers always bring to charm local buyers. Bob Haboldt, of Paris, has a
major 17th century Italian still life by Michelangelo di Campidoglio, while
Bruno Meissner, of Zurich, has four, vigorously-executed scenes from the
life of Moses, by Jacopo Palma. Bernheimer has a vibrant Canaletto view of
the Grand Canal priced at Pounds 2.6m and Emmanuel Moatti, from Paris,
showing both drawings and paintings, quickly sold a Rubens portrait of
Prince Francesco Gonzaga, of 1605, a fragment of an altarpiece.
'Trading at Masstricht is not just a sign the art market is moving. I think
it is a means to get it moving, too,' one dealer said.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: Welles on Welles - Screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS ORSON WELLES
by Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich
HarperCollins Pounds 20, 519 pages
DO WE laugh or cry at This Is Orson Welles? Probably both. This is the
conversational swansong of a master film-maker, but tears keep turning to
chuckles at Welles's sense of the ridiculous about cinema. For 500 pages he
holds forth on every subject, from The Magnificent Ambersons to amateur
magic, from radio drama to Rita Hayworth, from the tricks of filming snow
scenes (white cornflakes in Citizen Kane, refrigerated soundstage in
Ambersons) to the trials of spending too many years in the Hollywood sun. On
the way, he reveals more about the secret currents in his own cinema than an
armada of biographies have done, before and since his death in 1985.
'Last' is not quite the mot juste for this interview tome. It was edited by
Jonathan Rosenbaum from conversations Welles had with critic-filmmaker Peter
Bogdanovich in the late 1960s/early '70s. When both men became too busy to
tidy it for publication, the manuscript hung about, then got lost for five
years, then found again. But the book will surely be the 'last' published
work starring Welles's own voice.
As in Truffaut's Hitchcock opus, the movies are dissected and demythologised
by the man who should know. Lucky accidents and the inspirations of others
are confessed; auteur theories are taken to the cleaners. But it is not all
deprecation of his own genius. The more the book barrels along, with Welles
protesting the long interrogation sessions (Bogdanovich: 'How about
Fellini?', Welles: 'How about a little rest?'), the more a new and
self-revealing film-maker emerges.
It is easy to see why Welles earned the old image of a showman-dilettante:
too much success too young, too many vaunted projects left unfinished. The
world is still picking over the bones of Don Quixote and The Merchant of
Venice. And it would be picking over The Other Side of the Wind too, his
rumouredly brilliant dark comedy about film-making starring John Huston and
P. Bogdanovich, if only it could obtain the tied-up negatives and see the
material.
But Welles rejects the role others have cast him in: that of an eternal
dabbler, a playboy of Western cinema. The reasons for unfinished films are
painfully explained. And Welles's own taste, far from favouring the
gimmicky, prefers the elegiac Ambersons to the tricksy Kane, the rueful
Chimes At Midnight to the bizarre The Lady From Shanghai. He also claims
cogency for some movies that do seem like empty pyrotechnic displays. He
defends The Trial - often viewed as an example of Euro-Expressionism gone
bananas - as his most personal film: a bleak human comedy rather than a
piece of high-camp Kafka-Gothic.
If we believe Welles - and the man who radio-hoaxed a nation with The War Of
The Worlds requires pinches of salt - he was a gifted dreamer woken too soon
by the realities of a philistine business. There are two horribly sad
passages in the book. In one Welles gnaws his heart over the multi-picture
deal he thought would follow Touch Of Evil in the late 1950s, but which
Universal dropped on seeing the finished film. 'It was just too dark and
black and strange for them'.
In the other, Bogdanovich recounts a late-night TV screening of the
studio-butchered Ambersons that he and friends watched with Welles present.
Or almost present. The film's creator hung back, made some barbed comments,
vanished into another room, came back, then spent the remaining film looking
out through the darkened window. His eyes were moist when he turned round at
movie's end, says Bogdanovich.
We can wonder about how much Welles, the master artificer, confected even
these theoretically intimate moments. What we cannot wonder about is the
evidence of Welles's greatness before us on screen. It was not just
technical bravura and a flair for alchemising image into metaphor. It was
the sense of human existence as a single, ironic sweep: giving us the
time-lapse segues of Kane, the compacted social history of Ambersons, even
Harry Lime's Welles-scripted speech in The Third Man, aphoristically
colliding Renaissance Italy with cuckoo-clock Switzerland. 'It's not that
the world's so small,' Welles muses at one point to Bogdanovich, 'it's that
history is so short. Four or five very old men could join hands and take you
right back to Shakespeare.'
But summing up human history or another human life in a wry snapshot is
easier than doing the same with one's own life. What makes us laugh in this
book is Welles's exposure of the little local impostures that add up to the
ephemeral lunacy of 'success'. Like his story of Churchill standing up by
pre-arrangement in a Venice hotel whenever Welles passed by. Object, to
impress potential backers.
But what tugs the heart is the regret of a great artist for all the great
art he never made: for a life that gradually turned to unfulfilment and
hollow fame. Citizen Welles, by making Citizen Kane, became his own
self-fulfilling prophet. Bogdanovich even reminds us, in a postscript to the
book, that Welles chose to have his ashes scattered 6000 miles from
Hollywood on a Spanish farm where he had once been happy as an 18-year-old
boy.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: More poetic observations - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILFRED Owen is one of my private heroes, but I was surprised at the
comprehensive marking of his centenary. On Sunday, Radio 2 gave a fine
two-hour biographical feature presented by Dominic Hibberd. It covered his
youth - a home with evangelistic leanings, a harmless affair with a
choirboy, a nervous breakdown, a job teaching English in France - in 1915
yet, oddly careless of the war. He was sorry for the French troops, but the
British were 'only Tommy Atkins', mere soldiers. Yet he enlisted in the
Artists Rifles, commissioned, and won an MC on the Somme. Shell-shocked, he
was sent to recover in Scotland.
From here on he was more intimately observed in Radio 4's Monday play, Not
about Heroes by Stephen MacDonald, virtually a duologue between Owen and
Siegfried Sassoon, another shell-shock victim (James Telfer and the author).
Sassoon coached him into trying something more concerned with reality and
his best work came when he went back to the front, where he was killed in
action a week before the Armistice. Some of it, together with his letters,
will be read by Kenneth Branagh on Radio 3 in the coming week.
Detectives are commoner on the BBC than poets, and two more turn up this
week. On Wednesday Radio 4 gave the first of four parts of PD James's Cover
Her Face. Detective Adam Dalgliesh did not appear in this part, but the
Radio Times told us that Robin Ellis, who is to play him, was jolly good in
Poldark. I have heard the whole story (dramatised by Neville Teller) on a
BBC Radio Collection cassette, available from April 5, and he is good, among
a splendid cast. His problem begins with a cheeky servant-girl found dead in
a locked room.
Thursday's new investigator, in The Blackburn Files on Radio 4, is firmly
working-class, a retired Yorkshire pitman. He only investigates who is
stealing flowers from an allotment, but Stephen J. Blackburn (Finetime
Fontayne) and his assistant Tracey (Judy Flynn) keep it fun. For addicts of
detection, the week also gave Detective-Superintendant Thorne on Monday,
solving another problem set him by John Penn; Sherlock Holmes on Wednesday
in The Solitary Cyclist; and on Friday Dr Keith Simpson, the detecting
pathologist, with a strangled hitch-hiker.
More serious was Radio 3's Sunday play, The Lovesong of Alfred J. Hitchcock,
by David Rudkin. We are in an imaginary film studio, where a human Camera
(Michael Fitzgerald) gives the studio instructions. Hitchcock, played with
great realism and sensitivity by Richard Griffiths, wants to reproduce the
love-scene he visualised as a boy, but he despises his own fat body and
associates women with death. Rudkin repeats similar attempts time and again
 -the dream is followed by a thoughtful Hitchcock at work with script-writer
and Camera. The play lasted 130 minutes, whichI thought too long. Philip
Martin directed.
Groucho Was My Father (Radio 4, Wednesdays) presents Miriam Marx Allen,
Groucho Marx's elder daughter by his first wife. Groucho's letters to her,
read by Frank Ferrante in a convincing imitation of his voice, are witty but
ordinary. It is fun to hear talk of 'Uncle Harpo' and 'Uncle Zeppo',
especially of 'Uncle Chico', who besought Groucho to make another film with
him to make him enough money to pay the gangsters threatening his life.
There are two more programmes, presented by Tony Staveacre.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: Brave cultural mixture - Deanna Petherbridge admires
the controversial 'In Fusion' exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEANNA PETHERBRIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARRANGED on a crude metal factory stand are grimey crates stencilled
'Product of Chochreh Feyzdjou'; alongside is a gigantic rack supporting
rolls of stiff fabrics, and scrolls of unintelligible broadsheets are
arranged on a wall. The installation suggests a workshop, perhaps a print
workshop. But on looking more carefully, you become aware that the blackened
objects so carefully arranged in boxes are in fact hair, feathers and other
substances blackened with grease, not the tools of a mysterious trade.
Chochreh Feyzdjou, like the other artists in the brave and important
exhibition In Fusion at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, is a New European
with a tale to tell that embraces both native and adoptive cultures. Born in
Teheran but educated in Paris, Feyzdjou evokes the history of the
in-between; not a personal history, but a mock-industrial history of
impossible processes and never-to-be invented artefacts that could be placed
in Iran, in Europe, in this century or that. The objects so carefully
arranged in the boxes to simulate usage are the fetishised products of
displacement. She applies the language of systems to things of the
imagination.
Systems of order are also the subject matter of Carlo Capelan. Stiff pieces
of European furniture are formally placed within a mud-walled room. Display
cases, a machine-made Turkey carpet, couches and desks are the pompous
intruders in this 'ethnic' space, where piles of textbooks around the
periphery of the room are held down with stones. On the mud walls are
quotations from post-colonial theory and ethnology: James Clifford, Jonathan
Friedman, Luis Cannitzer, Gerardo Masquera. Within the old-fashioned
cabinets are museological displays: nail parings, wax spills, twigs,
wax-stoppered bottles containing the ashes of burned books. Some of the
texts on the wall have been blanked out. At the entrance is a pathetic
little mosaic image: 'Mi casa es tu casa' - your house is mine.
The messages in this installation are obvious, yet by some sleight of hand
the piece is neither gruesomely rhetorical nor aridly illustrative. The low
light renders the room and its intrusive furniture as a sort of anti-shrine,
which is evocative and moving. Capelan, born in Montevideo and a political
refugee from Chile, has found asylum in Sweden. His work, like Feyzdjou's,
is influenced by Joseph Beuys, the ultimate shaman, whose sojourn as a
refugee dead) in his native country, Germany, was theatrical and
manipulative. Here, Beuys' sham language takes on the ring of truth.
Installation and video are the global media of the 1980s and 1990s, and the
artists in the In Fusion exhibition are right up front. They prove the often
repeated statement of social analysts such as Stuart Hall that the periphery
is now in the centre, and the cultural implosion has been a creative one.
There is often something desperately bogus about Old Europeans trying to
come to terms with the problems of the periphery, but these artists - and
they do not all deal with political or social issues - are streetwise and
thoughtful. They have been there, they care, and they are using the language
to hand to express themselves.
Benni Efrat's videotape 'Ararat Express Summer 2043' is almost unbearable to
watch, as it dins its way in repeated images on a bank of video screens. The
tape narrates a journey through France; video screens have been strapped to
side-saddles of a troupe of pack-ponies, and the actual journey with its
solemn procession of ponies, grooms and bewildered spectators is intercut
with the images on the pack-screens: mass exodus and its related sufferings.
As the ponies are unharnessed for the night and the videos are laid out in
rows in fields, the other narratives are overlaid; feeding the starving in
Zambia, Botswana, El Salvador, the perilous journeys of Vietnamese boat
people and their arrival into despair. We have domesticated such scenes of
suffering in our scrolls through television, but here the repeated image of
a Vietnamese mother with the emaciated corpse of her child - dead on arrival
 -is harrowing. It is a piece about global responsibility using the
technology of global communication.
The exhibition is jointly organised with the South Bank Centre, and
therefore is part of a generous sponsorship programme by BT. It is a
depressing comment on Birmingham's Tories, that Councillor Alan Blumenthal
and Bernard Zissman, leader of the Conservative group, should have joined in
the row in the Birmingham press about BT sponsoring such 'rubbish'.
Other works on the exhibition are jollier, particularly As M'Bengue's larged
impasto paintings, bursting with musical rhythms and witty fusion of images
from his native Senegal with mock scientific diagrams, texts from 'official
journals' and occasional bits of classical sculpture.
Ying Liang, born in Peking and now living in Hamburg takes the traditional
language of Chinese brush painting on paper, and relieves it of its
preciousness by inserting rude graffiti into a flower painting or drawing
deliberately crude brush notations of women's suits on crushed Jap paper.
Ohannes Tapyuli, an Armenian artist living in Germany, points a light finger
at consumerism in his enormous framed shirts in a wall installation entitled
'We are Rich.'
Gavin Jantjes, a South African artist who lived in Germany before coming to
Britain, has written the major catalogue essay. He notes that by the year
2000 an estimated 50m people with extra-European cultural roots will be
living in Europe, and he questions the 'Kulturwurst' definition of culture -
ethnic Europeaness stuffed into a geographical package. The future identity
of Europe 'should be accompanied by a willingness to investigate complex
matters of diversity and difference.' Maastricht signals more than an
assembly of traditional nation-states; it is also the home of the New
European.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: The voice of Wilfred Owen - Poetry in Performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK, the Shropshire market town of Oswestry celebrated the centenary
of the birth of its most famous son, Wilfred Owen, poet of the pity of the
Great War, with an evening of readings at the Marches School.
It was an great gathering of poets, biographers and other ancillary
services: Jon Stallworthy, editor of the poems and author of the official
biography; Dominic Hibberd, editor and biographer of Owen's last year;
Susannah York, actress; Patricia Beer, Devonian poet; and, last but scarcely
least, Ted Hughes. The evening was compered by the Bishop of Shrewsbury.
Stallworthy, square-jawed and looking raffish in a tan leather jacket, led
off with biographical glimpses of Owen as a boy and youth - his frustrated
wish to attend university; his loss of the Christian faith. Unfortunately,
Stallworthy has too much of the silver-tongued academic impresario about him
 -the voice sings the poems, reminding us too much of the beauties of Poesy
and too little of the horrors of the war that the language describes.
Susannah York gave us a quartet of Owen favourites, including 'Anthem for
Doomed Youth' and 'Dulce et Decorum Est'. Fiercely, fierily dramaturgical,
it was a performance of grave, rigid eloquence, a demonstration of
professional skills that had been honed to perfection in some drama school.
The biographer, Dominic Hibberd, reminded us of the stultifying closeness of
the relationship between Owen and his mother, which included a shared habit
of using illness as a solution to all difficulties. It seems that on almost
every one of his last five birthdays Owen was ill with some hypochondriacal
reflex or other - until 1918, the last year of his life, and the one in
which he produced his miraculous war poetry. By this time, he had learnt to
face down his own devils.
Up to this point, the evening had consisted not so much of a calling up of
the spirit of Owen as a laudable flourish of Oswestry civic pride in having
owned, by the mere fact of his having been born and lived briefly there,
such a marvellous writer. The last two readers, Patricia Beer and Ted
Hughes, did much to correct that imbalance in the second half.
Where other readers had been grandiloquent, Beer - who argued in her little
talk that Owen, though not a direct influence upon later poets, had been a
great innovator himself in the technical aspects of his poetry by the use of
half-rhyme, for example - was plain, and convinced by that very plainness.
She also told us certain truths that earlier contributions had seemed to
obscure somewhat - for example, that Owen, unlike earlier poets of that war,
had written what people did not want to hear, and that that fact alone may
have led him to break free of traditional metres. Her own reading of
'Exposure', halting, imperfect, almost prosey, captured perfectly the
atmosphere of that poem - especially the way she read its refrain, 'we turn
back to our dying', so chillingly flatly.
Hughes had sat for the whole evening, great head slumped on his chest, as if
lost in some inner maze, and when he rose to speak he clearly felt that
there was little to be said, other than to let the poems speak for
themselves. What he did say, having been introduced by the Bishop as
'someone else from Dorset', was: 'I'll just read some poems. They're all
about dead men'.
He gave us just a handful, concluding with 'After Strange Meeting', but each
reading was definitive and each poem spoken as if it had been lived from the
inside. Only metaphor does justice to Hughes's voice: its subterranean
energies; its baleful brutishness, which matches the brutality of Owen's own
language because Owen was a poet who, in those last 12 months of his life,
and still only 25 years old, transformed himself from some pale, fluttering,
Keatsian thing into a poet who had somehow been empowered by suffering to
treat directly of the most horrible and sordid things that one man could
ever do to another. Hughes captured all this. 'This is a horrible one,' he
said of the fragment which begins 'My soul looks down from a vague height
with death', and all its numbing horror came spewing out. It was a
concluding moment of brilliant and unsurpassed discomfort.

DOROTHY L. SAYERS: HER LIFE AND SOUL
by Barbara Reynolds
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25, 398 pages
THIS IS the centenary year of Dorothy Sayers' birth. To mark the occasion,
eight of her Lord Peter Wimsey novels are being reissued in paperback
simultaneously with publication of this new biography by the head of the
Dorothy L. Sayers Society.
Sayers was born in Oxford but raised primarily in a remote vicarage in the
fenland of East Anglia. She enjoyed what she insisted on calling an
Edwardian childhood, solitary but happy, within an indulgent, civilised
family. Everyone - from her parents, cousins and aunts to her governess and
the gardener - was mobilised as dramatic foils for her starring roles.
Sayers went up to Somerville in 1912; Oxford was later to serve as fodder
for one of her most accomplished stories, Gaudy Night, where Harriet Vane
returns for a visit to her old college.
Except for the odd belltower captain who honours the accuracy of her Kent
Treble Bob Majors in The Nine Tailors, Oxford itself remains ambivalent
toward Sayers. Her wickedly observed (and reportedly all too accurate)
portraits of contemporary Somerville personalities in Gaudy Night are echoed
in her descriptions of 'Spooner looking as mad as usual' and 'Dr Dixey
looking like a walrus' at Encaenia in 1913. But one may forgive Sayers a
great deal for the words she borrowed from the degree ceremony to create
that most elegant of all fictional marriage proposals: 'Placetne, magistra?'
After graduating and a spell at teaching and reading manuscripts at
Blackwell's, Sayers moved to London where she encountered a series of
unsatisfactory men. One of them, John Cournos, was a Russian journalist and
writer on the fringe of London's literary scene. Cournos ultimately failed
to return Sayers' passionate love, and from her later chiding remarks it
seems just as well: 'You were a rotten companion for a poor girl. You
wouldn't go to the theatre and you wouldn't talk nonsense.'
Although Cournos had wished them to become lovers and use contraceptives,
Sayers insisted that no 'taint of the rubber-shop' should interfere with the
creation of their child. Then, with consummate irony, she became pregnant
while on the rebound. While it has been known that Sayers bore a son out of
wedlock, the identification of the father was never made clear, apparently
in deference to the wishes of their child, John Anthony. With his death in
1984, it must have been decided that all could now be revealed. In something
of an anti-climax, the father turns out to have been one Bill White, a
motorcycling man of action whom Sayers did not love, and who fled 'in rage
and misery' upon learning she was pregnant.
In addition to the centenary, this revelation appears to have been the
catalyst for this latest biography - which, alas, it does not justify. The
book often seems more absent-minded pastiche than biography, as if intended
to be read with previous writings about Sayers in mind. It is often
necessary to refer back to James Brabazon's 1981 biography to find out what
is actually going on, and indeed the author herself often relies on Brabazon
for interpretations (and quotations). Reynolds, an Italian scholar, may be
more at home with a text than a person. Her lack of empathy often causes her
to cling obstinately to the sunny persona of Sayers' letters when a more
complex analysis is required, and even when contradicted by Sayers herself.
Worse still, and unforgivably for a Sayers biographer, Reynolds' lack of any
sense of dramatic occasion allows major events in Sayers' life to occur
off-stage; among other omissions, readers are deprived of witnessing her
growing success as a novelist, the deterioration of her marriage, and
finally even her obituary tributes.
When Reynolds comes to the period to which she was an eye-witness, she
becomes incomprehensibly coy. For the last 14 years of Sayers' life,
Reynolds collaborated with her on translating Dante's Divine Comedy, yet she
polishes off their time together in just 12 pages, referring readers to an
earlier work for a full account.
I long ago decided that people could be divided into Peters and Harriets:
the one mercurial, elusive, and fey; the other straight-browed, steadfast,
literal. Reynolds claims that Harriet is 'in many ways a projection of the
author'. A similar case can be made for Peter, as Sayers confesses: 'When I
was dissatisfied with my single unfurnished room I took a luxurious flat for
him in Piccadilly. When my cheap rug got a hole in it, I ordered him an
Aubusson carpet.' Sayers managed to be both quixotic and sound - the whole
somehow much more than the sum of her reported parts. Despite the manifest
sincerity of this latest tribute, Sayers is still seeking her biographer.

A SUITABLE BOY
by Vikram Seth
Phoenix House Pounds 20, 1,349 pages
BOOK-reviewers tend to be paid at a rate appropriate to the length of their
reviews rather than that of the book they are reviewing. A few more novels
like this one and we shall need some clause compensating us in the case of
books that make demands 'deemed to be beyond the normal course of duty'.
Never can a variant of that old Hollywood formula 'Boy meets girl. Boy gets
girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl' have been stretched to such inordinate
lengths. Here the storyline is: boy (charmer, fellow-student, Moslem) meets
girl (beautiful, English literature student, Hindu); gets girl in spite of
maternal opposition; loses girl; nearly regains girl but loses girl finally
to Suitable Boy (solid, reliable, all set for successful career in the
shoe-manufacturing business, Hindu, right caste, but lacking charm or
glamour).
Seth is the latest instance of an Indian writer, steeped in his own
indigenous tradition, who has been through the mill of a British and
American education, (Doon in India, then Tonbridge, Oxford, Stanford and
Nanjing University, China). Such a writer tends at the outset to look to
English and other European literatures for models and to say to himself:
'Anything you can do, I can do . . . if not better then at least longer.'
Salman Rushdie, you may recall, took for his model Sterne's Tristram Shandy
with far-reaching results.
The early model for Seth was The Tales of Pushkin. They provided the
inspiration for The Golden Gate - a novel he wrote in verse about the
inhabitants of California's silicon valley. It was published here in 1986 by
Faber. Seth's witty stanzas wove a neatly plotted tale of a broken marriage,
a homosexual affair and a ferociously possessive cat. The notion of writing
such a story in a rigid metrical form must have seemed to be the greatest
commercial folly. Only a publisher with its own Cats to fall back upon would
have been prepared to under-write it. But Seth put himself on the literary
map with this tour de force and it has by now sold a cool 150,000 copies.
The immediate models for A Suitable Boy are 19th century novels like Madame
Bovary and Anna Karenina. Although everything is rooted in the growth of a
love-affair, with the heroine occupying the centre of the stage, her
forbidden passion is viewed in the context of the moral, cultural and
political attitudes of a whole society. The city where she lives is the
centre from which the reader beholds a social structure whose boundaries are
those of the aristocracy at the top, the bourgeoisie in the middle and the
peasantry at the bottom.
Seth's heroine, Lata, comes from a well-to-do Hindu family many of whose
members hold important positions in newly independent India. She is a
student at the university of Brahmpur - an imaginary place somewhat
reminiscent of Patna and Brinkipore. It is few hours railway journey to
Calcutta. The contrast between the life-style of the smart 'permissive'
Bengali society of her brother's wife's family with whom she stays and the
restricted provincial life of her home near the campus where she meets the
handsome unsuitable boy she falls in love with, is done with a precision of
detail that would earn Seth full marks from his French and Russian masters.
It is one of many such contrasts of ambience in the depiction of the four
families whose members are singled out for close scrutiny. They are
surrounded by this novel's hundred or more subsidiary characters, mainly
Indian but also one or two British who have stayed on .
Tolstoy contrasted adulterous Anna with virtuous Kitty, and arrogant Vronsky
with likeable Levin. Seth has several alternative heroines to Lata up his
sleeve and he produces them one after the other as he develops the narrative
along pairs of parallel lines. There is the music-loving courtesan whose
scented drawing-room is so sensuously described; there is Sava, Lata's
sister, a young, happily married woman about to give birth to her first
child; there is cynical, delectable Meenakshi, her sister-in-law,
nonchalantly deceiving her husband, a member of the Shady Ladies' Club;
there is the Moslem wife of the idealistic Urdu teacher whom we hardly see
since her creed prevents it, but whose fate is nonetheless every bit as
poignant as Lata's.
A similar multiplication of themes occurs. Apart from its fictional virtues,
the book may be read as a gloss on the violence in India today; much of it
stems from the period the novel illuminates, the early 1950s when the
problems inherited by the first all-Indian governments from the British were
at their most acute. Then in the same depth there is the world of the
campus, with its own ruthless political manoeuvering and an eccentrically
distrait mathematical genius (lover-boy's papa) thrown in for good measure.
But away from academe and government, Seth seems just as at home in the
world of agriculture and sweated farm labour, the abuses practised by the
zemindars (revenue collectors) on behalf of the great landlords. Yet another
dimension comes in the descriptions of religious fundamentalism in action,
the ceremonies lasting several days and drawing vast, unruly crowds on the
banks of the Ganges. And depicted in most detail of all is the world of
shoe-manufacturing (Seth's father's occupation), with its domination at the
top by emigre foreigners. It is used brilliantly as a metaphor for India's
industrial problems as well as the Suitable Boy's. The SB also has a Hindu
rival - a young poet, beginning to make a big name for himself, clearly a
portrait of the author, but he drops out of the hunt (for no very
satisfactory reason that I could see).
But I could easily fill the whole of this page merely describing the
amazingly rich content of the novel. Yet it remains so readable because the
prose is always direct and incisive. Does it all hold together? Yes, it
does, amazingly enough - rather like a Taj Mahal made out of Lego. Some
parts are detachable. One section has already been published as a
self-contained long short story. The controlled energy of the writing
carries one over the melodramatic cliches of plotting to which Seth resorts
to sustain his narrative. All in all, it is an outstanding achievement for
which he deserves the warmest congratulation.

DAPHNE DU MAURIER
by Margaret Forster
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 17.99, 455 pages
LETTERS FROM MENABILLY
by Oriel Malet
Orion Pounds 18.99, 303 pages
DAPHNE du Maurier, who always valued her privacy, was virtually a recluse
towards the end of her life. Instead of an autobiography, she wrote an
account of her youth, ending with her marriage in 1932, which concentrated
on her development as a writer. Margaret Forster's biography can be said to
concentrate on the emotional crises behind that development: her
relationship with her father, the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du
Maurier; her passionate friendship with a teacher at her Parisian finishing
school; her pre-marital affair with Carol Reed; the highs and lows of her
long marriage; the births of her three children; her 'crush' on Ellen
Doubleday, the wife of her American publisher; and a brief fling with
Gertrude Lawrence.
In a working life spanning over 50 years, Daphne du Maurier published some
25 volumes of novels and stories and 10 works of non-fiction and biography.
Her sales were quite phenomenal: even with wartime paper rationing, she
commanded print runs of 50,000 and 100,000. Film versions of her early
novels and later of her stories, The Birds and Don't Look Now, brought her
name to a wider audience and boosted an already-considerable income.
To the young Daphne du Maurier, the idea of deliberately writing for a
particular 'market' would have been anathema. When writing Jamaica Inn,
Rebecca, Frenchman's Creek and My Cousin Rachel, she was driven by the same
'hidden prompter' (vide Saul Bellow) as weightier and more ambitious
novelists. She was a natural, one of those who turn into a neurotic wreck if
not writing and whose lives are therefore dominated by the need to fulfil
this urge.
Given her highly-respectable old age (she was made a Dame of the British
Empire in 1969), it is easy to forget that as a young woman Daphne du
Maurier had a raffish reputation. Her father may have been a knight but he
was still 'a theatrical' and therefore not quite top-drawer. She herself
recounts (but Forster does not) how she shocked the people of Fowey in the
late 1920s by walking around the town not only hatless but in shorts. Her
first lover, the young film director Carol Reed, the illegitimate son of
Herbert Beerbohm Tree, would have made a good match. Instead, she married a
handsome martinet who had already fought in the First World War and ended
the Second as Major-General Sir Frederick Browning.
There have long been rumours about the unhappiness of this marriage, citing
Browning's philandering and later his drinking. The biography reveals that
sexual relations (known as 'Cairo' in du Maurier code as opposed to lesbian
ones, which were 'Venice') were never resumed after the war - more from
inertia and shyness than anything else. Sir Frederick's work as Royal
Equerry kept him in London all week and his demeanour at Menabilly on
weekends earned him the nickname Moper. Because of her writing - now their
main source of income - and her love of the seclusion offered by her Cornish
home, Lady Browning could seldom be tempted to London, so it is not
surprising that things fell apart. But, with typical loyalty, she forgave
him his peccadilloes and nursed him to the end.
Menabilly was the biggest folly in her life, a dark and dilapidated house
which she acquired in 1943 on a two-year lease and into which she poured
money - Pounds 30,000 on the roof alone - as if she owned it. She refers to
it as 'my rat-ridden ruin', and the myth of a Rebecca-like life of elegant
luxury is shattered. She was oblivious to domestic chaos, never bothered
with central heating, and when she finally moved to the dower house at
Kilmarth in 1969 she was amazed by its warm, sunny rooms.
Ms Forster's revelation that Daphne enjoyed 'Venice' with Gertrude Lawrence
 -if only during one care-free weekend in Florida - and fell in love with
Ellen Doubleday, will not surprise those who have always thought of her as
first and foremost a writer with a cavalier attitude to domestic duties and
motherhood.
A far livelier, if less comprehensive, portrait of the writer can be found
in Letters from Menabilly, written to her friend, the novelist Oriel Malet,
who adds her own commentary (to be published in May). They are full of
irritating Du Maurier slang and half-baked philosophy but there is nothing
in the 'official' biography to match these vivid and sometimes irreverent
pictures of her curious existence at Menabilly and Kilmarth. 'Do tell me,'
she asked Oriel Malet wistfully in her dotage, 'did I write Gone With The
Wind, or was it someone else?'
Margaret Forster is reluctant to take Daphne du Maurier seriously as a
writer; if she has any opinions about the quality of the work, she keeps
them to herself. I suspect that she is not a fan. She is certainly wary of
making judgments and seems to consider that the fiction is adequately dealt
with by old-fashioned psychological readings. Knowing that Rebecca was
sparked off by Daphne's jealousy of her husband's previous fiancee does not
help us to understand the novel's extraordinary and enduring appeal.
Not only has Margaret Forster produced a strangely muted portrait of a
particularly colourful character, she makes no suggestions as to how and why
the best of these books became and remain so popular. Daphne du Maurier's
diction is alternately clumsy and wooden; she has no ear for dialogue, an
erratic sense of history and a weakness for stereotypes. Yet, in her best
work, the superb story-telling, her dramatic use of nature, her strong sense
of place and her ability to evoke evil, put her in a Romantic tradition that
goes back to the Brontes. It is surely the business of a major biography to
address these contradictions and place the work of its subject in an
appropriate cultural context.

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X
as told to Alex Haley

Vintage Pounds 7.99, 314 pages
MALCOLM X: THE GREAT PHOTOGRAPHS
text by Thulani Davies
Stewart, Tabori and Chang Pounds 14.99, 167 pages
MALCOLM X, eternally a black hero, was the part-white child of an unhappy
family whose inherent brutality denied him both security and self-respect.
He became a teenage hustler, a scared kid, a swaggering thief who struggled
to conquer his many fears. Imprisoned at the age of 20, he slowly improved
himself. Motivated by an extraordinary effort of will, he became an
autodidact, an ascetic, a campus debater and a popular philosopher.
Released six-and-a-half years later, he devoted his considerable energy to
the Nation of Islam, a black religious movement many of whose tenets were
unrecognisable to true Islamic scholars. It was headed by the Reverend
Elijah Muhammad, who quickly recognised the talents of his new recruit and
made him his national representative. Malcolm soared above his origins to
become one of the important political figures of his time. He proved to be
the most effective minister the Rev Muhammad had ever recruited; even
Cassius Clay, who came in much later as Muhammad Ali, could never replace
Malcolm.
The story ends as the final act in a familiar American tragedy. Rev
Muhammad, like other founders of idiosyncratic American churches, turned out
to be a disappointment: the philandering head of a wealthy clan whose income
was the flow of cash from his followers. He fiercely defended his lucrative
crown against what he perceived to be the threat of usurpation by Malcolm X.
Yet it was Malcolm who achieved immortality by dying a martyr, assassinated
in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965. He was not yet 40.
Bruce Perry's scholarly book seeks to demythologise Malcolm's autobiography.
Its fascination lies in its analysis of the hero's early life, first as
Malcolm Little, then as convict. It exposes his internal contradictions. To
some of the observers quoted in its pages Malcolm X was so fair-skinned as
to be almost mistaken for white, a proposition both supported and belied by
photographs in Malcolm X: The Great Photographs. He made headlines by
preaching for Rev Muhammad against 'white devils', yet eventually abandoned
his racism and acknowledged that not all whites were evil. His autobiography
depicts him as a family man; Perry piles on the evidence that suggests he
was cold, often cruel, to women.
It is not surprising that some of his posthumous admirers manipulate his
memory in the interests of politically correct propaganda. I have not seen
Spike Lee's film, but his book reproduces the screenplay by James Baldwin
and others. This appears to ignore Perry's findings, perhaps in the
interests of further mythologising the myth.
It needs no such assistance. It is right to acknowledge his greatness, but
not to deny the complexities and inner tensions that arise from his tortured
character. His achievements are a matter of record, but so is his career as
a political chameleon. During most of his publicly-witnessed lifetime
Malcolm was known as a black nationalist, a preacher for black separatism,
and an anti-white, sometimes anti-Semitic, rabble-rouser. In his later
years, when he had abandoned much of this, he joked that his contribution to
the civil rights movement was that he frightened the white establishment
into accepting the integrationist demands of the Rev Martin Luther King Jr.
Perry knows that history will be more appreciative than that. Malcolm X
'mobilized black America's dormant rage and put it to work politically', he
writes. 'He made African-Americans feel proud of their color. In his effort
to fashion a remedy for his self-hatred, he fashioned one for them.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel: A little country's clockwork charm - How Switzerland
broke Nicholas Woodsworth's resistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEATHROW: 10am on a drizzly autumn day. I am not a nervous flyer, but as I
strap myself into my seat on Swissair Flight 831 I feel a growing
apprehension. What bothers me is not the flight but what lies at the end of
it - Switzerland.
For me the allure of travel is the allure of the untowards. I like hopping
on planes because it is the easiest way I have found of trading the known
and repetitious for the surprises of the one-off. I enjoy travel because it
never turns out the way I think it will.
Hence my hesitation about Switzerland. For all I have heard of it, this is
the land where the untowards never happens. Nor anything that is unorthodox,
extreme, risky or likely to inflame the passions. The essence of Swissness,
it is sometimes hinted, is blandness.
Who, after all, I ask myself, invented muesli? The Swiss. Who invented
orthopaedic shoes, Calvinism, fondue parties? Who plays the dreadful
alphorns? Who are so precise, punctual and reliable that they have become
the world's timekeepers? Who are so meticulously diligent that they are the
world's bankers? Switzerland, I fear, might turn out to be a very dull
place.
*****
EARLY evening: the summit of Mont Vully. I have climbed my first Swiss
mountain. Granted, it is smooth and grassy and only 653 meters high. But it
has given me the elevation I need to see things clearly.
I have changed my mind, turned 180 degrees. Switzerland, against all
expectations, is a wholly untowards kind of place. The stories are true -
this is a country of benign orderliness, efficiency, punctuality, conformity
and hygiene. But it is precisely this stolid respectability that makes
Switzerland so remarkable.
Perched flat on my stomach over a serene landscape, I reflect on the world
in its present limping state. In a world where everywhere the nasty and
unexpected are now the norm, a land of no surprises is surprising indeed. In
its very predicability, Switzerland has become an exotic and intriguing
place.
Tiny Switzerland's distinctive morals, manners and institutions are not
without reason. It is artificially composed of disparate groups sharing no
common language, religion or ethnic background. Its 800-year history is a
litany of uncertainty, of bullying and invasion by large and aggressive
neighbours. It possesses no natural resources and depends for its livelihood
on markets over which it has no control. What has shaped it is an
over-riding need for well-being and security.
Nowhere is Switzerland's profound conservatism more striking than in the
country's landscapes. Meticulously arranged and managed even in the wildest
of areas, the land is the object of an aesthetic sense of order reflecting
the nation's anxieties - the making of a safe, sure world. In transforming
the threatening into the reassuring, the Swiss have created an astonishing
beauty. For the visitor, Switzerland is, above all, a visual adventure.
Little Mont Vully has nothing to do with the Switzerland of rearing peaks
and gingerbread chalets and high alpine pastures. It sits between Lake
Neuchatel and the modest lake of Murtensee in an area more reknowned for its
market gardens and vegetables than anything else. But it is gorgeous.
Geometrically precise rows of cabbages and corn are tended no less royally
than the gardens of Versailles. To protect them from birds, the vineyards
that slope down to the Murtensee spend the summer covered in what look like
outsize yellow hair-nets. From barns to bakeries, buildings spill over with
the countless red blooms of flower-box geraniums.
Over on the other side of the Murtensee, medieval Morat, a toy-town of red
spires and watch-towers, gilded town clocks and decorated fountains, floats
on an evening mist building over the lake. Morat's streets, restored to
their original finery, are immaculate.
Walt Disney himself could not have done a better job. Everything depends on
artifice and attention to detail, and, strangely enough, it all feels
natural and right. In this highest of high-tech countries, not even the cows
wandering over Mont Vully with ridiculous, old-fashioned bells around their
necks seem in the least embarrassed.
*****
Lake Lucerne: on board the ferry Unterwalden. I have spent years watching
swans and ducks in London's parks, and never known how they fed or moved
under that muddy water. Now I do. In the crystal-clear waters of Lake
Lucerne, I see swans plunge their necks downwards and sweep the bottom with
their bills, watch flocks of ducks use their wings to swim along under the
surface as if in flight. It is an astonishing sight, and this one of the
loveliest lakes in the world.
I am usually reluctant to do corny tourist things like taking boat tours and
riding miniature trains to mountain viewpoints. But Switzerland is fast
breaking my resistance - such pursuits here are not so much corny as
heart-stopping.
Like the swans bobbing along beside it, the 90-year-old side-paddle steamer
Unterwalden is all elegance above the water and furious effort below.
Through an open-topped engine-room I watch polished pistons rise and fall
and paddle-wheels thrash their way through limpid water. They take me past
flower-laden lakeside villages basking in the autumn sun, chateaux perched
on forested promontories, mountains soaring skyward from the lake's edge.
At the little town of Vitznau I, too, soar skywards, in a cogwheel train
that climbs impossibly steep grades. I sit facing backwards. In no time at
all it is as if I am looking at the lake through the wrong end of a
telescope. I travel nearly 2,000m to the Rigi Kulm, a mountain summit from
which the entire country spreads out, tiny and unreal.
Rigi has been famous for a long time. Mark Twain climbed it last century to
see the sun rise over Switzerland. He got lost in the dark on the final
ascent and waited anxiously until mid-morning before he realised that the
glorious event had taken place on the other side of the mountain. Twain
swore forever more that in Switzerland the sun rises in the west.
*****
THE Hofbahnstrasse, Zurich. Not all Switzerland is a temple to nature. There
are about 1,700 Swiss banking corporations, and most of them seem to have
branches along the Hofbahnstrasse. These temples to money lend heavy, grey
walls, lofty ceilings and a sense of dignified purpose to a street of busy
trams and hurrying people. I am disappointed in the gnomes of Zurich. Who
invented the phrase? In my mind I pictured them as strange, cunning
creatures with identifiable signs - long ears or curling toes. They are like
men in grey suits anywhere.
My room at the Neues Schloss Hotel is another kind of temple, a temple to
technology. There are a hundred minor wonders such as its electric window
blinds. But the crowning glory is the Closomat - a fully automatic,
high-tech toilet. It is so complex that it comes with a book of
instructions. Once it is mastered, however, one literally sits back and
enjoys it: warm water jets and air driers do all the rest.
*****
MORCOTE, on the Swiss-Italian border. Can this still be Switzerland? In a
short drive over the St Gotthard pass I have driven from a Norwegian- to a
Spanish-style climate. Gone are the pine trees and the steep-roofed chalets.
In their place on the sub-tropical shores of Lake Lugano are palm trees and
ornamental bamboos, Italianate houses in rich ochre, sienna and magenta,
huge lunch-time dishes of polenta and risotto.
But I do not have to look at plants or houses or food to know that I am back
on the edge of the real world. I only have to look at people and their
behaviour. I have just seen a local driver reverse in the wrong direction
down a one-way street. It is a sure sign that I am not far from the general
disorder, confusion and non-conformity that makes up most of the planet.
Swiss life, so sane and predictable, ends up being the oddest life of all.
But once again it has reaffirmed my faith in travel, which never turns out
the way one think it will.
Nicholas Woodsworth travelled with Swissair (Tel: 071-734-6737), which has

FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: Florida's fun, in rain or
sun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS

<TEXT>
THE RAIN smashed against the windscreen. It was hard to see beyond the end
of the bonnet, so I stopped searching for the golf club and returned to my
hotel. You get used to that in Florida in late summer. Torrential rain falls
almost every afternoon and is followed within minutes by the sun. Soon the
ground is steaming.
I was in the north-east, the Palm Coast-Daytona Beach area. The Palm Coast,
two hours' drive north of Orlando, is a parcel of land the size of greater
London where ITT is building a community of 20,000 homes. It has tennis,
riding, biking, any water-borne sport and five golf courses. I was there for
golf.
I had mentioned to David Leadbetter, the well-known coach, that I was going
golfing in north-east Florida and he urged me to play Hammock Dunes. The
name had a ring to it. 'It's great,' said Leadbetter, so to play Hammock
Dunes became a primary objective.
I started, however, at Cypress Knoll, 25 minutes' drive from the Sheraton
(Palm Coast) Resort where I was staying. Cypress Knoll, carved out of
swampland, was designed by Gary Player. It has such narrow fairways that I
nearly went an entire round without using my driver, something I have never
done in 40 years of playing golf. My frustration was offset by the beauty of
the surroundings. A heron swooped down in front of one tee. A swallow-tail
butterfly fluttered past another. There were water moccasins everywhere and,
apparently, an 8ft diamond-back rattlesnake.
Next morning I left the Palm Coast and drove south to Daytona Beach. Indigo
Lakes is semi-private, which means it is open to anyone for a few thousand
dollars in membership. Accuracy was demanded but not as much as at Cypress
Knoll. The fairways are generous and some of the greens enormous.
Then it was the turn of Cypress Head, another semi-private course, designed
by Arthur Hills in Port Orange, just south of Daytona. Because the water
table is so close to the surface in Florida, any earth that is moved to dig
a bunker or sculpt a mound reveals water - the dominant feature on most of
Florida's courses.
Not so at Cypress Head. It has holes like those at some of Britain's famous
inland courses. Thickets containing oaks, pampas grass, willows, thistle and
wax myrtle had to be skirted or driven over and although there was water on
many holes, it was neither intrusive nor overpowering. I could play Cypress
Head again and again.
Good news awaited me at my motel. I had a starting time at Hammock Dunes the
next morning. I celebrated with a swim in the Atlantic. Although it was late
afternoon the sand on Daytona's 24-mile-long beach was hot underfoot.
Hammock Dunes is an ultra-private new club on the Palm Coast. It had only
112 members last August, one per acre. What sticks in my mind is not the
excellent condition of the course or the number of challenging holes.
Instead, I was struck by the attention to detail on the practice ground. I
went to limber up and found a pile of balls laid in such a way that must
have taken several minutes to do. It was the same at all of the 15 positions
on the practice ground.
Nor is it all golf. Within 60 miles are Disneyland, the Epcot space centre
and Universal Studios. This somewhat unsung part of Florida represents a
realistic alternative to Spain and Portugal for a spring or autumn golfing
holiday.
John Hopkins was a guest of British Airways Holidays and Destination
Daytona. One-week holidays including golf at 10 courses in the Palm Coast
and Daytona Beach area start at Pounds 589 (flight and hotel) plus Pounds 89
for the golf. British Airways Holidays: Pacific House, Hazelwick Avenue,

FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: The buzz of Madeira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN PILLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MUST be off-putting when standing over a nasty 5ft downhill putt for par
on a fast-paced green to hear a yelp and look up to see a Yorkshire terrier
ascending skywards in the talons of a large bird of prey.
But this happened to a lady member of the Madeira Golf and Country Club at
Santo da Serra, the first golf course on the Portuguese-owned island, which
opened in 1991. Chipping on to the green, she tied her pet to a tree and the
bird swooped.
Buzzards have been on Madeira for centuries, but golfers are a fairly new
species. Madeira is 350 miles south-west of Lisbon and three hours flying
time from London. Golf began there in 1947 when expatriates built a
nine-hole course to work off the Malmsey and sweet potatoes and work their
way up to their post-round poncha (a concoction of grated lemon, honey sugar
cane and white spirit) or nikita (beer, wine and ice cream).
For an island supposedly discovered by a shipwrecked Englishman, it was
inevitable that the British golfing influence would follow. The nine-hole
course of 1947 has now become the yellow Serras course and final loop at the
27-hole, 6,100-metre Santo da Serra club, chosen to host the inaugural
Madeiran Open and first event of the 1993 Volvo PGA European Tour.
'We offer year-round golf, not just winter sun,' says marketing director
Tony Barton. It is a typical resort course: not too easy, not too hard, And
it is very pretty. It is like Woburn-by-the-Sea.
Although Madeira boasts a continuous English summer, V-necks are required if
you are playing early in the morning at Santo da Serra, because it is 2,500m
above sea level and can be pretty nippy. Driving skills are another
recommendation.
Level ground is not easy to find on Madeira, and Santo da Serra, designed by
Robert Trent Jones, is a challenge to high and low handicappers alike,
especially the 476m par-five 3rd which calls for a drive over part of the
Machico Valley.
Opening soon, adjoining the course, will be a 145-room five-star hotel and
golf village with 30 luxury villas which can be built according to the
owner's design. There will also be a bowls green, a driving range, swimming
pool, tennis and squash courts, stables and equestrian centre - even a BMX
track.
The Woburn-by-the-Sea feel will be reinforced when Madeira's second course
opens at Palheiro in September, created by Cabell Robinson around the
sub-tropical gardens. Palheiro overlooks Funchal Bay. Reid's Hotel and its
lift to the beach can be seen from the 18th green.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: In Spain's golden rectangle
 -A new course looks set to perfect an already wonderful area for golfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE MET just after 8.00am on a windy March morning on the first tee at San
Roque golf club in southern Spain. A voice that was definitely not English
said 'Good morning,' and I turned to see a tall, sturdy man with dark hair
who was wearing red velvet trousers, white golf shoes and had slung his bag
of clubs over his shoulder. He had a slow, shy smile.
Jose-Luis Quiros was the caddie-master. Yes, he had played golf for many
years; no, he had never had a lesson. He just watched good players and
copied what they did - and did so with good effect, for he had a firm,
repetitive swing and looked to be a genuine five-handicap player.
As we played we talked, as golfers do, of the course, of our best rounds,
our favourite holes. He said he had some MacGregor clubs that were 50 years
old. I pulled out a nine-iron I carry in my bag, a Fred Daly model made by
John Letters that I bought more than 30 years ago. He admired the face and
classic lines of the clubhead and waved his hands, inscribing the shape of
the club face in the air.
On the 7th, a short hole uphill, I had the honour and hit a one-iron. It
felt good the moment I made contact. I was sure it would be near the putting
surface, if not on it. Jose-Luis stepped forward to play his tee shot, a
quizzical look on his face.
'You no hit it well,' he said.
'Pardon?' I said.
'You no hit it well.'
'Pardon?'
We were entering the realms of Basil Fawlty and Manuel and I felt like
saying 'Que?' in a sarcastic voice. I had just hit the shot of the round, a
one-iron that did not just fly off the clubface but screamed away as if it
was a fighter leaving an aircraft carrier.
I thought he was taking the Mickey. Then the peseta dropped. What he meant
was that I had not hit it full out, that I had saved some juice lest I hit
the ball through the green. He was right. Phew] The temperature dropped. I
nodded, sagely.
We played on and the sun came out to warm our stiff, middle-aged back
muscles. At the 18th I nearly chipped in for a birdie three and Jose-Luis
racked up another par. We shook hands and shared a coffee in the clubhouse.
Then he returned to his duties as caddie-master and I to my room.
The San Roque Suites hotel where I was staying is less than two years old
and already a prominent landmark on the road from La Linea to Marbella. As
you drive east it is high up on the left, the inland side of the road,
bordering the vast acreage of the Sotogrande estate.
In my view it has two things to commend it. It is very comfortable and well
managed by Alex Medina, who formerly worked in hotels in England for nearly
20 years. Its name comes from the fact that it has 50 suites and 50 double
rooms, and when I say suite I mean suite. Mine, for example, comprised a
kitchen, eating area, sitting room, double bedroom, bathroom with heated
marble floor and a separate lavatory. I could swing a golf club, never mind
a cat, in any of the rooms.
Still, for golfers, a greater attraction may be its locality at the western,
less populous end of the Costa del Sol golfing belt, an area which claims to
have 325 days of sunshine annually. Within five minutes' drive of its main
entrance are two superb golf courses to the east - Valderrama and Sotogrande
Old - and Alcaidesa to the west, which could be spectacular once alterations
are completed. When you add San Roque's own David Thomas-designed course,
the appeal of the hotel as a base for a winter golfing break becomes
obvious.
You do not have to take my word for it. In the second week of March, every
room was occupied, many with golfers staying there as part of packages
organised by Longshot, Eurogolf, 3-D and British Airways.
There is little that can be added about Valderrama, perhaps the best course
in Europe. Work progresses daily in pursuit of making it a masterpiece, much
of it with the aim of staging the 1997 Ryder Cup. Whether it achieves this
or not, it is undoubtedly one of the best maintained courses in the world.
The New Yorker used to offer readers a prize if they spotted a grammatical
error in its pages. The attention to detail at Valderrama is such that they
could offer a free drink to anyone finding a weed on its greens and probably
its fairways as well.
Sotogrande Old, the stately old course that Robert Trent Jones laid out 30
years ago, is on the seaward side of the Gibraltar-to-Marbella road. Its
reputation among courses down on the coast is rather like that of the Queen
Mother among Britain's royal family: it is much loved and admired even if it
is slightly past the first flush of youth. The new name on this part of the
coast is Alcaidesa, which is 15 minutes' drive from Gibraltar.
To measure its proximity to San Roque, I used the mileometer of my car and
can report that from Suite 23S at the hotel to the temporary clubhouse at
Alcaidesa is no more than 3 1/2 km, two of which comprise the drive from the
main road down to the temporary clubhouse. It is a majestic drive, a
zig-zagging, tumbling road that took me to the edge of the Mediterranean and
on the morning of my visit to the edge of a swathe of sunlight that lay
still and shimmering on the surface of the sea.
I was awed by the majesty of what I saw of the course. A frisky wind
galloped in off the sea causing the gorse bushes to sway and their yellow
blooms to shake uncontrollably. It is one of the most beautiful and most
difficult courses I had ever seen.
But the fairways were narrow in places, the carries long, the gorse lapped
the edges of some fairways and some of the greens were too severely tilted.
No wonder that when some of the gorse was cut back they unearthed tens of
thousands of golf balls. On a windy day, and more days than not are windy by
the sea, Alcaidesa could be almost unplayable.
Even so, 1,000 rounds each month were played over its 6,500 yards from
October last year to February. Work is currently going on to defenestrate
the course, altering 14 greens, moving tees, hacking away the gorse, making
it less penal.
I climbed into my car and drove slowly back up to the main road, chastened
at the amount of alteration work necessary to adapt what is only a
two-year-old golf course. It is too early to include Alcaidesa in the golden
triangle formed by San Roque, Valderrama and Sotogrande, a triangle that is
the most interesting current aspect of golf on the Costa del Sol.
Besides, to include Alcaidesa would alter its geometrical shape from a
triangle to a rectangle. But it was something to look forward to - the day
when there would be four outstanding golf courses no more than two miles
from one another in a part of the world that, to paraphrase Rupert Brooke,
seems to be 'forever England.'

block

CAESAREA is the only golf club in the world where Roman relics and ancient
obelisks are deemed an integral part of the course. Whereas other golf
courses have deep gorse, heather and lakes to gobble up your shots, Israel's
first - and, so far, only - golf course has strategically placed and
immovable Doric columns. Get behind one of them and you will have to chip
sideways.
There is no sidestepping history in Israel. Two miles from the
Mediterranean, on the coast road between Tel Aviv and Haifa, Caesarea is an
unusual and relaxing starting point if you intend driving into the 2nd
century. Self-drive holidays like the ones excellently organised by
Twicker's World, which will organise all your accommodation en route, are
becoming increasingly popular.
When Palestine was under British rule there was a Sodom and Gomorrah golf
club near the Dead Sea. Opened in 1961, Caesarea was built by an Englishman,
Fred Smith of Carter Seeds, and funded by the Rothschild family.
The course is a demanding par 73, and clubs are available for hire. The best
places to stay are at the Dan Caesarea or, nearer to Tel Avi, the luxurious
Daniel Tower hotel in Herzylea.
Two other golf courses are planned in Ashkolen and Eilat, both to be
designed by Gary Player.
Israel is perhaps the only country where you are actively encouraged to
pick-up hitchhikers with guns. Israeli soldiers thumb lifts everywhere. This
can be useful, for you have to take advice about where to go in Israel and
how to get there.
The standard of driving is what you might expect: it shows great faith.
Israeli lorry drivers, especially, are not frightened by death. Drive in the
Holy Land, therefore, like you would in Naples or Marseilles.
It is not as bad as Portugal: people actually drive with their eyes open.
Avis provides a Fiat Uno for Dollars 37 a day (unlimited mileage). Truck
stops offering basic meals prive the best-value lunches.
Take into account the three sabbaths - Friday (Moslem), Saturday (Jewish)
and Sunday (Christian) when planning your itinerary.
The Kibbutz Hotel chain of Israel offers excellent four-star B &amp; B and
farmhouse accommodation all over Israel for around Dollars 45 per single
room per night.
In turn, the Kibbutz hotel at Nof Ginosar, on the edge of the Sea of
Galilee, offers a memorable breakfast buffet.
The Galilee region in the north of Israel is the perfect place to savour
spiritual tranquility and recover from the tackiness of some of the
country's other sacred sites.
People who visit Israel - more than 1m - are divided into those who
experience an overwhelming sense of religious significance and those who
experience overwhelming disappointment.
Naturally, you have to visit the over-commercialised and squalid little town
of Bethlehem. Unfortunately it is not a particularly moving experience when
you share the little crypt in the Basilica of the Nativity with about 300
other people, and there is not much sanctity on offer when you have to
endure a fairly explicit body search trying to enter the town.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: India at just Pounds 1 a
round - Kevin Pilley finds Indian golf courses the cheapest, least busy and
friendliest in the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN PILLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEST place to get away from the cocooned world of corporate travel and
the 24-hour rush hour that is India is the golf course.
There are more than 160 courses in India, ranging from marvellous city
courses like Bombay Presidency and Royal Calcutta to services courses and
hill stations such as Ooty, for which the word 'undulating' is an extreme
understatement. In Gulmarg, in Kashmir, India has the highest golf course in
the world (2,700 metres).
In my experience Indian golf courses are the cheapest, least busy and by the
far the friendliest in the world. On average a round will cost Pounds 1, a
caddie 40p for 18 holes, an uggawallah, or ballspotter, 20p, and
water-bearer 15p. You don't even have to take your clubs. A set of Pings can
be hired for 30p a round. Equipment is cheap to buy, too. A pair of shoes
costs Pounds 6 in a pro's shop.
There is always someone in the clubhouse afterwards eager to introduce you
to Officer's Choice beer, Indian rum or the club's famed chickpea curry.
Letters of introduction are not needed. All imperialists are welcome.
Indians want the world to know about their golf courses, and the world
deserves to know.
Golf was played in India 55 years before any major course established itself
in continental Europe or the US. Founded in 1829, and formerly called the
Dum Dum club , Calcutta is the oldest golf club in the world outside
Britain. It is India's only par-73 course and, at 7,100 yards, its longest
and most difficult. It is just down the road from the Oberoi Hotel where you
can spoil yourself with excellent service and cuisine.
Like Calcutta, the Tea Lawn behind the 18th green at Delhi Golf Club is out
of bounds. And it has other idiosyncratic hazards. The 3,000 peacocks that
live on the course, and the tombs of the favourite concubines of Lodhi
rulers, are deemed to be integral features of the course and immovable
obstructions.
Only one British company specialises in golf holidays to India. Dorset-based
Indian Encounters offers 12-17-day golf safaris taking in Delhi, Calcutta,
Bombay and Bangalore. The Taj Mahal and Goa are also on the itinerary. Agra
has a nine-hole course. Golf is well organised in India and the courses are
good. January and February are the best months to play. You have to cope
with the occasional suspicious rustle from the rough, and holes called The
Elephant Pit and Hydrophobia, but is a great way to see the country.
Most of the bigger city clubs have their own inexpensive and comfortable
accommodation. Bombay Presidency isn't far from the Searock Sheraton. The
Windsor Manor at Bangalore overlooks the course and is only a 10p rickshaw
ride away.

in Delhi, fax: 91-11-5702929; or Indian Encounters of Creech Barrow, East
Creech, Wareham, Dorset BH20 5AP1, UK. In London, plenty of hotel

FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: An oasis for serious
sportsmen - The greened-over desert is waiting . . . for John Hopkins and
his five-iron
</HEADLINE>

IT WAS nearly 5.30pm one day last month. As we walked up the 18th fairway
the sun slid towards the horizon. The temperature was just over 70`F and a
brisk wind was blowing in over the lake, slapping my face like a slightly
damp warm flannel. I was thirsty and hungry and looking forward to a pot of
tea in the clubhouse.
Where was I? Florida? No. Spain or Portugal? No. I was concluding a round at
the Emirates golf course in Dubai with Andrew Millar, the Scot who is the
club's executive director. 'One big difference between playing golf here and
in Spain and Portugal is that we have no housing on our course,' said Millar
later as we drank our tea in the spike bar of the clubhouse. 'Down here you
get 11 1/2 hours of playing time each day at an average temperature of
70`F-75`F. We get three days of rain each year. In fact, this is probably
the sunniest golf club in the world.' He beamed as he said this, knowing it
was a sweeping statement.
Dubai may seem to be an exotic location for a golfing break but that has not
stopped them from building two championship standard courses, or from
planning a third, or from generally making a determined bid to be considered
a serious venue for a golfing break - all this in four years. Oil is Dubai's
main source of income at present but stocks will run out in 20 years and
tourism, of which golf is animportant ingredient, is being developed as fast
as possible.
Dubai is a bustling, busy place. It has a population of just over 600,000,
up from 420,000 seven years ago. Wherever you look new hotels are being
built and existing ones being enlarged. Emirates Airline, which was founded
less than a decade ago, now has nearly 20 flights a week from Britain to
Dubai.
On one such six-hour flight recently I thought about golf in the Gulf. I had
read that the sand course at the Dubai Country Club was one of the oldest in
the area and as the aircraft sped eastwards I wondered what it would be like
to hit a long iron to an oil-based green, or, as they are called down there,
a brown. Little did I know at that stage that much of Dubai was no more than
10 years old - younger than my golf clubs.
I went first to the Dubai Creek course, which is about as upmarket a
pay-as-you-play course as you could find. It cost Dollars 50m, much of which
went on a lavish 50-metre high clubhouse shaped like the sails of a dhow.
The Creek course, built on 180 acres of once-barren land, is five minutes'
drive from the airport and no further from the centre of town.
It was designed by Karl Litten, the well-known American, and opened in
February. It is the second grass course in Dubai and thus a cousin of the
Emirates course where the Desert Classic has been held these past three
years. The Creek is a resort course, aimed at itinerant businessmen who want
a game of golf and/or a course of lessons. The head professional is Peter
Downie, a Scot, and he and his six-strong team of teaching professionals
work most of the day and some of the night as well.
Floodlit facilities include a nine-hole par-three course, three practice
holes, (a par-three and two par-fours) and a driving range for up to 45
golfers. I played the front nine holes, had my swing videoed from behind, in
front and above in Downie's indoor teaching school, and left the club at
about 6.30pm. Dusk was gathering but that was no problem. The floodlights
were turned on and the bays on the driving range would remain full for
another three or four hours. It is hard to imagine better coaching and
practice facilities anywhere in the world and it was easy to understand why
Downie was anxious to try and attract teams out to the Creek course to
practice. 'I want to make this a centre of excellence for teaching and
practising,' he said.
The next day I played the Emirates course with Millar. Of the two grass
courses it is the tougher and, to my way of thinking, the more pleasing to
the eye with its imaginative use of grasses and scrub. It has three or four
outstanding holes. By the time Millar and I reached the 18th we had barely
been out three hours. Golfers know their etiquette in the Gulf. In any case,
marshals roam the course to winkle out slowcoaches.
Not that Millar needed anyone to hurry him up. A Scot who was once an
outstanding water-polo player and international swimmer, he is one of the
fastest players I have ever come across. He was out of the cart, had his
club in his hand and had hit the ball (no practice swing) and was back in
the cart and bowling merrily down the fairway long before his ball had come
to a halt - and sometimes before it had touched the ground.
Before I left the Emirates club, Millar urged me to go and look at the Dubai
Country Club. 'It is part of Dubai's golfing heritage,' he said. 'You must
not leave without seeing it.' So the next morning I took a taxi out to the
club, 15 minutes from the centre of town. A sign at the entrance said
Darjeeling Cricket Club. The taxi paused briefly and then continued up to
the low-slung buildings of the country club.
The 14th Dubai Ladies Open was being played that day and competitors had
come from Germany, Zimbabwe, Oman, India and Pakistan, as well as other
countries. I stood by the putting green, shut my eyes and realised I could
have been at Royal Mid-Surrey or The Berkshire on a summer's morning. Birds
sang overhead. There was a regular clunk and click from the practice tee
where competitors were loosening up.
English voices were coming from all directions. 'Oh, I say,' exclaimed one.
'I just chipped in. Bet I can't do that in the competition.' Each competitor
carried a  1/2 -inch thick, 12in-diameter patch of Astroturf, as if it was a
prayer mat. This was to be used on the tees and from the fairways. A ball
ending in the rough had to be played as it lay. Each brown, I noticed,
consisted of a perfectly raked circular surface. Players were expected to
rake the brown after holing out. The browns looked hard and it was difficult
to get any backspin.
I sought refuge from the heat in the office of Dave Greedy, a slim Welshman
who is the manager of the country club. I wanted to talk about golf; he was
anxious to know about the Welsh rugby team that had just unexpectedly beaten
England. We compromised. He talked rugby and I talked golf until a taxi came
to collect me and return me to my hotel.
They do things properly down in Dubai. Golf is only the half of it. Safaris
in four-wheel drive vehicles into the desert, hot air balloon rides, horse
and camel racing, rugby, squash and tennis: all these are available. But
golf was what I was most interested in. My four-day visit convinced me that
Dubai's courses equal any in the world; all they need is better marketing.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: On course for the greening
of the world - A look at exotic sites for serious golfing holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS

WHEN Robert Louis Stevenson wrote that 'to travel hopefully is a better
thing than to arrive and the true success is to labour,' he might not have
had in mind those caddies who recently made a circuitous and eventful
journey to a professional golf tournament in north Africa.
Their journey started in Scotland on the Saturday before the Thursday on
which the tournament started. They drove south to Dover to pick up the
cross-Channel ferry before heading to Gibraltar and crossing by ferry to
north Africa. So far, so good.
Then their troubles began. Alleged visa problems meant they had to bribe
Moroccan Customs officials on arrival and pay out more bribes - ranging from
money to cigarettes and candy bars - at every police stop between Rabat and
Casablanca. They arrived in Agadir weary, wiser and poorer.
Caddies are reputed to like such experiences. For the rest of us, though -
those who travel the world in search of a decent golfing break, be it 48
hours or 14 days - life is usually easier. Book your holiday, allow two
hours to clear Customs, have a few drinks and buy an armful of golf mags. In
due course you are, with luck, re-united with your clubs in a sunny place.
The expansion in air travel and the growing popularity of the game have
combined to make it possible to go almost anywhere, anytime, to play.
According to Tony Philo, general manager of Longshot Golf Holidays*, more
and more people are doing just that - 60 per cent more than five years ago.
In three months, some enthusiasts will fly to Reykjavik to play in the
Iceland Open on the year's longest day, when darkness falls for all of half
an hour. But if that seems extreme, where else might you go?
Remember, first, that golfing holidays are not holidays with golf: they are
holidays for golf - serious affairs in which two rounds a day are the norm.
As for places, you could take a couple of nights at Queenwood in the grounds
of Bowood House, the Earl of Shelburne's home in Wiltshire. You would be
looked after by a butler and fed by your own cook. Cheaper would be a stay
at Andrew and Mary Flint's Boscundle Manor hotel near St Austell, Cornwall,
where guests have a practice area with two greens, several teeing positions,
a lake over which to hit and a golf net. If you travel by helicopter, there
is a landing site.
A step or two up come hotels like the Agadoe Heights in Killarney, Ireland,
or the Butler Arms in Waterville where, within 20 miles, you will find some
of the best courses in Co Kerry - which means some of the best in the world.
But the traditional destinations are still those outside Britain: Portugal's
Algarve coast plus Spain, France and Florida.
The good news from Spain is that green fees have tumbled in recent years.
And, these days, the well-informed visitor taking a golf holiday on the
Iberian peninsula books in at a hotel that offers the game as an inclusive
facility and not an available extra.
Stay at the Quinta do Lago hotel on the Algarve, for instance, and you can
play at Quinta do Lago, Val de Lobo, Vilasol, Vilamoura and - the newest of
all - Pinheiros Altos. At the Dona Filipa and the Penina, two old
favourites, green fees are included in the price. This not only saves money;
it saves organisation, as well.
Madeira, which has been popular with discerning Britons since the days when
access was only by cruise ship, is making a comeback. The first 18 holes of
the Campo de Golfe were opened recently and the Madeira Open was played over
them in January. Another nine are nearly complete and a further 18 holes
will open by September. And Madeira is worth considering for a golf holiday
because of the advantages of its climate, which is rarely colder than 63`F
or hotter than 75`F - plus the sybaritic comforts of Reid's Hotel.
The new golfing destinations are places like the Far East, east Africa -
where the Windsor Golf and Country Club in Nairobi is making a name for
itself - Zambia, South Africa and, increasingly, exotic places like Dubai
and the West Indies, one of the few destinations where sunshine is
practically guaranteed.
'Golf,' said author AA Milne (of Winnie the Pooh fame), 'is the best game in
the world at which to be bad.' A fat lot he knew. It is the one game in the
world at which no one wants to be bad. Everyone wants to be able to hit the
ball 300 yards off the tee. As a result, hotels are starting to realise that
if they organise clinics, then guests can play and improve their game as
well. At Sandy Lane in Barbados next week, for example, an American
professional will conduct a clinic. If the venture is a success, there will
be another in the autumn.
'One trend among people taking golf holidays that has become apparent
recently is that clients expect more quality and better service from us,'
says Philo. 'They want more flexibility in departure and return dates, and
in tee-off times.
'They want to leave on any day of the week and stay for any length of time.
The days when you could travel to Portugal only on a Thursday and return
only on a Thursday are gone. These days, everything must go without a hitch
 -otherwise, they want to know why.'
And so they do. Golfers spending anything up to Pounds 3,000 a person per
week have a right to expect to be looked after. They are, after all,
searching for a new golfing destination that offers a better course than any
other, or a less stressful means of getting there, or a more soothing
atmosphere once they have arrived. It is a never-ending quest.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Property: For space and grace, go for a rectory - With
congregations falling, Gerald Cadogan discovers that not only are there
plenty of cast-off Church houses for sale but some of them come with an
unexpected bonus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE, when the Church of England still had substantial congregations,
rectors ran parishes and lived in rectories: substantial family houses,
larger than most in the village and at its heart, next to the church itself.
Position in the social pecking order - and attendant responsibilities - were
made manifest in brick and stone.
Now, though, the Church has sold nearly all the rectories it can. Parsons
cannot afford to live in them unless they have private means to supplement a
typical salary of Pounds 12,000 - and few do. Then again, many rectories
became surplus when parishes were re-organised into groups of three, four or
five churches under one priest.
Rectories, new and old, have one common bonus. Downstairs is an extra room
for the study where the priest wrote his sermons and held confirmation
classes.
In old rectories, it is often the same size as the dining or drawing room.
Expect also plenty of bedrooms; a pantry, scullery and larder as well as the
kitchen; several out-buildings; and a garden of between half an acre and six
acres.
The house probably will come with covenants forbidding you to turn it into a
pub or make a disturbance during services. But these are not onerous
restrictions. And if you are buying it from the Church, there is an
unexpected plus. Thanks to the Ecclesiastical Residences Act 1776 and the
Parsonages Measure 1938, the deal is free of stamp duty.
That will be the case on Wednesday when the 16th-19th century rectory in the
large village of Porlock, on the north Somerset coast and the edge of
Exmoor. is sold at auction by Cluttons, the diocesan agent, with a guide
price of Pounds 160-200,000.
In a similar sale on April 21, Cluttons will auction Berrow rectory near
Burnham-on-Sea. This is an attractive Georgian brick building which retains
its coach house and comes with a guide price of Pounds 150,000. For another
Pounds 30,000 or so, there is a second lot with planning permission for a
house.
Cluttons also has three old rectories in Somerset for sale by private
treaty. One - at Croscombe, near Wells - has Georgian sash windows, a granny
flat, three acres and a tennis court needing repair and netting. Price:
around Pounds 270,000.
In the south-east, old rectories cost more. At Washington, in West Sussex,
King &amp; Chasemore and Jackson-Stops offer one dating from the 1820s - a time
when many rectories were built. Its standard Georgian looks (for around
Pounds 360,000) would be more at home in a town than a village. The Georgian
house at Ampfield, near Romsey in Hampshire (Lane Fox, around Pounds
320,000) is more eclectic.
By 1854 - the date of the Old Parsonage at Cranbourne in Windsor Forest -
the style had changed to Gothic although rectories still had plenty of room.
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert subscribed to building both it and the
church, and Benjamin Ferrey was the architect. With six loose boxes and
three paddocks (making 7.5 acres in all), and near Ascot, it is being
offered by Jackson-Stops in London for around Pounds 565,000.
In Kent, Mountfield House at Staplestreet, near Canterbury, is not actually
an old rectory, although it might easily be. Gothic, and also from 1854, it
has the right dimensions and was the home of a Methodist hymn-writer,
Benjamin Gough. Strutt &amp; Parker in Canterbury is selling it with a guide
price of Pounds 350,000.
The same firm's office at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, has (with
Seccombes) the double bow-fronted old rectory at Shipston-on-Stour in
Warwickshire; offers over Pounds 240,000 are sought for this handsome
Regency building.
Savills in Banbury is selling two Georgian examples near the M40 in
Northamptonshire. Offers of around Pounds 385,000 are sought for a
stone-built rectory at Aynho, next to a wonderful 18th century box-pewed
church, while another constructed of brick at Aston le Walls is on sale for
around Pounds 10,000 less (with Jackson-Stops in Northampton).
More unusual is the Dower House in Gayton, near the M1, which the same duo
is selling for around Pounds 300,000. It is a Victorian Gothic extravaganza
built for a headmaster of Harrow school and featuring a steeply-pitched,
tiled turret. It would not have been out of place among the school's own
outstanding Victorian buildings. Sir John Betjeman would have loved it.
In the north, Jackson-Stops has three distinctive examples to sell. One, in
pink stucco at Ulverston, Cumbria, has Morecambe Bay lapping below the front
lawn (from the Chester office for around Pounds 550,000). From the York
office, there is a Tudor-Stuart house in brick at Thorpe Bassett (around
Pounds 230,000), while the other, also in brick and dating from 1885, is at
Thorpe Thewles, near Darlington (around Pounds 285,000).
East Anglia takes the honours for the greatest range of old rectories. One
at Snetterton, Norfolk, is said to have a ghost - a kindly old woman
(Jackson-Stops in Newmarket, around Pounds 235,000).
Mullucks Wells offers an unusually imposing Victorian house at Abbess
Roding, near Harlow (Essex) and the M11, for around Pounds 485,000; while
Bedford has another fine example at Docking, north Norfolk, for around
Pounds 325,000. John D. Wood is selling a rectory in Burnham-on-Crouch,
Essex, for around Pounds 340,000 - ideal for yachtsmen.
Bidwells has several, including two splendid 18th century houses near Holt,
Norfolk, from the Norwich office: Foulsham in mellow brick for around Pounds
345,000, and Baconsthorpe for around Lxxx. The firm's Ipswich office offers
the old rectory at Thornham Parva, Suffolk (around Pounds 170,000). Although
built as late as 1952, it does not lack for spaciousness.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Sport: Wall of death at 230mph - Motor racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SURGICAL expertise is never acquired in the abstract. The Royal Victoria
Hospital in Belfast, for example, is quite the best place in the world for
treating bullet wounds to the brain. At the Methodist Hospital,
Indianapolis, Dr Terry Trammell's expertise at stitching together injured
racing drivers is quite exceptional.
Last May, the man on the table was Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet. He had
run into the unyielding wall of the Indianapolis motor speedway at around
220 mph. The front of the car disintegrated; so, too, did Piquet's left
ankle. 'The bone was just pulverised to the point where it essentially
wasn't there,' reported Trammell after eight hours of micro-surgery.
IndyCar racing, in which Britain's Nigel Mansell makes his debut tomorrow,
is the blood'n'guts version of motor sport. Two things make it especially
dangerous; gladiatorial, even. One is that the cars are much quicker than
the F1 projectiles, averaging 230 mph at some circuits. The other is that
the oval circuits, hemmed by a concrete wall, leave no opportunity for such
niceties as 'spinning off.'
Tomorrow the season begins with 65 laps, totalling 181 miles, around a
street circuit on the Gold Coast, Australia's answer to Las Vegas. Because
of Mansell, it will be the sport's admission to the big-time for European
fans: British terrestrial commercial television has bought the rights to the
season's racing which will also go out on satellite TV.
On his first day in the cockpit in Phoenix, Arizona, Mansell came within 0.5
secs of breaking the track record set by Michael Andretti. Actor Paul Newman
 -co-owner of the team - leant into the car and shook the Englishman by the
hand saying: 'That was a mother of a lap.'
Newman's partner, Carl Haas, was equally impressed. 'I knew he was good but
not that good,' said Haas. 'For someone to come in cold and immediately go
that fast is scary. The guy has fantastic car control, experience and
skills. if he can do that on an oval, on a road track he will be totally
awesome.'
Mansell himself was uncharacteristically humble: 'Nothing about it compares
to anything I've ever done before or anything in Formula One. It's a
completely different world,' he told a huge media crowd. 'It holds your
attention totally. And as far as physical stress is concerned, it's very
hard.'
To some of its fans IndyCar retains the 'purity' of F1 before it went
hi-tech with semi-automatic gearboxes, intelligent suspension and
radio-telemetry between engine and the pits. IndyCars produce more raw
horsepower through bigger engines. One should not dismiss it as crude.
Honda, which stopped supplying F1 engines in 1992, will supply them to the
1994 IndyCar world series.
Some detractors say that on the oval circuits Indy is just a barbaric test
of nerve. The laws of physics mean that on the extreme edge of the track,
where the curves are shallower, cars travel fastest. They are also closest
to the concrete wall. Tyres sometimes brush the wall as the cars lap at
230mph or so.
Experienced Indy drivers rarely hide how frightened it can make them. Tom
Sneva, winner of the 1983 Indianapolis 500, was asked if he had run a little
close to the wall on the final turn. 'I don't really know,' he replied.
'Usually you have your eyes closed at that point.'
There is the possibility that an IndyCar oval may be built in Britain. At
least one circuit owner is deep into a feasibility study. Outline planning
permission is already secured.
The sport is enjoying a PR boost even the advent of a movie star driver
(Newman) could not create. 'Our appointment of Nigel has created a gravy
train for all the other teams in IndyCars,' said a spokesman for
Newman-Haas.
The only doubt is the possibility that Mansell - whether he admits it to
himself or not - may just be taking a sabbatical from the F1 big time. He
maintains his F1 career is over; leaving at the top with 30 wins and the
world title. Others are doubtful.
Frank Williams, his former boss at Williams-Renault, predicts that before
the year end Mansell will be talking to F1 people about a contract for 1994.
The oval tracks may be a struggle but Williams said recently that Mansell
would do enough on the street and road circuits to win the title.
'Nigel will demonstrate when he starts driving in the States that Indy is
not the same standard as F1. I think he will be in a class of his own and
just disappear,' he added. There are precedents. In the 1960s two British
drivers, Jim Clark and Graham Hill, came to the heart of US auto-racing and
won the Indianapolis 500. Both returned to F1.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Motoring: Get a grip on tired tyres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE CAR tyre in three is worn beyond the point of illegality before it is
replaced. Another 40 per cent are changed only when they have worn right
down to the limit.
Tom Farmer, chief executive of the Kwik-Fit chain of specialist tyre
dealers, finds this 'horrifying'. The official view, as expressed by Kenneth
Carlisle, Roads and Traffic Minister, is more relaxed.
He sees the figures - revealed by a nationwide survey - as 'showing that, on
average, tyres are being changed when they reach the legal limit . . . and
confirming that the public has understood the recent change in the law.'
According to another recent survey, many drivers do not know the urban speed
limit is 30 mph and the motorway limit 70 mph. So what chance is there of
their being aware that to be legal, a tyre must have at least 1.6 mm of
tread pattern remaining in a continuous band covering at least 75 per cent
of the width of the tread?
It seems that tyre neglect will always be with us.
Yet another survey (the public opinion pollsters must be immune from the
recession) suggests that road hauliers, though always moaning about rising
costs, throw away Pounds 80m a year in premature wear caused by abuse and
neglect of lorry tyres.
Nothing is more essential to safe driving than a good set of tyres. But
mention tyre care to most motorists and their eyes glaze over. Tell them
that four new ones for their sporty, 130 mph (210 kph) family saloon will be
over Pounds 500 and they mutter highway robbery. Even though the elaborate
in-car entertainment system they selected cost far more.
Today's steel belted radial tyre is long lasting (and long suffering) as
well as life saving. Even better ones are starting to appear on new cars and
in specialist dealerships or are waiting in the wings. For example, at
Geneva Show earlier this month, Michelin unveiled a futuristic tyre called
Anhinga on the Renault Racoon, a concept for an amphibious, go-anywhere
leisure vehicle.
The fat, low pressure Anhinga's tread pattern looks like animal hoofprints.
It blends with the terrain it runs over and does less surface damage than a
normal off-road tyre. Michelin made it of green rubber to show it is
environmentally friendly.
Very low rolling resistance Michelin tyres are helping the latest Citroen AX
diesel to be the world's most economical production car. Over 65 mpg (4.35
l/100 km) is possible in normal use yet it remains agreeably driveable.
For years, the tyre industry has been trying to defeat the curse of the
wide, ultra-low profile tyre aquaplaning in heavy rain. A bright idea, by
Swiss inventor Jerry Juhan, was to replace one big, fat tyre with two very
narrow ones, mounted side by side on a special wheel.
Instead of surface water building up dangerously, as it might under a very
squat tyre's footprint, it flowed through the gap between the two skinny
tyres. Narrow tyres do not aquaplane. The Juhan twin-tyre concept beat that
particular bogey.
But there were problems as well as benefits in having twin tyres. Goodyear
and Continental use the same aquaplane-defeating centre channel on their
Aqua-Tread and Aqua-Contact tyres. But they are conventional ultra-low
profile types with a deep grove moulded in the centre of their tread.
Michelin has taken the idea a stage further. At Geneva Show it displayed
Catamaran, a prototype tyre for super cars like Ferraris. It looks much the
same as its Goodyear or Continental rivals but is made more like two
separate tyres, though still sharing the same air chamber. A thick
reinforcing cable buried in the bottom of the groove ensures its depth - and
water clearing capacity - stays constant as the twin treads wear away.
Like so many tyre innovations, Catamaran is not brand-new. Michelin patented
the design in 1972.
If 21 years seems a long time between concept and reality, consider the
radial ply tyre. Two Englishmen, Grey and Sloper, patented it in the reign
of King Edward VII. But it was another 40 years before a Citroen Six became
the first car to run on radials (Michelin X) in 1949.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Sport: Learners and earners - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE soft spring sunshine bathing the scene once again at Key Biscayne
on Thursday, Jim Courier looked pretty relaxed. He had just beaten Mikael
Pernfors of Sweden to reach the fourth round of the Lipton tournament. Even
though he would have to play a second singles that night (a match he was
destined to lose), because of the severe storms in south Florida which had
delayed progress at the ten day event, the world No. 1 could afford to
smile. The 22-year-old American has already won three tournaments this year
and banked Dollars 621,809 (Pounds 438,000) to add to career earnings which
had reached almost Dollars 5m by the end of 1992.
Just up the coast at Boca Raton, life had a harder edge for four impecunious
young Britons. Thursday was the first day of qualifying on the opening leg
of the four week Florida Satellite Circuit. For Tim Henman, Nick Gould,
Barry Cowan and Dan Sanders this was a life or death mission, a quest for
points. Computer points. They alone measure a player's progress. They alone
are the passport to a place in the draw and potential prosperity on the
whirling multi-million dollar roundabout that is men's professional tennis
in 1993.
After winning the British Junior Championships last September, Henman's
reward was to be part of a British junior squad sent for a four week
apprenticeship on the Morocco circuit followed by one week each in Zambia
and Botswana plus two weeks in Zimbabwe. That was his first taste of the
professional scene.
'I qualified and won two rounds in Morocco to earn my first points - it was
an unbelievable feeling.' he remembers. 'People have no idea what it's like
at the qualies. The competition is so fierce. After we'd reached the quarter
finals of the Sunshine Cup team event last December we went off to spend
four weeks on the satellite circuit in Portugal. Every man and his dog
showed up that first day - 223 guys signed in. It was a zoo out there. But
at least I earned a few points. It was a start.'
Sanders has not yet made that start. 'It will be a huge weight off my
shoulders when I win my first point' he says. 'There's so much pressure
these days, but I don't mind that, now that the LTA are helping me with the
cost of competing.'
Along with Henman, Gould and Cowan, Sanders is part of a national squad
formed last July and managed by LTA coach David Felgate. Sanders, from
Yeovil, in Somerset, came to the fore by reaching the semi-finals of the
1991 national Junior Championships in his penultimate year as a junior.
Before he earned help from the LTA life was a struggle for his parents.
Dan recalls his attempts to follow the path he had chosen: 'They wouldn't
let me play tennis at school so I left at 16 and joined John Hicks' squad in
Wrexham, playing tennis four days a week and going home at weekends. But
each year that cost my dad Pounds 3,000 for just six months and he was also
having to pay for my sister at university. Then there was the huge expense
of travelling round the tournaments.'
Thanks to the efforts of Billy Knight, the former British No. 1 who guides
the fortunes of Britain's best youngsters do at last have a realistic chance
of making the difficult transition from junior to senior tennis. Not simply
because there is financial help available. There is also an improvement in
the whole area of development. As Henman says 'There is a much more
professional attitude to training, practice and preparation for matches. I
have just had a full medical at the Olympic Medical Institute. I realise
just how much stronger I need to be and I now have a full training programme
to work at.'
Henman has no illusions about the task he faces. 'I have to rate myself
against people like (Andrei) Medvedev, he's the same age as me and already
ranked 21 in the world. . . that's just 759 places higher than I am'.
If heredity has any influence, Henman must have a chance. His grandfather,
through his mother Jane, was the pre-war British Davis Cup player, Henry
Billington. 'I've been playing since mum and dad started me off at the age
of two-and-a- half. We were lucky to have a court at home so it was always
possible to practise.'
When David Lloyd started his Slater Squad some five years ago, based on
Reeds School and his Raynes Park club, Henman was in the original intake.
Tim says Reeds played an important role in keeping a balance to his life.
'There was nothing special about being a tennis player there. When you went
back after practice at the club you simply joined the other kids in normal
school activities.'
Henman believes the man he must thank for his sound technique is former
Davis Cup player Steven Shaw who accompanied James Bailey and Jamie Delgado
on their successful trip to Australia in January. Shaw was deputed by David
Lloyd to instil a professional attitude in his charges.
With healthy competition between the many squads that now exist around UK,
both at the centres built as part of the Indoor Tennis Initiative (ITI) and
at others in private hands, there are the beginnings of the long-awaited
British tennis boom. Much has still to be done. As Davis Cup captain Tony
Pickard said this week in Key Biscayne, where he was working as usual with
Stefan Edberg, 'We are still not getting the co-operation we need from some
of the coaches in coming along with their best youngsters - even though most
of them don't have a clue what it takes to exist in this environment.'
His arm swept in an expansive arc to embrace this makeshift tennis centre,
built on a former rubbish tip, where the world's best men and women, an
exclusive band of wealthy athletes, will divide Dollars 3m this week.
Perhaps the far away look in his eye is a reflection of how long it will
take before Henman and Delgado can expect to amass enough points to join the
charmed circle.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Sport: Pride of Lions with an English accent - John Hopkins
saves the British and Irish selectors the trouble of picking a party to tour
New Zealand / Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW morning, those selecting the British Lions' rugby squad to tour New
Zealand this summer will announce their choices. Gentlemen, you need not
bother. I have picked the party for you. Take the day off.
Although it is never easy to pick Lions' teams, I believe the 1993 party is
easier to select than, say, those of 1983 and 1989. Players from England -
which is vying with New Zealand to be the second-best rugby nation in the
world - obviously should form the core of the party.
Some ground rules. First, I am selecting solely on ability. Lions' teams
have been dogged by regional parochialism. Imagine the scene: selectors
representing each of the four home unions gather round the table. As the
composition of the party takes shape, one selector realises that there will
only be a couple of players from his country. This will reflect badly on him
and colours his comments.
Since it is impossible for me to predict these outbursts of chauvinism, I
have ignored them altogether. How nice it would be to think there will be
none and that the best party is chosen.
The new laws have encouraged the up-and-under as an attacking tactic.
Full-backs who are safe under a high ball are essential. Gavin Hastings is
one and so, generally, is Jonathan Webb. And while neither is entirely
reliable with the boot (look at Webb against Wasps last Saturday), there
will be other goal-kickers in the party.
Wings? The Underwood brothers are scorching attackers and deadly finishers.
Ieuan Evans, provided his shoulder is all right, would be a good
vice-captain. He has led Wales well since he was appointed captain 18 months
ago. The fourth wing is a toss-up between Ian Hunter of Northampton and
Ireland's Simon Geoghegan. Geoghegan is the better wing, Hunter the more
rounded player who can play full-back as well. Since versatility is an asset
on tour, I prefer Hunter.
Will Carling and Jeremy Guscott are unchallenged as the first-choice
partnership in the centre. Scott Gibbs, the sturdy young Welshman, should
go. He is a rock-solid tackler, as is Scott Hastings. I give my nod to
Hastings, though not by much over the Bath club's promising Phil de
Glanville.
Stuart Barnes and Rob Andrew are as clear a choice as stand-off halves as
Carling and Guscott outside them. They complement one another. Barnes has an
edge on a firm pitch because of the way he can get his line moving. He
demonstrated this brilliantly at Twickenham against Scotland. Andrew is a
doughty competitor and a good goal-kicker. The competition between them will
be keen.
Gary Armstrong is the obvious first choice at scrum-half. Will the other be
Dewi Morris, whose tendency to play as a ninth forward can be so useful, or
Robert Jones, the quick-passing technician? Jones could have lost his chance
by operating behind a beaten pack for most of the season. Morris is my
choice.
No. 8? A man like Dean Richards is an essential component of a team in New
Zealand where at least some of the games will be played in mud. His
upper-body strength and ability to tie-up the ball will be invaluable. With
training every day, he should get a bit fitter, too.
If, however, the ground is dry and the game is expected to be fast and
loose, then Ben Clarke would be an acceptable choice at No. 8. He could even
play blindside flanker with Richards at the back.
Is Wade Dooley a spent force? I think not. If there are four better line-out
forwards in the home countries, then I am a Dutchman. He will benefit from
regular competition, which he does not get with Preston Grasshoppers.
Martin Bayfield should go along with Martin Johnson, who is known and
respected in New Zealand. Candidates for the fourth place as a lock include
Gareth Llewellyn, who has blossomed this season as captain of Neath; Neil
Francis of Ireland; and the Scots, Doddie Weir and Damian Cronin. Francis is
my man.
Kenny Milne and Brian Moore are certainties as the hookers, Jeff Probyn and
Jason Leonard as two of the props. I think that Nick Popplewell, the fiery
Irishman, and Paul Burnell of Scotland, should join them.
Flankers? Peter Winterbottom picks himself because he is one of the best in
the world. I think Neil Back deserves a chance to demonstrate his phenomenal
workrate on the open-side. Mike Teague is another New Zealand style forward,
a man who blossomed on tour in Australia four years ago and could do so
again this summer. Emyr Lewis was a leading candidate four months ago but
has not played at his best this season. Tim Rodber has come on at
Northampton under the aegis of Wayne Shelford and, like Clarke, could play
either at No 8 or flanker. He deserves a chance.
Now, having picked the team one must address the ticklish question of the
captaincy. It is true that Carling is the most successful captain in world
rugby. But that does not take in to account that he does not seem entirely
at ease with it and, more to the point, what goes with it  - the media and
all that. Hastings manages to do both with less apparent discomfort.
It might be a horrible mistake or it might be a moment of inspired thinking
to make Hastings the captain and give Carling a break from captaincy to
concentrate entirely on his own game. I plump for Hastings.
So there you are Lions' selectors, I have done the job for you in half the
time and at no cost. The party comprises 21 Englishmen, five Scots, two
Welshmen and two Irishmen. I must now duck my Irish and Welsh friends and
colleagues for having picked only two men from their country but I did say I
would select strictly on merit.
Thus the composition of my party is (English unless otherwise stated): G
Hastings, (Scotland) capt, J Webb, R Underwood, T Underwood, I Evans,
(Wales), I Hunter, W Carling, J Guscott, S Gibbs (Wales), S Hastings,
(Scotland) S Barnes, R Andrew, G Armstrong (Scotland), D Morris, J Probyn, J
Leonard, N Popplewell (Ireland), P Burnell (Scotland), B Moore, K Milne
(Scotland), W Dooley, M Bayfield, M Johnson, N Francis (Ireland), P
Winterbottom, N Back, M Teague, T Rodber, B Clarke, D Richards.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Welcome to the Jerk Centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SO, WHITE man, you want a lickle buss up shut?'
I was looking at a very large Trinidadian lady holding an 18-inch serving
spoon in her hand. It sounded threatening. But she hardly seemed violent, so
I took a punt on it.
I was handed a polystyrene box with knuckles of curry goat and some paratha
(unleavened bread). It tasted good, but it left me wondering what buss up
shut could be.
In Trinidad there are so many food stalls that you hardly need to sit down
to a formal meal. And you can start right outside the airport when you
arrive - Queenie will give you a roti, an envelope of filled bread.
The many snacks on offer reflect Trinidad's extraordinary mix of population.
Rotis are of (East) Indian origin (as are about 40 per cent of
Trinidadians). So are doubles, more unleavened bread folded over double,
with a yellow channa (split pea) filling, and aloo pie (aloo is Indianfor
potato).
Aripa is supposedly of Spanish origin, a cornflour pattie with mince
stuffing, while pastels (Spanish, via Venezuela) are a mix of peppers,
raisins and minced beef wrapped in a dasheen (like spinach) leaf. There is
even Chinese in the mix. Earlier this century, Trinidad had quite a
community of Chinese, though many have now left for the Pacific coast of
Canada. Taken from the Chinese word for bread, pow is a ball of fluffy dough
with a savoury or sweet filling.
Vendors selling batter balls often stand in a line together. You can buy
phulori (split peas in batter), sahina (spinach) and baigani (eggplant).
Sweet mango chutney is on hand for a dip, but you are advised to be wary of
hot pepper sauce.
There is also a variety of sweet offerings: pamie (supposedly of French
origin) is sweet coconut with raisins in cornmeal. Only the very brave try a
tamarind ball, a sluggish lump of unverifiable specific weight, a torture of
bitter and sweet. If you fancy fruit, a walk around the centre of Port of
Spain will get you anything in season from the back of a pick-up.
Coconuts are on sale throughout the islands. They are well worth trying,
though it may come as a surprise that as soon as you show interest in having
one, the vendor will promptly whip out his machete. Do not be alarmed. With
a few deft strokes he will top the nut, leaving a small hole for you to
drink through.
Another great Jamaican institution is the Jerk Centre. Contrary to what you
might think, these are not gathering points for the socially ungainly (you
will even find the occasional Executive Jerk Centre), but open-air barbecues
where you can buy jerked meat.
Jerking is a special way of cooking meat, originally developed by the
runaways in the Jamaican hills, who would shoot wild boar and cook it for a
couple of days in an underground oven. Nowadays they use an open oven in the
ground, with plum and mahoe wood for flavouring. The original pork has now
become chicken, sausage and 'spear ribs'.
Your order will be hacked into bite-size pieces and bundled into a piece of
paper. Then comes the offer of hot pepper sauce. Take the tiniest dab at
first, because pepper sauce has a searing taste and a nasty habit of
affecting anything edible for about 100 yards around.
It struck me that hot pepper sauce is what buss up shut had threatened to
be. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me and I asked what buss up
shut was. The large Trinidadian lady took a piece of paratha bread and held
it up. 'You see it look like a shirt material?' (it looked like a piece of
khaki denim). 'Well now, I bust up de shirt,' she said, tearing it up in
strips, 'an' so, you 'ave buss up shut.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Armagnac's allure - Pure column-still Armagnac
is not cheap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUR TASTEBUDS work in peculiar ways. Put a row of good cognacs on the table
and nose your way through them, then try an Armagnac. It will appear coarse,
eclipsed by the ethereal refinement of old cognac. Yet, there are times when
only Armagnac will do; that rich, fruity, pungent spirit so close to its
native Gascon soil.
The late-20th century has begun to blur the edges of the two great French
brandies, pushing Armagnac a little way towards its more famous cousin. The
Armagnacais who are implicated in the movement will tell you that there is
an historical justification for what they are doing, and they are correct.
On the other hand, they are referring to a period of history which predates
our century, and to spirits which few of us have been lucky enough to taste.
What is important is not how Armagnac was made in Victorian times but that
the motivation for change has been dictated by backroom accountants
demanding an earlier return on investment.
What, then, are the differences? They begin with the soil. The best in
Armagnac is the sand and clay of Bas Armagnac. Tenareze is a heavier blend
of chalk and clay, while Haut Armagnac makes the worst spirits on its wholly
chalk soils. In Cognac, chalk soils are considered the best.
To a large degree the vines are identical which make the thin, acidic wines
which distil to make great brandy. The dominant variety is Ugni Blanc or
Saint Emilion. In the past Folle Blanche used to be the best in both areas,
but this died out in Cognac before the second world war: only in Armagnac
does an appreciable amount survive. Four or five growers continue to make a
pure Folle Blanche Armagnac. In Armagnac there is also the Colombard grape
and the Baco. The hybrid Baco will have to go before 2010, but it has its
fans. Growers counter that it is only good because it is planted in the best
vineyards of Bas Armagnac.
The chief difference lies in distillation. Both started out with the
onion-shaped pot which distils in batches. At the turn of the century,
Armagnac went over to the column still, a cheaper, continuous process. When
the first legislation was introduced to govern spirit distillation in 1936,
there were no pot stills left in Armagnac. The law was amended in 1973 and
many distillers took the chance to install a battery of cognac-like pot
stills.
Spirit runs off a pot still at a higher degree of alcoholic strength than a
continuous still: 70 or more per cent, as opposed to as little as 52 per
cent from the column. The pot-still spirit is cleaner, with fewer
impurities. There is a disadvantage, however: you miss out on that powerful
aroma of prunes, incense, spices and wild mushrooms and make a spirit which
is neither Armagnac nor cognac, for pot-still Armagnacs rarely achieve any
distinction in old age.
Where the commercial incentive comes in is that pot still spirits are ready
to drink rather earlier than those made in a column still. You might market
a pleasant drink when it is only two or three years old, providing you add a
little cane sugar and caramel and stick it in a new oak barrel to give it a
nuance of vanilla. Almost all 'three-star' and many VSOP Armagnacs are made
in this way, and pot-still spirit will be found in varying proportions in
Armagnacs up to XO level. After that, deluxe and vintage Armagnac is
produced by the traditional, continuous still.
Even traditional Armagnacs age more quickly than cognac. It is hotter in
Gascony than in the Charentes and, throughout the summer months, distillers
often lodge casks in hot lofts where the spirit gains in strength. The
famous 'ranclo' character of old sherry, nuts, dried apricots and wild
mushrooms creeps in earlier in Armagnac, when the spirit is about 10. In
Cognac, you generally have to wait until it is over 25.
Wise blenders transfer their Armagnac from wood to glass demijohns after 30
years; otherwise, the woodiness becomes overpowering. This was demonstrated
by an 1888 Armagnac from the Bas-Armagnac firm of Samalens. Extract of
Armagnac, Pierre Samalens called it. It had been 80 years in cask.
Armagnac may sport a vintage date, a privilege denied to cognac. These
vintage Armagnacs are available readily although many of the houses prefer
their blends, which represent house styles as opposed to the caprices of the
weather. Pure column-still Armagnac does not come cheap.
The merchant house of Larressingle makes a nice spicy 'Tres vieil Tenareze'
at Pounds 25 from Balls Brothers (311 Cambridge Heath, London E2, tel:
071-739-1642). Samalens' prune and iris-scented Vieille relique will set you
back about Pounds 50 from Harrods (071-499-6292 for other stockists). The
slightly harder style of Tenareze is well represented by the Armagnacs of
Chateau Pomes Peberere.
Arthur Rackham and The Vintner shops sell the 1961 vintage at Pounds 52.99
but, if you baulk at that, there is a pure column-still VSOP at Pounds
18.89. For the more aromatic spirits of Bas Armagnac, the Domaine de Mouchac
1976 is made in a benchmark style (Pounds 50 from Lay and Wheeler of
Colchester (0206-577-272).
The very best Armagnac I have tasted this past year, however, is the Folle
Blanche from the Domaine de Boignieres with its delightful aromas of flowers
and apricots. It is just what Armagnac ought to be and worth every penny of
Pounds 70 from Bloomsbury Wine and Spirit (071-436-4763) or Harcourt Fine
Wine (071-723-7202).

FT  20 MAR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Getting to grips with the R-word - The world's
greatest white grape does not have to be sweet to be good, as Jancis
Robinson confirms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINE NAMES are full of pronunciation traps. Cos, Montrachet and Moet can all
sort out the Moutons from the lambs, but the most commonly mispronounced
name of all must be Riesling, which is 'Reece-ling' and not 'Rise-ling'.
This is all the more lamentable since Riesling is the greatest white wine
grape of all, lives for ever and, as demonstrated eloquently at recent
tastings held in Paris and London, and New York on Monday, does not have to
be sweet to be good.
The tastings could not be concurrent since they were the child of one brain,
whose owner was understandably keen to attend each one. Stuart Pigott is a
dedicatedly non-partisan wine writer in his early 30s who divides his time
between south London and Germany but sees his mission as sniffing out some
of the finest wines being made today, wherever they may be.
His particular speciality is Riesling, about which he has written four books
(two of them self-published guides to the best wines made in Germany in 1989
and 1990), and he has for years wanted to set up a blind comparison of the
finest Rieslings of the world.
The super-concentrated 1990 vintage at last provided him with an even
playing field for the Rieslings of Germany, Austria and Alsace in France.
And he had to choose the razor-sharp dry style of Riesling since that is
just about all Alsace produces. Germany and Austria used to make
predominantly sweet wines, and British and American wine merchants still
import little else, but within Austria and Germany there has been a
winemaking revolution, partly provoked by the 1985 diethylene glycol scandal
in which only sweet wines were implicated.
Thus, since about 1988, almost all regions of Germany and, in particular,
the cool and dramatic Wachau district of Austria make a wide range of fully
fermented, non-sweetened Rieslings in the racy style of Alsace (which style
has in any case been the only acceptable form of Riesling for many younger
British and American wine drinkers).
The Pigott tasting, held at the Gavroche with Riedel glasses as indications
of seriousness of intent, comprised six flights of wines (this collective
noun for once seeming appropriate, given the airborne quality of fine dry
Rieslings) of which a dozen came from each of Austria and Germany and 10
from Alsace.
'This tasting is in many ways the most impossible thing I've ever tried to
do, because of the impossible combination of political interests,' was his
somewhat devigorated comment on the machinations involved in persuading the
three generic promotional bodies concerned to underwrite such a potentially
damaging exercise.
In the event, what was extraordinary to me was the similarity in style
between the wines, yet the dissimilarity between that style and the
stereotypical description of Riesling. There was hardly a wine that could be
described as 'flowery', while Riesling, like any great grape variety, proved
itself as a vehicle for transmitting location. Virtually all of the
producers seemed to be trying to pack such concentrated and local character
into the bottle as possible, so that many were marked much more by a
distinctly mineral note, with explosive, but definitely dry fruit on the
palate. Lime, wet stones, gunsmoke, paprika, honey and even salami cropped
up in my tasting notes, and they were all beautifully balanced, except for
some very ripe wines in which the alcohol was just a bit too much for this
delicately transparent grape variety.
As has become customary at any serious blind comparative tasting (especially
one funded by the participants), we were urged at the beginning that this
was Not A Competition. But, as has also become customary, there was a show
of hands for favourite wines at the end.
The London favourite seemed to be an Austrian, a Durnsteiner Kellerberg
Smaragd from the Wachau magician F X Pichler, which had been second
favourite in Paris where, perhaps not surprisingly, an Alsace wine had been
favoured; Marcel Deiss's Schoenenburg (Pounds 22.50 from Lea &amp; Sandeman, see
below).
It is difficult to exaggerate how well a top quality dry Riesling goes with
food - far better than most Chardonnays which can be extremely blunt
instruments to apply to the palate and head at the start of a meal.
High acid plus relatively low alcohol, now minus sugar, should equal success
for this exciting new style of fine wine.
Where to buy dry Rieslings:
It is near impossible to find the lovely Wachau Rieslings outside Austria,
and the dry Rieslings so treasured by Germans are only slowly escaping that
country - although try Philip Eyres of Amersham (tel: 0494-433823), Gelston
Castle in Scotland (0556-3012), Oddbins and Summerlee Wines of Earls Barton
(0604-810488) for names such as Juliusspital, Koehler Ruprecht,
Lingenfelder, Muller Catoir.
Expatriated top quality dry Alsace Riesling is much easier to find. Adnams
of Southwold (0502-724222) sells Blanck wines; Lea &amp; Sandeman of London SW10
and W8 on (071-376- 4767) has Deiss; O W Loeb of London SE1 (071-928-7750)
has Faller, and Hugel; Morris &amp; Verdin of SW1 (071-630-8888) has Ostertag;
Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up has Zind-Humbrecht; and La Vigneronne of
London SW7 (071-589 6113) has a wide range of Alsace including Kreydenweiss.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Cookery: A quick bite along party lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH-SPEED, home-cooked alternatives to the ready-prepared meals of the high
street multiples - microwaved, trayed and cardboard-boxed - seem to have
struck a chord with readers, particularly those who are, in the words of
one, 'always in search of something as easy as pasta but more unusual and
more glamorous. In other words, dishes that are genuinely practicable for
mid-week dinners a deux and could even be used for a dinner party.'
So, here is my suggestion for an informal and relatively effortless mid-week
dinner party.
RED MULLET WITH PESTO (serves 4)
A first and main course rolled into one, this is served best in deep soup
plates, with forks for spearing the fish and vegetables and spoons for
supping up the broth. Salad, plus a handsome selection of cheeses and good
chocolate or sweetmeats with coffee, are all you will need afterwards.
Ingredients: Red mullet, cleaned, scaled and filleted (enough to yield 1-1
1/2 lb of fillets); 3-4 oz green beans; 2 oz small young spinach leaves; 2
leeks; 2-2 1/2 pt unsalted fish stock; a good pinch of saffron strands
pounded with mortar and pestle; a long curl of finely-pared orange peel; a
generous splash of Noilly Prat; 1 ciabatta loaf; 2 or 3 sprigs of basil;
home-made pesto (or Le Roi with a grating of Parmesan added).
Method: Remove any scales and bones the fishmonger may have missed and cut
the fillets across obliquely into generous bite-size pieces. Dust the skin -
but not the flesh of the fish - lightly with salt. Top and tail the beans
and cut the leeks into chunks. Slice the bread, toast it lightly, spread
with pesto, pile it on to a plate and keep hot.
Fast-boil the Noilly Prat until reduced by half. Add the fish stock, orange
peel and saffron and bring to the boil.
Drop the leeks and beans into the pan and cook them until just tender. Then
add the spinach and the finely-torn basil leaves: they will need little more
than a minute to wilt and heat through.
While the broth and vegetables are cooking, heat a well-seasoned frying pan
and dry-fry the fish (in two batches). First, cook it skin side down. After
about two minutes, when the skin is crisp and the flesh has begun to change
colour, turn it over and and fry it flesh side down for just a few seconds.
Remove and keep hot in a tureen while you cook the rest of the fish in the
same way.
Discard the orange peel and ladle the vegetables and broth over the red
mullet. Check seasoning and bring to table with the toast (the idea is to
eat the stew and nibble the toast on the side).
Then drop the remaining toast into the tureen so it soaks up the flavoursome
liquid and softens enough to cut with a spoon and sup with the broth.
PROCESSOR PESTO
I always used to make pesto by hand - aromatherapy par excellence if you
have the time for it - but I have decided that metal blades do not taint
basil as mortar and pestle addicts once led me to believe. The new
generation of Magimix machines contain a miniature inner bowl which is ideal
for making pesto. A labour of love has been reduced to an unlovely but
efficient one-minute task.
Ingredients: A handful of fresh basil (ie, 2 little supermarket bunches);
1-2 garlic cloves; 1 well-rounded tablespoon pine nuts or flaked almonds;
scant 2 tablespoons freshly-grated Parmesan cheese; 2-3 tablespoons extra
virgin olive oil.
Method: Strip the basil leaves from the stalks and put them into the
mini-bowl of a food processor. Chop the garlic and crush it with a good
pinch of salt. Add it to the bowl and whizz briefly. Add the nuts and cheese
and process again until the ingredients are all chopped finely and well
mixed.
Finally, add enough oil to make a creamy puree-like paste, adding it slowly
through the funnel while the machine is running. Check seasoning and serve.

selling traditionally reared meats (fresh, cured and recipe products) by
special overnight delivery nationwide. Now she has come up with a natural
extension to that range, 'home-made' stocks. Rich pork jelly stock is
already available, with lamb and beef stock to follow shortly. She
recommends refrigerating the stock on receipt for no longer than two days or
freezing it for up to three months - if you can resist tucking in that long.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Fashion: Why design is not simply black and white . . . -
Working clothes arouse some trenchant opinions, as Paul Keers discovers /
Dressing for the Professions: The Architect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL KEERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSIONS can reflect their professional concerns in their clothes quite
as much as architects. Form, materials, colour, style - all are criteria by
which you would judge an architect's work. And all may be displayed in an
architect's dress.
As a client, you may be hiring an architect for a multi-million pound
construction project. That will lead you to seek the kind of traditional
professional values, such as financial responsibility, normally associated
with suits and ties. But you are also looking for someone with creative
vision and the originality that often goes along with flamboyant,
unconventional dress.
The ideal architect strikes a balance between the images of professional
responsibility and creative flair. And, according to architect, designer and
lecturer Eva Jiricna, that is exactly what architects traditionally
reflected in their dress.
'At the beginning of the century,' she explains, 'all architects dressed up
formally, but usually with a flamboyant gesture to it. There was always a
hat, a bow-tie or a handkerchief to make their appearance a little bit
artistic. After the first world war, American architects remained very
formal. And they still dress almost like bankers, in order to impress
people, because architecture in America is very much a business.'
The grandest masters of post-war architecture can indeed be mistaken for
bankers. International figures such as the American Philip Johnson, and the
Oriental American I M Pei, are debonair, distinguished dressers. Both are
traditionally formal, in dark suits with pocket handkerchiefs, white shirts
with discreet cufflinks, and sombre ties.
And both wear perfectly round spectacles, echoing the modernist hero Le
Corbusier. To an architect, visual details like this must have a philosophy.
'I had my glasses custom-made 40 years ago,' Johnson once explained,
'because to me, glasses are round. It came from the Machine Aesthetic.'
American architects remain essentially formal dressers, with the colourful
quirks of the post-modernists reflected in details, like a pink bow-tie or a
coloured shirt. 'But in Europe, Jiricna explains, 'architects abandoned this
distinguished approach, and started dressing down almost.'
This dressing down takes two forms. One reflects the intellectual's disdain
for dress. This is the deliberate shabby chic, the crumpled cords and
battered jackets of academic style, as displayed by the late James Stirling.
The other is a deliberate rejection of tradition in favour of modernity,
comfort and function. That style is epitomised by high-tech architects such
as Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. Foster is frequently seen as a
representative of the new relaxed style of professional dressing. He often
works in a crewneck sweater, or a polo shirt; but a stainless steel Rolex
still suggests both his professional status and his respect for engineering
excellence.
Eva Jiricna's dress similarly reflects her designs. It is deliberately
functional and, coincidentally, a colour match for her most famous work. 'My
wardrobe tends to revolve around black and white, and people think that was
the Joseph influence,' she says. (Eva Jiricna designed the monochrome
high-tech interiors for designer Joseph's various fashion stores and
restaurants). 'But in fact, it is a question of time.
'When I was working for other people, if I bought a blue bag, I had the time
to find a pair of matching blue shoes. But when I set up my own practice, I
simply did not have the time, and my black and white wardrobe was a personal
excuse to avoid shopping. I could just stretch out my arm and grab another
black jacket.
'It makes dressing so easy. I have black jackets, white T-shirts and shirts,
and black trousers, leggings and skirts, in different textures and weights.
Then I might add socks or a handkerchief in pink, blue or orange, to make it
more cheerful if appropriate.'
John Pawson is another architect whose dress reflects his professional
concerns. He is famous for his bare, almost furniture-less, flats and cool
Japanese restaurants. His work pushes the architectural dictum 'less is
more' to the extreme. Pawson favours plain, dark suits and shirts without
ties, with clean, uncluttered lines and no decorations. It is a contemporary
look associated with Japanese labels such as Comme des Garcons.
But Pawson is reluctant to adopt the minimalist tag usually applied to his
work for his personal style. 'How about restrained? Simple? Calm?' he
suggests.
With architects such as Pawson and Jiricna, it seems that stylistically,
what you see is what you get. Jiricna agrees. 'It's inevitable that when you
are constantly surrounded by problems of an aesthetic nature, then
everything becomes based on your attitudes to the aesthetic. Subconsciously,
you are bound to look at things from that same angle, which is going to be
reflected in what you wear.'
But that is not always the case. The radical glass pyramid in front of the
Louvre was designed by the traditionally dressed I M Pei. And the biography
of Richard Rogers recalls how, in 1977, he was invited to the initial
briefings by Lloyd's for its new building. 'Rogers - aware not only that the
client was rather different from the experimentally inclined French
government of 1971 but also that times had changed - bought a grey Yves St
Laurent suit for the occasion and borrowed a tie.'
That is the kind of compromise which is unacceptable to Ian Pollard. This
year, Pollard was the only architect among Esquire magazine's ten
best-dressed men for 1993. Photographed in his habitual straight leather
riding boots from Manolo Blahnik, and the shoulder-length hair which has not
been cut for more than 20 years, he declared: 'I dress the way I want to
dress. If that doesn't conform to accepted codes, that's too bad.'
His dress signals his uncompromising approach. This, after all, is a man
whose professional wardrobe has featured a wolfskin coat, bootlace ties,
decorated Kansai jackets and black jodhpurs. He said in one interview: 'If I
was very straight in a grey suit, presenting a grey personality, it would be
cheating myself. A grey suit would mean I was prepared to fit in with
anything they wanted. They can forget it.'
Clearly, Pollard's dress gives an indication of both his professional
attitude and his architectural style 'Eclectic, I suppose]' he laughs. And
Pollard is scathing about the dress of colleagues today.
'It's really a profession in which a bow-tie is considered racy. Architects
want to look like the clients they want to get. Invariably, that client, as
far as big projects are concerned, is a corporate client. To a corporate
client, anyone who doesn't dress like another corporate man is persona non
grata, and his thought processes are considered questionable.
'A corporate client cannot identify with anyone who does not fit the
categories with which he is familiar. So the architect tries to present
himself as the corporate man the client is looking for. It's a sad
reflection, the kind of architect's compromise which means we also end up
with bland, compromised buildings.'
That is a view which Eva Jiricna rejects. 'I do believe in the word
'appropriate',' she explains. 'Part of my work involves producing modern
designs which fit the limits of acceptance of traditional clients, and I
would reflect that by wearing a skirt rather than trousers if it was
appropriate.'
To many observers, architects are the best-dressed of all professionals,
combining individual freedom with an inherent sense of style. Eva Jiricna
says she is struck by the style of the architectural students. 'The girls in
particular are tremendously inventive and smart, as opposed to student
chemists, who are remarkably uninteresting.'
Ian Pollard remains unconvinced. 'Of course, if you're concerned about the
design of buildings, you should be concerned about the design of everything
else. But if you measure architects' dress on a scale of 0 to 100, they only
manage to get it up to 7 or 8.
'You'll find as many grey suits in architecture as in any other profession.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / How to Spend It: Designer gear by mail order - Quality
catalogue clothes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONVENTIONAL wisdom in mail-order land has it that while it is relatively
easy to sell shirts and cotton chinos, tracksuits and T-shirts through the
post, selling high-priced designer ranges is another thing altogether.
Patricia and Andrew Davidson thought otherwise. They had a hunch - they
could not afford a catalogue and market research, so they had to rely on
instinct - that there were many women who either hated shopping or did not
have the time who longed for easy ways of buying quality clothes. Women
living far from decent shops, women with busy careers and those who live
abroad were all seen as potential mail-order customers.
With nothing but Andrew's business expertise, Patricia's eye for stylish
clothes and a modest amount of capital they have now launched a beautifully
photographed catalogue. Its most distinctive quality perhaps is that it is
small.
The collection is centred round three main designers - Caroline Charles Paul
Costello and Amanda Wakeley - but there is also a range of accessories from
Anya Hindmarch (handbags, some classic, some witty) and Butler &amp; Wilson.
These names are not new but they were not always easy to track down. Now
their wares can reach homes all over the UK as well as abroad.
The Davidsons' hunch that there was a mail-order market for quality designer
clothing looks to be proved right. It will never be mass-market, but as
niches go it seems to be doing well. Launched last week, some 3,500
catalogues have been sent out and orders are pouring in. At least three
people have ordered more than Pounds 1,000 worth of clothing each.
Do not expect to buy more cheaply than you would in the shops - 'the point
is not price but accessibility,' says Andrew Davidson. Quality and ease of
shopping are what it is all about.
Paul Costello's pure silk 'toile du jouy' tea dress, for instance, is a more
grown-up version of all the flower-sprigged numbers wafting into the shops.
At Pounds 195 it seems good value, if not cheap. His dark navy fine wool
double-breasted blazer is also well-priced at Pounds 230 but cannot begin to
compete with Marks and Spencer on price terms. Amanda Wakeley's fine wool
sweaters with satin cuffs may seem expensive at Pounds 220 but they do offer
that magic combination of being classic and distinctive.
For this catalogue most of the designers' clothes come from mainstream
collections but in the pipeline for the autumn are more exclusive ranges,
including some sassy cocktail dresses and evening suits from David Sassoon
of Belville Sassoon.
If you are interested in the spring/summer range you can order the catalogue
by post or by phone: Kingshill, Little Kingshill Grange, Great Missenden,
Buckinghamshire HP16 0DZ. Tel: 0494-890555. It costs Pounds 3.50 (refundable
on the first purchase) plus Pounds 1 p&amp;p.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Knives for the pure in heart: David Sexton risks opprobrium
to seek out the best in blades for strictly peaceful uses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SEXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAYING YOU like knives invites opprobrium, especially since more young
people are carrying them for criminal purposes. Outside my house, I once
overheard a boy exclaim to his friends that he had to go back home for a
minute. Had he forgotten to lock up? Had he left his rail ticket behind? No.
'I forgot me blade,' he explained to his sympathetic mates.
But are there no reasonable grounds for taking pleasure in a well-designed
pocket knife? If not, it is a pity. For they combine form and function in a
thoroughly satisfying way. They are useful for picnics, for sharpening
pencils, for opening parcels.
The best-known example is the Swiss army pen-knife. Top chef Raymond Blanc
chose one as his luxury item on the BBC radio programme Desert Island Discs.
He actually owns a red one, which he was given by his eldest son several
years ago; he uses it for such diverse things as cutting branches and
opening bottles. 'It's a comfortable companion,' he says.
These are the only pocket knives sold by Harrods, the London department
store - for reasons of safety, or tact? - and they are available in a huge
range under such names as Spartan, Camper, Climber, Huntsman and Explorer.
Buck &amp; Ryan, the splendid ironmonger in central London, also has them at
competitive prices and they are sold, too, in such fancier places as
designer Paul Smith in Covent Garden.
Victorinox, a Swiss family firm, has been making them ever since winning a
contract to supply the Swiss army in the 1890s. The quality of the
workmanship is excellent. Yet, as knives, their aesthetic qualities are nil,
even for those with only a few extra functions. Those with dozens of
appendages - the thick SwissChamp has more than 30 - are positively
grotesque. Nor do the stainless steel blades take a good edge.
The other most fashionable pocket knife is Opinel. Of a similar antiquity,
these knives also are alpine in origin and they are impressively functional.
The handle is wood, the curved blade high-carbon steel. A simple but
effective safety ring twists round to lock the blade in position. Closed, it
does not quite disappear into the pleasingly shaped handle; extended, it
makes a nice line with the wood. The knife is very light and has a
pleasantly rustic quality.
Opinel knives come in many sizes and they are cheap. They werepopular in
France before Britain, and some fancy versions have been devised. You can
buy them with stainless steel blades (shinier but blunter) and stained wood
handles (pretty in green, red, yellow or blue). Prices range from Pounds 3-4
up to around Pounds 12. Again, Buck &amp; Ryan has a full range, or you can get
them from Oggetti, Conran or Authentics.
Both Victorinox and Opinel are distributed widely. Beyond this, though, it
gets more difficult to find good knives. Conran sells a number of small,
ugly specimens from Japan, all shiny metal ('vanadium stainless steel') at
Pounds 19.95. Knives, needing to fit the hand, do not work well to a
modernist machine aesthetic.
Far and away the best modern knife is Puma, based in Solingen, Germany. .
These are made from quality steels tested to a high degree of hardness; the
designs are at once wholly functional and elegant. Some use 'Sambar
staghorn' or 'Rio-jacaranda hardwood' for the handles, but the most
attractive are actually those made of a tough plastic called Micarta.
The basic Puma knife, with this handle and a rear-locking mechanism, looks
neat folded in on itself. Opened, it has a sinuous line from handle to
blade. It feels entirely solid: you could split a lobster on the beach
without difficulty, or skin a bird.
To some eyes, its plain lines make it look disturbingly like a weapon rather
than a tool. To others, it is a thing of beauty. Puma knives, ranging in
price from Pounds 40-50, are available from Authentics in Covent Garden,
London.
Authentics also sells the prettiest of all knives, the Laguiole, a
traditional French shepherd's knife still made in the beautiful Aubrac
mountains of the Aveyron. They have a handle of horn made into a thin,
elegantly undulating shape and riveted on to brass, which seems to wrap
around the pointed blade.
Opened, this is much wider than the handle, which obviously exists only to
support it. On the better versions (usually numbered individually), the
steel back of the handle is chased with a foliage design and capped with a
bee. There is no actual lock, but the blade snaps crisply into place and
feels quite safe for the fingers.
Laguiole knives are found easily in France but are hard to track down here
in the UK. Conran seems to sell one but, on inspection, this 'Larguiole'
knife (Pounds 21.75) does not fold, and has a wooden handle and no edge. It
turns out to be a paper knife.
Max Pike's Bathroom Shop in central London sells two sizes: a 9 cm horn
version with a single blade for Pounds 37.50, and an 11 cm specimen (with a
blade, a corkscrew and a spike for loosening knots, prising open tops,
cleaning a horse's hoof or a myriad other tasks) for Pounds 69. Both prices
include mail order.
Authentics has sold out of Laguiole knives but expects to get a new delivery
in three to four weeks at prices from about Pounds 10 up to about Pounds 35.
It is worth examining each one individually. Unlike Puma knives, which are
machine-made and perfect, these have the feel of a craftsman's work, good or
bad.
Philippe Starck has produced a kind of trendy dolt's version of the
Laguiole, made smoothly all over in stainless steel but keeping the shape
(Pounds 99 from Authentics). It is a homage of a sort. In France, pocket
knives are remarkably fashionable. They decorate the pages of all the better
women's and decor magazines. That they are seen in the UK mainly as
offensive weapons is just another of the ways in which the yobbishness of
our popular culture impoverishes us all.

FT  20 MAR 93 / End of the lode for gold thieves: A British geologist in
Australia has found a way to 'fingerprint' the metal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD thief could not believe his bad luck. Like nearly everyone else in
the business, he was convinced that the origins of what he had stolen were
untraceable once identification marks had been removed.
Yet, the expert prosecution witness was telling the court, with uncanny
accuracy, how the thief had gone about disguising them.
The witness said the metal had been melted and some 18-carat scrap gold
added before it was melted again. He even identified the mine from which the
gold had been taken. The accused man was so astounded that he changed his
plea to guilty - and then admitted he had indeed done everything claimed.
Dr John Watling, the expert witness, was so elated that he almost asked the
judge to let the thief go free. For the case was a crucial step in
establishing that gold 'finger-printing' really does work.
This technological breakthrough affects not just gold thieves: it will make
life much more difficult for fraudsters and drug barons the world over.
Before long, Watling's work will result in much of the world's gold being
finger-printed so that its origins can be pinpointed with certainty. In this
way, it will cease to be an untraceable international currency.
This will, for example, make laundering drug receipts more difficult. One
way in which drug rings move their money into the mainstream banking system
is to buy gold-mining land, or even old mines.
Stolen gold is bought with the illicit cash and is then mixed with dirt and
possibly some metal from the mine or mining area. The metal then goes to a
refinery, which has no way of knowing it is not newly-mined gold. When it
leaves there, it has become 'legal.'
Watling's system also will help to prove that mines have been 'salted,' a
confidence trick as old as the industry itself.
Watling, 42, is a British geologist and geo-chemist born at Helsden, near
Norwich. Educated at Imperial College, London, he has for the past two years
been in charge of the West Australian government's minerals science
laboratory in Perth. He started work on his finger-printing theory about 10
years ago when it occurred to him that the 70-80 elements in gold might be
brought together in a unique way whenever a specific deposit was formed.
It was only a short step from proving the theory to finding a practical
application. That came when he gave evidence in a case where the accused
claimed that gold in his possession came from South Africa. Watling showed
that it actually originated from a West Australian field.
How? Because, said Watling, South African gold has significant
concentrations of palladium, ruthenium, platinum, osmium and iridium;
Australian gold has none of these.
Watling needs only a very small trace of gold for his work. The sample is
cut by a laser linked with a plasma-mass spectrometer; this identifies the
trace elements present. The technique is similar to to traditional human
finger-printing in that a jury can simply be shown patterns on sheets of
paper to compare one gold sample with another.
Watling says the first case to use gold finger-printing was the most
difficult because his team had to go to great lengths to get the details
absolutely right. Today, defence lawyers in Western Australia no longer
question the validity of the technique, which has been used in 17 gold theft
cases. This is particularly important in a state where it is estimated that
at least 2 per cent of the gold mined is stolen - an annual loss worth about
ADollars 2.5bn.
Part of the reason for this is that, in the West Australian fields, stealing
gold is not considered a particularly serious crime. This attitude dates
back to the days when miners were paid a pittance for working underground in
difficult and dangerous conditions. When, occasionally, a miner found a gold
nugget among the ore, the temptation to pocket it often was irresistible.
Today, most of Western Australia's gold is spread in invisible specks
through the ore which is dug from open pits by construction equipment and
put through a chemical recovery process. Accidents are rare and pay is
reasonable.
But every one of the 29 pubs in Kalgoorlie, the town at the heart of the
state's eastern goldfields, still has its 'gold buyer' - someone willing to
give cash for the metal with no questions asked. And while it is unusual to
find a nugget, the new technology used in the goldfields does not deter
determined thieves.
A wire wool pad suspended discretely in a mine's carbon-in-leach tank will
collect about two troy ounces of gold a day, worth nearly ADollars 900.
Thieves take gold-impregnated carbon and use oxy-acetylene equipment to burn
away the charcoal to get at the gold.
They even take the so-called pregnant solution - a mixture of water, cyanide
and gold - and set up their own processing operations to extract the gold.
To combat all this, the West Australian Gold Producers' Association, working
through the Chamber of Mines and Energy, uses the services of the
Kalgoorlie-based Gold Stealing Detection Unit. This is part of the state's
police force but is hired out to the private sector. Its present head, Det
Senior Sgt Darryl Lockhart, says that unless it is obvious a gold theft case
can be resolved quickly in court, all samples and exhibits go to Watling's
laboratory for testing. 'It is an invaluable tool for us,' he adds.
So far, Watling has finger-printed 60 mines and 40 bullion samples from
Western Australia and is now finger-printing more than 200 samples from
South Africa and Russia. He and some colleagues are soon to publish a paper
making the technique available to other scientists.

FT  20 MAR 93 / As they say in Europe: Italian comic opera and Russian
world-weariness - How others view their budget problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY YEAR in Sicily there is an event which outsiders find, to say the
least, unattractive. Tuna fish are driven ashore through a complex system of
nets and then bludgeoned to death. It is la mattanza, and now the word has
been recycled by the Italian press to describe the present, rather
attractive, settling of accounts with a corrupt political class.
In Russia the mattanza is quite different. There a single figure, widely
seen as a symbol of righteousness, is slowly bludgeoned to death by the
remnants of a corrupt political class. Pravda represents the Remnant Party
and has its own point of view, arguing 'the conflict had flared up between
the president and society' (my italics).
Moscow watchers spend little time on Pravda nowadays, far less than when it
was boring. Today it combines anti-Yeltsinism with 19th century xenophobic
pan-Slavism and Bolshevik nostalgia, and, as a result, offers stimulating
and exciting insights. It recently argued that the Americans were plotting
to keep Russia out of international arms markets: 'They will start promising
us 'tips' such as the notorious Dollars 24bn, (the western aid package
agreed last year) and on this pretext will press the foreign ministry to
block impending Russian weapons sales where western corporations have key
interests.'
Pravda also says that the west is trying to split Russia, so it fabricates
lies about 'a reforming president against a conservative-communist
congress.' Next the west will back the imposition of a state of emergency by
Boris Yeltsin.
But to return to the original theme - is it the parallels or differences
between Russia and Italy that are the more striking? In both, people believe
that their country is on the point of breaking up. In both there is, not
surprisingly, a widespread conviction that the native way of doing things is
far from ideal. On the other hand the Italians take their present
difficulties to their hearts, they glory in the parade of public figures
through the prisons and courts and revel in the revelations, as it were. No
Italian would blame foreigners for what has gone wrong.
Some Russians, on the other hand, do blame others but seem to take the
crisis in their stride: the papers write as if hyper-inflation, the collapse
of the state, the break-up of the nation, the impossibility of achieving
good government, were the norm. To the Italians, 1993 is opera, grand or
comic. To the Russians, it is a bore.
But both at least make headlines in the newspapers of the rest of the
continent which in turn react passionately. Thus the Catholic Daily in
Poland, which would normally object to Russians of the Yeltsin type, sees
him as a Christ-figure: 'The west contributed to the shower of stones that
poured on the Russian president's head.'
The Germans sneer heavily at the Italians. But every country in Europe, not
just Italy and Russia, is in trouble, yet these two interest newspapers
across the continent which are otherwise more than usually insular.
One of those troubled lands, Britain, suffered its annual budget this week
and so there was the usual outpouring of words in the local media that no
event short of civil war could occasion on the domestic news pages of other
lands. The French were struck by two items, one reflected the widening
psychological gulf between Britain and the rest, the other the shrinking
physical gulf. They pointed out that when the time comes to implement the
third stage of European Monetary Union, the British budget deficit will
still amount to 6 per cent of gross domestic output - double the Maastricht
Treaty target. This insight was not picked up in Britain because there the
Treaty is taken seriously only in parliament, which is a way of saying it is
not taken seriously.
Norman Lamont's plan to cut journey times from Dover and Heathrow to central
London was the other issue for the French. Their reaction was reassuring -
the proposed high-speed rail links were seen as a means of getting to the
British capital more quickly. Recent French comment has stressed the
desirability of travelling rapidly in the opposite direction.
Less interesting, but far more important, than Lamont's budget was the
conclusion of the German Solidarity Pact at the weekend - or Bonnspeak for
higher taxes in the west to pay off the Ossies. This was an event of
Europe-wide significance which therefore occupied little space in the
British media. But what is striking about all recent budgets, proposed
budgets, Solidarity Pacts and whatever is the view that higher taxation
provides a solution to current problems. Except in Russia and Italy. In both
these countries the forces of common sense and rationality demand spending
cuts.
Why is it that the sanity of the 1980s is thought relevant only in those
countries which have gone mad?

FT  20 MAR 93 / Gardening: Now's the time to chop up a border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S amazingly warm weather has sent gardeners back to their
flowerbeds, looking for damage, checking for early blooms and planning for
the seasonal's replacements.
By now, we all have flowers on the primroses; the buds are open on
magnolias; and there is an uneasy sense that the world is six weeks ahead of
itself. Myself, I have a mass of dead dianthus and some nasty patches in
other parts which hate the wet winter: what should be done now to bring
borders up to the mark?
The first tip is often forgotten: since wet winters wash goodness out of the
soil, you must now put it back. Late March is the time for a general garden
fertiliser and, by habit, I usually choose Growmore. Half-hearted gardeners
probably shirk this expense because they think the money might be wasted,
but I know from experience that it is essential.
Nowadays, there is a great fashion among the uninitiated for concentrated,
super-charged fertilisers, of which the most popular seems to be 6-X. These
brands have their uses, but users tend to believe they are like oats to a
racehorse: the more you feed, the faster the plant will travel. The opposite
is true.
If you double the dose, you will do much more harm than good. Concentrated
fertilisers really must be applied at the strength set out on the packet. As
a general garden dressing, a balanced chemical compound is preferable at
this time of the year.
The second tip is topical and, for once, saves money. If you have gaps,
begin by dividing good plants which you own already.
The next fortnight is an ideal time for division and the task is extremely
simple. Dig up an established clump; put it on a hard surface; decide how
many bits you want, remembering how small a piece now is from most
nurseries; then, slice straight through a mat of main roots with a sharp
blow from a spade.
Plants with a single main root or a wooded main stem are unsuitable
candidates for division: leave lupins or poppies well alone. It is also too
late now to split border irises and expect them to flower: delay your attack
here until early July. There are plenty of alternatives which you can
multiply by aiming straight.
My favourite victims are hardy geraniums, especially the admirable Johnsons
Blue; the one exception is the rare eriostemon, which seems to take years to
recover from this treatment.
I am also pleasantly surprised at the ease with which herbaceous clematis,
especially the handsome blue Wyevale form, will split into willing
fragments. Pieces may look woody and miserable, but they soon grow away like
mad.
As most plants now cost Pounds 2 or more apiece, it pays to strike out with
a spade this weekend. Phloxes, day lilies, campanulas, hostas, agapanthus,
lychnis, and even the lemon-yellow anthemis with its daisy flowers - all are
plants which respond well to a short, sharp slice.
Michaelmas daisies, too, are wonderful splitters and one of the best, the
pale-blue Aster frikartii, is actually improved by the experience. Always
use the outer bits of the clump as they are younger and more vigorous.
These daisies can be as tough as telephone directories to would-be rippers,
though. The books suggest that you use two forks driven back to back through
the middle of the plant so that they can then be teased outwards, pulling it
to pieces. I find this trick is rather hard to carry out and I much prefer
to use two spades, driving them into the centre like tomahawks, one after
the other.
The great advantage of splitting is that you pay nothing and can choose your
own size of plant. Alternatively, you can buy something new from a garden
centre, but you need to be vigilant at this time of the year. From March
onwards, growers are potting their smaller stock into bigger containers,
filled with peat. Until it has grown away, you might be deceived by the size
of the pot and end up with a much smaller plant at a much bigger price,
paying for peat rather than roots.
If you do have a genuine choice, it is more economical to buy a big single
of anything which you can split. All week, I have been enjoying the dozen
double-flowered primroses which I split from a single parent last spring, as
soon as I bought it. Individual plants would have been much more expensive
and, by now, no better.
Lastly, what do you do where you have a failure in the middle to back of a
border and need height quickly? The white-flowered lavatera Barnsley will
certainly grow and fill the space, but it soon luxuriates too much and is
too leafy for formal company. Personally, I prefer a trick which you can see
in excellent evidence in the terrace borders at Powis Castle.
Buy a tripod of three tall bamboo canes, fixing them together with wire.
Wrap some wire netting round this framework and plant one or two clematis on
either side of this tall support. If fed properly, these will race away and
flower up to a height of 5-6 ft later in the summer.
Some of the best forms, including Perle d'Azure, are too vigorous for this
position but I have had excellent results from white Henryi and the lovely,
dark red Mme Eduard Andre, both of which seem to be available widely for
impulse buyers this month.
If the winter has caught you out, use your ingenuity and try this type of
replacement. It might even be an improvement.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Menu which caters for all tastes
 -The Budget and Small Businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a rare chancellor who can devise a Budget which satisfies the demands
of small businesses. Keeping such a diverse group of business owners happy
is a difficult task.
It is, therefore, no small tribute to Norman Lamont that the menu served up
on Tuesday drew almost unanimous approval from small business organisations.
The one-person start-up, the established growing business and the
entrepreneur on the verge of selling up - all were catered for.
In their enthusiasm, they seemed willing to forget that nothing was done to
introduce more generous investment allowances, reduce the impact of
inheritance tax or to replace the business expansion scheme, to expire in
December.
They did get a carefully chosen mix of measures intended to simplify the tax
system, reduce red tape and improve the workings of small business
programmes. Some scepticism remains as to whether all these objectives will
be achieved, but at least the intention is there.
Few subjects raise temperatures among the small business community more than
VAT, and the chancellor responded to this. Lamont reduced the qualifying
period for bad debt relief from 12 to six months. He also increased the
turnover ceiling for cash accounting - the threshold below which businesses
do not have to pay VAT until they have received payment from customers -
Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 350,000. These changes will give business a one-off
saving of Pounds 150m.
Other VAT moves will allow the business owner to sleep more easily at night.
The draconian nature of the penalties which can be imposed by Customs &amp;
Excise has been a source of serious concern.
The chancellor has proposed reforming the application of the serious
misdeclaration penalty so that it is used only against larger, persistent
offenders. He will also allow Customs some discretion. Previously, the
penalties were automatic and did not take into account the circumstances of
the case.
However, the chancellor was unable to raise the VAT threshold by more than
the rate of inflation, to Pounds 37,600. Last year, he persuaded the
European Commission to allow an increase in excess of inflation.
Deregulation is in favour with ministers and several measures were intended
to achieve this. Debate about removing the small firms' audit has continued
for more than a decade, but there are signs that action finally will be
taken. A discussion paper is to be produced by the department of trade and
industry and it seems likely that businesses below the VAT threshold will be
let off the audit hook.
A desire to deregulate and simplify also lies behind plans to allow 8m
self-employed and other tax-payers to calculate their own returns for the
Inland Revenue. The aim is to reduce the amount of to-ing and fro-ing
between the taxpayer and the taxman but cut out estimated assessments,
appeals, postponements and revised assessments.
Under the new system, which will not take effect until the 1996-97 tax year,
most tax returns will be accepted by the Revenue - but it will have the
right to check them if it has doubts. Taxpayers who are late with their
returns or their payments will face extra charges.
Taxpayers will pay tax on the current year rather than on previous years,
removing the cash flow advantages. The response from business has been
mixed. Some wonder if the self-employed really will feel confident enough to
dispense with a tax adviser and compile their own returns.
The uniform business rate has imposed a heavy burden on traders,
particularly retailers in the south of England, and there have been pleas
for an easing of its impact. The chancellor went some way to meeting these
by agreeing to hold the rate of increase at the level of inflation for the
second year running. No business will face an increase of more than 3.6 per
cent.
The loan guarantee scheme has always been regarded as a poor substitute for
the more generous cheap loan packages available to small businesses in
Germany but it has provided a life-line to many small firms which do not
meet the banks' definition of a backable proposition.
The easing of the scheme's terms announced by Lamont should make it more
attractive, but this will continue to depend on the willingness of the
individual bank manager to put it to use. The present premium of 2 1/2 per
cent will be cut to 1 1/2 per cent for variable loans and only 0.5 per cent
for fixed-rate loans. The maximum eligible loan will rise by Pounds 100,000
to Pounds 250,000, while the proportion covered by the guarantee will rise
from 70 to 85 per cent.
The loan guarantee scheme tends to be used by businesses which are expanding
but, for entrepreneurs at the other end of the business life cycle, the
chancellor also had good news. Many feel locked into their business because
of the high level of capital gains tax triggered when they sell. In response
to lobbying from the venture capital industry, Lamont has agreed to allow
roll-over relief so long as the proceeds of selling a business are
re-invested in another unquoted company.
'A clever Budget in a difficult economic climate' was the general view of
small firms' lobbyists.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Alarm over freeze on earnings cap -
Pensions / The Budget and You / Industry sees it as the 'thin end of the
wedge'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A THROWAWAY line during his Budget speech, chancellor Norman Lamont
announced casually that the earnings cap on pensionable income would be
frozen next year, a tribute to the government's efforts in subduing
inflation.
No sooner were the words out of his mouth, however, than the pensions
industry sounded the alarm.
'This is potentially a pernicious trend,' said Tina Norris, of actuarial
consultant Noble Lowndes. 'The industry had originally wanted the cap to
rise in line with earnings. Instead, it is rising in line with prices, which
do not increase as quickly.'
The fact that it has been frozen for a year has significant ramifications,
both for occupational and personal pension-holders. The cap is critical
because it is the ceiling beyond which earnings cannot count for pensions
purposes and still attract tax relief on contributions.
For most people, the present 1992-93 fiscal year cap of Pounds 75,000 sounds
like a sufficiently healthy salary; and the anticipated Pounds 77,400
salary, which would have come into effect in the 1993-94 tax year had the
freeze not been imposed, seems healthier still - although those earning
close to the national average may well wonder why those on such handsome pay
even deserve tax incentives to help them make pension provision.
'It's the fat-cat syndrome,' said the finance director at one of the UK's
largest pension schemes. 'For most of the country, it doesn't matter
tuppence.'
With that comment in mind, it is not surprising that complaints about the
earnings cap have come mostly from high-earning executives and those who
organise schemes on their behalf.
But Ron Amy, pension and benefits manager at Grand Metropolitan and
chairman-elect of the National Association of Pension Funds, points out that
a dangerous trend is underway. 'It's the thin end of the wedge,' he said.
When the earnings cap was set originally, the ceiling was Pounds 60,000.
Through retail price inflation, it has risen steadily over the past decade.
But salaries have, historically, risen 1.5 to two percentage points faster
each year than prices.
As a result, what is considered a very generous salary now might not be so
in 20 or 30 years when many pension scheme members are ready to retire. The
cap could soon capture people on relatively modest incomes, Amy said.
He added: 'Labour unions are starting to notice that a relatively young guy
in his 20s now could well fall outside the cap by the time he retires.'
That is not to say that well-paid people now are denied pension provision -
expressed typically as a percentage of final salary - for income earned
above the cap. They are simply not entitled to tax relief on contributions
towards it.
As a result, employers have set up so-called unapproved schemes. These do
not have approval from the Inland Revenue and are, typically, unfunded.
This means that no contributions are made into a pool: employers simply
promise to meet pension costs above the cap out of current earnings. 'These
offer a lot less security than funded schemes,' Amy notes.
But pension experts point out the irony of the government's desire to cut
tax incentives for pension provision at a time when it is looking at ways to
encourage people to make greater provision for their own retirement. The cap
affects personal pension-holders as well as occupational schemes.
Personal pension-holders may earn tax relief on contributions on a sliding
scale up to the cap, beginning at 17 per cent of salary for a person in his
20s and moving to 40 per cent for someone aged 61 and over.
While only a small percentage of the population is likely to be able to
devote 40 per cent of salary to pension savings, the ceiling could act as a
deterrent - say, to a self-employed individual who had neglected to make
pension provision early on in his career.

OVER THE past three years I have made a substantial loss on investment bonds
made with a life company, but gains on my own share portfolio. Can one be
offset against the other for CGT purposes?
We take it that, in your first sentence, you mean that you have surrendered
single-premium life policies for less than the premium which you paid in
each case. That being so, the answer is no (by virtue of sections 210(2) and
16(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992).

I BOUGHT 10,000 Bradford and Bingley 11 5/8 Pibs on December 8. The interest
dates are January 20 and July 20. The total price included purchase of 141
days' interest at Pounds 449.07 (ie, gross of any tax).
I received my interest payment on January 20: Pounds 435.94 (net of 25 per
cent tax). I might have to pay higher-rate tax on the interest as well. How
do I claim tax relief on the Pounds 449.07 in the original total purchase
price?
It can be claimed in your next tax return. Ask your tax office for the
pamphlet on the accrued-income scheme: IR68.

IS THE guarantee covering 90 per cent of the first Pounds 40,000 of a
married couple's joint account with a building society the total guarantee?
Are other investments with the same society included in that total, such as
guaranteed equity bonds, Pibs and Tessas? Therefore, should one limit one's
total investment with each society to Pounds 40,000?
The protection afforded by the Building Societies Act relates to all the
investment of each person in the same society, so that the limit of Pounds
40,000 for joint investors would apply to the totality of their investments,
whatever their nature.

I HAVE BEEN told that one should not re-let property under an assured

This is incorrect. Section 20 (4) of the Housing Act 1988 provides that when

assured tenancy will remain an assured shorthold tenancy if it is granted to
the same tenant.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I were the sole owners of a small private company. We chose to
liquidate it, with the approval of the Inland Revenue, from January 4 1991.
We ceased to trade and began to liquidate the assets for distribution. Some
of these were transferred into our names, including a freehold property.
The inspector of taxes called in the district valuer for his opinion on the
property and a figure was agreed in spring last year. Overall, there is a
capital gain liability.
When we sent in our tax returns in June 1992, we made the following
statement: 'We are expecting to receive a capital gains assessment re
'90/'91. Will you please look into it?' (We named the company and the
approximate gain for each of us). To date, we have heard nothing further.
Have we done sufficient to bring this to the inspector's notice?
It looks as though you and your wife have done all that is required of you
in regard to your personal CGT liabilities. But it is not clear whether the
company's corporation tax liabilities have been settled, including the
company's chargeable gain on the deemed sale of the property etc at market
value. If the liquidator is still trying to get the Revenue to agree the
company's final corporation tax position, that could explain why you have
heard nothing about your personal CGT bills.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Now it's easier to be generous -
Charitable Giving / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS A generous Budget for the generous, and giving to charity is now more
tax-efficient than ever. Adjustments were made to two schemes:
Gift Aid
This allows tax relief for one-off big donations. The minimum amount which
can be donated under the scheme and still qualify for tax relief has been
lowered from Pounds 400 to Pounds 250, having dropped last year from Pounds
600 to Pounds 400.
Under the scheme, a gift of at least this size is treated as net of basic
rate tax. Thus, for any donation of Pounds 250, the charity will receive
Pounds 333.33 once the Revenue's tax rebate is added on.
Those who pay top-rate tax are entitled to claim back the difference between
top and basic rate (15 per cent), which comes to Pounds 50. So, it is
possible to give Pounds 333 to charity for a net outlay of Pounds 200. One
item to note arising from this reform is that there is now no point in a
top-rate taxpayer making a donation of Pounds 200 or more without going
through the Gift Aid formalities.
Give As You Earn
GAYE, organised by employers, involves donations made through monthly
automatic deductions from your pay cheque. These deductions are made from
gross pay, rather than net, which makes the scheme very tax-efficient.
The maximum amount which can be deducted per month has been increased from
Pounds 50 to Pounds 75. That means that basic-rate taxpayers donating the
maximum pay only Pounds 56.25, while top rate-payers part with only Pounds
45.
Payroll donations can be made to more than one charity, and the Charities
Aid Foundation will be contacting all GAYE donors to explain how they can
take advantage of the new maximum.
Unfortunately, according to the Charities Tax Reform Group, there is now
more need to be generous to charity. The group said the charitable sector
would be 'significantly worse off,' one reason being the cost of imposing
VAT on fuel and power.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Revenue's threat on non-approved plans
 -CGT Relief / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of significant tax shelters for executives acquiring shares in
unquoted companies is offered by the Budget. But companies granting share
options without Inland Revenue approval face a new fiscal threat.
There is a long-established 'retirement' relief from capital gains tax for
directors who sell shares in their family trading companies after the age of
55. The first Pounds 150,000 of any gain is exempt, as is half the next
Pounds 450,000, although the exemption is restricted if the shares have been
held for under 10 years.
Until now, the only people eligible have been full-time company directors
owning at least 25 per cent of their company's shares, or owning 5 per cent
where other family members control the company. The chancellor proposes to
replace this by a single individual 5 per cent test, and to allow employees
as well as directors to qualify. Those fortunate enough to have such a
significant stake will now have the chance to supplement their retirement
package by cashing in their shares with little or no tax to pay.
Young turks with no thoughts of retirement were not forgotten. Although
Lamont said his new CGT roll-over relief related 'specifically to
entrepreneurs who have built up successful businesses,' it has a wider
scope. As with retirement relief, a 5 per cent interest will suffice, and
non-directors will qualify if they have been employed in a managerial or
technical capacity.
The relief will be available to any employee satisfying these conditions who
sells shares in an unquoted trading company and, within three years, invests
the proceeds in a stake of at least 5 per cent in another unquoted trading
company. Any CGT liability will be deferred until the taxpayer no longer has
a qualifying holding. An acrobatic employee could, therefore, aspire to a
series of roll-overs culminating in an ultimate sale with the benefit of
retirement relief.
This virtuoso tax-saving performance will be ruined, however, if the
employee acquires his shares via a non-approved share scheme; the exercise
of a non-approved option triggers an income tax liability. The new reliefs
provide protection only against CGT. An executive who is promised a 5 per
cent option should urge his employer to set up a Revenue-approved scheme
which will be the only way of keeping his gain within the CGT regime.
Those companies who may yet be tempted by the flexibility of an unregulated
scheme had another warning shot fired across their bows on Tuesday. The
Revenue issued a statement on the arcane subject of whether the grant of
options should create a tax liability for the granting company.
Any analysis of an option grant focuses typically on the tax implications
for the grantee. In strict theory, it is clear that granting the option is a
CGT disposal and the company could be taxable not on the price actually paid
by the employees - usually a nominal Pounds 1 - but on the true value of the
option.
Until now, the Revenue has tended to turn a blind eye to this issue. Its
Budget-day announcement looks like good news in that it restricts the tax
charge to the amount received. The snag is that this will only apply to
approved schemes. This is a strong hint that, from now on, the taxman will
adopt a tougher stance towards non-approved arrangements.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Higher rate band hit - Married
allowance / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARRIED higher-rate taxpayers under 65 will be Pounds 294 a year worse off
because of a Budget change to the married couple's allowance. The measure
takes effect from April next year.
The married couple's allowance, like most other allowances, will be frozen
in the 1993 tax year at Pounds 1,720. At the moment, the allowance is worth
Pounds 430 to a basic rate taxpayer and Pounds 688 to higher payers. But
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said tax relief from the married couple's
allowance will be restricted to 20 per cent, instead of 25 per cent for
basic rate taxpayers and 40 per cent for those in the higher rate band from
April 1994.
This will limit the maximum benefit from the married couple's allowance to
Pounds 344, regardless of a taxpayer's marginal rate. However, the widening
of the 20 per cent band to the first Pounds 2,500 and then Pounds 3,000 of
income from Pounds 2,000, worth Pounds 25 this year and another Pounds 25
next year, will mitigate the loss.
Assuming no other changes to personal allowances, the effect of both
measures on a married basic rate taxpayer under 65 in 1994-95 will be a loss
of Pounds 36. A higher rate taxpayer will lose Pounds 294.
Those aged 65 and over, who receive a higher married couple's allowance,
will also see its tax benefit restricted to 20 per cent. However, the
allowance will be increased by Pounds 200 so basic rate taxpayers between 65
and 74 will lose no more than Pounds 33.25 in 1994. The corresponding figure
for those aged 75 is Pounds 35.36.
From April, married women will be able to receive all or half the married
couple's allowance following last year's Budget measures. Those wishing to
do so should request Form 18 from their tax office and return it by April 5.
The limit on the benefit from April next year means that the 1993 tax year
will be the only one in which a couple will benefit from the allowance being
transferred to the wife if she is a higher rate taxpayer and her husband a
lower one.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: No change to threshold - Capital Taxes
/ The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF John Major's most inspiring visions faded in the Budget. At the
Conservative conference in 1991, he told delegates that he wanted to see
wealth 'cascading down the generations'. Lobby journalists were given to
understand that this would mean reform, or even abolition, of inheritance
tax.
As it transpired, last year's budget merely increased the threshold for the
value if an estate before IHT becomes payable by slightly more than the rate
of inflation - from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 150,000. That is where the
threshold will stay this year. Inflation is low, while prices of the assets
which form the bulk of most estates - houses - have fallen over the last
year, so heirs have little to complain about. But it is not the sweeping
reform for which some had hoped.
There will similarly be no indexation for the CGT threshold. You are only
allowed to realise gains of Pounds 5,800, over and above inflation, before
CGT becomes payable. That remains generous, in spite of the equity market
recovery in the last quarter of 1992, and fewer than 100,000 investors are
liable to pay the tax in 1992-93.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A spanner in the works - The impact on
families / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR'S Budget proposals were so complex that they could have
widely different effects on different families, depending on their
investments and their employment status. So, the Weekend FT asked Michael
Bishopp and Clive Mackintosh, of Price Waterhouse, to invent three
hypothetical families to analyse how a cross-section of readers would be
affected.
The three are Mr and Mrs Wrench, a self-employed plumber and wife; Mr and Ms
Suburban, a relatively prosperous unmarried couple with children; and Mr and
Mrs Executive, a well-off couple whose children have left home.
Mr &amp; Mrs Wrench. He earns Pounds 20,000 from his plumbing business but his
wife has no income. They have a Pounds 40,000 mortgage and own two cars.
In the 1993-94 tax year, he will gain Pounds 25 in income tax because of the
widening of the 20 per cent band to the first Pounds 2,500 of taxable
income.
But they will spend an extra Pounds 10 a year on excise duties on alcohol
and tobacco, and will face a 6 per cent rise - Pounds 143 a year - in
motoring costs. The net effect is a loss of Pounds 128.
Many of the chancellor's tax increases are postponed until 1994-95. From
that date, the Wrenches will suffer from the restriction of the married
couple's allowance to the 20 per cent band - this will cost them Pounds 86.
The 1 per cent rise in Class 4 National Insurance contributions will add
another Pounds 139 to their tax bill.
The restriction of MIRAS to the 20 per cent band will also cost the couple
Pounds 120 a year. Add an extra Pounds 72 of fuel costs, to reflect the 8
per cent VAT band of domestic fuel and power, and a further Pounds 75 in
motoring expenses.
Even though they will gain a further Pounds 25 from the continued widening
of the 20 per cent band; the Wrenches will be a further Pounds 575 worse off
than they were in 1993-94.
He will qualify for the option of self-assessment in 1996-97 (see page III),
but is uncertain about the administrative burden this will involve.
Mr &amp; Ms Suburban. Each earns Pounds 30,000. He travels 5,000 business miles
in his company car, which is a two-litre BMW320i with a list price of Pounds
18,500 (fuel is not provided). She has a private car.
They have a joint Pounds 60,000 mortgage on a house bought after 1988, so
they receive tax relief of only Pounds 30,000. But, because of his job, they
are about to buy a new house in a higher-cost area and his employer is set
to pay a relocation subsidy of Pounds 13,440.
All this means the Budget has hit the Suburbans very hard: in particular,
they suffer from the change in tax treatment of relocation costs. The
chancellor made two adjustments in this area. Previously, the employer could
give a tax-free allowance for moving to a higher-cost area, plus covering
the actual costs of the move. Now, the relocation allowance is taxable and
only the actual moving costs - of up to Pounds 8,000 - can be reimbursed
without a tax liability. The staggering cost to the Suburbans is Pounds
5,376.
They also suffer from higher alcohol and tobacco duties, motoring expenses
and petrol costs. National Insurance costs rise, since the higher-rate band
has moved from Pounds 405 to Pounds 420 a week. Even without the relocation
effect, the Suburbans are more than Pounds 1,000 worse off in 1992-93.
Since they have children, the Suburbans are entitled to the additional
personal allowance of Pounds 1,720. But in 1994-05 this, like the married
couple's allowance, will be limited to relief at 20 per cent; a cost to the
couple of Pounds 344.
What with all the other changes such as MIRAS, and the 1 per cent NI
increase, the Suburbans will be Pounds 1,984 worse off in 1994-95 compared
with the present tax year.
Mr &amp; Mrs Executive. He earns Pounds 100,000 a year and she gets Pounds
30,000. He has a Rover as a company car and does 2,000 business miles, with
fuel costs provided. They have Pounds 1,000 of dividend income outside a Pep
and a further Pounds 1,200 inside.
One Budget change which affects the Executives is the loss of tax relief on
BES loan-backed schemes. This saved him Pounds 5,600 in tax in 1992-93.
The dividend income of this couple is also affected by the chancellor's
alterations to advance corporation tax. As the Price Waterhouse figures
show, this higher-rate tax-paying couple sees a drop in its Pep income
because of the change. The change does not improve the tax benefits of a Pep
for higher-rate payers.
All the other tax changes mentioned above hit the Executives, particularly
the higher levies on company cars. His car benefit will increase from Pounds
8,625 in 1992-93 to Pounds 9,450 by 1994-95, an effective cost of Pounds 330
at 40 per cent tax.
Excluding the opportunity cost of the BES, the couple is Pounds 799 worse
off in 1993-94, and Pounds 1,826 worse off in 1994-95, compared with this
tax year.

THE COMBINATION of a strong market and anticipation of the Budget did little
to entice directors into making investments and selling remained the most
noticeable feature of the week.
Five of the board at Wyevale Garden Centres, including Christopher Powell,
the non-executive chairman, Brian Evans, the chief executive and Stephen
Murfin, the finance director sold a total of 612,000 shares at 173p. At the
same time last year, Peter Williamson, the deputy chairman, sold 500,000
shares at 171p. Since then the shares have underperformed by more than 15
per cent relative to the market. Each director still retains a sizeable
number of shares.
Linx Printing Technologies came to the market in mid-October last year and
is involved in the manufacture and sale of continuous ink jet printers used
in the identification and coding of products. W Harris, the chairman, sold
300,000 shares at 183p.
The purchase by Paul Roy at Smith New Court, the financial services group,
follows a period of strong outperformance. His purchase was made at 164p and
the shares are currently trading at 176p.
Six of the board of Harry Ramsden's, the fish and chip shop chain, purchased
a total of 41,212 'B' shares at 100p each.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A welcome from lenders - Housing / The
Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING MEASURES outlined by the chancellor in the Budget were broadly
welcomed by lenders this week.
Halifax, the largest lender, said its optimism was tempered by caution
because the chancellor was relying on his Budget proposals to bring recovery
to the market and improve employment prospects. Confidence remains the key
to recovery, it said.
Of immediate significance was chancellor Norman Lamont's decision to raise
the threshold for stamp duty from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000. Lamont
said this would affect half the properties on the market and would benefit
to first-time buyers and others at the lower end.
'We are very pleased and found it very encouraging,' said Abbey National,
the second largest lender. 'For a first-time buyer Pounds 600 represents a
significant saving.'
The change applies to documents executed on or after Budget day, provided
they are not stamped before March 23. The Inland Revenue said that any
documents exchanged on or after March 16 would not be stamped until March 23
unless accompanied by a specific request to do so earlier.
House prices in the south east are higher than for the rest of the UK but
Halifax expects the measure to benefit the market even in this most
depressed of areas. It said that the average price paid by a first-time
buyer in the south east is Pounds 50,000 and in greater London, Pounds
60,000 against a national average of Pounds 45,000.
The chancellor also said he would be limiting mortgage interest tax relief
at source (Miras), to 20 per cent instead of 25 per cent. In recognition of
the fragile state of the market, he said the measure would not be
implemented until April 1994. Higher rate tax relief was abolished in 1991.
Tim Melville Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, the third largest lender,
welcomed the move: 'We have long advocated a phased withdrawal of mortgage
interest tax relief and the redirection of some of the savings involved
towards first-time buyers and owner-occupiers on low incomes.'
The table shows the effect of the proposed Miras change. Under current
mortgage rates of 7.99 per cent it represents an increase in monthly
payments of a maximum of just under Pounds 10. Halifax said it did not
expect the move to damage the market, partly because it was expected. 'The
stamp duty measure was helpful and Miras will not matter,' it said.
The National Association of Estate Agents agreed. 'It is probably the right
time for the government to introduce changes, particularly now that mortgage
rates are at their lowest level for many years,' said Michael Jones,
president. 'The reduction will not have a profound effect on either those
with homes or those thinking of buying.'
However, if mortgage rates rise, the effect of the reduction in Miras
benefit will be greater by pushing up monthly payments. John Cole, of Berry
Birch &amp; Noble, financial advisers, said the effect would be to make more
people - especially those who have already scaled their mortgage down to
Pounds 30,000, the maximum on which relief is available - wonder about the
value of continuing to maintain a mortgage.
'A lot of people who have retired or have been made redundant are asking us
whether they should pay off their mortgage. The proposed change to Miras
will make people question further this benefit,' he said.
The calculation involves balancing the return on a Pounds 30,000 investment
against the value of tax relief of 20 per cent on a Pounds 30,000 loan. At
the current mortgage rate of 7.99 per cent, a basic rate taxpayer would have
to earn around 8.5 per cent gross on his savings, and a top rate taxpayer
10.65 per cent, in order for it to be worthwhile to have savings instead of
repaying the loan.
People over 65 who have life annuity home income plan schemes which allow
them to draw down some of the savings invested in their houses will be
excluded from the Miras change and will continue to attract relief at 25 per
cent.
Lamont also made it easier for people with negative equity - when the value
of their home is less than their mortgage - to move house. Previously, if
your lender allowed you to move and to re-secure the old loan on the new
property, you would have lost your entitlement to Miras because it is
payable only on a new loan. Since Budget Day, however, the old loan will
qualify.
The Inland Revenue said, 'The measure is primarily intended to remove an
obstacle faced by those with negative equity who want to move house.
However, the new rules are not to be restricted to situations where there is
negative equity and other borrowers may be able to take advantage of them.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: First Option Bond returns - National
Savings / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE First Option Bond returned from exile this week as chancellor Norman
Lamont said that National Savings is expected to make an 'important
contribution' to government funding. But the new rate on the bond, available
from Monday, is just 4.75 per cent net, equivalent to 6.34 per cent gross
for one year, on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. The rate payable on Pounds
20,000 and above will be 5.05 per cent net.
This rate is well below the 7.75 per cent net given when National Savings
launched the bond last July, provoking protests from building societies over
what they regarded as unfair competition. It was withdrawn in November.
The return on the new bond can be bettered by other fixed-rate products on
the market. According to Moneyfacts, Cheshire's one-year Tempo bond is
paying 5.25 per cent net on Pounds 5,000 and 5.8 per cent net on Pounds
25,000.
The rate on Portman building society's one-year fixed-interest bond is 4.9
per cent net (minimum deposit Pounds 500)while Alliance &amp; Leicester pays 5
per cent net on its two-year fixed-rate bond, with a minimum deposit of
Pounds 5,000. Savers have no access to their money when tied up in these
bonds - but they do with National Savings, although the penalty is that they
will get no interest.
There are no signs yet of panic among the societies, although there is
concern at the rise of the limits on National Savings purchases.
'We have for some time been concentrating our efforts on trying to maintain
the returns available to our savers affected by falling interest rates,
particularly those living off interest on savings,' said Jim Birrell, chief
executive of Halifax. 'We shall do all we can to remain competitive, but the
new range of NS changes will influence our views on future mortgage rates.'
Nationwide added: 'At present, we can offer competitive products. But if
they (NS) changed their products, we would have to look at our savings rates
and, at the extreme, it would put pressure on mortgage rates.'
Some rather better news is that the limit for the 40th-issue savings
certificates, and for the sixth index-linked certificates, has been doubled
to Pounds 10,000. The limit for income bonds has been raised five-fold to
Pounds 250,000, and from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000 for Capital bonds.
The limit for premium bonds will double to Pounds 20,000 from April 13, and
the maximum amount that can be held in the investment account will rise from
Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 100,000 from May 10.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A new Merc and fresh loopholes - Diary
of a Private Investor / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

'SEE, I've saved you lots of money,' said my wife on hearing details of
Norman Lamont's Budget.
'You haven't bought a racehorse have you, or a wood-burning stove?' I asked,
nervously, as it would probably be my job to remove the waste material
produced by both of them.
'No. I sold one of my cars just in time. The new Nissan Micra I bought is
much more economical and I made sure to fill both my cars with petrol before
Mr Lamont started his Budget speech and increased petrol prices.'
'But . . .' I started.
'And with the hefty increases on tax on expensive company cars, this ought
to be mean that the new Mercedes due to be introduced later this year ought
to be much more competitively prices if they expect reasonable sales - so I
should be able to trade in my old Merc for a new one at last.'
'I will agree to a new Merc,' I said, 'if you can kindly work out for me all
the complexities and implications if the chancellor's changes to advance
corporation tax (ACT) and how it might affect your dividend income (as
someone who earns too little to pay income tax) and how it will affect
taxpayers like me at higher rates.'
My wife fell silent and left the room. As I am still struggling with ACT
myself, the reader will have to look elsewhere in the FT (page III) to
discover the personal effects of the ACT changes.
However, with some pension funds and certain other institutional investors
claiming a possible 6.25 per cent cut in their cash flow as a result of the
ACT changes reducing their income from dividends, perhaps they will now pay
even more attention to investing for growth (and capital gains) rather than
high dividend levels. Perhaps, in order to generate more cash, institutions
will be somewhat more inclined to 'churn' parts of their portfolios, buying
and quickly selling whenever a profit can be realised and using part of that
profit instead of dividend payments to meet some of their cash obligations.
Hopefully, the ACT changes ought to focus more attention on those companies
that have been paying dividends out of reserves (or even from part of the
proceeds of rights issues) rather than conserving cash and using it to
reduce debt or for expansion purposes.
As a private investor I still prefer to invest in shares for growth, rather
than income, and make use of other types of investment for regular cash
generation.
The Inland Revenue issued a consultative document which followed on from the
Budget and the chancellor's comments on trying to address the problem of
surplus ACT arising on account of dividends paid by a company out of profits
from overseas sources which have already borne foreign tax.
Perhaps a creative tax avoidance expert can devise a means whereby an
overseas subsidiary of a UK company might like to make a 'gift' to the
shareholders in the UK company of an appropriate sum in the currency of the
country concerned. The UK company could undertake to convert small sums into
pounds.
I was disappointed that the chancellor did not abolish stamp duty on share
transactions, especially in view of the long overdue demise of Taurus.
However, he did say in his Budget speech that he would 'review the position
further in the light of the conclusions of the Securities Settlement Task
Force set up by the Bank of England.' I hope the task force includes strong
representation from private investors.
While the chancellor announced 'roll over relief' for 'European Community
agricultural quotas for ewe and suckler cow premiums' he did not take up my
suggestion to provide roll over relief to private investors who invest in
shares.
He did, however, announce that entrepreneurs who sell shares in their own
company can 'defer the payment of capital gains tax' if they invest those
gains in 'another qualifying unquoted trading company, or companies.'
I welcome this move, but I hope that this provision can be expanded to
include investing in shares in quoted companies. It is often quoted
companies that need an entrepreneur to shake them up - and to focus their
attention just on unquoted companies seems a pity. Although, perhaps, tax
avoidance experts are already beavering away to produce schemes whereby
unquoted trading companies can control stakes in quoted companies.
While closing many tax loopholes (such as the long overdue abolition of
business expansion schemes which involved the provision of loans to BES
investors) the Budget created a number of areas (especially those connected
with ACT) which are likely to keep armies of accountants occupied.
The chancellor also announced various changes to national savings products
with increases in the holdings limits of savings certificates, and capital
and income bonds and the reintroduction of first option bonds. All these may
well be worth closer study.
But with the present pathetic performance of my Pounds 10,000 worth of
premium bonds I am unlikely to increase it to the proposed new maximum
holding of Pounds 20,000.
Thus, while I applaud the various measures introduced by the chancellor to
assist small business, I wish he had done much more to help the private
investor. Maybe in his autumn Budget he might . . .

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The winners and the losers - Company
Cars / The new tax regime's impact / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN PATERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS YOUR company car worthwhile? Until recently, most company car drivers,
whether work users or perk users, received a clearly tax-efficient benefit
if the car was available for private use.
However, over the last six years the benefit has been eroded as company car
tax charges have increased by more than 300 per cent compared with inflation
of 40 per cent. In addition, chancellor Norman Lamont has announced a new
tax regime based on the maker's recommended retail price - the list price -
which will hit many company car drivers hard. Some will suffer further tax
increases of more than 50 per cent from April 6 1994, although many will
benefit to a lesser extent.
The move to list prices is also expected to have a big impact on car prices.
The practice of heavy discounting to large fleet users and fleet companies
should lessen and list prices should fall. This will benefit the private
purchaser, but will cause a rise in company car costs.
The new regime, expected to raise an extra Pounds 100m per year compared
with 1992/93, is based on a simple fixed percentage - 35 per cent - of the
list price of the car when it was first registered (plus extras).
Business users will receive discounts of two-thirds and one-third for heavy
use (18,000 miles or more) and normal use (more than 2,500 miles)
respectively. Older cars, four years old or more, will receive an additional
discount of one-third.
Thus, if you were a company car driver of the soon-to-be-launched Ford
Mondeo 1.8 GLX 5dr - voted 1993 Car of the Year by What Car? magazine - with
a list price expected to be Pounds 14,600, doing 1,000 business miles, your
taxable benefit in 1994 would be Pounds 5,110 (Pounds 14,600 x 35 per cent).
For a 25 per cent taxpayer, this would cost Pounds 106 per month. Under the
prevailing system, the tax charge would be Pounds 93 per month - an increase
of 14 per cent.
If the driver covered 10,000 business miles, both figures would be reduced
by one-third to Pounds 71 and Pounds 62 respectively.
Table 1 shows how to calculate whether you will gain under the new rules.
First, identify which of the five brackets your car falls into under the old
system, based on its cost when new and its cylinder capacity. Then compare
your car's actual list price to the breakeven list price shown in the first
column. If your car's list price is greater than the breakeven figure, you
are a loser; if it is less, you are a winner. For example, all drivers of
2-litre cars costing less than Pounds 19,250 will suffer if the list price
of their car is greater than Pounds 12,814.
Table 2 gives examples of typical winners and losers. In general, the losers
are those drivers who chose cars at the top of the old bands.
Deciding whether you are a winner or loser does not however necessarily
resolve the question of whether your company car is still worthwhile. All
the new regime has done is to reallocate the tax charges on a different,
usually fairer, basis.
However, because of the retention of the 2,500 and 18,000 business mileage
bands, the benefit continues to be governed by business use, rather than
private use. There is little to support these arbitrary business use
figures.
Also, the 35 per cent tax factor applied to list price is too crude a method
of establishing a car's true annual cost. The true cost will be made up
principally of depreciation, finance costs, maintenance and running costs
and insurance (except fuel) together with the effect of taxes - income tax,
corporation tax, VAT and national insurance.
It appears that the new system has been pitched at too high a level and, in
general, the new regime will over-tax company car drivers, both business
users and perk drivers. A switch to cash will therefore be encouraged under
the new rules.
Surprisingly perhaps, those drivers with high business mileage (30,000 plus)
may suffer most under the new regime as their business use discount will be
limited to two-thirds. However, for work car drivers, tax efficiency is not
usually a big consideration, other commercial factors weighing far more
heavily.
For perks car drivers (less than 2,500 miles), the tax factors carry their
due weight and we can expect many more situations where it will be
beneficial to switch to cash. However, such drivers should also consider
non-tax factors.
A car is probably the second largest purchase an employee would make, and
the fact that all costs are usually borne by the employer, come what may, is
a significant advantage.
Companies also usually have access to greater discounts and cheaper funding
and can also recover VAT on maintenance costs. Thus, even if a company car
is not tax efficient, the relative cost savings available through sourcing a
car through the company may be enough to make the provision of a company car
cost effective, in spite of its tax inefficiency. On the other hand, the
employee may be willing to downgrade or buy a used car.
In many cases, the tax considerations will outweigh other factors. In other
cases, the employee will wish to stick with the car in spite of its cost. He
may also wish to consider employee lease purchase plans. The disadvantage of
such schemes is their cost, because of increased credit risk.
The cash or car decision is not easy. One thing is certain, however, and
that is that considerably more drivers will benefit from a switch to cash,
and employers may be able to make significant cost savings in the process.
We can also expect to see a growth in innovative schemes designed to pass on
tax savings to both employees and employers.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gain and loss for Names - Insurance
Market / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH Lloyd's of London has responded enthusiastically to the tax
measures for the insurance market's hard-hit Names, the benefits are far
from unalloyed.
The measures do nothing to help Names already hit by heavy losses. And while
Names' advisers said the new reserving arrangements were more generous than
they had anticipated, others were less enthusiastic, suggesting that a
second measure - affecting the tax treatment of capital appreciation - will
affect many Names adversely.
The most important measure is a new, more generous tax deductible reserve to
meet future losses. This replaces the current special reserve fund, which
allows Names to set aside up to Pounds 7,000 each year against higher rate
tax. The level of the reserve has been unchanged since 1955.
According to the new arrangements for the 1992 underwriting year, a Name
will be able to transfer up to 50 per cent of profits to the new reserve
each year, provided the value of the funds in the reserve does not exceed 50
per cent of the Name's overall premium income limit.
Amounts withdrawn will be made to fund losses or cash calls; withdrawals
that are not used to meet losses will attract tax. The change 'should allow
Names to plan their business. The current system does not really allow them
to 'set aside an extra bit just in case'', said John Reed, insurance tax
specialist with Ernst &amp; Young.
Robert Saunders, of Smith &amp; Williamson, the private bank, said another
feature of the new arrangements - that income and gains arising on assets in
the reserve will be free of income tax and capital gains tax - was
especially attractive to Names. 'This is generous. It makes a lot of
difference to prospects at Lloyd's'
But Charles Sturge, co-editor of the Chatset guides which analyse syndicate
performance at Lloyd's, said the change did nothing to help Names hit by
losses between 1988 and 1991. 'It is no big deal because most Names are
likely to have underwriting losses carried forward from previous years, as
well as the constant drip of losses from the 1992 year onwards.' Names would
have to pay profit commission to their agents on money invested into the new
reserves.
Sturge is particularly critical of a second change. From 1994, the Inland
Revenue will treat capital gains earned from appreciation of Names' premium
trust funds (the funds into which premium income is paid) as income rather
than capital. Present arrangements are beneficial to Names because capital
gains are usually converted into tax losses by indexation allowances. These
'tax losses' can be offset against capital gains a Name might make outside
Lloyd's.
Sturge says the indexation allowance in an average year is worth about 3 per
cent of a Name's premium income limit, or Pounds 30,000 for a Name
underwriting Pounds 1m. 'The average Name will be worse off as a result of
this Budget.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why not buy a pied-a-terre? -
Expatriates / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR proposes to abolish the 'available accommodation' rule. This
treats individuals in the UK, for a temporary purpose only, as resident for
tax purposes for any tax year in which they visit the UK - no matter how
short the visit - and where they have accommodation available for their use.
The rule's abolition will apply to both income and capital gains tax from
April 6.
In spite of the change, resident status will be incurred in any of the
following ways:
Coming to the UK with the intention of remaining permanently or for over
three years.
Visiting for more than 182 days in any tax year.
Visiting for more than 90 days per year by reference to an average of four
consecutive tax years.
It may be some time before all the ramifications of the current changes
become clear. Ownership of property will continue to be relevant to resident
status, although not to the previous extent.
For example, if you claim to be departing the UK for permanent residence
overseas, whether you dispose of your UK home or not will determine
respectively: whether UK non-residence is admitted immediately; or whether
you will be required to wait three years for a retrospective ruling.
Similarly, owning or acquiring a property when you arrive in the UK may be
taken as indicating your intention to reside in the country for an extended
period.
Some results of the change are clearer. Britons who have emigrated to the
sun following retirement and who have been deterred from maintaining a UK
pied-a-terre, need hesitate no longer. Similarly, foreign businessmen who
are regularly in the UK and would like to acquire accommodation, should be
able to do so without fear of tax consequences.
Under current law both would risk liability to tax on overseas income and
gains.
British expatriates, staying in their UK homes between overseas contracts,
have faced even greater problems. Most will have been UK domiciliaries and
the acquisition of UK resident status carried with it the danger of tax on
worldwide income and gains.
Expatriates who perform 'duties of substance' in the UK while maintaining
accommodation there, have faced the same sort of problem. While most will
have succeeded in excluding their salaries from liability by means of the
foreign earnings deduction, they typically became chargeable to tax on
worldwide investment income and gains.
All of the above people will gain from the impending change. Their overseas
income and gains will remain outside the charge to UK tax, provided they
keep their visits within the six months per annum/three months average
rules.
But there are snags. Wives who had previously been regular UK residents will
no longer be able to enjoy an annual Pep, while others may find their right
to personal pension plans has evaporated.
All this assumes the legislation will pass through Parliament. However, that
is not a foregone conclusion.
Donald Elkin is a director of Wilfred T. Fry of Worthing, West Sussex.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A problem with deadlines - Business
Expansion Schemes / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE party comes the hangover. The Business Expansion Scheme binged on
non-recourse loans in the weeks leading up to the Budget, as they allowed
investors to exit from their investments after only six months.
But the chancellor's decision to outlaw any loans connected to BES shares,
with effect from the midnight before, caught several sponsors unawares. One,
BZW, is still unsure of whether it allocated in time for the deadline.
Oriel Residences, sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance, and Residences At
Bristol, sponsored by Hodgson Martin, had failed to meet the deadline and
intends to repay investors' money.
The Oriel scheme was relaunched yesterday without a loan option, and will
now be known as Oriel Cash-backed. After five years, it will guarantee an
exit price of Pounds 1.15 for every Pounds 1 invested now. Investors in the
original Oriel company are being invited to vote for the company to be wound
up, and their cheques have not been cashed.
Yorkshire Flexible, sponsored by Capital for Companies, had raised and
allotted Pounds 9m before the Budget deadline. Another Pounds 3m was
received on Tuesday, but the cheques were not cashed and investors have the
option to withdraw. They would still receive tax relief, but would be unable
to accept the loans which were central to the package.
Anyone buying BES shares from Budget day onwards is barred from using them
as security for any kind of loan. You will not even be able to take out a
bank loan with BES shares as security, if those shares were bought on budget
day or after.
If you invested in the BES and shares were allotted to you before the
chancellor's deadline, you can borrow against them without losing tax
relief. However, the guidelines for deciding when shares have been allotted
are controversial. According to the Inland Revenue, it will not be necessary
to receive share certificates by the relevant date. Normally, tax inspectors
will decide that shares have been allotted when a shareholder's name has
been entered in the register of members, and this can normally be done very
quickly using computers.
However, this decision is at the discretion of individual tax inspectors,
which could lead to confusion - as has happened in the case of BZW, which
raised Pounds 25m to finance Barclays repossessions via the Gracechurch BES
companies last month.
While this mess remains to be tidied up, the rest of the BES industry has
returned to schemes which require investors to hold on their shares for five
years. These are unaffected by the budget.
Schemes now fall into two broad types - those which seek to assure an exit
after five years by contracting to pay investors a fixed price, and those
which offer no attempt at a guarantee but aim to maximise capital growth.
According to the Allenbridge Group, 14 contracted exit schemes were on the
market by the end of the week. The strength of the guarantor is vital when
assessing these schemes. 'Cash-backed' offers, where a separate sum of money
is placed on deposit so that it can reach the contracted exit price after
five years, may also be attractive. Allenbridge lists a further 24 assured
tenancy companies without any guarantee.
As this week's problems have demonstrated, BES investment is not for the
uninitiated. Main BES advisers are Allenbridge Group (071 409 1111) and BESt
Investment (071 613 0032).

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Insurers: OFT acts - The Budget and
You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading put its oar into the murky waters of life
insurance this week with two reports containing proposed reforms in
disclosure rules. The chancellor must now decide whether to accept them.
One report, which could be implemented quickly, suggests amending four rules
proposed by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB).
Independent advisers' commission
The OFT want IFAs to disclose their commission, in cash terms, before a
sale. Own charges in illustrations
At present, any projection in marketing literature assumes that a company
has a set level of costs prescribed by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust
Regulatory Organisation, even if these actually are much higher. Under the
OFT's suggested rules, you would be able to see just how much more expensive
they were.
Surrender values late in a policy
At present, projected surrender values for the first five years must be
shown and, under SIB's proposals, these would have to be revealed in the
context of the amount of premiums paid. Because the costs of administration
and sales are deducted at the beginning of the policy, investors often make
a loss at this stage. But surrender values later in the term are also much
worse than maturity values, and the OFT wants to force companies to disclose
them.
Differential pricing for tied agents
Life companies are not now allowed to charge different prices for selling
through different tied agents, even though the costs vary from agent to
agent. The OFT hopes that prices would fall if companies were allowed to
make differential charges.
In a second report, the OFT calls for each life company to announce how many
of its policies are surrendered. It would also require life offices to send
annual statements to policy-holders, like those given to unit trust
investors.

Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, reports half-year results on
Thursday with analysts forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 295m
and Pounds 325m against Pounds 244m a year earlier on sales of about Pounds
1bn.
Retrovir, the HIV-treatment, is expected to generate between Pounds 120m and
Pounds 140m, while estimates for sales of Zovirax, the herpes and chickenpox
medicine, range from Pounds 345m to Pounds 385m.
Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, announces its 1992
results on Tuesday. It released estimated results, showing an unaudited
pre-tax profit of Pounds 147m, a 48.5 per cent increase on 1991, last month
when it announced the Dollars 434m acquisition of Specialty Coatings
international, the US coatings company.
Full-year results on Tuesday from Invergordon Distillers, the independent
Scotch whisky producer, are likely to reflect the increased pressure on
margins in the bulk whisky market. After five years of strong growth,
pre-tax profits are expected to be virtually flat at Pounds 32.4m against
Pounds 32.2m in 1991.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Peps will also suffer - The Budget and
You
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL equity plans have become less attractive relative to other
non-equity investments as a result of the tax change.
As the table shows, Pep investors should suffer a drop of around 6.25 per
cent in income, unless companies increase their dividends to compensate
investors for the change. But the result will be to reduce the return on a
Pep which currently yields 5 per cent to 4.69 per cent.
This particularly reduces the relative attractions of Peps for basic rate
taxpayers, since their dividend income outside a Pep will not be affected.
The benefits of a Pep for many basic rate taxpayers were already marginal
for those plans with extra charges. If a fund yields 4 per cent gross the
tax saving to a basic rate payer in 1992-93 was 1 per cent, or Pounds 60 on
a Pounds 6,000 investment. Some Pep managers make an initial charge of 1 per
cent plus VAT, more than wiping out the tax saving.
The change in the tax system would reduce the saving on such a fund to
Pounds 45, and may tip some plans below the break-even point for basic rate
investors. They should concentrate on Peps with no extra charges. This is
true of nearly all unit trust Peps; it remains the case that if you are
prepared to buy the unit trust, then you might as well buy it in Pep form.
However, remember that most unit trusts have an initial capital charge of
Pounds 300 on a Pounds 6,000 investment. The lower this charge the better.
Higher rate taxpayers will also see a fall in the gross yield on Peps.
However, since their dividend income outside a Pep will drop by 6.25 per
cent, their tax saving will remain at 40 per cent. Furthermore, they are
more likely to benefit from the capital gains tax exemption Peps provide.
Nevertheless, Peps will still be less attractive, compared with other
investments such as gilts, than they were before.
Pep managers spoken to this week dismissed the effect as 'marginal'; they
maintain a Pep is still attractive to both basic and top rate payers.
Certainly, equities remain the best long term investment and provided the
investor is able to hold on to a Pep for 10 years or so, the advantages
should still be clear. Those who should reconsider a Pep are basic rate
payers in funds with additional charges.
Investors who are in low-charging plans should have no reason to give up
their plans; and a Pep still remains an excellent way of saving to repay a
mortgage.
In the short term, the change may increase the popularity of bond-equity
plans. Since bonds are unaffected by the tax change, yields on such Peps
will be less affected than pure equity plans and may even gain. Fidelity
says the yield on its mixed Pep will rise.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tax cut will hit your income -
Dividends / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY SEEM confusing that a cut in the tax rate on dividends is bad news
for private investors. But it is.
Both non-taxpayers and higher rate taxpayers look set to suffer a cut in
dividend income of about 6.25 per cent as a result of the change. Someone
who previously had net dividend income of Pounds 10,000 will see that fall
to Pounds 9,375.
However, there is some good news. Basic rate taxpayers will be unaffected.
And corporate dividend policy may change to cushion shareholders from part
of their loss, although this will be difficult in the light of low dividend
cover ratios.
The change is complicated in effect because companies do not pay a 'gross
dividend' - they pay a net dividend and a further payment (the equivalent of
basic rate tax) to the Inland Revenue. This is a downpayment on the
company's tax bill, hence the name Advance Corporation Tax. It is a
convenient way for the government to use the corporate sector as a tax
collector.
Under the old system, if the company declared a net dividend of 7.5p, the
investor would receive the dividend payment, together with a tax credit of
2.5p. (see table)
Non-taxpayers (such as pension funds) could use the tax credit to reclaim
the tax paid from the Inland Revenue. In effect, they received a gross
dividend of 10p.
Basic rate taxpayers needed to do nothing; the net dividend reflected the
impact of 25 per cent tax. They thus had no further tax liability, nor any
ability to reclaim tax. Higher rate taxpayers were assessed as having
received a gross dividend of 10p. At the 40 per cent rate, they were liable
to pay 4p in tax. Thus in addition to the 2.5p already deducted, they had to
pay an additional 1.5p, leaving them with 6p.
Under the new system, the tax rate on dividends is 20 per cent. If companies
pay the same net dividend of 7.5p, non-taxpayers will get a tax credit of
just 1.875p. This makes the gross dividend 9.375p (9.375p, less 20 per cent,
is 7.5p). The effect is to cut gross dividends by 6.25 per cent (from 10p to
9.375p), hitting pension funds and Pep holders.
Basic rate taxpayers will still get the net dividend of 7.5p and will face
no further charge. So the effect on them is neutral.
But higher rate taxpayers will face an additional charge - the difference
between 20 per cent and 40 per cent tax. So instead of a further 1.5p
payment (under the old system), they will have to pay 1.875p (20 per cent of
9.375p). Their net income will be 5.625p, instead of 6p under the old
system, a decline of 6.25 per cent.
This may cause some investors to increase that part of their portfolios they
hold in bonds, rather than in equities. This may have been part of the
chancellor's intention since he has a lot of gilts to sell.
However, there may be some unintended consequences of the chancellor's move.
The income shares of split capital investment trusts became less attractive
after the change.
As Nigel Sidebottom, associate director of brokers Gerrard Vivian Gray,
points out: 'Split level income shares - particularly those with very high
flat yields and annuity characteristics - provide virtually all their return
to shareholders in the form of income. Pension funds holding these shares
will as a result suffer significant reduction in returns.
'The gross redemption yield will in some cases fall by over 2 per cent as a
result of the change' adds Sidebottom.' The market reacted quickly to the
change with most income shares being marked 2 to 3 per cent lower first
thing on the morning after the Budget.'
The full implications of the change may take some time to appear, as
companies review their dividend policy.
But there are two consequences: equities have become slightly less
appealing; and within the field of equity investment, capital gain has
become more attractive, relative to income.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The DIY tax bill - Income Tax Self
Assessment / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DECIDING for yourself how much tax you have to pay sounds like a dream, but
some 8m people who fill in a tax return will, for the 1996/97 tax year, have
the choice of assessing themselves for tax. Half are self-employed, the rest
are pensioners and employees who receive tax return forms. Employees under
the pay-as-you-earn system and deduction at source arrangements will not be
affected.
Under the proposed system, those who fill in a tax return would make their
own assessment by working out how much tax is due on their income. At
present they declare their income and expenditure and leave it to the Inland
Revenue to calculate tax liability.
'The new system will do away with the present rigmarole of raising
assessments, appeals, agreeing payments and adjustments to the final
payment, which is unproductive,' said Maurice Parry-Wingfield, tax partner
at Touche Ross. 'If more taxpayers understand and are more involved in their
tax affairs, that can only be welcome.'
Self-assessment will be made possible because the current system will be
simplified. The complex 'preceding year' basis of income tax for the
self-employed will be changed: if all goes to plan, all income tax will be
taxed on a common current year basis from 1996/97. This means that tax from
self-employment will be paid in the year in which it is earned, rather than
a year later. One year will drop out of the tax calculations for the
self-employed and transitional provisions will be made so that businesses
will not be taxed twice.
Another change is the decision to issue the self-employed with one tax
statement and one tax bill for all income regardless of whether it comes
from employment, freelance earnings or investment. The taxpayer will have to
deal with only one tax office. The Inland Revenue says the changes are
intended to make the process of tax returns and payments 'simpler and
fairer.'
But self-assessment has disadvantages. Those who choose it will have their
tax payments brought forward since assessment will be on a current year
basis and their payments to the Revenue have to be included with their
completed tax assessment form.
There is also the issue of 'random audits' which the revenue says is
necessary to deter those hoping to pay less tax as a result of
self-assessment. This would give the Inland Revenue an unrestricted right to
check accounts, without giving a reason, within one year of them being
filed. At present, the Inland Revenue has to tell a taxpayer why it wants to
check the account.
'Most of the benefits are for the Inland Revenue and their administration,'
said John Battersby, tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'They will have the
prospect of money coming in more quickly as a result. Random audits mean
that for a whole year after you have filed you do not not know whether your
assessment will be accepted and if the Revenue challenges you, you will not
know the reason.'
'I do not think it will be that wonderful,' said Martin Ben-Nathan, of
chartered accountants Casson &amp; Beckman. 'You will have to work out your own
tax and if you get it wrong, there will be penalties. It might be better to
get the Inland Revenue to do the work.'
Consultation is continuing between the Revenue, employers and representative
bodies.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Markets: Long, dull and infernal - Serious Money / The
Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVIL is in the detail, said Ross Perot, the US tycoon, and he might
easily have been speaking about the Budget. Norman Lamont's speech might
have seemed both long and dull, but there was plenty for investors to ponder
in the small print.
Most tax allowances were frozen, such as the personal allowance, the higher
rate band, the annual CGT allowance, the age allowance and the inheritance
tax threshold. The married couple's allowance was not only frozen but
restricted to 20 per cent from April 1994.
Mortgage interest relief is also being restricted to 20 per cent, as from
April next year. At the same time, citizens can look forward to another 1
per cent rise in National Insurance contributions on earnings between Pounds
56 and Pounds 420 a week.
Taken together, those changes could take Pounds 645 in 1994-95 from a
married person with a mortgage who earns Pounds 30,000 a year. The sole
concession is the widening of the 20 per cent rate band, which works out at
a whopping Pounds 25 per person over each of the next two years.
Do not spend it all at once, especially as the chancellor decided to round
up the usual victims - smokers, beer-drinkers and motorists - for their
annual clobbering. He added VAT on fuel for bad measure.
The implications of the above changes are at least relatively
straightforward. Where matters become more complicated is in the detail and,
in particular, the change in the way that advance corporation tax is levied.
The figures are spelt out on page III, but the upshot is that, other things
being equal, higher-rate taxpayers, non-taxpayers and Pep holders will all
see a 6.25 per cent cut in their dividend income.
It might be that companies will increase their net dividends to compensate,
but, in the context of a weak economy and low dividend cover, it seems far
from certain.
The perverse impact of all this is that the elderly, who have saved
prudently for their retirement so as not to be a burden on the state, will
be the group much the worst hit by the Budget. They will probably see their
dividend income fall, while also paying the Chancellor's other levies.
What should private investors do? In spite of industry protests, the
benefits of a Pep have always been less obvious for a basic rate than for a
top rate payer. Even more so than before, basic rate payers should carefully
examine plans to ensure the charges do not outweigh the tax break. Indeed,
Guinness Flight has cut the charges on its Temple Bar PEP precisely to
address this point.
The change may also tilt the investment argument slightly towards bonds and
away from shares. A portfolio with a 65/35 per cent split between shares and
bonds might be shifted to a 60/40 split.
According to Whittingdale, the gilt fund managers, the change will produce a
benefit, in the form of a slightly higher yield, for basic rate taxpayers
who hold bond funds. However, the chancellor did not allow bond funds to
qualify for Peps so the news is not all good.
Whether or not you find gilts more attractive after the Budget probably
depends on whether you are convinced that the government has made sufficient
effort to bring the budget deficit under control.
If you are unconvinced, you may still find that index-linked gilts are
appealing. The real yields of over 3.5 per cent on long-dated issues compare
very favourably with the 4 per cent dividend yield on the equity market.
Although index-linked issues offer little income, they have distinct tax
advantages. Do not forget index-linked National Savings either - the limit
has been doubled to Pounds 10,000.
One wrinkle also worth noting is that company convertible bonds are
unaffected by the ACT change (since they pay interest), whereas convertible
preference shares, however, do suffer (because they pay a dividend).
This might increase the attractions for private investors of convertible
bonds, which offer a steady income and the possibility of profits if share
prices rise.
It is also important to return to the argument advanced by Robin Angus, of
NatWest Securities, that private investors should concentrate on total
return.
Although the chancellor did not increase the CGT threshold, at Pounds 5,800
it still represents an allowance that most investors fail to use.
A return of 5 per cent capital and 3 per cent income is just as good in
gross terms as a return of 8 per cent income and no capital growth. Given
the different tax treatments, the former option may be much better in net
terms.
This just scratches the surface of the technical changes which the
chancellor made. Those who have company cars, BES plans, their own
businesses or who are long-suffering Lloyd's names will find relevant
articles in the next few pages.
In short, there are a lot of details - and a lot of devils too.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Markets: ACT: winners and losers - The Bottom Line / The
Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor's changes to the advance corporation tax (ACT) regime do not
necessarily spell good news for companies. Although there are obvious
winners, there are also losers. The reduction in the rate of ACT, from 25 to
20 per cent over two years, appears good news for business. Companies will
get a cash-flow benefit, as ACT is payable in advance but corporation tax is
paid in arrears. The changes pose two potential problems: a higher tax
charge and institutional demand for higher dividends.
First, companies which have suffered from surplus ACT in past years can
offset it against UK corporation tax as long as their profits recover. But
the amount of surplus ACT which they can offset against Pounds 33 of
corporation tax will reduce from Pounds 25 to Pounds 20. As a result, their
marginal tax rate will rise from 8 to 13 per cent.
Second, tax-exempt investors, such as the pension funds, may want companies
to pass on any benefits accrued from the changes in the form of increased
dividends. One senior fund manger said: 'We will obviously look at each case
separately. But I do not think that a company which stands to gain
significantly from the changes should think twice about not increasing its
dividends proportionately.'
Andrew Jones, the senior partner at Ernst &amp; Young, believes the reduction in
the ACT rate will be of most help to companies which have lots of UK taxable
profit and no ACT problem. They will have a reduced cash flow cost because
they pay less ACT in absolute terms. Stephen Boddice, finance director of T
&amp; S Stores, believes his company is a typical example of gaining from the
reduced cash flow, although the amount is not big.
Another class of companies which could benefit, according to Jones, is that
which has a minority of its British taxable income from UK sources. 'In
those cases,' he says, 'ACT is close to being an irretrievable problem and,
again, the reduced absolute cash cost will afford them some relief, though
far less that they would immediately expect.' Colin Hope, chairman and chief
executive of T &amp; N, the motor components and engineering group, concurs:
'The changes will unquestionably be of use to us over the next few years.
But they will of less hope than one might think.'
Another winner in this category is BBA, the automotive, aviation and
industrial component maker which generates most of its revenue overseas.
Peter Clappison, finance director, said the changes should save it around
Pounds 1m in tax. But the bulk of companies which have a surplus ACT problem
will be no better off. Those companies which have curtailed dividends to
utilise past ACT may be substantially worse off.
Most analysts believe Trafalgar House, the construction, engineering and
shipping conglomerate, fits into this category. The group believes, however,
that the effects of the changes will be neutral because of its increased
overseas earnings.
Hoare Govett has identified a number of FT-SE 100 winners from the changes.
These include the industrial conglomerates BTR and Williams Holdings; RTZ
Corporation, the world's largest mining company; HSBC Holdings, which last
year acquired Midland Bank; Standard Chartered; Smith &amp; Nephew, the
international health-care and consumer group; and Ladbroke, which owns
Hilton International hotels and various betting businesses. But the only
clear winners are those which are able to raise the dividend or pay
dividends that are sufficiently generous to keep tax-exempt shareholders
happy.
Ladbroke, is an obvious example of such a winner. Cyril Stein, the chairman,
said: 'Given our high yield, I am confident that pension funds will not be
pressing us for for higher dividends.' But Forte, the hotels group, seen as
an overall winner because its tax charge is expected to fall by around
Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m, might not have much scope to raise its dividends.
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, has also been classified as a partial
winner. Derek Bonham, the chief executive, believes its tax charge will fall
by about Pounds 35m. He also believes that the pension funds are strong
enough to withstand the changes without necessarily demanding a bigger
dividend.
Matters could prove awkward for Hanson if it takes a different line, though.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd believes the group's ability to increase dividends is
constrained by the low level of cover and the growing cyclicality of earning
due to the move into natural resources.
The Treasury has gained from this change in the tax system because of the
lower tax credit. On the chancellor's own figures, retaining the present
offset rate would still produce Pounds 1bn of revenue saved by reducing tax
credit payments.
As the changes stand, many companies fear that what seemed like a positive
move might not achieve its aim.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Markets: Investors in wonderland - Wall Street / The Budget
and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE behaviour of equity investors in the US is looking ever more
paradoxical. Consider the following:
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is bumping along at near record levels, but
economists continue to emphasise the fragility of the US economic recovery.
Corporate restructurings - meaning layoffs, asset sales and mergers - are
producing improved productivity and profit levels at many US companies, but
the buoyant price / earnings ratios of many company stocks seem to have
discounted a level of improvement that may not be reached for another 12 to
18 months.
The tax-increasing, deficit-reducing budget legislation presented by the
Clinton administration was approved on Thursday by the House of
Representatives, as was a Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11.2bn) fiscal stimulus
package. But the budget could still be watered down in the Senate and in a
joint conference between the two chambers of Congress.
The recovery of US banks is considered a fait accompli, judging by investor
sentiment and share prices, but warnings that the credit crunch is
unresolved and that commercial property loans are still a problem are
creeping back into the debate.
Inflation is not thought to be a serious worry in either the bond or equity
markets, but there is a lurking fear of prospective reflation resulting from
the Clinton plan.
Taken as a group, Wall Street investors appear to be undecided about which
way to turn. Almost inevitably the lemmings who constitute the majority are
allowing themselves to be pushed and shoved by short-term events and
indicators.
For example, Thursday's cut in German interest rates triggered a healthy
38.90 point jump in the Dow Jones index. But the short-termers may not
recall the underlying rationale for the cut - the deepening recession in the
national economy which serves as Europe's economic engine.
Wall Street was delighted at the Bundesbank's rate cut, but most investors
forgot that many US exporters and multinational companies will find it hard
for some time to sell their products into the weakened European market.
In the domestic US economy there are other examples of enigmatic investor
sentiment. The US car industry is working hard to restructure itself, but
all the strong medicine being taken in Detroit seemed to be eclipsed by the
angst this week of one man at one US car company - General Motors.
The reason was the melodramatic cliffhanger scripted by Jose Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua, the GM man with the allegedly magic touch. Lopez's indecision
over whether to stay at GM or to take a top job at Volkswagen (he eventually
chose the latter) looked at times like a cross between a Peter Sellers farce
and a Samuel Beckett existential mope.
The question it should raise for investors is to what extent GM's recovery
plan depended on the efforts of one Spanish manager who was only brought to
Detroit ten months ago.
As for the pharmaceuticals industry, investors can bite their nails along
with executives from that sector, who are alternating between states of
panic and anger as they gaze at the price-ceiling and other policy options
that may be part of Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care reform package, to
be unveiled in early May.
The battering taken by several drug stocks implies that what may be good for
US society (cheaper health care available to a larger number of poorer
people) could be painful for a number of drugs manufacturers.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Markets: Believe it or not, that wasn't a recession - London
/ The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN COLERIDGE first thought up that phrase about the 'willing suspension of
disbelief' - the 'poetic faith' we feel in the presence of true artistic
creativity - he probably did not have the Budget in mind.
But he should have done.
Consider this year's example. Norman Lamont asked us to believe that
significant business tax rises - through Advance Corporation Tax and
Petroleum Revenue Tax - were actually tax concessions proffered in response
to eager pleas by the corporate sector.
He asked the gilt market to believe in the bankability of government
promises to raise taxes stretching several unfathomable years into the
future, and in the plausibility of a spending review that has barely even
started.
Most improbably of all, the Treasury asked us to believe that there was
really no recession last year after all.
The UK's non-oil gross domestic product shrank by only  1/2 per cent point
during 1992, according to the economic estimates published to accompany the
Budget.
Even that modest slippage overstates what actually happened, on the
Treasury's figures: if you compare the fourth quarter of 1992 with that of
1991, there was really no change. Manufacturing output was actually 1/2 per
cent higher in the fourth quarter than it had been a year before.
Faced with all this, the markets did their best to suspend their
incredulity. Share prices fell on the day after the Budget, with the FT-SE
100 index dropping 29.4 points to 2889.9. By the end of the week, blue chips
had recovered some of their lost ground, and the FT-SE 100 closed at 2900.1
on Friday, down 15.8.
Smaller companies had no lost ground to make up: the FT-SE Mid 250 index
actually rose on the day after the Budget, and closed the week up 1 per
cent.
The gilt market, which had begun the week in a mood of foreboding, appeared
to have suspended its critical faculties by the close. Even though the
Treasury's new estimate of the 1993-94 public sector borrowing requirement,
at Pounds 50bn, was higher than earlier estimates, the market responded
enthusiastically. The yield on 10-year gilts, which was 7.56 per cent at the
end of last week and 7.66 per cent in the immediate aftermath of the new
PSBR estimate, ended the week at 7.61 per cent.
The decisive factor for the gilt market was probably not the Budget itself,
nor Norman Lamont's promise of a 'wedge' of rising tax revenues in years to
come. It was the growing evidence that a solid economic recovery is under
way, ranging from the discovery, in the Treasury's figures, that last year
had not been as ghastly as it seemed, to higher building society lending and
lower unit wage costs, culminating in Thursday's unexpected drop in
unemployment for the first time in 34 months.
The market has convinced itself that only economic growth can deliver an
escape from the spectre of ever-rising government borrowing; this week, that
prospect seemed on balance a little more likely.
Ever since last autumn, the equity market has been expecting such a
recovery. This week's developments, therefore, have been dominated by an
attempt to calculate whether the tax changes in the Budget were likely to
help or harm the value investors put on the profits stream that recovery
will generate.
For higher-rate and tax exempt shareholders, the changes in the tax
treatment of dividends mean that the stock market is less valuable than it
was before the Budget, as articles elsewhere in this section explain. The
gross dividend yield on the FT-Actuaries All-Share seems likely to drop from
around 4.1 per cent to something like 3.9 per cent. At that figure, it would
be reaching the level at which equities have traditionally been seen as
unsustainably expensive.
Of course, gross dividends are only of direct relevance to tax-exempt
investors; for others, the net dividend is the more important figure. Taking
that into account, brokers' analysts seemed divided about the impact of the
change. NatWest Securities reckoned that only 39 per cent of equity
investors were adversely affected; Goldman Sachs put the proportion at 70
per cent or more.
Amid the confusion, two facts seemed clear: the government had stepped up
its tax take from companies and their shareholders by Pounds 1bn a year; and
it had chosen to help companies with surplus ACT problems at the expense of
those without. Since surplus ACT is concentrated in a relatively small
number of businesses - those with a very heavy dependence on overseas
profits, or with unusually high dividend payouts  - individual gainers stand
to win much more than individual victims will lose. Shares that benefited
from this reasoning included Redland, up 21p since the Budget to 477p, and
BAT, up 19p to 992p.
The market seemed reluctant to single out other individual gainers and
losers from the Budget. Rolls-Royce Motors, part of Vickers, stands to be a
significant loser from the changing structure of company car taxation, which
will penalise very expensive cars much more heavily than at present. Vickers
shares scarcely budged, however, dropping only 2p after the Budget to close
the week at 129p; presumably investors no longer regard Rolls-Royce as a
significant factor in valuing the group.
Whisky distillers, singled out for favourable treatment in the Budget speech
by a whisky-sipping chancellor, also stand to benefit, in relative terms at
least, from a less onerous rise in excise duties than that imposed on other
forms of alcohol. Guinness shares dropped 28p to close at 462, affected more
by lack-lustre results than by any advantage accruing to the whisky trade.
Oil companies with North Sea interests fell into two camps after the Budget.
Those with mature fields and little to gain from a continuation of the old
system of lavish allowances for future exploration (perhaps because they had
already used up all the allowances the taxman would give them) stand to be
big gainers.
Analysts decided that BP was the best example of this category: its shares
rose only 4 1/2 p, however, closing the week at 299 1/2 p. Oil companies
which had counted on a continuation of allowances in the future, typically
smaller independents, stand to lose: overall, the sector lost 0.4 per cent.
In principle, you might think that gas and electricity utilities would also
suffer from the Budget, with its promise to impose value-added tax in years
to come on domestic fuel and power. Curiously, the stock market appears to
believe that consumers are indifferent to the price they pay to stay warm:
British Gas shares lost only 2 1/2 p, closing the week at 297 1/2 p.
In this, as in other respects, investors proved willing to offer companies,
and the chancellor, the benefit of the doubt. Spring weather, favourable
economic statistics, a strengthening pound, and a Budget speech which made a
nod in the direction of future austerity - together these left traders eager
to set their darker thoughts aside.
Still, Coleridge's willing suspension of disbelief is a transitory
experience. At the end of the play, the audience leaves the theatre; at the
end of the story the reader puts the book down. Just how long can this
particular outbreak of poetic faith be expected to last?

FT  20 MAR 93 / Magicians of the little red box: Last Tuesday marked the end
of the traditional March financial ritual. Malcolm Rutherford reflects on
eight ex-chancellors who took the starring role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY HAVE not formed a dining club, but there is a remarkable number of
former UK chancellors around: eight altogether. Some were obviously more
successful than others, although none was successful throughout and even the
'problems of success,' as Edward Heath called them, brought pain in their
wake.
Talking to the ex-chancellors leads to a sense of continuity. All have dealt
with the weakness of sterling; nearly all have had difficulties in
controlling public spending and, in varying degrees, they have all doubted
the accuracy of the figures on which their actions are based. For some, the
annual Budget and even the annual public expenditure exercise are not their
central task. For much of the time, they are simply reacting to events.
The most youthfully enthusiastic of the former chancellors is the oldest:
Lord Thorneycroft, now 83. The most intriguing, historically, is Lord Barber
 -if only because he has remained so silent since. The four most effective
were, in different ways, Roy Jenkins, Denis Healey, Geoffrey Howe and Nigel
Lawson: two Labour men and two Tories.
James Callaghan had to deal with circumstances beyond his control, but found
the experience useful when he went on to higher things. John Major delivered
only one Budget before becoming prime minister. Last Tuesday's was Norman
Lamont's third. For what it is worth, recent precedent suggests that
chancellors rarely resign and are sacked even less often.
If you omit Iain Macleod, who died in 1970 after 31 days in the post, the
average length in office, between the return of a Labour government in 1964
and Lawson's resignation in October 1989, was more than four years. Until
Lawson departed over exchange-rate policy, the only post-war chancellor who
resigned was Thorneycroft. No chancellor has been sacked since Selwyn Lloyd
in 1960.
Whether Thorneycroft achieved anything by going is still a matter of intense
debate in the higher reaches of the Tory party. He resigned from Harold
Macmillan's cabinet in early 1958 over public expenditure which he judged
was - note the figure - Pounds 50m too high.
Thorneycroft says that he has never had any regrets. 'Harold was a
delightful man, but he was a big spender . . . I resigned when I knew that
we couldn't go on continuously and regularly overstretching our resources.'
He denies the rumour which emanated from Downing Street at the time - that
he was put up to it by Enoch Powell and Nigel Birch, who went with him. It
was his own doing, he insists. He and the prime minister agreed to put the
public expenditure matter to the full cabinet. The prime minister won and
the Treasury lost. That meant that the chancellor's authority was in danger
of being undermined in all future spending arguments. It also illustrates a
cardinal rule: if the prime minister and the chancellor are working well
together, politics should be relatively smooth; if they are not, there is
likely to be trouble.
The Thorneycroft resignation remains of interest in other ways. 'I'm not a
rich man,' he says, but when he looks around his Eaton Square flat you know
that 'rich' means 'super-rich'. Very few modern ministers can easily afford
to put principle first.
Heath's first choice of chancellor was Macleod, who was ready to introduce
value added tax. When Macleod died, he turned to Tony Barber, a successful
former party chairman, and former treasury minister, then in the cabinet as
chancellor of the duchy and just starting the negotiations on Britain's
entry to the European Community. Barber remained chancellor for the rest of
the Heath government. It was not a happy time.
Heath and Barber never had that close relationship between prime minister
and chancellor that seems essential at least to the appearance of good
government. It was a period of sudden policy lurches: from Selsdon Man and
economic laissez-faire to prices and incomes control, and Heath tended to
rely on senior civil servants such as Sir William Armstrong rather than on
ministers. 'It was even more of a 'yes man' cabinet than Mrs Thatcher's,'
says Lawson.
Barber admits now that he thought more than once of resigning. He 'hated'
the prices and incomes policy, but was persuaded, as were many other
free-market Tories at the time, that there was nothing better available.
What prompted thoughts of resignation was the continuing rise in public
expenditure, but he remembered Thorneycroft and concluded that his
resignation had not achieved anything.
Nevertheless, the Barber stewardship was eventful. He introduced VAT in his
1971 Budget, but did not heed the advice of good friends in Europe: two
youngish finance ministers called Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut
Schmidt. Giscard advised him to set a uniform rate as high as possible
straightaway, with a minimum number of exemptions. That was the way to avoid
storing up trouble for the future. The chancellor replied that it was not
practical because Britain had no history of a sales tax.
Possibly he had an eye for talent. When Barber left politics for banking in
1974, he chose as his bag carrier and personal assistant an almost unknown
young man called John Major. And it was his determination to give up the
House of Commons at the next election that perhaps helped him to stay calm
as chancellor.
In early 1973, Barber presided over an unprecedented year-on-year economic
growth rate of 10.5 per cent. That was the Barber boom. By December that
year, he was introducing a draconian programme of spending cuts. Healey, the
Labour chancellor who took over from Barber, says that he left a mess like
the Augean Stables behind him.
Yet, by British standards, Barber had inherited an unusually healthy economy
from Jenkins in 1970 with the first surplus in the PSBR since 1936-37 -
though also the last until Lawson. Jenkins had become chancellor in late
1967 following devaluation and the departure of Callaghan.
In his book Time and Chance, Callaghan describes the loneliness of it all:
'I have never experienced anything more frustrating than sitting at the
chancellor's desk watching our currency reserves gurgle down the plughole
day by day and knowing that the drain could not be stopped. I could not even
share the misery with others.'
Like Lamont with the 'green shoots of recovery,' there was a phrase he came
to regret. 'We are back on course. The ship is picking up speed. Steady as
she goes]' he said in his 1967 Budget. Devaluation came six months later.
After that, there was never any question that he would stay on, nor did he
wish to do so. Roy Jenkins succeeded him.
Jenkins recalls now that he was 'totally indispensable' to the Labour prime
minister, Harold Wilson. 'I had the power of an H-bomb over him,' he says
and sounds as if he wished he had used it. Certainly he regrets that he was
not decisive enough with his first Budget.
To gain the benefits of devaluation, he suggested bringing the 1967 Budget
forward to mid-February and combining it with an announcement of expenditure
cuts.
All official advice was against him because the Treasury has never liked the
idea of a unified Budget, and Jenkins allowed himself to be overruled.
Besides, said the Treasury, it was impossible to construct a Budget without
waiting for the short-term economic forecasts.
Jenkins has less admiration for the Treasury mystique and conventions than
most former chancellors. 'It's not the smooth purring Rolls-Royce machine
that is often supposed,' he says.
He found that there were better officials at other departments though he
does single out for praise Sir Douglas Allen (later Lord Croham) as his
permanent secretary and one or two others. He thought the secrecy was
excessive and regularly ignored it. Once he lost the daily briefing paper on
the gold and foreign exchange reserves that was for his and the prime
minister's eyes only: he expected it to turn up in a newspaper, but nothing
happened. 'In those days the Treasury was obsessed by those figures.' In
Budget-making he took the unprecedented step of consulting some of his
cabinet colleagues, once even including Tony Benn.
What struck him most was how quickly the economy could turn round. In his
stewardship the balance of payments went rapidly from deficit to surplus,
but it can turn back just as fast. And if Jenkins had known the recovery
would be so rapid, he would not have gone on raising taxes in the 1969
Budget after a record rise in 1968.
Being chancellor breeds a weary cynicism about figures. Even when Jenkins
took on the beginnings of monetary policy, he was careful to describe the
theory as 'arcane.'
By the mid-1970s, Healey was facing the same sort of currency and spending
problems that had confronted Callaghan. Healey remains unrepentant, although
his manner has mellowed with time. Thatcher used to speak of him as an
'amoral thug.' Nowadays, he is one of the few people to speak
sympathetically of Heath. The only regrets he expressed were that he did not
find it easier to work more closely with Jenkins (Jenkins, Healey and Heath
were at Balliol College, Oxford, together), and that the government had not
been more flexible in its incomes policy. Its 5 per cent norm led to the
'winter of discontent' in 1979.
Healey remains scathing about Treasury numbers and forecasts: 'The figures
are always wrong or out of date.' The estimate for the public sector
borrowing requirement which led to the loan from the IMF was far too high.
But he is still glad he went to the fund because it 'put the seal' on cuts
he wanted to make, anyway.
The IMF episode led to a notable change in Budget-making: for the first
time, all cabinet ministers debated the contents in advance and secrecy
seemed to have been abandoned. The change did not last.
Healey's innovation was the gradual introduction of monetary policy. He says
he learned in the army that 'you can't work without a plan, but you must
know that the plan will work. You must take money seriously.' He was perhaps
the first chancellor to do so. Like Jenkins after devaluation, he was
surprised by how quickly the economy turned round after the IMF loan. For
the rest, Healey remains convinced that the root British problem is the
class system.
It was Callaghan as prime minister in 1979 who noted that the tide had
turned against high taxes, and Labour duly lost office. Howe, as the new
Tory chancellor, recalls that after cutting the top and standard rates of
income tax in his first Budget he was cheered by the British Airways crew
when he flew to the Tokyo summit and applauded by Labour councillors in his
constituency, in spite of having raised VAT. It was his 1980 Budget,
however, which set a new discipline. The medium-term financial strategy then
introduced 'imposed a framework from which I could not have escaped even if
I had wanted to.'
The stir over the MTFS was as nothing compared with the Budget in 1981. Howe
raised taxes at a time of recession. Thatcher was 'shattered,' but he did it
because the government's fiscal position was getting out of hand. At the
same time, Howe predicted an average economic growth rate of only 1 per cent
for years. Yet, by mid-1982 the recession was over and the forecasts had
been shown to be wrong again.
For the 1982 Budget, he made an innovation that has stuck. Early in the new
year, he called treasury ministers and officials to Chevening, a government
residence in Kent, for Budget discussions; this has become the norm. Only
after that do the weekly discussions between chancellor and PM get under
way.
Lawson's Budgets are sufficiently recent not to need a summary save to say
that he would have been even more of a reforming chancellor if Thatcher had
approved more of his proposals earlier. He is the perfect example of the
rule that when relations between chancellor and prime minister go well, it
is good for the government - and also of the reverse. Up to the 1987
election and slightly after, they were satisfactory. Afterwards, they went
into sharp decline, leading to his resignation in 1989. But he found a novel
way of telling the PM of his initial Budget thinking: he and and his wife
would invite Thatcher and her husband to an informal dinner around the end
of January.
Yet, Lawson's own initial approach was remarkably prudent: one penny off the
basic rate of income tax in 1986 (a decision taken only a few days before
the Budget), and two pennies in 1987. 'What a lot you got]' said The Sun.
The bigger cuts came after the 1987 election.
Other reforms, such as the broadening of VAT and the phasing-out of mortgage
interest relief, were limited by Thatcher, who had more of an eye for voters
than an efficient tax system. Lamont, who was for several years Lawson's
chief secretary, thinks that his old boss left a lot still to be done. In
particular, he has a hankering for the negative income tax, which combines
taxes and benefits, that was much studied by the Heath government.
Before Lamont took over, there was the brief interlude of chancellor John
Major. He presided over only one Budget, but could have made a permanent
mark with the introduction of Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts)
which are a Treasury favourite for further development. Major says that the
ideal qualities for a chancellor are 'a long view and a thick skin.'
One fact about Major might surprise: he is an advocate of total Budget
secrecy, which this year has been tighter than ever. There is no intention
of loosening the secrecy when the government moves to the unified Budget in
November.
Can that be viable? Nobody knows. The process of preparing and presenting
tax and spending proposals together will involve much wider consultations
and, therefore, leave room for arguments and possibly leaks. Most former
chancellors are, at best, lukewarm about the idea. Lawson is against it. He
thinks tax must be seen to be handled separately, and that unification will
lead to huge administrative problems in the Treasury.
But something on which everyone agrees is that the determination to press
ahead with unification has come from the present chancellor. 'The merit does
not lie in the originality of the idea,' says Lamont (it was proposed in the
Armstrong Report of 1980), 'but in the fact that it is being implemented.'
Not all former chancellors regard the Budget as their most important act.
They like the mystique, they want to be popular and take credit if their
name is attached to a lasting reform. But most of the interesting
developments take place between Budgets.
Remember the remark by Macmillan: 'Preparing a Budget is like using last
year's timetable to catch a train.' Then there is the forthright advice from
Thorneycroft. 'A government needs one main objective. This year, it should
be how to deal with unemployment.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / The Long View: Living Pounds 1,000 beyond our means
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK the Budget Red Book truly lived up to its unofficial name, showing
projected deficits on a scale not seen since the 1970s.
The government that was once committed to a balanced budget is set to borrow
Pounds 50bn (some 8 per cent of gross domestic product) in the coming
financial year and on its central projection will still be borrowing at the
rate of Pounds 30bn a year (nearly 4 per cent of GDP) in 1997-98.
Whereas last year, just before the election, the Treasury projected a return
to medium-term balance on the basis of incredible economic growth
assumptions, this time the growth looks more plausible but the borrowing is
unbelievable.
In practice it will all work out some other way, and that certainly appeared
to be the assumption in the gilt-edged market which scarcely batted an
eyelid this week at the prospect of perhaps Pounds 140bn of net new issues
being unloaded on to it over the next four years, doubling the volume of
outstanding paper.
Perhaps, indeed, the adjustment will take place through deep cuts in public
spending, or extension of VAT to newspapers, children's clothing and a lot
more, or by some other means which gilt holders would also view
enthusiastically. But there are darker possibilities.
Taken literally, the prediction of a 2 per cent inflation rate at the end of
the 1990s implies that the government proposes to borrow at a real rate of
some 6 per cent when it issues fixed income gilts (although it can get away
with about 3 1/2 per cent on index-linkers). When a country borrows at a
real interest rate greater than the rate of economic growth the burden of
the debt will keep on growing even if the budget returns to balance. Debt is
rarely repaid on any scale, so in these circumstances eventual default is
almost inevitable, usually achieved behind the smokescreen of restructuring
or inflation.
This week Norman Lamont required future generations of British taxpayers to
assume the burden of the nearly Pounds 1,000 a head by which we propose, as
a nation, to live beyond our means in 1993-94. Those future taxpayers have
not had the opportunity to give their consent, and they may decline to pay.
True, some unexpected bonus, such as a surge of economic growth, may yet
retrieve the situation. The budget deficit melted away in the late 1980s, in
an unpredicted way. The overall debt burden does not yet compare with that
of, say, Italy.
Those sturdy British citizens of the next millennium may grit their teeth
and dutifully pay the postponed taxes of the wretched victims of the 1990s
depression. It is more likely, however, that we will face some kind of
capital market discontinuity, of which there are two excellent examples in
recent British history.
One was in 1976 when Denis Healey as Labour chancellor was manfully
attempting to run deficits which would offset the vast surpluses of the
oil-producing countries. The 1975-76 budget deficit reached Pounds 10.3bn,
or 9 per cent of GDP, and the first estimate of the borrowing requirement
for 1976-77 was Pounds 12bn (the equivalent of Pounds 60bn in relation to
the UK's current money GDP). The trade deficit appeared to be running at 1.5
per cent of GDP (actually less than the near 3 per cent current account
deficit now officially forecast for 1993).
In the end the markets concluded that the strategy was unbelievable.
Gilt-edged investors went on strike, the stock market went into free fall
and sterling collapsed. By September Healey had to call in the IMF. The
irony of it all was that the figures were hopelessly pessimistic; in the end
the PSBR was little more than Pounds 8bn and the trade gap was less than 1
per cent of GDP.
The other example came only last year when the UK's position within the
European exchange rate mechanism became unsustainable. To hold sterling's
parity against the D-Mark interest rates needed to be very high, but the
British economy was not strong enough to cope. An attempt to raise rates
then became, once again, unbelievable.
At that time the crisis revolved around short-term interest rates and the
foreign exchange market. The future problem would centre upon long-term
rates and the debt market, but might be essentially similar in its nature:
investors would require higher rates in order to take up the ever-mounting
debt, but the future burden of higher borrowing costs would appear
impossible for a sluggish economy to sustain.
The positive aspect of all this is that out of crisis can come common sense.
In 1976 and 1992 the collapse of confidence in the financial markets forced
the politicians to abandon dangerous policies. Norman Lamont,too, might need
to be forced into prudence.
In late 1976 and early 1977 there was an astonishing turnround in sentiment
as the markets responded to the spending cuts required by the IMF. In 1993
the markets are assuming, quite reasonably, that the Red Book projections
imply that eventual corrective action will be triggered. However, in certain
respects Lamont, burdened by 3m unemployed and an elusive recovery, is worse
off than Healey, who had to contend only with just 1.3m jobless (though this
was a high figure at the time) and who - whatever the environment of
financial crisis - luxuriated in an economic growth rate of 3.7 per cent for
calendar 1976.
Might a future chancellor, like Lamont last year, be tempted or even forced
to break out of his straitjacket? He would do it this time by suspending the
full funding rule entirely, inflating the money supply and going for growth
on the basis of a weakening exchange rate.
He would no doubt be idolised by the tabloid press, which this week viewed
Lamont's tax increases, deferred though they were, with grotesque alarm. But
he would still need to borrow and could never escape the grip of the
markets. The Red Book is surely overdoing the red ink.

FT  20 MAR 93 / US to delay trade sanctions against EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday agreed to postpone sanctions against the European
Community, due to be implemented on Monday in a public contracts dispute,
until after another round of negotiations in Brussels starting on March 29.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, also said in
Washington he had been assured that the Clinton administration would seek an
extension of its 'fast-track' authorisation in trade negotiations 'until the
end of this year'. Mr Delors said he appreciated the US 'gesture' of
postponing the sanctions.
Mr Hugo Paeman, the EC's chief trade negotiator, said in Brussels yesterday
the US decision had greatly improved the atmosphere in which the forthcoming
Brussels meeting between the two trade representatives would take place. It
would also aid him in the preparatory discussions he would have in
Washington next week, he said.
The sanctions, over US access to the EC government procurement market, would
deny European companies the right to bid on US government contracts for
electric power equipment, telecommunications and other services. This could
cost EC companies an estimated Dollars 40m-Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m-Pounds
35m) a year in lost business. The US is demanding a waiver of article 29 of
the new Utilities Directive, which gives EC companies a 3 per cent
preference on contract bids.
The row is the first public face-off between the US and the EC, and may set
the tone for a number of nascent disputes over issues such as Airbus
subsidies and steel trade.
A joint US-EC statement yesterday said Mr Delors had indicated 'the EC's
desire to find a mutually satisfactory solution' when Mr Mickey Kantor, the
US trade representative, visits Brussels later this month.
The statement also said the US and the EC agreed to negotiate 'a
significantly larger market access package in both goods and services as the
first order of business in the renewed Uruguay Round negotiations'.
The US administration has previously said it would seek from Congress a
fast-track extension but has not said for how long. An extension to the end
of the year should allow the US and its largest trading partners to launch a
final drive to complete the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Delors apparently emphasised that he sought closer transatlantic
co-operation in his discussions with US president Bill Clinton on Thursday.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Inflation rate rises after end of sales season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH retail price inflation edged higher last month, boosted by more
expensive food and petrol and a bounce-back in prices after the January
sales.
Prices rose in February by 0.7 per cent from the previous month, taking the
year-on-year rate of inflation to 1.8 per cent, slightly higher than in
January when it was 1.7 per cent. This was the first rise in the annual rate
since April last year.
The RPI excluding mortgage interest payments, an underlying measure favoured
by the Treasury, rose by 0.6 per cent in February. On this basis, the annual
rate rose to 3.4 per cent from 3.2 per cent.
In spite of the February figure, prices are still rising at their slowest
rate for 25 years and underlying inflation remains within the government's
target range of 1 to 4 per cent.
Foreign exchange markets concluded that the rise in the inflation rate would
discourage another interest rate cut. The pound rose a pfennig on the news,
but later slipped to close at DM2.4325, down  3/4 of a pfennig on the day.
Sentiment towards the pound, which gained five pfennigs this week, remained
positive after some mildly encouraging economic data, including a rise in
manufacturing output, a drop in unemployment and higher retail sales. Mr
Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said there were signs
that economic recovery was beginning. 'On the balance of probability both we
and independent forecasters now believe that the outlook is for growth,' he
said.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said inflation was set to rise and
that value added tax increases in the Budget would push up the RPI in April
next year when they were introduced.
Although the Treasury said it was not unduly worried by the rise, it warned
that the chancellor would continue to operate interest rate policy to keep
inflation within its target range.
The Central Statistical Office said much of the increase in prices last
month reflected a rebound from January's sales.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Foreign share of Japan's chip market rises sharply to 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
FOREIGN manufacturers' share of the Japanese semiconductor market jumped to
20.2 per cent in the fourth quarter last year.
This matches the target increasingly focused on by the US in its efforts to
force open Japan's electronics market. It reduces the risk of an acrimonious
row during bilateral talks in Hawaii this weekend.
US semiconductor makers welcomed the news yesterday, especially as most
forecasts put the likely foreign market share in the fourth quarter at about
17.5 per cent.
The share reached 15.9 per cent in the third quarter of 1992, at that stage
the highest level since the 1986 bilateral semiconductor agreement was
signed, when foreign chip sales accounted for 8 per cent of the Japanese
market.
The unexpected fourth-quarter jump fulfils the 1991 semiconductor agreement
with the US, indicating that foreign market share would grow to more than 20
per cent by the end of 1992.
The Japanese government has argued, however, that a 20 per cent market share
was not a commitment, but an 'expectation' by the semiconductor industry.
An official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the
increased market share was 'due to the strong efforts of both the US and
Japanese semiconductor industries'. Japanese industry increased foreign
purchases even though domestic semiconductor shipments were 'very low', he
said.
The outcome takes the heat out of what was shaping up to be a bruising
meeting in Hawaii tomorrow, the first formal meetings between US and
Japanese trade officials since President Bill Clinton took office in
January. There were fears that a figure below 20 per cent would prompt
demands for trade sanctions.
The US semiconductor industry is now concerned that the higher market share
in Japan should be sustained. US industry executives said much of the
increase may be due to a shrinking market in Japan. 'A temporary improvement
will not resolve the issue,' said Mr Alan Wolff, counsel to the US
Semiconductor Industry Association.
The Japanese consumer electronics sector, in particular, has been hard hit
by the slowing Japanese economy. While this has reduced the overall size of
the Japanese chip market, it has had little impact on US chip imports.
Officials are concerned the rise in market share may be reversed as consumer
electronics sales pick up in Japan.

FT  20 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of peace talks between BA and Virgin is decidedly damaging
given the delicate relations between the US and UK in aviation matters.
Virgin may be over-egging its case, but BA has damaged its own cause by
extending the uncertainty.
BA's shareholders may well ask why their company is prepared to pay Pounds
4m in compensation for a 'dirty-tricks campaign' which it insists was
relatively minor. But their main concern has been to see the episode
resolved. If BA has been fully frank, it should have nothing to fear by
dropping its 'gagging' clause. Its best defence in any future regulatory
disputes would then be that it had recognised past misdemeanours,
compensated Virgin and acted to prevent their recurrence.

FT  20 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Life Assurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading's proposals for greater disclosure in the life
assurance market is good news for consumers. The same cannot be said for
life companies. Those selling through independent financial advisers and
with high expenses may find the odds stacked against them. That points to a
further squeeze on small mutual life offices, which enjoy neither broad
distribution nor economies of scale.
Banks and companies which sell life products through them may be the
beneficiaries. Low expenses and a customer base which overlaps with IFAs
should leave them well placed to poach new business. But the case is by no
means clear-cut. Low costs have allowed bancassurance companies to build fat
margins. If the OFT manages to introduce price competition, they may equally
feel the squeeze.
The likes of the Prudential and Legal &amp; General, which sell through large
direct sales forces, should feel secure. The OFT has abandoned any hope of
unravelling commissions paid to salesmen or tied agents. There is always the
worry, though, that consumers presented with more information on the cost of
life assurance may turn to other savings products instead. With the life
assurance sector at an all-time high relative to the market, that risk has
hardly been discounted.

FT  20 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson/Costain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor old Costain seems unable to get anything right. Having agreed to sell
its Australian coal to Hanson, it then accepted a better offer from Altus.
When Hanson sued, Costain confidently decided to fight. When Costain lost,
it appealed. Now it has backed down and settled on the original terms with
Hanson. Shareholders may receive slightly more in sterling since the pound
has fallen and the net worth of the assets has gone up. But that hardly
makes up for such a public display of cack-handed management.
Hanson, by contrast, must be relieved to have won something after a rather
lean spell. The deal usefully expands Peabody's low-sulphur coal interests
outside the US. But whatever the wrangles with Costain, buying Australian
coal looks easy compared to getting involved with British Coal. Any further
expansion of Peabody is unlikely to involve the UK.
Costain's bankers will be pleased to see the money safely in. But given that
US legal action was always going to be a drawn out affair, Costain should
have made sure it could stay the course before it went to court.

FT  20 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Rating recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The feeling that interest rates have stopped falling grew stronger this
week. Retail sales, building society figures and yesterday's inflation
statistics all added to the picture of a frail but gathering recovery. Even
the bizarre fall in unemployment and the rise in sterling lent support. The
Budget speech also suggested that the government is less panicky about
growth, and Mr Lamont looks like a man quietly waiting for something to turn
up.
With rates stuck at 6 per cent - at least for a while - the gilt market may
have to give up some ground. It has been travelling hopefully in the
expectation of ever-lower rates, and yields, particularly at short
maturities, now look too low. Indeed, if the chancellor seriously intends
the banks and building societies to help him fund the Pounds 50bn borrowing
requirement he will need a bigger gap between base rates and three-year gilt
yields.
That leaves equities relying on recovery rather than lower rates for
support. Hopes of growth will certainly prop up UK cyclical stocks, and the
market as a whole may manage earnings growth of 20 per cent in 1993. High
yielding shares with good dividend cover may also benefit, as pension fund
managers look for opportunities to claw back the dividend credits they have
lost to the chancellor. But companies with large continental businesses look
more vulnerable. The downturn there is going to be deep and prolonged, as
even the Bundesbank seems grudgingly to concede.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Ministers braced for rebellion on coal industry white paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is preparing to risk another political row over the coal
industry by publishing a white paper in the next two weeks before it has won
any guarantees to keep open some of the 31 threatened pits.
Ministers want to lay the white paper before parliament by April 2 even
though they have conceded it will not be possible to conclude negotiations
with generators for coal tonnages additional to those in 'base' contracts
nearing conclusion.
Their decision comes five months after launching a coal review prompted by
the furore over the closure decision. It means that the future of thousands
of threatened miners' jobs will remain uncertain for several months longer.
It will also lay the government open to potential further rebellion by
dissident Tory MPs. Labour will charge that the all-party trade and industry
select committee was able to produce a formula for saving at least half the
31 pits by the end of January.
The date of the white paper will depend on when, and if, the negotiations
for the base contracts between British Coal and the electricity companies
can be concluded. Officials in the Department of Trade and Industry are
expected to work over the weekend to resolve remaining issues through
binding arbitration.
Although considerable progress was made in negotiations in the last two
days, some regional electricity companies are still saying they do not want
to sign anything before the white paper is published. Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, has said the contracts must be signed before
the white paper.
A compromise is likely. But even if the problems over base tonnages can be
resolved, talks with the generators for additional contracts are some way
off conclusion. It is these negotiations which will determine how many of
the 31 pits can remain open.
The white paper will stress that the future of mines should be determined by
the market. It is likely to offer the prospect of providing subsidies to
keep open some of the threatened pits but will leave the detail of how many
to the outcome of negotiations between British Coal and the generators.
This is likely to take several months. Meanwhile, as a prelude to
privatisation of the coal industry, the government will arrange for private
mining companies to lease pits which are not wanted by British Coal. Leasing
talks cannot begin before the white paper is published.

FT  20 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow's witching hour spell
disappoints

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equity prices barely moved yesterday afternoon, as the triple witching
expiration of options and futures failed to move the market dramatically,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 5.94 higher at 3471.58. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, was off 1.46 at 450.43, while
the Amex composite was up 1.25 at 422.37.
The Nasdaq composite, which failed to keep pace with the big board's gains
on Thursday, fell 4.69 at 682.72. Trading volume on the NYSE was about 294m
shares and declines outnumbered rises by 1,038 to 830.
The simultaneous expiration of stock index futures, index options and
options on individual stocks had little impact on morning trading, although
it generally creates volatility later in the day.
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 58 3/4 in
active trading after announcing the surprise resignation of Mr Gilbert
Williamson, the chairman of its NCR computer unit.
Whirlpool slipped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 52 1/4 after the company said
that charges related to its wholly-owned financial services subsidiary would
reduce first quarter after-tax earnings by Dollars 40m.
The charges relate to a write-down of specific accounts, largely in its
aerospace portfolio.
In the first quarter of 1992, Whirlpool earned Dollars 35m, or 50 cents a
share. Drug company stocks remained active in NYSE trading. Merck eased
Dollars  3/8 to a 52-week low of Dollars 35 7/8 and Glaxo Holdings laost
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18.
Shares in Lewis Galoob Toys firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 3 7/8 on its
plans to buy Diversified Specialist with financing from a two-year credit
facility.
Ford added Dollars  1/2 to a 52-week high of Dollars 52 1/8 , Chrysler rose
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 40 and General Motors moved Dollars  3/8 higher to
Dollars 40 1/8 .
In Nasdaq trading, shares in JB Hunt Transport plummeted Dollars 3 3/8 to
Dollars 18 1/8 in heavy turnover after predicting lower-than-expected first
quarter earnings because of bad weather and high fuel prices.
Digital Microwave jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 11 1/4 , a 52-week high,
after Alex Brown increased its investment rating on the stock to 'buy' from
'hold'. Alex Brown reduced its predicted 1993 loss for the company.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices finished the week on a positive note, closing the day
higher in heavy trading.
The composite index rose 17.70 points, or 0.5 per cent to close at 3576.99.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 367 to 269. Volume was 62.933 shares,
up from Thursday's 44.338 shares, and trading value meanwhile rose to
CDollars 589.4m from CDollars 448.7m.
For the week, the stock exchange rose about 29 points. Eleven of 14 stock
groups closed higher.

FT  20 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fiat speculation takes centre
stage in Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY on the Continent was generally strong ahead of the weekend, writes
Our Markets Staff.
MILAN turned its attention to Fiat after another report, this time in
Business Week magazine, that it was about to sell a 40 per cent stake to
Renault. The report was denied by both companies but, said Mr Guiseppe
Bonini of Intersim in Milan, after a week out of the news, the market was
sensitive to stories about the motor group.
The latest report, following a 50 per cent rise in the Fiat share price over
the last two months, which was not justified by fundamentals, had left
investors again thinking that 'an announcement of some sort must be on the
way,' he added.
Fiat gained L171 to settle at L5,597 before continuing to L5,820 after
hours.
The rise was enough to spark a sharp early rally in a market that was also
supported by the denial by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of reports that
Prime Minister Giuliano Amato had come close to resigning. The Comit index
closed down 0.56 at 496.66, or 3.4 per cent lower on the week.
Banca Commerciale, which the government has said it will privatise after
Credito Italiano, led the downturn, falling L156 to settle at L4,530, before
dropping to L4,464 after-hours.
FRANKFURT was slightly firmer on a day that was dominated by the expiration
of options. However, the expected volatility in equities failed to
materialise and the DAX index finished 2.62 higher at 1,698.81, down 0.5 per
cent on the week. Turnover swelled to DM20.5bn from DM6.2bn.
Reaction to Thursday's cut in the discount rate was generally muted. Mr
James Cornish of NatWest Securities in London commented that the course
steered by the Bundesbank would allow 'market rates in Germany and elsewhere
to come down, probably with next week's repo. But it also conveys
dissatisfaction with current levels of inflation and Bonn's efforts to cut
spending.'
Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley added that while last weekend's solidarity
agreement was good news for the market it was not enough 'to address the
underlying structural causes of Germany's recession'. With construction
workers currently seeking pay rises of some 7 per cent, further rate cuts,
he noted, were unlikely unless there was a settlement of around 3-4 per cent
and further progress in reducing inflation.
In the corporate sector Asko was one of the day's strongest performers with
a rise of DM55 or 8 per cent to DM710 on slightly improved sales.
PARIS went into the election weekend little changed on the day and the week:
the CAC-40 index closing 0.83 lower at 1,962.69.
With a victory for the centre-right widely forecast analysts have turned
their attention to the effect a new government will have on the markets.
With the franc under pressure on the currency markets speculators are
expected to mount further attacks next week when the country is in a
transitional state ahead of the second round of voting on 28th March -
volatility in equities may be expected.
Credit Lyonnais CI's were active, rising FFr35 to FFr575 on speculation that
a new government might seek changes at the top of the management structure.
Carnaud Metalbox was another high volume stock, although the shares closed
just 90 centimes lower at FFr224.90 as bid hopes abounded. Elsewhere in
second liners Skis Rossignol put on FFr91 or 9 per cent to FFr1,070 in very
high volume which some analysts were unable to understand.
ZURICH derived strength from Thursday's move to lower domestic interest
rates and a clutch of corporate results and the market closed at an all-time
high. The SMI index rose 28.5 to 2,182.6, for a 0.8 per cent rise on the
week.
'The market had not been expecting the SNB to follow the Bundesbank's lead
and cut rates, but it proved a very positive move,' said Miss Felicity Smith
at Hoare Govett in London.
Holderbank bearers - the day's most active issue - gained SFr12 to SFr662 on
better than expected 1992 figures.
Nestle, reporting next Wednesday, saw its bearers rise SFr30 to SFr1,185.
Shares in machine maker Georg Fischer fell SFr15 to SFr760 after news of a
74 per cent plunge in 1992 profits and an announcement that the machine
maker was omitting its dividend.
AMSTERDAM was slightly stronger, helped by a firmer dollar, and the CBS
Tendency index gained 0.1 to 107.7, closing a good week 3.3 per cent higher.
Ahold was among the losers as investors reacted to its announcement on
Thursday of a 1-for-10 rights issue, slipping Fl 1.00 to Fl 94.40.
STOCKHOLM was heartened by signs that the opposition Social Democrats were
willing to negotiate with the centre-right government over economic policy.
The Affarsvarlden index ended 7.8 down at 1,007.2, for a weekly decline of
0.5 per cent.
DUBLIN's central bank cut short-term interest rates and the market responded
with a rise in the ISEQ overall index of 39.58 or 2.8 per cent to 1,461.48.
COPENHAGEN was depressed by the suspension of Baltica, the country's biggest
insurer, and the KFX index shed 0.73 to 80.83 in turnover of DKr493m.

FT  20 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo falls 1 per cent
in cautious trade
</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS adopted a cautious attitude in Tokyo, but Germany's rate cut
together with expectations of more economy-boosting steps by the government
underpinned the market, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The Nikkei index fell 190.73 or 1.02 per cent to 18,537.17 - for a weekly
rise of 2.7 per cent - in volume of 620m shares, compared with Thursday's
650m.
The market opened firmer following Thursday's rally, with the Nikkei peaking
at 18,835.96, 108.06 points above Thursday's close, in early trade.
But the market lost steam in mid-morning in the wake of index-linked selling
from investment trusts and profit-taking by institutional investors and the
Nikkei dipped to an intra-day low of 18,503.16 in late afternoon trade.
Declining issues led advancers by nearly four to three, with 596 lower, 462
higher and 116 unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks was down 1.57 to 1,406.69, while
in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 6.05 to 1,128.82.
A firm yen was seen to discourage foreign investors while political
uneasiness in Russia and North Korea also weighed on investors' minds. The
market also awaited February preliminary money supply figures with many
investors expecting to see modest growth.
Many large-capital steel issues gained on the firm yen. Nippon Steel rose
Y12 to Y337 and NKK Y2 to Y271. Mitsubishi Heavy, however, fell Y5 to Y537.
Brokerages rose on better-than-expected earnings forecast revisions
announced on Thursday.
Nomura gained Y50 to Y1,890, Nikko Y25 to Y870, Daiwa Y20 to Y1,100 and
Yamaichi Y23 to Y673.
Construction shares were higher in anticipation of greater public works
spending. Ohbayashi rose Y33 to Y570, Kajima Y21 to Y804, Shimizu Y16 to
Y896 and Tobishima Y15 to Y551.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed.
HONG KONG switched its attention away from politics, concentrating instead
on encouraging earnings reports from some of the colony's biggest companies.
The Hang Seng index finished 37.08 higher at 6,088.34, 1.3 per cent lower on
the week, in turnover of HKDollars 2.8bn.
Swire Pacific gained 75 cents to HKDollars 31.50, Cheung Kong dipped 10
cents to HKDollars 21.90 and Hutchison Whampoa rose 30 cents to HKDollars
HKDollars 16.10 in reaction to their earnings announcements late the
previous day.
AUSTRALIA began strongly, taking its lead from Wall Street's overnight
performance, but the rally was seen to run out of steam as the day
progressed. The All Ordinaries index ended 7.5 higher at 1,677.1, little
changed on the week, and showing turnover of ADollars 287.3m.
Golds were strong, led by a 7 cent gain by Normandy Poseidon to ADollars
1.51. TNT sold 27.7m options in Normandy, completing its exit from the
group.
News Corp rose 9 cents to ADollars 7.68 on news that it had filed a shelf
offering of up to USDollars 1bn of debt securities with the US Securities
and Exchange Commission.
SINGAPORE closed easier but above the day's low after weakening on rumours
that deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's health was worsening.
The Straits Times Industrial index fell by 17 points at one stage but
rebounded to end 4.01 lower at 1,664.78, little changed on the week.
NEW ZEALAND staged a subdued advance which left the NZSE-40 index 9.94 ahead
at 1,590.27 but in low turnover of NZDollars 21m.
Air New Zealand continued to fare badly, the A shares ending down 6 cents at
NZDollars 1.88, a 24 per cent decline since February 1.
BOMABY's BSE index fell 16.82 to 2,376.76 as many investors continued to
liquidate holdings built up before last month's budget.

FT  20 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Paris gathers pace on hopes of new rate
cuts - Alice Rawsthorn finds that optimism is returning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance the prospects for the Paris stock market are scarcely
scintillating, given that a new government is poised to take power against a
backdrop of high interest rates, a vulnerable currency, stagnant industrial
output and a bad set of financial figures.
However, the CAC-40 index, which was stubbornly static last year, has
already risen by about 8 per cent this year.
Most analysts are now confident that it will rise further during the rest of
the year. 'We are more optimistic about France than all the other major
European markets,' said Mr Richard Davidson, European equities strategist at
Morgan Stanley in London. 'The CAC-40 index has moved ahead in the first few
months of this year and we'd expect it to rise as high as 2,300 by the year
end.'
Analysts base their optimism on the expectation that the Bundesbank will
continue its policy of steadily reducing German interest rates, thereby
allowing the French conservatives, who seem certain to return to power after
the final round of voting in the parliamentary elections on March 28, to
follow suit. That should alleviate the pressure on the economy, enabling it
to return to recovery in early 1994.
At present France is under intense pressure because of the impact of high
real interest rates - of about 8 per cent with bank base rates at 10 per
cent and inflation running at 2.1 per cent - on consumer spending and
industrial investment.
During the first half of last year, many French companies were able to
compensate thanks to buoyant growth in exports. When the franc strengthened
after the September currency crisis, they found it much more difficult to
compete in the international marketplace.
A number of prominent French companies have recently reported 1992 results
illustrating the negative impact of the strong franc. LVMH, the luxury goods
group, this week confirmed a sharp fall in net profits partly because of
adverse exchange rates. Renault almost doubled net profits to FFr5.7bn in
1992 but fell into the red in the final quarter of the year. Michelin and
Peugeot-Citroen were also hit by the hard currency.
Meanwhile, the precarious state of the property market and the sharp rise in
business failures have aggravated the problems of many financial groups.
GAN, one of the largest insurers, warned on Wednesday of a collapse in net
profits from FFr2.3bn in 1991 to only FFr400m last year. That followed
reports of falls in profits from both Union des Assurances de Paris and the
Axa group. The banks are also in a sickly state, with the market now braced
for a grim announcement from Credit Lyonnais, which has already disclosed
that 1992 was its worst year for two decades.
The rate of real GDP growth in France fell in the final quarter of last year
for the first time since the Gulf war. The Bank of France's business surveys
suggest that industrial output probably fell in January and stabilised in
February. That raises the threat of a second successive quarterly fall in
real GDP during the first three months of this year, which would mean that
the economy was technically in recession.
The stock market has already absorbed this gloomy news and is concerned more
with the timing of future rate cuts, than with the present problems of
French companies. 'Sooner or later French rates will fall - hence the
buoyancy of the market,' concluded the latest analysis from Flemings
Research. 'The outstanding issue is how much damage will be done to the
economy in the meantime.'
Most analysts are confident that the 'damage' will be limited. The corporate
sector does, after all, have the underlying advantage of relatively low debt
levels and industry is also reaping the benefits of the high levels of
investment during the late 1980s.
Moreover, France, thanks to the socialists' commitment to sustained low
inflation, is likely to be able to make deeper interest rates cuts than
other major economies. 'There is more leeway (in France) for an easing of
long rates than in the other Group 5 countries,' said a recent report from
Banque Indosuez in Paris.
The critical question is whether the new centre-right government will be as
zealous in its attachment to the franc fort strategy of protecting the
French currency as the socialists.
Most prominent conservatives have already made reassuring statements about
the need to sustain a strong currency.
There is, however, a possibility that the new administration could come
under pressure from the chauvinistic RPR faction led by Mr Charles Pasqua
and Mr Philippe Seguin, who championed the anti-Maastricht campaign in last
autumn's referendum.
That has triggered speculation that the next government might allow the
franc to leave the ERM, if it comes under renewed market pressure. 'The
franc will still be a strong currency even if it does leave the ERM,' said
Mr Davidson of Morgan Stanley.
'There is a possibility of its floating for a while, but its true strength
should then come out. It certainly isn't a negative influence over the
market.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: TI upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in UK engineering company TI Group were hit by reports that
Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, which filed for Chapter
11 protection in December 1990, was about to formally cancel an order for 20
Airbus aircraft.
TI's subsidiary Dowty Group, acquired by the company last year after a
bitter takeover contest, makes the landing equipment for the aircraft.
Continental was also known to have had an option on a further 26 aircraft.
The shares fell sharply in response and at the day's worst were down 15 at
308p. Analysts however pointed out that the decision would not be a surprise
and, coupled with the strong market trend, the stock recovered to close a
net 5 lower at 318p, with turnover having risen to 5.3m.
Insurance and pension group Legal &amp; General, whose results on Thursday
cheered the market, moved forward, adding 8 to 489p, after BZW upgraded
current year profit expectations.
The securities house increased its 1993 figure by Pounds 10m to Pounds 174m,
and has now pencilled in Pounds 203m for the following year. Sentiment was
improved further when BZW also advised investors to switch Prudential and
into Legal &amp; General. Shares in Prudential responded by falling 5 to 334p.
In a perky building sector, Marley continued its strong run following its
results this week. The shares gained 6 to 120p. Spring Ram, which more than
halved in price on Thursday following a profits warning, recovered to close
9 1/2 ahead at 73p in turnover of 18m.
Selected leisure stocks also benefited from a mood of recovery among
investors. Granada Group gained 5 to 371p, buoyed by continued talk that it
is poised to buy a big stake in Yorkshire Television.
Ladbroke added 8 to 205p as NatWest Securities said 'buy'. The broker
believes the group will gain from changes to the rate of ACT and the
proposed designation of foreign income dividends. As a result, NatWest
raised its EPS forecast by 6 per cent. Forte rose in sympathy, up 4 to 202p.
First Leisure jumped 8 to 370p.
Brewing stocks, which had languished after the Budget, also caught the
revivalist mood. Bass rose 8 to 585p, Allied Lyons 10 to 574p and Whitbread
'A' 13 to 479p.
The reports about Continental Airlines were said to have checked the advance
of British Aerospace from where analysts emerged from a visit with a
positive view about the prospects for the Rover car subsidiary. Following an
initial retreat, the shares closed unchanged at 280p.
Credit Lyonnais Laing was said to have raised concerns about the accounting
methods at Siebe, and was also reported to have executed an overnight sell
order in the engineering group. However, another securities house also had a
large line of stock on its books. The shares gave up 9 to 472p.
Speculation that GKN would soon be on the receiving end of an Pounds 800m
order for its Warrior armoured vehicle from Kuwait helped the shares advance
8 to 476p.
A press article on Manoplax helped maintain momentum in Boots. The shares
jumped 15 to 527p as the stock also continued to bask in press speculation
that the OTC market is to be restructured in favour of the larger
prescription drug companies.
WH Smith was unsettled by a sell note from NatWest Securities, the 'A'
shares falling 6 to 434p.
Food retail stocks nursed a hangover from the bearish note struck by BZW on
Thursday, the broker turning cautious about food price inflation costs. Kwik
Save was the worst casualty, retreating 9 to 824p. Asda bucked the trend as
NatWest Securities reiterated their positive stance, the shares up a half
penny to 75 3/4 p. J Sainsbury bounced back, jumping 10 to 525p.
Turnover in Hanson rose to 11m following its subsidiary Peabody's settlement
with construction group Costain. Shares in Hanson closed 2 up at 238 1/2 p,
while Costain improved 4 to 35p.
Oil shares closed an eventful Budget week with share prices under some
pressure as profits were taken and sterling strengthened against the dollar.
British Petroleum traded fairly calmly at 13m shares and managed to hold on
to the overnight quotation of 300p. Similar factors inhibited Shell which
gave up 4 to 568p in unimpressive trade of 3.8m shares.
There was activity in Lasmo, which at first gained ground but then turned
off as a seller appeared. Turnover of 5.1m shares left Lasmo 3 down at 183p.

FT  20 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: C&amp;W wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Positive news emanating from Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W) was said to be behind
two profit upgrades by brokers yesterday, sending the shares sharply
forward. BZW raised its 1993 forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 810m, and a
further Pounds 20m to Pounds 990m the year after. One other leading broker
also raised its forecasts, according to dealers.
C&amp;W has been reporting increased interest among new domestic and business
subscribers for Mercury telephone system users, with the number of new
customers estimated by analysts to have risen by about 30 per cent a month
in the group's second half. Mercury's aim to have two million customers by
the middle of 1995 is now within range, according to telecoms specialists.
That trend is likely to accelerate when Mercury introduces its 'Easy Access'
system in April, allowing subscribers to use Mercury from telephones without
the special blue Mercury button. C&amp;W shares advanced 20 to 725p in turnover
of 2.8m.

FT  20 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities put their faith in recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a strong rebound in share prices in London yesterday as investors
chose to put their faith in prospects for economic recovery and to set aside
those for further cuts in UK interest rates. Government bonds gave ground
after the announcement of a slightly sharper rise than expected in
February's Retail price index warned of inflationary pressure and apparently
weakened the chances of another base rate cut for the time being.
The FT-SE Index rose 20.4 to 2,900.1, recovering an important support level
and closing within 16 points of its Budget eve quotation. The investment
emphasis swung back towards the cyclical sectors, with building and
construction, motors, stores and merchant banking stocks all performing
well.
Further demand for second line issues took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index up 21.4
to another all-time high of 3,154.7. Of overall Seaq volume of 824.1m
shares, around 63 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks.
Sharelink, the Birmingham-based broker which claims a large share of UK
private client business, said yesterday that private investors had been
strong buyers of equities this week. The big institutions, more concerned
with the Budget changes in Advance Corporation Tax and dividends on overseas
corporate earnings, remained subdued yesterday. NatWest Securities said
yesterday that holders of around 45 per cent of UK equities could be
affected by the changes in treatment of payments on overseas earnings.
Traders stressed that technical factors distorted the equity sector.
Mid-morning brought expiry of the March futures contract on the FT-SE Index,
when the big securities houses juggled their holdings between the futures
contract and the underlying blue chip securities. At the close, New York was
looking wary of repeating its strong overnight performance as it awaited the
Triple Witching hour, when a clutch of derivatives contracts expire
together.
After some initial hesitation, the stock market moved ahead following
completion, without undue strain, of the futures and options expiry. News
that headline inflation had recorded an annualised increase of 1.8 per cent
last month failed to check equities, although the figure was at the high end
of analysts' forecasts and undermined hopes that the Budget might also have
brought a cut in UK base rates.
Government bonds fell by around  5/8 on inflation nerves, with only
Index-linked steady. But equity strategists preferred to focus on this
week's unemployment, retail sales and industrial output data as evidence of
economic growth.

THE EXPIRY of both the March futures contract and the March index options
was the main feature in an active derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
Early selling caused initial weakness in both the March and June contracts
on the FT-SE which opened at 2,880 and 2,897 respectively.
However, the selling soon dried up leaving both contracts to move into
positive territory ahead of the expiry of March. This occured between
10.10am and 10.30 with March finishing at 2,895.5 on turnover of 6,066 lots.
Strong buying of June saw it reach 2,930 ahead of the opening on Wall Street
before it succumbed to a bout of profit-taking. The contract closed at
2,910, two points above its fair value premium to cash of about 9 points.
Volume was 11,490 contracts.
Traded options saw the expiry of the March index options. Total volume was
30,608 of which 7,221 lots were in the FT-SE 100. United Biscuits was the
most active stock option with 3,846 trades.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Re-thinking 5 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures contracts fell back sharply yesterday, after the figures
for UK inflation in February came out a little worse than expected, writes
James Blitz.
For the last two months, sterling dealers have assumed that the UK
authorities would probably bring UK base rates as low as 5 per cent to
stimulate the economic recovery.
But yesterday's retail prices index for February, which showed a headline
rise of 1.8 per cent year-on-year, raised concerns that the government might
have to lean towards tightening policy to keep inflation under control.
Indeed, the week has been dominated by signs that make another easing of UK
monetary policy much less likely. On Tuesday, the chancellor said in his
budget statement that current interest rates were consistent with the
desired level of economic growth.
On Thursday, a surprising fall in unemployment figures in the UK also raised
speculation that another easing might be unnecessary.
All these elements combined to bring down the June short sterling contract
by 9 basis points to a close of 94.22 yesterday. The September contract came
down 12 basis points to close at 94.36 and the December contract came down
11 basis points to close at 94.39.
In other words, the markets believe that, at best, 3-month sterling will
drop to 5.61 per cent this year - and this level is just about compatible
with 6 per cent base rates.
According to one London-based dealer, any speculation about a cut is based
on perceptions that Germany will aggressively ease policy this year, and
that the UK may be tempted to follow.
Sterling cash reflected the tighter tone. Three-month sterling rose to 6 per
cent from about 5.75 per cent first thing yesterday morning.
That development took place in spite of the relatively slick removal of a
Pounds 1.65bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England.
German futures meanwhile reflected a delayed reaction to Thursday's decision
by the Bundesbank to ease the discount rate by 50 basis points but to leave
the Lombard rate unchanged.
The June Euromark contract fell 4 basis points to close at 93.16 and the
September contract was down 2 basis points to close at 93.90.
Cash rates were steady, with call money at 8.58 per cent.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc remains under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH FRANC remained under pressure against the D-Mark inside the
European exchange rate mechanism yesterday as dealers continued to express
disappointment that the Bundesbank had not reduced its Lombard rate at its
council meeting on Thursday, writes James Blitz.
The French currency fell as low as FFr3.4160 against the D-Mark at around
lunchtime in London. It later closed unchanged at FFr3.4100, but still
around 2 centimes above its ERM floor against the German currency.
Another reflection of the pressure on the franc was that 1-month interest
rates rose as high as 12.5 per cent first thing in the morning and hovered
around that level throughout the day.
Dealers are clearly preparing to test the commitment of a new French
government to the franc fort policy following tomorrow's first round of
parliamentary elections. There is concern that a new administration may
float the franc in order to bring French interest rates down, although
leading right-wing politicians reasserted yesterday that they were committed
to the current parity.
A more important issue is whether the Bundesbank decides to reduce the rate
at which it lends funds to commercial banks in its weekly intervention on
Tuesday.
Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in
London, believes that a 25 basis point cut in the repo rate, currently at
8.25 per cent, will allay the pressure on the franc.
Another potential source of trouble for the French currency comes from the
peseta, which weakened against the D-Mark despite the fact that Spain was on
holiday. The peseta closed at Pta71.59 against the D-Mark from Pta71.48.
According to one dealer, the Bank of Spain has spent Dollars 5bn on
intervention in the last two weeks.
The D-Mark's strength continued to take its toll on the dollar. After
closing at DM1.6415 on Thursday night, the dollar dropped to a low of
DM1.6260 in London trading before closing at DM1.6330.
Underlying sentiment in the market remains bullish for the US currency. But
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of currency research at Swiss Banking Corporation and a
long-time dollar bear, believes the US currency will slip to DM1.52 within
the next 3 months.
Sterling rose a pfennig after poorer-than-expected inflation figures in the
UK heightened speculation that the government may lean towards tightening
monetary policy. The pound lost ground later, closing at DM2.4325 from a
previous DM2.4400.

NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group, has filed a shelf

would permit it to issue up to Dollars 1bn in debt securities, writes Kevin

News Corp said the filing would allow it to issue senior subordinated,
subordinated or senior debt securities 'from time to time' once a related
registration statement becomes effective. This is the latest in a series of
moves to raise debt and equity capital to replace bank debt acquired as part
of the group's Dollars 7.6bn restructuring in 1991.

FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Production cuts at Thyssen Stahl
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRODUCTION cuts are intensifying at Thyssen Stahl, Germany's largest steel
producer, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
Speaking at yesterday's annual meeting, Mr Heinz Kriwet, chairman of the
Thyssen group, said sales for the steel division were 20 per cent lower for
the five months ended February compared to the same period last year.
Crude steel production fell by 22 per cent. But long products suffered the
greatest setback with five-month production falling 50 per cent.
The group will lay off 9,000 workers, mostly in its steel divisions, by the
end of 1994 - up 1,000 from planned cuts announced earlier this year.
Mr Kriwet said the principal cause of the European steel crisis was the
continuing subsidies enjoyed by Italian and Spanish steel producers. He also
blamed 'unfair' competition from east European producers. For the full
Thyssen group, sales for five months fell by 10 per cent.

FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Provisions and poorly-performing
investments behind Asko setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus, the German retailer which is majority owned by
Swiss-based Metro group, blamed high provisions and poorly-performing
investments for a net group loss of DM468m (Dollars 283m) in the nine months
to the end of last September. This compares with a profit of DM6m in 1991.
However, Mr Klaus Wiegandt, chief executive, said yesterday that Asko was on
course to make 'substantial profits' during this year on sales in the region
of DM20bn. He said the group could make operating profits of DM200m, after
interest payments.
The company is paying no dividend for the nine months, its abbreviated
fiscal year. Mr Wiegandt was hopeful the group would be able to pay a
dividend for 1992-1993, but said the payout would hinge on the scale and
timing of asset sales, which are intended to raise DM800m over the remainder
of the year.
The losses for the nine months, which totalled DM648m at the parent company,
are to be offset by the group's reserves, reducing the group's
asset-to-equity ratio from 11 per cent to 3.5 per cent. The group's debts,
which stand at DM4.7bn, would be cut to less than DM2bn over the course of
the year, Asko said.
Turnover was just under DM16bn, up 12.8 per cent on the first nine months of
1991. Operating profits fell from DM328m to DM122m.
The group's poor financial condition reflects a series of acquisitions made
in the late 1980s, culminating in the purchase of the Co-op group in 1989.
The high level of provisions reflects the fact that many of the group's
investments are now worth less than when they were bought.
As indicated in January, the group is to raise money through a mixture of
outright sales and partial flotations.
Asko confirmed yesterday that Morgan Grenfell, the merchant banking
subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, has been retained to advise on the flotation of
a 25 per cent stake in the Praktiker DIY chain. Mr Wiegandt said Praktiker's
market value would be more than DM2bn.

FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Stead to take over at NCR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JERRE Stead, a fast-rising star at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, is to
take over as chairman and chief executive of NCR, AT&amp;T's computer
subsidiary, from Mr Gilbert Williamson, who is unexpectedly retiring.
Mr Williamson, who has been with NCR for 30 years, became chairman after
AT&amp;T acquired NCR in a hostile Dollars 7.4bn 1991 takeover. He oversaw the
successful integration into NCR of AT&amp;T's much weaker computer business.
He will only be 56 next month, but both NCR and AT&amp;T claimed yesterday that
the retirement from May 1 to pursue 'personal interests' was his initiative
and had not involved pressure from Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T's chairman. Mr
Allen expressed 'deep gratitude' for Mr Williamson's handling of the
integration.
However, some analysts speculated that Mr Williamson might not have moved
sufficiently quickly for AT&amp;T's liking to raise NCR's computer industry
profile in the 18 months since the merger.
Mr Stead, 50, joined AT&amp;T in September 1991 from Square D, an electrical
components company acquired by France's Groupe Schneider. He was put in
charge of AT&amp;T's loss-making business communications systems operation,
which makes office telephone equipment, and put it into the black.
Mr Stead will be succeeded at business communications systems by 39-year-old
Ms Patricia Russo, currently vice- president national sales and services for
the unit.
The acquisition of NCR was a gamble by Mr Allen that the rapid convergence
of the computer and telecommunications industries would benefit companies
with strong positions in both sectors.
So far, the merger has gone more smoothly than many on Wall Street had
predicted, but NCR has yet to prove that it is capable of sustained
market-share growth.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Cocoa
support scheme abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL COCOA Organisation delegates decided yesterday to abandon
efforts to negotiate a market stabilisation pact based on a stock
withholding scheme.
With time quickly running out for reaching an agreement that could be
ratified in time to replace the present moribund pact when it expires at the
end of September, and with wide gaps remaining between producers and
consumers on several crucial issues, the delegates decided to consider the
softer option of an agreement based on voluntary production control,
promotion of consumption and running down the organisation's 233,000-tonne
buffer stock.
A special session of the ICCO council will be held on June 8-11 to discuss
this plan, which an official described yesterday as more than an
administrative pact but well short of a full economic accord.
The announcement, which came too late to produce any response at the London
cocoa futures market, is unlikely to have come as much of a surprise to
traders, most of whom had long ago given up hope of an effective market
support pact being agreed. Late trading in New York showed little sign of a
reaction, though prices were tending lower.
Sugar continued to be the brightest star in the commodities firmament this
week as New York futures prices surged to three-year peaks and their London
counterparts to the highest levels since April 1991. The August contract in
London closed yesterday at Dollars 265.20 a tonne, up Dollars 25.20 on the
week, while New York's July contract moved above the 12 cents-a-lb mark. In
late trading it was quoted at 12.50 cents a lb, up 1.72 cents from the end
of last week and three cents from a month ago.
Having been wakened from its torpor a few weeks ago by drought-induced cuts
in the Thai crop projection - down from the initial 5m tonnes to 3.51m,
which would be the lowest level for five years - the sugar market was given
a further boost by news that Cuba had been hit by the storms that swept the
eastern seaboard of the US last weekend.
London analysts were dubious from the first about the extent of the damage
to Cuba's sugar crop, which was already expected to be well down from last
year's 7m tonnes, possibly as low as 5m tonnes. And in its daily Commodity
Report yesterday GNI, the London trade house, noted that a Cuban request for
United Nations aid revealed that 'only Dollars 46m of damage was done to the
sugar crop - or 190,000 tonnes'. That figure was well below some of the
earlier estimates, GNI said, 'and adds weight to our negative view point'.
Traders were in no mood to be dissuaded from their new-found bullishness,
however. 'The market is still tight,' one London analysts told the Reuter
news agency yesterday. 'It's on an uptrend and it has recovered a long way.'
But he was not sure that it could sustain present price levels, which
offered attractive profit-taking opportunities for speculators and might
tempt producers to sell from their stocks. 'There is a lot of material to be
sold short term and if selling begins, we could see the top of the market,'
he suggested.
In contrast, the coffee market extended last week's heavy fall. The London
Futures and Options Exchange's May robustas price closed yesterday at
Dollars 879 a tonne, up Dollars 6 on the day but Dollars 34 down on the
week. In the absence of fundamental developments traders attributed the
market's continued weakness to the high level of consumer stocks and
pessimism about the prospects for progress towards the revival of the
International Coffee Organisation's export quota system being made at next
week's London meeting.
GNI suggested yesterday that lack of enthusiasm from the US, the biggest
coffee consumer, could scupper the negotiations. 'It is likely that the US
delegation has not received a fresh mandate from (President) Clinton,' it
said in its Commodity Report, 'in which case the meetings will merely be to
set another date for talks, but if (delegates) have had word that the US
position has not changed under Clinton, then everyone might as well pack up
and go home early.'
At the London Metal Exchange tin proved the brightest spark as commission
house buying fuelled a late rally in prices. Dealers said labour unrest in
the Bolivian mining industry also provided support as an accelerating
Dollars 230 surge over three days wiped out an earlier Dollars 142.50 fall
and left the cash position at Dollars 5,755 a tonne.
The cash copper price ended Pounds 61.50 down on the week at Pounds 1,459.50
a tonne, but most of that resulted from sterling's strength against the
dollar, in terms of which the pice was only down about Dollars 12. Despite
high stocks, poor demand growth outside North America and Japanese selling
early in the week, copper made several attempts to break long-standing
resistance at just above Dollars 2,200 for three months metal. Dealers said
buyers were encouraged by concern over the situation in Zaire, labour unrest
in Chile and falls in stocks at the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex),
suggesting that output losses caused by widespread flooding in Arizona this
year had been heavier than thought earlier.
The gold price moved steadily higher this week, ending yesterday at Dollars
331.45 a troy ounce, up Dollars 3.70 on balance. But dealers expected any
closer approach to the ceiling of the recent Dollars 326/333 price range to
attract producer selling, especially as in South African rand terms the
price near a record.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: ASB alters rules for debt repurchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW RULES on the tax treatment to be adopted when a company repurchases its
own debt were issued yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board.
The change prompted Scottish Power to announce a net charge of Pounds 10.4m
in its most recent set of accounts.
The rules contained in an ASB abstract follow work by the Urgent Issues Task
Force, a unit designed to clamp down quickly on ambiguities or abuses in
existing standards.
They require any premium or discount incurred in repurchase of debt to be
written off in the year in which it is incurred, rather than amortising any
premium or discount over the period of the original life of the debt.
The only exceptions are when replacement borrowing gives the same economic
result as the original borrowing and there has been no change of substance
in the debt.
Companies are not required to implement the changes until accounting years
ending on or after June 22 1993, but Scottish Power opted to take the charge
in its 1992-93 accounts.
The company repurchased Pounds 142m of government debt in November 1992.
There was a 'significant cost saving for the company in using cash to
replace expensive, long term debt bearing interest at 11.856 per cent per
year,' explained Mr Duncan Whyte, finance director.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Gardiner shuffles board for new start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARDINER GROUP, the distributor of security and surveillance equipment,
yesterday dismissed its chief executive and announced sweeping board changes
following an investigation into a Pounds 4.8m overstatement in its 1991
accounts.
Mr Yashar Turgut has been replaced as chief executive by Mr Harvey Samson,
group finance director.
Mr Turgut's departure follows a report by accountants Price Waterhouse which
concluded that the company's accounting records had been falsified.
According to Price Waterhouse, there had been a deliberate mis-statement in
the value of the company's stocks, mainly of burglar alarms.
Mr Ian Nellist, group finance director during the period when the
mis-statement took place, 'has so far been unwilling to discuss the matter
with Price Waterhouse or the board', the company told shareholders
yesterday.
Anxious for a new start following the four-month investigation, the company
said Mr Samson would be joined on the board by Mr Richard Clemons as
chairman, replacing Mr Thomas Buffet who resigned last November; Mr Bob
Underhill, a former executive director at Stirling Group, has been named as
finance director.
Announcing a Pounds 2.05m pre-tax profit on turnover of Pounds 73.8m in the
year to October 31 1992, the company claimed it was now ready for expansion
in Britain and continental Europe.
Earnings were 1.34p and a final dividend of 0.19p makes a 0.66p (1.3p)
total.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Costain shares rise on coal sale agreement
with Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Costain, the heavily-borrowed construction and mining
group, rose by more than a tenth yesterday following an out-of-court
settlement with Peabody, a Hanson subsidiary, over the sale of Costain's
Australian coal mining businesses.
Costain originally accepted a bid from Peabody for the businesses last
October. Shortly afterwards it accepted a higher offer from Altus Finance, a
subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, for the Australian coal
mines and its Australian property interests
Peabody subsequently obtained an injunction in the US courts preventing the
sale to Altus.
The settlement with Peabody, announced late on Thursday night, is in line
with the original deal reached last October. It involves the Hanson
subsidiary paying Costain Dollars 200m (Pounds 135m) plus a net asset
adjustment of Dollars 34m which is subject to a final audit. Peabody will
also take on borrowings of ADollars 85m (Pounds 41m) owed by the Australian
coal mining operations.
Altus, which has agreed the terms of the out-of-court settlement, is
expected to receive just under Dollars 2m in compensation from Costain and
Peabody with the latter paying the higher share. All other claims for
damages and legal costs will be dropped by the three companies.
The French subsidiary had previously agreed to acquire the Australian coal
mines and properties for Dollars 245m plus an additional figure to take
account of any rise in the company's net asset value.
Costain's share price yesterday rose 4p to 35p following the removal of
uncertainty over the sale.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: TV-am fades out with a bumper Pounds 20m
profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TV-AM enjoyed bumper profits last year as it wound down its breakfast
television operations after losing the franchise and ceasing broadcasting on
New Year's Eve.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.16m, against Pounds 12.5m for the preceding 11
months, reflected a fall in staffing levels to 130 people through most of
the year compared with a peak of 400 and a 10 per cent increase in turnover
to Pounds 87m. Operating costs fell 17.7 per cent to Pounds 49.5m.
The company, which first started broadcasting on February 1 1983, lost its
franchise to GMTV, having bid Pounds 14m to renew its licence against GMTV's
Pounds 34.5m.
It attacked again yesterday the bidding system, saying 'the loss of our
licence was the result of one of the most deeply flawed Acts of Parliament
ever to reach the statute book.'
Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman, said: 'The Broadcasting Act of 1990 was not only
a bad act but it was also totally inhuman. In effect, for fourteen months
our staff had the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.'
Having failed to find other investments in television which would maintain
the same return on investment for its shareholders, the company continued
its liquidation by declaring a final dividend of 20p, making a total of 64p
(14p) for the year.
At the interim stage the company announced a 4p dividend and at Christmas
announced a further 40p interim dividend. Total dividends paid since the
company was floated in 1986 amount to 119.35p per share on a purchase price
of 65p per share.
TV-am will have finally disposed of all fixed assets by the end of March,
and is holding about Pounds 6m cash in reserve against outstanding property
rents.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brit-Borneo Petroleum surges 73%
</HEADLINE>

   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH-BORNEO Petroleum Syndicate yesterday joined the chorus of concern
from oil and gas explorers about the tax changes for the sector announced in
Tuesday's Budget, writes Hugh Carnegy
Reporting a 73 per cent surge in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.81m in the year
to December 31, compared with Pounds 4.52m, the company said it would have
to carry out a strategic rethink of its plans to expand significantly its
activities in the North Sea.
The proposals would stop companies offsetting exploration and appraisal
costs against income from fields which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax. Mr Alan
Gaynor, managing director, said British-Borneo would almost certainly slow
down exploration in the North Sea. He called for clarification of the
government's intention to allow a two-year extension of PRT relief on
existing contracts. It was not clear whether four wells British-Borneo had
obligations to drill but on which work had not yet begun would qualify, he
said.
Revenues from oil and gas were up almost four times at Pounds 17.9m (Pounds
3.7m), outstripping for the first time revenue from the investment
portfolio.
Earnings per share were down at 16.93p (19.95p), reflecting a rise in the
number of shares in issue, while the proposed final dividend is 4.433p,
making an unchanged total for the year of 7.1p.

<TEXT>
GPG, the UK investment arm of Sir Ron Brierly, the New Zealand entrepreneur,
yesterday informed the Stock Exchange its holding in Brown Shipley Holdings,
had exceeded the 30 per cent mark which would oblige it to make a bid under
the takeover code.
But the rise in the stake to 30.02 per cent in the investment business,
which is under offer from Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise, was understood to
have been made in error. GPG did not intend making a mandatory bid.
GPG said on Wednesday it was considering a full cash bid 5p higher than
KBL's 30p offer. KBL has extended the deadline on its bid to next Thursday
and is awaiting GPG's next move.

Reporting a 73 per cent surge in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.81m in the year
to December 31, compared with Pounds 4.52m, the company said it would have
to carry out a strategic rethink of its plans to expand significantly its
activities in the North Sea.
The proposals would stop companies offsetting exploration and appraisal
costs against income from fields which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax, leaving
them paying a net 64p for every Pounds 1 spent instead of 17p under present
rules.
Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said British-Borneo would almost

clarification of the government's intention to allow a two-year extension of
PRT relief on existing contracts. It was not clear whether four wells

Revenues from oil and gas were up almost four times at Pounds 17.9m (Pounds
3.7m), outstripping for the first time revenue from the investment
portfolio.
Mr Gaynor said there was strong growth potential in the Gulf of Mexico,
particularly in gas. He announced British-Borneo's first move into direct
operating, through an operating consortium in the Gulf of Mexico with
American Cometra, a subsidiary of Electrofina, and Ranger Oil of Canada.
Earnings per share were down at 16.93p (19.95p), while the proposed final
dividend is 4.433p, making an unchanged total for the year of 7.1p.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Molins' shares rise on 29% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Molins out-performed the stock market yesterday with a 19p jump to
479p as the tobacco machinery and packaging group announced a 29 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 18.3m for 1992.
Mr Michael Orr, chairman, said the company had achieved the improved profits
through increased penetration of international markets and cost reductions.
The company has adopted the FRS 3 accounting standard. The reported pre-tax
profits for 1991 were Pounds 15.5m.
A 17 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 181m (Pounds 155m) was the result of
both volume increases and gains on currency transactions.
Mr Orr was bullish about prospects for the current year, saying further
progress would be made. 'We like making money as well as machinery,' he
said, 'and the outlook for Molins is really quite good.'
The total dividend was increased by 10 per cent to 14p (12.75) after a lower
proposed final of 9.5p (9.75p). Earnings improved from 33.1p to 41.9p.
The tobacco machinery division achieved the best performance. Operating
profits rose 28 per cent to Pounds 18.6m due to an improvement in overall
margins, substantial cost-cutting and strong advances in China and Brazil.
The important US market continued to be depressed, however.
Packaging machinery recorded a Pounds 100,000 rise in operating profits to
Pounds 3.1m on sales 22 per cent up at Pounds 63.8m. The division, heavily
dependent on the US market, suffered a decline in margins from an average 6
per cent to about 5 per cent.
The group aimed to improve these margins and, in the longer term, to
diversify into packaging for the food and pharmaceuticals industries.
The group expects to receive a Pounds 10m repayment from the pension
surplus. Agreement had been reached with trustees to share the surplus
between the company and the fund's members. The members have to approve the
plan.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Haden MacLellan gains from accounting
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HADEN MACLELLAN Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, said yesterday that
new accounting rules were largely responsible for a 16 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.3m for the year to December 31.
The group, which reorganised its management last year following losses on
its US operations, said operating profits - Pounds 7.4m, against Pounds
15.4m - were a better performance indicator. Operating losses on US
operations fell to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.6m).
The final dividend is being cut to 1p (5p) making a 2p (8p) total. Earnings
per share emerged at 2.6p against restated losses of 1.1p. Group turnover
from continuing activities declined from Pounds 319.9m to Pounds 276m.
Operating profits on property and discontinued operations more than halved
to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 15m). On process engineering and services they
declined to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 8.1m) and on manufacturing and distribution
they fell to Pounds 4m (Pounds 5.5m).
The group adopted FRS 3, the new accounting standard, which means one-off
gains and losses will normally be reflected in pre-tax profits.
Under this formula figures for 1991 have been restated to take account of an
Pounds 11.4m charge, including Pounds 8m in re-stated goodwill.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Shares rise despite 30% drop for Hornby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADITIONAL toys fought a rearguard action last Christmas against their
high-tech rivals like gameboy and his ilk, Hornby, the games, trains and
boat maker, said yesterday as it reported a 30 per cent drop in pre-tax
profits for the year.
Buoyed by the relatively optimistic outcome of Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 2.09m)
in the face of such competition, the shares closed up 21p at 164p.
The group said the results were satisfactory given the competing
disadvantages of last year's craze for computer games and consumers'
reluctance to spend until a month before Christmas.
Turnover declined to Pounds 31.3m (Pounds 32m) and operating expenses were
inflated by the launch of the new Cassy doll which led to costs 'approaching
Pounds 500,000'.
Net interest costs were higher at Pounds 364,000 compared with Pounds
199,000.
The board proposes a maintained dividend of 9p, payable from lower earnings
per share of 11.5p (15.4p).
Mr Jack Strowger, above, group chairman, announced his intention to retire
at the next annual general meeting after 12 years in the post. He is 77. He
will be succeeded by Mr Malcolm Thomas, the deputy chairman.
The company's shares trade on the USM.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Evered acts to reduce borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERED BARDON, the UK building materials group, yesterday moved to reduce
its large borrowings by selling a half share in part of its US operations.
The company is raising Dollars 34m (Pounds 24m), after all expenses, from
the sale of a 50 per cent stake in its quarrying, concrete, blacktop and
builders' merchants businesses in Arkansas and Indiana to CJ Langenfelder &amp;
Son, the US building materials group.
Langenfelder is paying Dollars 49m for its stake in the joint venture which
it will manage. Payment will be made as to Dollars 42m in cash, Dollars 6m
in five-year loan notes and Dollars 1m in other deferred payments.
The Indiana and Arkansas operations in the year to December 31 1991 made
pre-tax profits of Dollars 4.8m.
The combined net asset value of the businesses on disposal was approximately
Dollars 39m.
Evered will remain the sole owner of large aggregate reserves in the US,
with consents to extract more than 900m tonnes in Massachusetts around
Boston and in Maryland close to Washington DC.
It also owns large stone quarries in England and Scotland as well as a sea
sand and gravel dredging business supplying the UK and continental Europe.
The company expanded rapidly following a series of acquisitions during the
1980s leaving it with large debts. The latest sale should take net
borrowings below Pounds 300m. Even so gearing is likely to remain about 90
per cent.
The company, which had previously identified the Arkansas and Indiana
businesses as candidates for disposals, recognises that it will be under
pressure to reduce its borrowings further.
It will be reluctant, however, to make further sales involving what it
regards as its core businesses. The sand and gravel dredging businesses is
regarded by analysts as the most likely candidate for a sale if further
disposals are required.
Evered Bardon cut its interim dividend from 1.935p to 0.8p after pre-tax
profits fell from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 4.6m during the half year ended
June 31 1992.
The group, which blamed the recession in the UK and US construction markets,
is expected to announce results for the whole of last year at the beginning
of next month.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram faces further questions on
profits fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE a 10p recovery in its share price to 73p yesterday, Spring Ram, the
kitchens and bathrooms company, still faces some searching questions from
analysts and institutional shareholders when it announces a substantial
profits fall on Monday.
Although it released an explanation on Thursday as to why 1992 pre-tax
profit, at about Pounds 26m, would be Pounds 13m less than expected,
analysts say the announcement raised many questions.
The most important is the reason for Pounds 5.6m of profit being pushed back
into 1993. As it seems this is not connected with the exceptional gain taken
on selling spare ACT capacity, the questions centre on the more regular
trading activities. For instance, do the contracts concerned relate to sale
and return arrangements with customers or to stock being held for customers
on Spring Ram sites?
The company pointed to Fred 4, a financial reporting exposure draft, as the
cause of the changed timing on the Pounds 5.6m profit. The draft rules
introduce tough requirements on the treatment of many devices used to
conceal liabilities or inflate profits.
A second area of questioning concerns the light that different accounting
treatments throws on the group's previous profits record. The reported
figures showed rapid growth from Pounds 1m in 1982 to Pounds 36.2m in 1991,
and high operating margins, which were 17 per cent in 1991.
According to Thursday's statement, the 1991 pre-tax profit has been revised
downwards by Pounds 1.4m to take account of FRS 3 and a more conservative
depreciation policy.

WEAK retail demand was yesterday blamed for a Pounds 294,000 fall in interim
pre-tax profits at Fortnum &amp; Mason, the Piccadilly department store.
Fortnum said lower profits of Pounds 1.51m for the 28 weeks to January 23,
down from Pounds 1.8m last time, were also due to repair and maintenance
costs and advertising expenditure.
In spite of a slight increase in turnover, up Pounds 169,000 to Pounds
15.6m, Mr Gary Weston, chairman, said trading conditions remained gloomy.
The Piccadilly store saw sales decline 0.5 per cent although this was offset
by improved exports. Overall, exports rose 13.7 per cent - with sales in the
US more than doubled, France up by 49 per cent and Japan 28 per cent.
Earnings were 235p (279p) and the interim dividend was unchanged at 86p.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Dedicated followers of fashion - The
growing popularity of emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE investment industry is always prone to fashion. With three investment
trusts currently attempting to raise money to invest in emerging markets, it
is clear what is the fashion of the moment.
There is no precise definition of what constitutes an emerging market but
the general idea is that they can be found in developing countries, which
are either converting to capitalism or significantly liberalising their
financial systems.
Templeton, one of the management groups which specialises in the area, says
that more than 75 per cent of the world's population lives in such
countries.
Countries in south east Asia, Latin America and parts of southern Europe are
obvious candidates. Robert Fleming, which manages the Fleming Emerging
Markets Investment Trust, breaks countries down into three categories:
emerging, incubating and dormant.
The first includes countries such as Argentina, Korea and Venezuela and
consists of markets which Fleming will consider backing at the moment.
Incubating markets are ones which might be interesting in the future, such
as Cyprus, Egypt or Zimbabwe. Dormant markets cover nations such as Cuba and
Tunisia, which could be interesting if policies changed.
The primary reason for emerging markets being so enticing is the expectation
of higher economic growth. The World Bank predicts 3.6 per cent per annum in
the 1990s, compared with 2.1 per cent for industrialised countries.
The reasons for their faster growth include improving literacy rates,
creating both a more educated workforce and a downward pressure on the birth
rate.
In the long run, this economic growth should feed through, via higher
corporate profits, into better stock market returns. That, argues Fleming,
was the experience of the 1980s, as Taiwan, Thailand and south Korea enjoyed
growth of more than 8 per cent in gross domestic product and more than 15
per cent in stock market returns.
A further factor is economic liberalisation. Examples include the opening up
of eastern Europe, the prospect of a free trade grouping including the US
and Mexico, and the easing of restrictions on overseas investments in
countries such as Taiwan and Brazil. In most emerging markets, stock markets
constitute a much smaller percentage of GDP than in developed countries.
The very nature of these countries' underdevelopment makes them risky. Stock
markets are illiquid with the bulk of a market's capitalisation centred on a
few stocks, Accounting practices may not conform to the standards of the
industrialised world. Political regimes are often unstable and economies
prone to problems such as hyperinflation.
The result can be enormous volatility. Turkey fell by more than 40 per cent
in 1992, while Peru was up by 120 per cent.
But enthusiasts see these risks as opportunities. For a start, they say that
underdeveloped markets are inefficient and create more scope for seeking
undervalued stocks than the much-monitored exchanges of London and Wall
Street.
Furthermore, the very difficulty of investing in these markets is a reason
for both institutions and private investors to use the specialist services
of a fund manager, such as the three currently trying to raise finance:
Fleming, Genesis (via an offshore-based fund) and Templeton.
In addition, the enthusiasts argue that emerging markets have very low
correlation with each other or with the main stock markets. Thus a
diversified fund can offer a significant reduction in risk.
Cynics would argue, however, that whenever a fashion appears, it must be the
top of the market.
The five investment trusts in the field with a two year record produced an
average return of 80.3 per cent over the two years to March 1 (mid-market to
mid-market with net income reinvested). That was the best performance of any
investment trust sector over the period.
But despite these increases, both Templeton and Fleming argue that
valuations in many markets are still attractive and trade on price/earnings
ratios lower than those in the US, UK and Japanese markets.
Furthermore, it is argued that these markets are being neglected by large
investors at the moment. Fleming quotes figures from the World Bank showing
that foreign institutional investment, as a percentage of total assets, was
only 0.2 per cent at the end of 1989.
Even though that is forecast to grow to 0.5 per cent by the year 2000, it
may still represent a substantially underweight position. Mr Mark Mobius,
investment manager at Templeton Emerging, points out that the emerging stock
markets have a capitalisation greater than that of the French and German
markets combined.
The limited number of funds in this area has created the scope for the
managers to raise new money. The Fleming and Templeton funds have frequently
been able to trade at premiums to net asset values, a sign that demand for
shares exceeds supply.
Fleming is seeking to raise about Pounds 50m in total, having conditionally
placed Pounds 37m of stock already. Templeton is looking for more than
Pounds 20m. The Genesis details are yet to be confirmed.
It seems that emerging markets are emerging from a backwater into the
mainstream of investment.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Anglia TV ahead as share of advertising
revenue rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIA Television increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 14.55m for 1992 but
held the dividend at 9.26p with an unchanged final of 6.4p. Profits for the
previous 14 months were Pounds 8.38m.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 140m (Pounds 153m) with advertising revenue at
Pounds 113m (Pounds 127m) and programme sales at Pounds 23m (Pounds 22m).
The results were reported under accounting standard FRS 3 with figures for
the preceding 14 months restated.
Anglia cut expenditure on acquiring programmes in 1992 to Pounds 37.24m
(Pounds 40.87m). Operating profits were Pounds 12.41m (Pounds 4m).
Sir Peter Gibbings, chairman, drew attention to Anglia's increased share of
the commercial television network's net advertising revenue, which at 7 per
cent in 1992 was 0.3 per cent improved on 1991, the ninth consecutive year
of increased share.
Anglia ended 1992 with a strong balance sheet, including Pounds 26.46m cash.
However, the group was cautious as to the immediate outlook; cuts of 25 per
cent in real terms have been made in operating costs since 1990 with staff
levels now at 593 against 800 in 1990.
In the light of its greater share of net advertising revenue, analysts are
revising upwards their forecast pre-tax profits for 1993, to about Pounds
5.5m.

Sir, Your report, 'More heavy job cuts expected soon at Daf' (March 16), of
impending further job losses at Leyland Daf mentions the unacceptably high
stock levels found by the receivers. Sophisticated organisations in both
manufacturing and retailing sectors learned long ago the importance of
obliging their suppliers to make deliveries 'just in time'. That Leyland
Daf's management appears to have failed in this respect is a sad comment on
its competence and justification for complaint by the workforce. It would be
interesting to know what over-stocking arose from the import of components
from the parent company and its overseas subsidiaries.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Before the horse has bolted: The Budget has given racehorse
owners a boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drive into Newmarket and there is no doubt that this is a town built for
horses. Signs point to the National Stud, the National Horseracing Museum
and the equine virology unit. They also warn: 'Racehorses for five miles.'
The warning may seem odd as visitors take in the beauty of hundreds of the
finest horses streaming up Warren Hill early on a spring morning. Then a
horse shies and leaps, and the hazards become apparent.
A more appropriate warning sign before Tuesday's Budget might have read:
'VAT 17.5 per cent.' Since Tuesday, however, the shadow has been lifted;
horse owners can now register for value-added tax and claim back the
payments. The measure applies specifically to racing and no other area of
horse ownership.
The benefits will be considerable: for every Pounds 10,000 spent on a
yearling, nearly Pounds 2,000 more is paid in tax; every Pounds 1,000
monthly training bill includes about Pounds 150 in VAT; every Pounds 300
vet's bill has more than Pounds 50 added for taxes.
Besides the VAT burden Newmarket has suffered from recession and the UK's
relatively low prize money, which provides insufficient compensation to
cover high costs. About 400 of the town's 3,000 stables are empty, about a
dozen yards are for sale, staff have been laid off.
On top of all this, Tattersalls, the leading bloodstock auction house, had
decided to move its most highly regarded yearling sale to the Republic of
Ireland, where VAT is only 2.5 per cent. In France, VAT is 5.5 per cent.
After the Budget measures, Tattersalls is likely to reverse its decision.
One reason behind its thinking was that its principal buyers, the Maktoum
brothers of Dubai's ruling family, did not buy at last autumn's sale.
Instead, they bought in Ireland and in France, and VAT was one reason for
the switch.
Another ominous development was that Darley Stud Management, which looks
after two of the Maktoum brothers' interests, allocated 24 per cent fewer
yearlings to UK trainers than it had at the end of 1991. France and the US
were the main beneficiaries. About half Darley Stud's 750 horses in training
internationally are based at Newmarket.
The implications were bad for every aspect of British racing. Thoroughbred
breeders were losing custom and bloodstock prices were falling. Trainers
froze or cut their fees to try to keep the smaller owners as the big ones
switched horses overseas.
Service providers, such as vets, blacksmiths and horse transporters, were
suffering too. And the knock-on effects in a place such as Newmarket
extended to hotels, restaurants and even the gentlemen's outfitters, which
thrive on the 50 days a year of racing and sales.
Many in the racing lobby believed that 30,000 jobs were at risk. But now,
the same people would have you believe that the chancellor has saved British
racing.
Mr Geoffrey Wragg, one of the 65 trainers based in Newmarket, said the VAT
relief meant that 'for every six horses you have in training you can get one
trained free'.
Mr Pip Payne, said: 'It's a great time to be a racehorse owner. The horses
are cheaper, the training is cheaper, there is more racing and more prize
money. The industry now has to market itself and generate more owners.'
At Mr Alex Scott's yard, where the modern brick buildings have double-glazed
windows and the equine pool is heated, more than half the 75 horses belong
to Sheikh Maktoum Al Maktoum, who has yet to reduce his UK string
significantly. It is now less likely that he will. But the Americans have
gone, partly because 'there was nearly 20 per cent extra on the costs in
England from VAT'.
VAT was not the only reason. Lack of big prizes loomed just as large. As Mr
Michael Goodbody, who manages the Sheikh's Gainsborough Stud, says: 'First
prize in a maiden race in the UK might be Pounds 4,000, in Paris Pounds
8,000 and in the US Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 21,000).
The VAT concession tackles the high cost of UK racing, saving perhaps Pounds
20m-Pounds 25m of the Pounds 150m estimated losses incurred yearly by
owners. But it does nothing to tackle the low income side of the equation
represented by low prizes.
Complaints about the small proportion of betting income that is diverted
into racing are just as loud as the erstwhile clamour over VAT. But although
the cheering was loud on the VAT victory, a few questions are being raised.
The main one is: will all owners benefit? The answer is that they can all
register for VAT. But there are hurdles.
According to the memorandum of understanding agreed between Customs and
Excise and the industry, owners must 'seek' sponsorship, appearance money
and prize money.
Owners obviously seek the latter - although race courses will now pay VAT on
the Pounds 40m total prize money involved, which they in turn will claim
back. The other two requirements will change racing's traditions, bringing
in a degree of commercialism that might raise a few eyebrows among the old
guard.
However, the Jockey Club, racing's ruling body, says concessions must be
made. Mr David Pipe, director of public affairs, said the ban on advertising
in the parade ring would be lifted. Horses will soon sport logos on their
rugs and saddle cloths. Jockeys will probably carry them on their boots and
breeches, not on their silks.
Appearance money is also a new development. But who will pay for it? Most of
the UK's 59 race courses are not profitable. That leaves the race sponsors
or, perhaps, the betting industry.
For Customs and Excise, sponsorship and appearance money will attract VAT,
offsetting the tax claimed back by racehorse owners on their expenses.
An indication that the new VAT scheme is not supposed to be a one-way
traffic of tax rebates for the industry with no offsetting receipts comes in
the following extract from the memorandum: 'Customs will review the
operation of the scheme . . . during its fourth year to assess whether the
levels of income available to the industry . . . warrant the scheme's
continuing operation.'
The message is that if owners want to keep the VAT concession they will have
to start treating their hobby as a business.
More broadly, the industry has to help itself in finding a solution to its
'under-funding' by competing with other leisure activities for sponsorship,
participants and spectators.
A lot can change in four years in racing. One of those welcoming the VAT
change was the head lad of Mr Michael Stoute's stable. He was sitting on a
four-year-old that cost Pounds 760,000 as a yearling. But the horse didn't
make the grade on the racecourse and has recently been gelded.
That is exactly what could happen to the VAT scheme if owners sit back and
neglect the commercial requirements imposed by Customs and Excise.

FT  20 MAR 93 / The mouse that roared: Peter Bruce visits Andorra, Europe's
newest sovereign state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANDORRA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Come back in a few months,' says Mr Xavier Espot, Andorra's minister for
tourism and sport, rubbing his hands. 'This is going to be very
interesting.'
Last Sunday, Andorrans, perched high up in their tiny Pyrenean principality
between Spain and France, voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to grant
themselves their first constitution and to end more than 700 years of feudal
rule from 'down below' as they call their neighbours.
As far as its people are concerned, Andorra has just become Europe's newest
sovereign state. 'Now we'll get to see what its like being a real
democracy,' says Mr Espot.
There is excitement everywhere. In the next few weeks President Francois
Mitterrand of France and the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Joan Marti
Alanis, will sign the new constitution into law, transferring sovereignty to
Andorrans. 'Things are going to begin to happen really quickly around here,'
says Mr Candi Naudi i Mora, a former minister and the country's biggest
property developer.
Until recently, Andorrans have been slow to seek change. Since the 13th
century the principality has been ruled jointly by the bishops of Urgell in
Spain and the French counts of Foix. The Foix title passed to the crown of
France in the 15th century and successive French heads of state.
These 'co-princes' have enjoyed complete power in Andorra - over commerce,
immigration and security. And for centuries Andorrans have wanted it that
way.
Even now, in voting sovereignty to themselves, Andorrans have made the
co-princes a single constitutional monarch, obliged to sign laws and to be
consulted only on foreign policy affairs that directly affect France and
Spain.
Slow political development has contrasted with an increased pace of economic
change. In the past 30 years Andorra has been transformed from a subsistence
economy into a modern tourist mecca. Its towns are lined with expensive duty
free goods. Visitors shop and ski. And the 60,000 or so locals have one of
Europe's highest standards of living. The country is pretty and clean. There
is practically no crime and no prostitution.
Andorrans pay no taxes, get free education in schools financed by France and
Spain and get cheap health care. The local government has until now raised
more than 95 per cent of its revenue by charging a small import duty.
No one knows what inflation might be. 'We don't have a consumer price
index,' says Mr Naudi. And per capita income? 'Enormous,' says the minister
for tourism.
Economic development has prompted increasing demands for self-determination
which has brought the people of Andorra into a series of disputes with the
co-princes. In 1982 an Andorran assembly, was established with the agreement
of the princes.
The most serious dispute has occurred over an expropriation law passed
unanimously by the assembly in 1985 but which has never been approved by the
co-princes.
The law would probably cut the price that the government has to pay to buy
land from property-owners - many of whom have benefited from the old system.
Under the new constitution, the co-princes will have to sign the law.
The See of Urgell is the big loser from Andorra's new independence. The
Bishop, once so influential that he could determine the credit policies of
Andorran banks, failed to make catholicism a state religion in the new
constitution and had to fight hard to prevent abortion being legalised. But,
under pressure from the Spanish government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the See
has been forced to accept a reduction of its power.
Andorran officials say there is no resentment behind their move to
independence. 'We just want to be able to do things,' says Mr Espot. 'The
institutions of the old system were incapable of dealing with modern
problems.'
For a start, the Andorrans want to establish themselves as an offshore
financial centre. 'We pay no tax but we can't even be a tax haven because we
don't have the appropriate laws,' says a local lawyer. More importantly, the
government wants to scrap legislation banning foreign companies from
Andorra.
Officials say they must change such laws to find new sources of income.
Freedom from feudal rule is going to be expensive. Between 1989 and last
year public spending rose nearly 50 per cent to Pta20.4bn (Pounds 118m),
mainly to fund new schools. To finance a growing budget deficit the
Andorrans need to create more economic activity - by changing company law
and opening up to foreign investors - and then find ways to tax the new
sources of wealth.
'We will never have a direct tax here,' says Mr Naudi, but there is broad
agreement that indirect taxes will have to be introduced, perhaps even a
value added tax.
Andorrans fear new taxes just as they fear that continued economic growth
will fuel immigration. Resident foreigners already outnumber locals by more
than three to one - more than half the population is Spanish. The
authorities, seeking to create a stronger sense of national identity, have
decided to create more Andorrans. Anyone who has spent more than 30 years in
the country or who was born there before 1975 is now eligible for
citizenship.
This may not seem very generous, but few foreigners are complaining. 'I have
another 10 years to wait,' says a Basque, resident here for the past two
decades.' He will happily give up his Spanish passport when the time comes.
'It's a strange, conservative, place. Everybody, especially the police,
knows your business but it's a good price to pay for total security in a
civilised country.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / When the going gets tough . . .: Do the tough get going? The
art of resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To go, or not to go? That is the question raised anew by the controversy
over the remuneration arrangements for Mr John Birt, director-general of the
BBC. Both Mr Birt and Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC board of
governors, appear to have survived a chorus of calls for their heads in a
manner which must inspire deep envy among others who have recently put their
signatures at the bottom of resignation letters.
In the UK, the events of the past fortnight will lead to a further round of
soul-searching over the apparent failure of public figures to resign no
matter what has gone wrong.
Mr David Mellor, the arts minister who resigned last summer after an affair
with an actress and revelations about a free holiday in Spain as the guest
of the daughter of a senior figure within the PLO, might disagree with the
common wisdom. So too might Mr Harvey Proctor, the Billericay MP forced to
stand down in the 1987 general election after admitting charges of gross
indecency.
However, both individuals came to grief over their private lives. Not since
the departure in 1982 of Lord Carrington, the foreign secretary, and two
junior colleagues following the unexpected invasion of the Falklands Islands
by Argentina has any minister felt it necessary to resign because of policy
failures.
So no one's head has rolled over sterling's ignominious departure from the
exchange rate mechanism. Nor, yet, has anyone accepted responsibility for
the events over the sale of arms to Iraq revealed by the Matrix-Churchill
trial. The debacle over the pit closures has resulted in a sideways transfer
of one senior civil servant, but the only people who have joined the
unemployment register as a result are miners whose pits are to close.
The rarity with which top people in British public life resign is in sharp
contrast to what goes on in industry. Lord King was last month forced into
premature retirement from the chairmanship of British Airways to bring an
end to continuing controversy over the airline's dirty tricks campaign
against Virgin Atlantic.
Mr Bob Horton, chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum, was ousted
in June, as profits fell. And last week Mr Christopher Heath, chairman of
Baring Securities and once, reputedly, Britain's highest-paid executive,
found himself unexpectedly spending more time with his family after a
disagreement with the parent company's deputy chairman, Mr Andrew Tuckey.
Overall, 1992 saw some 25 British senior executives leaving their companies
unexpectedly, usually under the pressure of poor corporate performance.
US business has also seen a series of high-level resignations, as investors
have girded their loins to oust 'imperial' chief executives who had
previously appeared impregnable.
Last year, for example, Mr Robert Stempel resigned as chairman and chief
executive of General Motors. This year, in one week in January alone, Mr
John Akers stepped down as chief executive of IBM, Mr James Robinson left
the same job at American Express, Mr Paul Lego went as chief executive of
Westinghouse and PetroCanada's chief executive, Mr Wilbert Hopper, was
'relieved of responsibilities'.
In Japan, resignation of top executives has become almost ritualised, as a
form of penance for companies in trouble.
In February, for example, Mr Akio Tanii resigned as president of Matsushita
Electric, the world's largest consumer electronics group and owner of MCA,
the US film studio. Mr Tanii said he was taking responsibility for the
involvement of National Lease, a subsidiary, in a financial scandal that
rocked Japan in the summer of 1991. 'I felt it was important to clarify
responsibility for certain unfortunate matters that occurred during my
presidency,' Mr Tanii said.
Japanese politicians also follow this practice, to the extent that the
ruling Liberal Democrats were in danger of running out of candidates for top
jobs after the recent spate of corruption scandals.
Under the presidency of Mr Bill Clinton, resignation among US politicians
could also become much more common if the precedent of the confirmation
hearings is to be followed. Two female candidates for attorney general
resigned before reaching first base at the Justice Department because they
had employed illegal immigrants as babysitters.
Whatever the country or the job, there can be benefits in tendering a prompt
resignation. Bob Horton, for example, has quickly found a new ship of
industry to captain: he is chairman-designate of Railtrack, the state-owned
body set up to run Britain's railway tracks after privatisation.
Lord Callaghan, Britain's last Labour prime minister, is probably the best
advertisement for taking the blame quickly and publicly. He resigned as
chancellor of the exchequer in 1967, immediately after Britain's Labour
government was forced to break a manifesto promise and devalue the pound.
Shifted sideways to the post of home secretary, he later became foreign
secretary, before reaching Downing Street as the first prime minister this
century to have held all three great offices of state.
But the BBC episode demonstrates that there is still plenty of scope for
avoiding the big R in British public life. In that case, having a divided
board has proved a great asset for Mr Birt and Mr Hussey. The failure of the
BBC's directors to agree that they should go has been an important reason
for their survival.
Another valuable security device is the possibility of collective guilt
which implicates as many others as possible in the issue in question.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor at the time of sterling's departure from
the ERM, could rightly claim that his economic policy had been endorsed by
the cabinet in general and the prime minister in particular. If he went,
they went, the argument ran. Unsurprisingly, he stayed.
Greater openness of government may encourage increased use of this
stratagem. The publication of membership of cabinet committees makes it much
clearer that responsibilities for bad political decisions is usually shared
by several ministers.
If all else fails, resignation can often be deferred until everyone has
calmed down by setting up an inquiry. The inquiry set up into the arms for
the Iraq affair is a case in point. Lord Justice Scott can be expected to
apply his noted forensic skills to the inquiry, but his report will appear
nine months or more after the events in question. By then, nobody is likely
to feel the need to resign.
The clear message, in the UK at least, is that people in public life can
rarely be forced out if they keep their heads and the backing of the people
who appoint them. If these conditions are met, premature departure can be
avoided. Even when the press and media are in full pursuit - as in the case
of the BBC and Mr Hussey - it is possible to frustrate the pack.

<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested in your story 'Jobseekers 'past it at 45' ' (March
15). Your readers aged over 45 might be interested in the age breakdown of
the unemployed in the US, where those aged 45 to 64 experience only
two-thirds the national average unemployment rate. Possibly a similar
distribution would now exist in the UK, had there been a law against
discrimination for the last 25 years, as in the US.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Letter: Widely differing views on long-term effect of Budget
measures on cost of pensions (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A S CAIRNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The reduction in the tax credit on UK dividends paid to pension funds
is one of the most significant proposals in this year's Budget. The
chancellor has, at a stroke, effectively reduced the value of pension fund
assets in the UK. This has serious consequences:
Companies which operate 'final salary' pension funds will have to pay higher
contributions in the future, unless they cut back on benefits or their
employees pay more.
Individuals with personal pensions will also have to pay more or accept
lower pensions in the future.
The Budget proposal should therefore concern a very large proportion of the
population but, unless it receives wider coverage in the media, it is
unlikely to lose the government many votes at the next election. Indeed the
public's ignorance of this issue may lead the chancellor and his advisers to
conclude that pensions are a 'soft touch' for further tax in the future.
However, before imposing further tax on pension funds the government should
bear in mind that:
tax incentives are needed to persuade the public to tie up their money in
pension schemes (money invested in pension schemes cannot be withdrawn until
retirement);
unless the public makes adequate private pension provision, the government's
aim of reducing dependence on the state will not succeed.

   From H R WYNNE-GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The changes to advance corporation tax put forward in the Budget will
have an effect on the return on equities. This has implications for pension
funds as has been pointed out by Lex ('UK equities', March 17).
It is important that this effect is not overblown: the income yield on
equities will fall from 4 per cent to 3.75 per cent as a result of the
reduced amount of tax that will be recoverable from the Inland Revenue.
However, this reduction in yield represents probably no more than 0.1 per
cent or 0.2 per cent of a typical pension fund.
The difference between the performance of a good investment manager and one
that is not so good is often very substantially more than this and I doubt
very much that actuaries will advise any significant change to be made to
pension fund contributions as a result of such a small change.
Indeed one would hope to see the effect of increased cash flows and the
general recovery in the economy producing investment returns which would
amply justify a continued investment in equities as against bonds.
One can only hope that dealers in markets as a whole will take a similarly
long-term view of the attraction of equities.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER REEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on Britain's Top 50 charities ('Fears grow for charities
as cash crisis worsens', March 15) might usefully have highlighted two
oddities apparent from the information presented.
The first is the unusually high ratio of funds to expenditure: most
charities could support present spending levels for years ahead despite even
a sharp fall in current income.
The second is the extension of charitable status to organisations which
trade in every important respect like commercial companies but are
conveniently exempt from the comparable tax burden. In no meaningful way are
they directed towards helping disadvantaged members of society without due
financial recompense.
Such organisations warrant a separate description to distinguish them
clearly from those whose activities reflect truly charitable intentions.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Letter: BT reckons rates are low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL HEPHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, National Utility Services' simplistic method of comparing local
telephone call prices means that like is not compared with like ('BT rates
for local calls 'high' ', March 17).
For a start, the NUS survey excludes cheap-rate local calls which are of
most benefit to our residential customers and where BT's charges are among
the lowest in the world. The survey also selects a call of three minutes.
Like BT, many countries charge in fixed meter steps. Particularly for local
calls, the size of the step varies greatly between countries, so choice of
call duration can give different results.
More important, the survey ignores the size of the local call area. BT's
local call areas are among the largest in the world, including, for
instance, the whole of London. Many of the calls that BT's customers make at
local call rates would be priced at higher long distance rates in other
countries.
You also say that BT's line rental is high at Pounds 10.28 a month. We do
not know how NUS derived this figure. The quarterly line rental for BT's 19m
residential customers is Pounds 19.54 and for its 7m business customers
Pounds 31.65, equivalent to a monthly rate of Pounds 6.52 and Pounds 10.55
respectively.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Leading Article: World on the trade brink
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE FRICTION is increasingly undermining western co-operation. As a
result, short-sighted decisions made by myopic decision-makers could do
untold damage to the hopes of billions of people around the world.
The background is inauspicious. With the collapse of the former Soviet
Union, the strategic glue binding the western economies, has dissolved.
Where once there was a nuclear-armed colossus to fear, there are now beggars
to shrug aside. To its credit, the Clinton administration wants the west to
unite to help rebuild Russia. Unfortunately, squabbles over how to share the
burden now divide the west, whereas the threat once presented by the Soviet
Union united it.
The less than happy state of most major economies makes co-operation still
more difficult. The exception is the US. This week's announcement that US
industrial output was up 0.4 per cent in February and 4.3 per cent over the
past 12 months confirms that Mr Clinton must be the luckiest - and Mr George
Bush the unluckiest - politician on earth.
Others have been less fortunate. The UK economy may now be recovering after
its two and a half years or so in recession, but only after a policy volte
face forced upon a reluctant government by the foreign exchange markets.
In the other major industrial countries, the picture is darker still. The
British Treasury forecasts a fall of  3/4 per cent in the combined gross
domestic product of the three largest continental European economies in
1993, following an increase of just 1 1/4 per cent last year. German GDP may
even fall by 1 1/2 per cent this year, it argues. Yet neither the grim
economic tidings nor the much vaunted 'solidarity pact' have been enough to
transform the Bundesbank's caution. For the rest of Europe, the Bundesbank's
monetary policy feels like the death of a thousand small interest rate cuts.
Further stimulus
Meanwhile, the Japanese government is contemplating a second major fiscal
package, to follow the Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.5bn) emergency increase in
public works spending announced last autumn. Since the British Treasury's
forecast is for a mere 1 per cent increase in Japanese gross national
product between 1992 and 1993, following 1.5 per cent last year, a further
boost would seem inevitable. But the trade surplus, which reached Dollars
10.55bn in February alone, is the most important reason for action, since it
has become an increasingly significant focus of tension, particularly with
the US.
Yet the Japanese trade surplus is as much an excuse for friction as its
cause. Washington is now in the grip of what looks increasingly like a new
policy paradigm, one that is bound to make all its trade relationships more
difficult. Where once US trade policy was aimed at agreements on legal and
administrative processes, it is now aimed more and more at achieving
specific quantitative results. Where once it was multilateral, it is now
increasingly bilateral or unilateral.
Specific commitment
The prime example of the new policy paradigm is the 1986 semiconductor pact,
progress on which is due to be reviewed by US and Japanese trade officials
in Hawaii this weekend. For many Americans this is the example of how trade
should be conducted with Japan. They particularly like the specific
commitment to a 20 per cent foreign share of the Japanese market which they
believe it contained. To this, the Japanese reply that there was no such
commitment. They also assert that no market economy could make such a
commitment. Fortunately, the immediate dispute has been defused by the news
that the Japanese have reached the 'target' they insist is no target at all.
While the US is apparently intent on turning Japan into the 'Japan Inc' that
many Americans complain it already is, it has not ignored its trade
relations with the European Community. Fortunately, the threat of immediate
US sanctions over public procurement has been lifted. But US policy towards
the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations remains extremely
obscure.
It is an obscurity that some in the EC, particularly the government most
likely to emerge from the coming French elections, may well want to exploit.
That government will, after all, be elected largely because the economy
suffers from rising unemployment and is burdened by short-term real interest
rates at around 8 per cent. Protectionism is almost inevitable. The French
conservative parties are already committed to reviewing the farm reform of
the EC. They are also committed to changing the agreement on farm trade
negotiated with the US last year. Since the US apparently wants precisely
the same thing, further conflict would seem inevitable.
The mistake on all sides of these trade squabbles has been the failure to
recognise that harmonious trade relations have become more central to the
industrial countries not less. It would be a bitter irony if it took the
collapse of Russia's reforming government to restore the co-operation among
the industrial countries that is now so sorely lacking.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Charm offensive with some value: UK manufacturers have had a
cool response to the Budget but welcome efforts to boost morale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most striking features of this week's Budget was the chancellor's
evident desire to flatter and cajole the nation's manufacturers. The
government's alarm about the state of UK industry is not new, nor is its
desire to spur manufacturers into an investment-led recovery. But Mr
Lamont's efforts went beyond persuasion. On company tax, export aid and
small company legislation, he appeared to be offering cash on the nail.
If early reactions are a guide, he has largely failed to convince. Most
manufacturers see the Budget as having at best a neutral effect on their
business. Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive of English China Clays, goes
further: 'What happened this week heightened the attraction of investing
overseas.'
It might be argued that managers are not always at their best when wrestling
with macro-economic concepts. As one of Britain's most senior industrialists
caustically remarks: 'When all these businessmen react to the Budget the
next day, they don't know what the hell they're talking about.' But in a
sense this is irrelevant. The government is seeking to instil in
manufacturers the confidence to spend money. When it comes to confidence,
perception is everything.
Most industrialists agree that there is a scent of recovery in the air,
though they disagree on how far they trust it. But Mr Chris Masters, chief
executive of the distribution and industrial services group Christian
Salvesen, speaks for many when he says: 'The government has been elected for
another four years, but it appears policy can change by the hour. We'd like
some faith that policy is being adhered to, almost whether it's right or
wrong. What is our interest rate policy? What's our long-term policy on
exchange rates? Are we raising taxes or lowering them?'
Mr Teare has a more specific worry: the Budget's proposals for future
increases in personal tax. 'There's some pretty tough medicine there for the
man in the street. People's costs are going to go up now for three years.
They know that. That's going to build up pressure on the wage front again,
and that isn't good news for companies like ours which are big exporters.'
For the government, such reactions are doubtless unsurprising. But when it
comes to specific measures to help industry, it could with justice argue
that it has acted on a number of issues which industry has pressed on it for
years: in particular, export credits, advance corporation tax and
infrastructure projects.
Even here, the response is grudging. Trafalgar House, for example, is a
company for which the Budget might have been tailor-made. It relies heavily
on export finance for big overseas engineering projects: it has a large bill
for surplus ACT: and it is heavily involved in infrastructure projects in
the UK.
Mr Alan Gormley, Trafalgar's chief executive, gives the government some
credit for trying. 'The Budget moved the tax structure in favour of industry
and against the financial sector, and I think that's for the UK's long-term
well-being. But it's a move which needs to be sustained on a consistent
policy basis. We've been a long time getting the economy into this state,
and we'll be a long time rebalancing it.'
On the specifics, Mr Gormley is less generous. Take export credits. 'The
previous regime was ridiculous. It clearly penalised UK exporters against
the competition. What we've seen in the past two years is the UK moving back
closer to the middle ground. They're not there yet.'
Or take ACT. 'The most positive thing I can say is that it's on the agenda.
The government is recognising it's a real issue. I'm not sure the solutions
proposed are the right ones.'
Or take infrastructure projects. 'At least they didn't announce the Jubilee
Line yet again. There is still more talk than action. I think industry's
view is that the jury is still out until we see some of these things
actually happening.'
To be fair, Mr Gormley - a Scottish accountant by training - has a
reputation among his colleagues for being downbeat by nature. But in his
reservations on the ACT changes, he is not alone. Rentokil, the highly
successful service company, raised its final dividend on Thursday by an
extra amount to ensure that its shareholders would not lose under the new
rules. Mr Chris Pearce, Rentokil's finance director, says: 'The change in
ACT was announced as a positive step for British industry. But the
chancellor did it to raise money. We had to put the dividend up by Pounds
1.1m, and we will get Pounds 400,000 back in tax. So there was a net cost to
us of Pounds 700,000 to put our shareholders back where they would have been
before.'
Mr Teare of English China Clays takes the argument further. If companies do
not increase their dividends, he points out, the pension funds which they
finance will have to carry the burden. 'Who's going to pay the bill? Or are
pension benefits going to have to come down? The benign period we've been
through of pension surpluses and improved benefits would come to a
staggering halt. All of that isn't the greatest background to consider more
investment in manufacturing industry in the UK.'
Despite the carping, few businessman will deny that taken all round, the
government's charm offensive has its value. Mr Juergen Gerhrels, UK head of
the German electronics giant Siemens, says he feels no different after the
Budget than he did before. 'But it is very important that the government has
identified itself with manufacturing. People working in manufacturing in the
UK have a lower standing than in Germany. This conviction that manufacturing
has an important role to play is definitely good for morale.'
A senior executive with one of the UK's biggest manufacturers agrees. 'We do
believe there has been a fundamental shift in thinking. There's more being
done now about manufacturing through the Department of Trade and Industry
than for 20 years or more, and that's making manufacturers much happier.'
And after all, it is possible that the chancellor is in luck. Recovery may
be taking place anyway, whatever the government does. Most industrialists
this week described it as patchy and fragile, but not all of them.
Mr Gehrels of Siemens runs a UK business with annual sales approaching
Pounds 1bn. 'I'm much more optimistic than I was a year ago. Most of our
business lags the economy, since it is in infrastructure projects. But we
also also make components for consumer electronics manufacturers, and there
has been a definite upturn there since the start of the year. We're 30 per
cent ahead of what we expected, and for me this is an economic indicator. I
think we see light at the end of the tunnel.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / Man in the News: A spoonful of financial pain - The
chancellor's current buoyancy has not been affected by an unpopular Budget /
Norman Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a self-consciously poignant moment this week as Mr Norman Lamont
set about persuading the British people that they would one day applaud him
for putting up their taxes.
Sharing for an instant the burden of his office with a few million
television viewers, Mr Lamont recalled the judgment of a colleague. Good
chancellors, this wise soul had explained, were invariably unpopular. Mr
Lamont allowed himself a chuckle. By that standard, he sometimes thought he
was the best guardian of the nation's finances there had ever been.
This weekend as he contemplates the public mood after his third and perhaps
(just perhaps) his last Budget, Mr Lamont can hardly be blamed for seeking
solace. Before Tuesday's package he was unpopular with the voters. After it,
he was more deeply so.
The reaction was not all bad. The broadsheet newspapers by and large judged
that in the circumstances (and that is an important caveat) he had done
something like the right thing. Faced with a Pounds 1bn-a-week Budget
deficit, there was no option but to raise taxes. Cutting tax allowances such
as mortgage interest relief and extending valued-added tax was probably the
best way to do it. The 'green' edges provided by a higher tax on heating and
fuel went down well with the chattering classes.
The Conservative party at Westminster offered a broadly similar assessment,
though their unease at the extension of VAT to domestic fuel forced another
of those by now ubiquitous government U-turns. A significant chunk of the
extra revenue will have to be spent on offsetting help for the poorest.
But the tabloid press, more attuned than the politicians and journalists who
inhabit the Westminster village to the mood in the pubs, was far less
generous. It reminded the chancellor of all those broken promises - offered
only a year ago when he was cutting taxes to help the Conservatives win the
general election. It seized on the VAT move as an assault on pensioners. It
had no doubt that the 1 per cent rise in National Insurance contributions
was a disguised increase in the basic rate of income tax.
The tabloids reminded the chancellor more effectively than the Labour party
that he could not claim to be clearing up after some other government's
mess.
Mr Rubert Murdoch's Sun, which has been harrying Mr Lamont for months over
his personal affairs, declared that it was no longer enough for him simply
to resign. He should commit himself to a certain kind of hospital.
Mr Lamont was unapologetic. He demonstrated last autumn after sterling's
exit from the European exchange rate mechanism that it would take more than
a few nasty newspaper editorials to shift him from a job he has always
wanted.
He has not been singing in his bath this week (apparently he now prefers
reading the newspapers during his evening soak). But he is personally
buoyant.
Sensibly, he has decided to mend some of the bridges he burnt with the media
after the ERM debacle and during the controversy over the Treasury's
contribution to a personal legal bill. He has relearned how to smile rather
than snarl when criticised. He will stay at No 11 Downing Street for as long
as Mr John Major will have him.
The chancellor is convinced that the Budget struck the right balance between
nurturing economic recovery in the short-term and bringing down the Budget
deficit over the medium term.
He decided on this growth-now-pain-later-strategy in January at the
Treasury's pre-Budget gathering in Chevening. There was subsequently some
debate about how the extra money would be raised. Mr Lamont considered
extension of the VAT base to beyond domestic fuel.
His novel plan to encourage the long-term unemployed back to work by paying
benefits to employers ready to hire them was added late in the day. Mr
Lamont spotted the idea in an article in the FT (reading it, of course, in
his bath).
But the outline of the macro-economic strategy did not change between
Chevening and last Tuesday's speech. Mr Lamont made it clear to the prime
minister that he regarded the pledge to raise an extra Pounds 6.5bn in
1994-95 and Pounds 10.5bn in 1995-96 as the minimum necessary. He also
insisted from the outset that the government would have to legislate for the
increases this year if the strategy was to have a shred of credibility in
financial markets.
Those who have talked to him since Tuesday have taken away the suspicion
that, left to his own devices, he would have preferred to have been a shade
tougher. But there is no evidence of any great row with the prime minister
during the Budget's preparation. On the day itself, Mr Major volunteered to
his Downing Street aides that the chancellor had come up with the right
Budget at the right time.
Mr Lamont wants the tax increases to be seen alongside the squeeze on public
spending set last November in the autumn statements and the 1 to 4 per cent
inflation target which has replaced the ERM as the lodestar for monetary
policy.
Taken together, he believes all three represent a coherent macro-economic
policy which should last the lifetime of the present parliament. He intends
to supplement it with an approach to micro-economics which combines the
free-market zeal of the Thatcher years with a recognition that government
can single out manufacturing industry for help.
His judgment on the politics of the Budget was similarly sanguine. No matter
that he raised taxes just a year after promising to cut them. Circumstances,
a favourite friend of politicians when pledges are dropped, had changed.
Economic recovery would dim tabloid memories (by yesterday The Sun had been
driven to welcome on its front page the fall in unemployment and a pick-up
in the housing market). The electorate would thank him for restoring a grip
on the economy, for refusing to duck difficult decisions. Had not Lord Howe
got it right by being similarly tough in 1981?
Therein lies the gamble. Mr Lamont was probably correct in judging that to
have done nothing would have been a more damaging admission of failure. But
he may well have been too hopeful.
A ministerial colleague - in admittedly mischievous mood after a good dinner
 -summed up the chancellor's predicament with a cruelly amusing metaphor. Mr
Lamont was like the bank robber who wounded an innocent by-stander while
plying his trade. By stopping to ensure an ambulance was called before
making his getaway, the robber left the bank convinced that he would be
judged a popular hero rather than a villain.
Well, not quite. Mr Lamont cannot take for granted the nation's willingness
to forget and forgive. He has staked all on the economic recovery taking
hold before the government's finances get any worse. If it does not, then he
or his successor will find themselves repeating the tax-raising exercise in
November.
He is assuming that improved housing and labour markets will persuade the
public to take the deferred tax increases in their stride; that by the time
of the next election in 1996 or 1997, reductions equivalent to 2p or 3p off
the basic rate of income tax will restore the Conservatives' tax-cutting
credentials. Maybe.
In the meantime, what of Mr Lamont's future? He is 50 and has no inclination
to move out of the world of politics he has inhabited for most of his adult
life. He would be happy to stay at the Treasury indefinitely. If the prime
minister decided he must move, then the only other job that would interest
him would be the foreign office.
The chancellor has a case for staying on. His first Budget in 1991 dug the
government out of Lady Thatcher's poll tax hole. His second helped win the
general election. The ERM debacle cannot be pinned on him without
implicating the prime minister. He has already jotted down his own account
of the fateful sequence of events which led to Black Wednesday.
The most common assessment at Westminster this week was that the Budget had
probably enhanced his chances of remaining. Those long-awaited green shoots
are showing signs of taking root. He has pre-empted many of the decisions
which a successor might want to take in the first unified Budget in
December.
The truth is that Mr Major has not made up his mind about cabinet
reshuffles. He will do so only when he manages to set himself free from the
political quagmire of the Maastricht treaty. Until then Mr Lamont, like the
rest of us, will have to wait and see whether this week's Budget improves
with age.

FT  20 MAR 93 / An irresistible force: Dividends are in the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rentokil, best known for pest control, put a cat among the pigeons on
Thursday by raising its dividend in response to the chancellor's Budget.
The increase aimed to compensate shareholders who do not pay tax, for
example pension funds. These shareholders stood to lose out because, under
Budget changes to advance corporation tax (ACT), they will receive a lower
rate of tax credit on UK dividends. Fears about lower effective dividends
for pension funds, the stock market's biggest investors, were one reason
share prices fell on Wednesday.
Rentokil's move, which was not what the chancellor intended to happen, may
add to pressure from institutions for other companies to follow suit.
However, only a few companies with high dividend and interest cover will be
able to afford that luxury.
'Given that dividend cover is at a low level because of recession, I would
guess there is only a minority of companies which can afford a dividend
increase,' according to Mr David Gray, head of research at James Capel, the
stockbroker.
The Budget changes are complex, and many companies are still working out the
full implications. But most observers say companies in the banking,
construction and engineering sectors still need to restore dividend cover
and have no room to compensate investors by lifting dividends. Utilities,
however, could increase pay-outs because of strong balance sheets inherited
from privatisation and low borrowings.
Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director at building materials group Redland,
said he wanted to restore dividend cover first. Lower ACT rates would save
the company Pounds 10m a year and improve cash flow. 'The positive effect on
the company of lower ACT will more than compensate gross (untaxed) funds for
their loss of earnings,' he said.
UK water companies, which pay no corporation tax because of high capital
allowances, are likely to face calls for higher dividend payments. These
calls may be hard to resist, because water shares are valued as high-yield
stocks.
'I can understand institutions wanting compensation, but it's just another
factor which will have to be considered at year-end,' according to Mr David
Luffrum, group finance director at Thames Water.
The ACT changes will also affect corporate pension funds, which will receive
the same reduced dividends as institutional pension fund shareholders. For
some companies, this could mean the benefit of lower ACT is balanced out by
higher pension contributions. In other cases, pension fund valuations will
have to be reviewed because previously assumed rates of dividend growth may
no longer be valid.
'Either way, people with pension fund surpluses may find them being used up
quicker than first expected,' according to another finance director.
The ACT changes will be phased in over the next year, and the new 20 per
cent rate only takes effect from April 6 next year. Companies paying
dividends in the weeks or months ahead of this date will be sorely tempted
to delay payment and qualify for the lower rate.
One company, Rathbone Brothers, an asset management group, has already
jumped the gun. It is bringing forward its interim dividend payment by two
weeks to avoid the new ACT rules.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Ministers flock to laud prospects for economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUCCESSION of senior ministers yesterday praised the Budget and projected
an upbeat message on British economic prospects.
Their optimism was part of an orchestrated attempt to drown out
'doom-mongers' - who have been condemned by Mr John Major.
Ministers want to shift the agenda of economic discussion towards the
Budget's benefits for business and away from the implications for the needy
of the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel and power.
Some ministers have been reluctant to claim in public that they, too, have
detected 'green shoots' of economic recovery, apparently first sighted by Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, at the Tory party conference in 1991. Their
fear has been that the sighting might be equally shortlived.
Yesterday's ministerial speeches contrasted the UK's grounds for economic
confidence with the recession elsewhere. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, said: 'Recovery is not yet secure but our prospects are looking
brighter, while for many countries they are looking bleaker.'
Public service minister Mr William Waldegrave told his Bristol West
constituents that the skies over Britain were becoming brighter.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, told a meeting in his
Loughborough constituency: 'This has been a five-star week for Britain. Why
won't Britain welcome it?'
Labour continued to pursue ministers on VAT and on their 'betrayal' of
election promises not to raise taxes. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, said in his Dunfermline East constituency: 'Conservatism now
means nothing more than never having to say you're sorry.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / Doubts surface on BBC governors' undertakings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, ALISON SMITH and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR BBC staff were last night casting doubt on the commitment of the
corporation's governors to honour an undertaking made on Thursday to
redefine their roles and responsibilities.
It emerged yesterday that the governors had been angered by criticisms of
their role in the appointment of Mr John Birt, first as deputy
director-general and then, from January 1 this year, as director-general.
Those criticisms, by the BBC's 41-member general advisory council, have
apparently encouraged the governors to dig their heels in and resist
pressure to undertake a thorough reform of their role.
One senior source at the BBC said yesterday: 'The only thing that is likely
to change the mood of the governors now is if any of the general advisory
council members threaten to resign in protest.'
The dominance of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the board of governors,
over the activities of the board of governors will not be affected by
Thursday's statement. A source close to the governors said things would go
on as before.
Four of the governors, including Lord Barnett, vice-chairman, are due to
retire at the end of July. However, 'even after they are gone the chairman
will still be there, as will the director-general,' said a figure in the BBC
yesterday.
The general advisory council is not due to meet again for several months.
But several of its members, including Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat
home affairs spokesman, have indicated their firm wish that Mr Hussey should
resign.
Meanwhile, it was still unclear yesterday whether Mr Birt has agreed to give
a financial indemnity to the BBC if problems with the Inland Revenue emerged
because of a reassessment of his tax status.
The BBC said yesterday that it would broadcast four of its radio networks by
Astra satellite from April 3. Households in the UK and a large part of
western Europe, will be able to receive Radios 1, 4 and 5, as well as World
Service broadcasts, by tuning into the UK Gold television channel.
The BBC has a 20 per cent stake in UK Gold and Thames Television 15 per
cent. TCI, the largest US cable operator, has 27 per cent and another US
company, Cox Cable, 38 per cent. Astra is owned by the Luxembourg-based
company SES.
Listeners to the satellite broadcasts will require a fixed satellite dish,
costing about Pounds 400, until digital audio technology becomes available
in the next few years, making portable listening possible.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Compromise agreed over police shake-up plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS have agreed a compromise over proposals by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home
secretary, which would have led to a radical reorganisation of the police
service at the expense of local councils.
Mr Clarke's original plans would have shifted all police funding to
Whitehall, and elected councillors would have lost their majority on police
authorities.
Compromise proposals, expected to be announced next week, will ensure that
there is a continuing role for councillors. They are expected to retain
about half the places on police authorities. The others will be filled by
Home Office appointees, taking account of ministers' desire to see the
business community more involved in running the police.
There are also signs that the 43 police forces in England and Wales will not
immediately be halved in number. Mr Clarke is likely to underline that the
proposed power to merge police forces should be exercised only after
consultation.
Chief constables meeting at an Association of Chief Police Officers seminar
yesterday said that it would be 'madness' for Mr Clarke to change police
force boundaries in advance of the forthcoming local government
reorganisation. They called for any eventual reorganisation to be based on a
level-headed business case rather than 'unquantified gut feelings'.
Although the chief constables accepted the case for additional members of
the public serving on police authorities, they said the link with elected
members of local authorities must not be lost. 'Officers serve the people,
not the state,' said Mr John Burrow, Acpo president, after the meeting.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Virgin weighs up legal options in fight against BA: US
battle could be a courtroom 'World War Three' - Government pressure to end
fight / Fear of 5-10 year timescale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and DANIEL GREEN

<TEXT>
VIRGIN Atlantic yesterday said it was considering three courses of legal
action against British Airways after the breakdown of the negotiations
designed to compensate Virgin after BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign: In Europe
under the competition rules of the Treaty of Rome. In North America under US
anti-trust legislation.
In the UK under the Data Protection Act and the Computer Misuse Act.
Of the three courses of action a complaint to the European Commission under
article 86 of the Treaty of Rome seems the least attractive.
The article prohibits a dominant position in a substantial part of the
common market if the position affects trade between EC states.
Virgin's first step would be to lodge a complaint with the European
Commission backed by evidence of BA's anti-competitive behaviour.
The commission would then launch an investigation and has extensive powers
to request information and carry out on-site inspections of business
records. But the investigation could take a long time. The commission is
unlikely to pursue the matter with any urgency if the complaints against BA
are limited to past conduct.
If the commission eventually found BA guilty of an infringement it could
impose a fine on BA of up to 10 per cent of its worldwide turnover. However
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, would not recover any damages.
To recover damages for a breach of article 86 he would have to bring a
private action in the British courts. The courts have little experience of
trying such cases, however, and it could turn out to be a very
time-consuming and costly exercise for little reward.
Damages awarded by British courts are tiny when compared with the sums
awarded in the US. So, if Mr Branson is determined to press ahead against BA
he would do better to sue BA in the US. There, the courts have the option of
tripling the damages awarded.
Virgin's lawyers have already looked at suing BA in the US. When gathering
evidence of alleged BA dirty tricks in the US in advance of the UK high
court libel action, lawyers from London firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis met Mr Robert
Beckman, the US anti-trust lawyer. Mr Beckman handled the anti-trust lawsuit
brought by Sir Freddie Laker, owner of the defunct Laker Airways, against BA
over Skytrain which was concluded in 1984.
Mr Beckman will have warned Virgin of the risks of suing in the US. The
Laker case became bogged down over the issue of whether the US courts had
jurisdiction to hear the case. The federal circuit Court of Appeals
eventually ruled that the courts did have the jurisdiction, but the two
parties settled out of court and no legal decision was ever reached on the
merits of Mr Laker's claim.
Virgin might avoid such a fight provided it limits its claim to the dirty
tricks which allegedly took place in the US. Nevertheless, US anti-trust
lawyers warn such an action is fraught with danger.
Virgin would almost certainly be limited to bringing the US equivalent of an
article 86 action under section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging abuse of a
monopoly position.
'If BA fights it would be the equivalent of World War Three litigation. It's
a very unclear area of the law,' one US anti-trust lawyer said.
He warned there would be problems in defining in which markets there was
dominance and in deciding whether the complaint amounted to anti-competitive
conduct under the Sherman Act. There would be also any number of appeals on
points of law.
'It could take anywhere between five and 10 years to litigate,' the lawyer
added.
Even if Mr Branson were awarded triple damages it would still be open to BA
to sue Virgin in the UK courts under the clawback provisions of the
Protection of Trade Act, which is designed to restrict the impact of the
jurisdiction of foreign courts over UK companies.
Although this legislation has never been invoked in Britain, it allows for
the clawback of up to two-thirds of a US triple damages award.
Mr Branson also faces problems with using the Data Protection Act and
Computer Misuse Act. While the British courts could provide a forum for the
revelation of further potentially embarrassing information on BA, the acts
are rarely used and involve limited penalties.
Virgin refused to be drawn yesterday on which course of legal action it
would follow against BA and when. A decision is promised within a few weeks.
Whatever his final choice, Mr Branson will be aware that he will need a very
deep pocket if he is eventually to recoup more than the Pounds 9m he was
reputedly offered during the settlement negotiations.

FT  20 MAR 93 / From cups of tea. . . to round-the-clock talks . . .to a
farce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT ALL started politely enough over countless cups of tea in the
ground-floor drawing room of Richard Branson's elegant Holland Park mansion.
For 90 minutes on Monday, January 25, the flamboyant head of Virgin
Atlantic, perched on the edge of his armchair, chatted animatedly with Sir
Colin Marshall, the hard-nosed and somewhat more conventional chief
executive of British Airways.
Both men were anxious to bury the hatchet after a messy, damaging and
sometimes squalid battle which threatened to spiral out of control. A
fortnight earlier BA had attempted to end its long-running 'dirty tricks'
dispute with Virgin when it apologised in the High Court for its underhand
behaviour and paid Pounds 610,000 in libel damages.
Branson, in spite of the settlement, was still fuming at what he always saw
as an attempt by BA to drive his smaller airline out of business. The day
after Virgin's court victory, Sir Freddie Laker, whose own airline was
forced out of business 10 years earlier, had telephoned from Florida to
congratulate Branson and to offer a succinct piece of advice: 'Sue the
bastards'.
The Virgin boss now wanted a lot more than Pounds 610,000. He sought
millions from BA for the damage inflicted on his fleet of eight jumbos, with
a commitment never again to treat a competitor so shabbily. He threatened a
barrage of legal action across the US and Europe if BA refused.
In spite of BA hopes that the High Court hearing would represent the end of
the affair, the airline knew it had to talk. Branson was not a man to give
up easily and the mere threat, deftly dropped into the odd conversation,
that he had far more damaging evidence could not be dismissed lightly.
Both sides were also under increasing pressure from the government to settle
a dogfight which ministers believed was giving the British airline industry
a bad name.
At their Holland Park summit Branson and Marshall were joined by Trevor
Abbott, Virgin group managing director, and Robert Ayling, his opposite
number at BA. Marshall kicked off with a statement repeating his airline's
apologies and providing assurances that he had not been involved in any
campaign.
Like dishes on a menu, Branson then reeled off the issues he expected both
sides to cover during talks designed to reach a final peace settlement. High
on the list was a pledge by BA not to make any further improper use of
Virgin computer information and an end to passenger poaching.
Marshall and Branson seemed to take it in their stride. They emerged,
smiling and joking, to tell the press, who had been kept entertained in
Branson's dining room, that talks would start at once.
Sir Colin was to fly out of the country on business, so he left Ayling to
fix up an early meeting with Abbott and start the hard bargaining. Lawyers
constantly on hand, Abbott and Ayling started to meet regularly at Enserch
House, BA's London offices in St James' Square. Occasionally they convened
at Linklater and Paines, the airline's solicitors.
The talks quickly became bogged down. An insider said: 'It was quite clear
that BA's lawyers were, initially, just intent upon finding out what else we
might have on them.'
On February 5 BA announcedthat Lord King was stepping down in sadness as
chairman six months ahead of schedule. The end of his 12-year reign handed
Sir Colin the executive chairman role he had always wanted.
Ten days later the negotiations came close to collapse. In spite of a mutual
pledge that neither side would disclose any details until an agreement was
signed, Branson awoke to find Sunday newspapers carrying the terms of an
offer included in a letter from BA to Virgin.
His fury at BA's apparent lack of good faith intensified press suggestions
that his side had leaked the terms of BA's offer. The theory was killed when
it emerged that the letter was a draft which had never left BA's hands.
That Sunday Branson wrote a long and angry letter to Sir Michael Angus, BA's
deputy chairman. The letter challenged statements by BA's lawyers that the
airline's directors had not known about the 'dirty tricks' campaign.
Branson focused on the specific issue of computer accessing. Virgin had
accused BA of tapping into its computer reservation information for the past
three years and that it had continued to do so last summer even after
Virgin's lawyers had formally complained to BA.
In any case, the offer BA leaked to the Sunday newspapers was unacceptable.
The UK flag carrier proposed to pay Virgin Pounds 3m to settle a
longstanding aircraft maintenance dispute and also suggested arbitration
procedures to determine Virgin's claims for commercial damages.
The Branson letter brought BA back to the negotiating table and Lord
Caithness, the aviation minister, urged Branson to try to settle to avoid a
damaging legal battle in the US.
When the talks resumed after an apology from Sir Colin for the previous
weekend's events the lawyers took the strain. As the days passed Gerrard
Tyrell and Colin Howes, the Harbottle and Lewis lawyers working for Branson,
fought for 48 hours to stay awake as they sparred with an army of legal
experts from Linklaters, Simmonds and Simmonds - representing the
non-executive directors - and Sullivan and Cromwell.
Up to 20 BA lawyers working in shifts kept one session going for 25 hours
without a break. A Virgin official said: 'BA's view appeared to be that they
were buying Virgin's silence, not that they were compensating us for the
'dirty tricks' campaign.'
By February 18 Abbott had presented a compromise package to Ayling. Talks to
hammer out the compromise intensified but on February 22 they risk being
derailed with fresh press disclosures suggesting BA was still poaching
Virgin passengers in California.
The same day Branson rushed to Heathrow Airport to indulge in the type of
highly effective self-promotion which has become his hallmark. Opening the
new Virgin Clubhouse, complete with music room, massage and manicure
parlours, Branson vowed to make flying fun.
He had a more serious message for BA, issuing another public ultimatum to
his competitor to settle immediately or face a bruising legal battle.
The following day a meeting was held at Branson's home between the Virgin
boss, Abbott, Ayling and Michael Davies, a BA non-executive director
standing in for Sir Michael Angus.
Branson told them he would settle the dispute for around Pounds 12.5m to
Pounds 13m which would cover both the maintenance row and passenger-poaching
claims.
On March 1, BA came back with a draft contract including a counter offer of
Pounds 9m. With some BA directors suggesting the figure was unnecessarily
generous, it was to be BA's last cash offer.
The draft, however, contained a poison pill. BA was now insisting on a
strict confidentiality clause and the return of documents setting out the
'dirty tricks' allegations against BA which had forced the airline into a
High Court settlement.
Although he would accept the Pounds 9m cash payment, Branson flatly rejected
any suggestion that his company should be permanently gagged. Neither would
he tolerate returning the court documents if BA intended to shred them. He
suggested they should be held by lawyers at least until both companies
enjoyed a better relationship.
An angry Branson told Sir Michael Angus that the idea of a gag was
contemptible. Such were the conditions being laid down by lawyers, he
complained, any autobiography he should one day write would have to pretend
the affair never happened. Setting yet another deadline he told BA: 'settle
by 4pm Friday or we'll see you in court.'
The following day, with the talks deadlocked, Branson used an address to the
Royal Aeronautical Society to ask the government to give smaller UK airlines
a fair crack of the whip in competing for business against BA. He could not
resist a jibe, thanking BA for its 'generosity' in checking, at absolutely
no cost to Virgin, his airline's computer records.
Two days later, after Sir Colin and Ayling had found themselves facing
criticism of their airline's behaviour from some MPs at a meeting of the
Commons all-party Aviation Group, talks were back on to resolve the gagging
and shredding issues.
As the hours ticked away towards 4pm on Friday March 5, Branson's team drew
up a press release announcing the collapse of talks and the decision to
pursue BA through the courts. At 3.59pm, a letter arrived from Ayling,
telling Branson a more detailed response was on its way.
Once more in the game of bluff and counter bluff, the Virgin camp lifted the
deadline. When it came, however, the counter offer was still not acceptable
to Branson. Although BA proposed to keep the 'dirty tricks' documents for
five years, the Virgin boss felt he still faced an unacceptable vow of
silence.
That Sunday, Branson flew to New York as his lawyers digested the contents
of BA's latest offer and prepared another response. When Branson returned to
London four days later, both sides were still bogged down in a legalistic
tussle which increasingly threatened their credibility in the eyes of those
watching.
The log-jam continued for seven more days, in large part because BA's top
management were engaged on another front with the airline's USAir deal
coming to a head. Ayling had to fly off at a moment's notice to the US where
the new Clinton administration was about to pronounce itself on BA's Dollars
300m investment in USAir. The USAir deal, much to BA's relief, was cleared
last Monday.
Back in London, Ayling sent a letter to Virgin saying that BA was prepared
to continue negotiating but not prepared to accept arbitrary deadlines
repeatedly set by Branson.
Virgin said Ayling's latest and long-awaited response was still totally
unacceptable because it continued to insist on gagging Branson. 'This is
turning into a Brian Rix farce and even farces don't run for so long in the
West End,' said Abbott.
Enough was enough. After Branson returned yesterday from the US he announced
that he was breaking off talks with BA and that he was starting legal
proceedings against the UK flag carrier's conduct in the UK, EC, and US
courts. The battle which lies ahead could make recent events look like a
minor dogfight.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Concern over undertaking on role by BBC governors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, ALISON SMITH and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS WERE being expressed at senior levels in the BBC last night that the
corporation's governors intend to follow through an undertaking made on
Thursday to clearly redefine their roles and responsibilities.
It emerged yesterday that the governors had been angered by criticisms of
their role in the appointment of Mr John Birt, first as deputy
director-general and then, from January 1 this year, as director-general.
Those criticisms, by the BBC's 41-member general advisory council, have
apparently encouraged the governors to dig their heels in and resist
pressure to undertake a thorough reform of their role.
One senior source at the BBC said yesterday: 'The only thing that is likely
to change the mood of the governors now is if any of the general advisory
council members threaten to resign in protest.'
The dominance of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the board of governors,
over the activities of the board of governors will not be affected by
Thursday's statement. A source close to the governors said things would go
on as before.
Four of the governors, including Lord Barnett, vice-chairman, are due to
retire at the end of July. However, 'even after they are gone the chairman
will still be there, as will the director-general,' said a figure in the BBC
yesterday.
The general advisory council is not due to meet again for several months.
But several of its members, including Mr Robert MacClennan, Liberal Democrat
home affairs spokesman, have indicated their firm wish that Mr Hussey should
resign.
Were pressure from the council to eventually force a much firmer intention
of the board of governors to re-define its responsibilities and activities,
a political dimension would enter the furore. Depending on how far-reaching
reform of the governors' practices were to be, the the BBC charter itself
may have to be amended.
That amendment could be made only with the agreement of Mr Peter Brooke, the
national heritage secretary, and would have to be approved by parliament.
Meanwhile, it was still unclear yesterday whether Mr Birt has agreed to give
a financial indemnity to the BBC if problems with the Inland Revenue emerged
due to a reassessment of his tax status.
Some accountants believe that if Mr Birt was judged to have been an employee
of the BBC for tax purposes it would be possible for the Inland Revenue to
claw back PAYE tax liabilities and national insurance contributions from the
BBC.

FT  20 MAR 93 / London road jams 'sickly': Fear of 'maglignant' congestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ALASTAIR MORTON, chief executive of Eurotunnel, yesterday warned that if
congestion in and around London was not tackled the rest of Britain would
suffer.
He told a conference of 250 managers in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, that
congestion in London was 'a sickly thrombosis - it's a malignant one, almost
cancerous'.
Speakers at the conference discussed the problems that northern and Scottish
companies have when trying to reach markets in continental Europe.
Lord Healey, the former Labour deputy leader, said northern England and
Scotland had more than 30 per cent of Britain's road freight traffic but
received only 16 per cent of the government's budget for new motorways and
trunk roads.

FT  20 MAR 93 / The unhealthy story of where a family spends its money
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW retail prices index weightings, which are supposed to reflect how a
typical household divides its income, paint a rather disturbing picture of
family spending priorities.
Mortgage interest payments still get the single biggest weighting of 48
parts out of the total of 1,000, although this has fallen from last year's
weighting of 64. Sweets and chocolates get the highest weighting in the food
category, accounting for 12 parts, while biscuits and cakes get a weighting
of 9. Fresh vegetables get 7 parts and fresh fruit a meagre 6.
The cigarette weighting has fallen this year to 31 parts from 32, in spite
of price increases. This suggests that families are spending proportionately
less on tobacco.
Compact discs, which were introduced to the index five years ago, receive a
weighting of 7 with cassette tapes. Vinyl records disappeared from the index
last year.
The cost of foreign package holidays, included in the retail prices index
for the first time in its 79-year history, has been given a weighting of 30.

<TEXT>
THE MARC RICH commodities trading organisation, which is based in
Switzerland, has become the first foreign company to be awarded a licence to
supply electricity in England and Wales.
Rich claims to be second only to Cargill, the US group, among the world's
diversified trading houses, concentrating particularly on oil and aluminium.
It publishes no accounts but Mr Marc Rich, who has built up the group since
1974, says turnover is about Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21bn) a year while the net
worth is about Dollars 1bn.
Rich will supply very large industrial customers, each with demand for at
least 1MW in any half-hour period , with electricity it buys from the 'pool'
or the wholesale market.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Children may be allowed in pubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILDREN WILL be able to accompany their parents in pubs, and
Continental-style cafes will be permitted to sell alcohol under a relaxation
of the licensing laws in England and Wales being considered by the
government.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, yesterday stressed the boost which such
changes would provide for the tourism and leisure industry when calling for
comments in a consultation period extending to the end of June.
He told the Commons that he hoped the introduction of more 'civilised
habits' would curb heavy drinking in addition to widening consumer choice.
Mr Clarke explained that pubs with suitable facilities would be granted a
certificate allowing the admission of children under 14 - possibly subject
to a 8pm time limit - providing they were accompanied by an adult.
The Continental-style cafes would be able to sell alcohol with or without a
meal, although food and non-alcoholic drinks would also be expected. Mr
Clarke emphasised the government had 'absolutely no intention' of relaxing
the prohibition on the sale of alcohol to people under 18, and their
consumption of alcohol in licensed premises.
He said a further proposal would remove the absolute discretion of licensing
justices and, as was already the case in Scotland, limit the grounds for
refusing a licence to those specified by statute.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said changes should not result in the
interests of local people being cast aside for commercial reasons. He said:
'The problem is not pubs wanting to open but prevented by the licensing
laws, but the numbers closing.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / Food, petrol and clothing nudge up inflation rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPER PRICE increases for food, petrol and clothing contributed to the
small rises in headline and underlying inflation last month.
Prices rose 0.7 per cent on the month, taking the retail prices index to
138.8 and the annual rate to 1.8 per cent. Underlying inflation, which
excludes mortgage payments, rose to an annual rate of 3.4 per cent. Food
price inflation remains low at 0.9 per cent on an annual basis, but in
February food prices rose 1.1 per cent on the previous month, the biggest
monthly increase for almost two years.
The Central Statistical Office said the rise occurred mainly because of a
sharp increase in seasonal food prices with retailers raising the prices of
fresh fruit, vegetables and home-killed lamb by more than in 1992. As a
result seasonal food prices fell only 9 per cent in the 12 months to
February compared with 10.4 per cent in the year to January.
In spite of recent reductions in interest rates, housing costs - mainly
mortgage interest payments - rose by 0.3 per cent in February compared with
the previous month. The CSO said the rise reflected a small continuing
increase in the size of the average outstanding mortgage debt.
The price of household goods rose 0.7 per cent from the previous month, as
the cost of furniture and furnishings bounced back after the January sales.
The annual rate of inflation for this category of the RPI continued to
reflect the sluggishness of the housing market, rising only 1.4 per cent in
the year to February, the lowest rate for six years.
Clothing and footwear prices, which continue to fall on an annual basis,
rose by 1.8 per cent month-on-month, reflecting price recoveries after the
sharp reductions of the January sales and price increases as the new
season's fashions entered the shops.
The second phase of higher telephone charges boosted household service
prices by 0.5 per cent on the month and 3.8 per cent in the year to
February. Leisure service prices also rose. Increases in excise duties
announced in the Budget will not affect the RPI until April. They are
expected to add about 0.5 per cent to the index.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Leaked route to Channel angers Kent villagers: Fresh
protests planned over tunnel link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWEVER ANGRY Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, might feel over the
leaked Channel tunnel rail plans, the mood in some of the villages along the
proposed line yesterday was even more bitter.
With the plans widely perceived to represent a cheaper - and more
environmentally damaging - option than previous proposals, the leak has left
residents and council groups in Kent wearily plan-ning a new set of
protests.
The plans revealed by Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, show
that the line is planned to run mostly above ground between the Channel
terminal and London, with fewer tunnels than originally expected.
With some details of the leaked plan still to be decided, Kent County
Council refused to speculate on the precise impact of the plans on the
region.
Mr Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, chairman of the planning committee, said: 'We
recognise that you can't build a railway through Kent without causing some
environmental harm. But we are insisting that the plans should conform to
the highest standards.'
Nevertheless, the council admits that the delays in the decision and the
nature of the leak have left many in the area feeling deeply frustrated.
Mr Andrew Rowe, Conservative MP for Mid Kent, said: 'Nothing in this
long-running saga has been well handled and this is no exception.'
Meanwhile, along the route of the line the mood was mixed, with most
villages greeting the proposals with confusion and anger.
Starting in the west, one area with some cause to celebrate is a six-mile
stretch west of the village of Boxley, where it seems that the line will run
through a tunnel, instead of overground as once feared.
Mrs Molly Tipples, a regional campaigner, said: 'Where I live we are
obviously delighted.'
A few miles further east, in the picturesque Boxley valley, the villages are
in uproar. Although this part of the line was planned as a tunnel, the new
proposals suggest it will run above ground, 300 metres past a new housing
estate, then slice through a section of the green belt which separates the
Medway conurbation from the Maidstone area.
Mr Garreth Thomas, chairman of the Boxley village protest group, said:
'We're very disappointed. The land is geographically so important.'
He fears that if that section of the green belt vanishes 'we could end up
with a conurbation the size of Manchester.'
His anger is echoed six miles further along the route in the village of
Harrietsham. Villagers originally hoped to have a 'cut and cover' tunnel in
the area but now also face an overground option.
Residents in Harrietsham are furious that although British Rail has offered
some compensation, it covers only those living within 100 metres of the
track.
Mr Robert Taylor, chairman of Harrietsham parish council, said: 'There are a
lot of people here who want to move but cannot sell their houses.'
A few miles further east, on another stretch of the overground route, the
villages of Lenham Heath and Charing fear that they will no longer be
protected from the effects of noise pollution.
Mr Martin Pym, a farmer, said: 'The prevailing wind will blow all the noise
and dust to the village. But now it seems that a lot of the protective
fencing will be left out.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / End to antiquated rules welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISITORS TO Britain will no longer be quite so bewildered by the country's
antiquated licensing laws if the proposals put forward yesterday by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, are introduced.
The planned reforms were welcomed by brewers, pub companies and tourist
authorities.
Reaction was summed up by Camra, the Campaign for Real Ale, which said there
was no question of wanting to change the law on when children could drink
alcohol 'but making the kids drink squash in the pub car park is one of the
bizarre British rituals that really ought to be scrapped'.
Mr Clarke, who once objected to being called a political lager-lout because
he prefers real ale, said: 'It is time to relax some of the laws which have
made most pubs no-go areas for families.'
The Brewers' Society strongly welcomed the move to provide children's
certificates for suitable pubs to allow youngsters under the age of 14 to be
admitted up to 8pm when accompanied by an adult.
Mr Robin Simpson, the Brewers' Society's director, said: 'It is sheer common
sense to allow pubs to apply for these certificates and it reflects the fact
that pubs are now a modern leisure unit which should be available for use by
all the family. It is also the best way to get over a sensible drinking
message to the kids.'
Pubmaster, the UK's largest independent pub retailer with more than 2,000
pubs, said the relaxations would bring Britain more into line with the rest
of Europe. It would also create more potential business for the licensed
trade. This was welcome, as the chancellor had again hit beer in the Budget.
Whitbread, the brewing group, thought the proposals would help to remove the
mystique which surrounded eating and drinking in pubs for many children, and
ultimately should lead to more sensible eating and drinking.
Mr Mark Bennett of Alcohol Concern said he would give the proposals a
cautious welcome if they made pubs safer and more sociable rather than
heavy-drinking shops.
'But there are caveats. We want to know what the criteria will be for giving
children's certificates, and we will be pressing for better training for bar
staff and for a period of monitoring after the changes have been
introduced,' he said.
The English Tourist Board said it had been pressing for the relaxation of
licensing laws and the idea of children's certificates would make life
easier and more pleasant for families.
The certificates are already in use in Scotland.

FT  20 MAR 93 / MPs to challenge agency on lost Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs ON THE Commons public accounts committee are to challenge officials from
the Benefits Agency about how the failure of its computer system contributed
to the disappearance of some Pounds 21m from the agency's accounts.
A report by the National Audit Office said a total of Pounds 37m went
missing from the 1991-92 accounts for the social fund, which makes loans to
people in need for important or emergency purchases. Of that Pounds 8m was
lost through accountancy errors. A further Pounds 8m was lost through
'normal' delays in putting new loans into the system.
Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour chairman of the committee - the Commons'
watchdog on spending - said the agency should have had much better control
systems and should have planned its computer system more effectively. The
agency yesterday said the discrepancy had been caused by an inadequate
rather than a faulty computer system, and said it thought only a 'small
part' of the Pounds 21m would have to be written off.
The system consists of a stand-alone personal computer in each office and
was installed in 1988 when the agency was founded. It does not transfer
records from one office to another and its software is unable to deal with
more than one loan per individual.
If someone repaying a loan through deductions in social security benefits
moved without leaving a forwarding address any money owed became 'lost' in
the system.
A new system intended to connect individual offices has already been
installed in two offices and should link every office by January 1994.
Mr Sheldon said that the errors were particularly serious since the amounts
represented such a large proportion of the social fund's annual budget of
more than Pounds 300m.

FT  20 MAR 93 / City report scorns Treasury policy for rail: Charges for
road use in the capital urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S view that private-sector money will help fund new railway
projects has been sharply contradicted by a detailed report for the
Corporation of London, the local authority for the City.
The study, by the London School of Economics, says the solution to London's
transport problems lies in higher fares, heavier property taxes and the
introduction of charges for road use, rather than 'unrealistic' attempts to
get the private sector interested in unprofitable projects.
The report comes just days after the chancellor's Budget speech reaffirmed
the government's determination to involve the private sector in funding
transport projects - including the Pounds 2bn east-west CrossRail scheme
through London.
It says investment in public transport projects in London is 'so
fundamentally unprofitable' that private finance will not make a very
significant contribution.
'There is a danger that unrealistic aspirations for attracting private
finance will divert attention from the real issues and continue to sanction
delay,' it warns.
'All concerned will have to face up to the hard fact that if new major
investment is to take place in London's transport infrastructure then some
form of tax financing is going to have to be the majority source of funds.'
The report, by Mr Stephen Glaister and Mr Tony Travers of the LSE, is being
published as part of the City Research Project, a three-year study into
London's competitive position in international financial services.
It says about Pounds 1.9bn a year is needed to fund London's public
transport needs.
The Corporation of London believes that the low rents accompanying London's
over-supply of office space make it an attractive place to do business, but
the offices will be filled only if there is sufficient capacity in the
transport system.
Mr Michael Cassidy, the Corporation of London's policy committee chairman,
said yesterday: 'Financial services thrive in city-centre locations and have
to be served by rail connections.
'CrossRail, the most important of the infrastructure improvements for the
City of London, would equip the Square Mile to achieve its leadership role
in international finance. Without it, yet another opportunity to promote the
powerhouse of the nation's invisible earnings capability will have been
lost.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / One-day strike called at Ford
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A ONE-DAY strike of 8,500 white-collar staff at Ford has been called for
Thursday by the MSF white-collar union in protest at the threat of
compulsory redundancies. The date coincides with the launch of Ford's Mondeo
model.
Foremen at Ford's Dagenham, Swansea and Southampton plants are today due to
end the strike they started four days ago against the compulsory redundancy
threat. Ford said last night their strike had 'made no impact on
production'.

<TEXT>
A Pounds 25m loan-backed Business Expansion Scheme organised by Barclays de
Zoete Wedd may have failed to qualify for tax relief due to an oversight on
the eve of the Budget, John Authers writes.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in his speech that shares in BES
companies had to be issued to shareholders by midnight before the Budget if
loans were to be made against them.
BZW, a London-based securities house, said yesterday that there were
'uncertainties in the Inland Revenue press release' and that it was seeking
a ruling from the Revenue.
The Inland Revenue said that it was left to individual tax inspectors to
decide when a share had been 'issued'. It said: 'This will normally happen
when the shareholding has been listed in the company's register of members.'
BZW's Gracechurch companies bought repossessed properties from Barclays
Bank's loan book. They were launched at the end of February and were fully
subscribed within a week.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Warning on traffic congestion in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ALASTAIR Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel, yesterday warned that if
congestion in and around London was not tackled the rest of Britain would
suffer.
He told 250 senior managers from many sectors of the economy in Wakefield,
West Yorkshire that congestion in London was 'a sickly thrombosis - it's a
malignant one, almost cancerous.'
Speakers at the conference, which was sponsored by IBM, discussed the
problems that northern and Scottish companies have when trying to reach
markets in continental Europe.
Sir Alastair said that if London was crippled as a world-class capital city
the rest of Britain would be harder to reach.
Lord Healey, the former Labour deputy leader, said the north and Scotland
had more than 30 per cent of Britain's road freight traffic but received
only 16 per cent of the government's budget for new motorways and trunk
roads.
He added that rail freight charges had risen 36 per cent in the last year as
a prelude to privatisation and more government investment was needed to
improve speed of access to European customers.

ROSYTH Royal Dockyard, the privately-managed Fife naval facility threatened
with losing its nuclear submarine refitting business, said yesterday that a
proposal for it to upgrade oil tankers instead was unlikely to work.
The proposal, made last month by the rival Devonport yard in Plymouth, was
aimed at finding an alternative use for the incomplete submarine dock
project at Rosyth, on which Pounds 120m of government money has been spent.
Rosyth's counter-study found the proposal 'deeply flawed'.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Power licence for Marc Rich
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARC Rich commodities trading organisation, which is based in
Switzerland, has become the first foreign company to be awarded a licence to
supply electricity in England and Wales.
Rich claims to be second only to Cargill, the US group, among the world's
diversified trading houses, concentrating particularly on oil and aluminium.
It publishes no accounts but Mr Marc Rich, who has built up the group since
1974, says turnover is about Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21bn) a year while the net
worth is about Dollars 1bn.
Mr Rich is a controversial figure because since 1984 he has been wanted by
the US authorities for tax evasion and on charges that he illegally traded
with Iran during the hostage crisis. He never visits the UK, which has
extradition arrangements with the US.
The Office of Electricity Regulation yesterday granted the Rich organisation
a second-tier licence with permission to supply electricity to very large
industrial customers, each with demand for at least 1 megawatt.
Rich will buy its electricity from the 'pool' or the wholesale market formed
after privatisation of the industry.
So far Ofer has issued 28 second-tier supply licences for England and Wales
and 17 for Scotland.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Welsh pub referendum to be abolished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WETS have won in Wales. The government intends to abolish the referendum
that is held every seven years on Sunday pub opening, Roland Adburgham
writes.
This process has steadily reduced the number of Welsh areas where pubs are
closed on a Sunday to just one. The Welsh Office is proposing that the next
poll, due in 1996, should be the last. Only legislation would then be able
to change its result.
Sir Wyn Roberts, minister for Wales, said: 'Since the inception of Sunday
opening referenda in 1961 there has been a steady decline in turnout which
was less than 9 per cent of the electorate at the last poll, held in
November 1989.'
The diehard district was Dwyfor in north Wales, where the turnout was 47 per
cent. A majority of nearly 1,500 voted to stay dry. Mr Dennis Roberts, the
district council secretary, said yesterday: 'Sunday opening is an issue
locally. It was a vote for the old way of life.'

FT  20 MAR 93 / Moi spurns 'dictatorial' western donors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S President Daniel arap Moi yesterday threatened to suspend relations
with western donors and said Kenya was on the brink of collapse.
The president's move followed the refusal of donors to resume Dollars 40m a
month aid payments amid fresh evidence of government backsliding on free
market reforms and continued corruption by banks and businessmen.
Bankers and donors said Mr Moi's statement would further destabilise the
economy, fuel rapid depreciation of the Kenya shilling and boost inflation,
which has already risen to around 50 per cent this year.
Many observers fear the rapid price spiral will spark urban unrest among
Kenya's impoverished people.
President Moi said the government was reviewing relations with donors who
were forcing 'dictatorial and suicidal' reforms on the country.
Mr Moi singled out the International Monetary Fund for criticism, saying the
reforms were unrealistic and were causing suffering to the Kenyan people.
'Kenya will no longer agree to policies which are economically suicidal,' he
said. 'The government is to rethink the country's economic arrangements and
take the necessary steps it deems fit to safeguard the welfare of the
people.'
For a month Kenya has tried to woo back badly needed balance of payments
aid, which was suspended in 1991 because of corruption, mismanagement and
political authoritarianism.
The government has partly liberalised the foreign exchange market and made
tentative steps to decontrol prices. But an IMF mission two weeks ago
refused to approve the reforms until the government took further measures to
reign in excessive liquidity by raising interest rates, cutting the bloated
270,000-strong civil service and taking bolder steps on price
liberalisation. Donors who met in London last Monday refused to resume aid
until the IMF conditions were met.
In a move that seemed to meet some IMF demands on mopping up liquidity, the
government yesterday issued Ksh5bn (Pounds 61m) worth of three-month
Treasury Bills. Bankers who bid for the bills said the interest rate would
be around 35 per cent - 10 points lower than the IMF's target.
However, the move was overshadowed by evidence that the central bank this
week released Ksh5.4bn through the controversial pre-export financing scheme
to two banks - Trade Bank and Exchange Bank.
The pre-export financing scheme has been criticised by donors as one of
Kenya's worst corruption scandals, allowing politically connected companies
and banks access to cheap Kenya shillings for conversion into foreign
exchange and 'round tripping'.
Last month Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister, promised that the
pre-export financing scheme had been shut down.
Mr Robert Shaw, economic spokesman of the opposition Ford-Kenya, said: 'All
the old scams are reappearing. Its back to business as usual.'

The explosion was the second in Calcutta in less than four days, after a

over 70 injured.
Police say that the blasts in Calcutta are not linked to the series of bomb
attacks which rocked Bombay last Friday, leaving over 250 dead.

<TEXT>
The US International Trade Commission has brought to an end a dumping suit
filed against British steel producers, with a ruling that the US industry is
not injured by exports of new steel rails from the UK, writes Nancy Dunne in
Washington.
The ruling, delivered late on Thursday, came after a 5-1 vote in which only
the Commission chairman, Mr Don Newquist, a Democrat, found that the dumping
caused injury.
British Steel accounts for the lion's share of the UK's steel rail exports
to the US, adds Andrew Baxter in London. The privatised steelmaker sold
27,000-28,000 tonnes in the US last year, worth Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m and up
sharply from the 15,000-16,000 tonnes exported to the US in 1991. The
company yesterday welcomed the ITC decision. 'We regard it as a proper
solution,' it said.

The International Monetary Fund has endorsed Egypt's compliance with the
IMF's first stand-by agreement with the country, triggering the forgiveness
of Dollars 3bn of official debt and enabling talks to start on a fresh
stand-by accord, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo.
The IMF board's approval of Egypt's economic reforms freed the final tranche
of a Dollars 370m loan agreed in a deal originally struck with the IMF in
May 1991.
Endorsement of the programme had been due by last November, but was delayed
first by disagreement over the scale of cuts in Egypt's budget deficit, then
by IMF concern over the speed of the government's privatisation programme.
The approval now signals IMF satisfaction with Cairo's progress on both.

Mr Attilio Bastianini, one of three deputy leaders of Italy's small Liberal
Party, was arrested by Milan magistrates on corruption charges yesterday,
writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The arrest of Mr Bastianini, a 50-year-old lecturer at Turin's prestigous
Politecnico, was based on allegations of receiving L250m (Pounds 110,000) in
relation to a contract with Anas, the state roads authority. Anas contracts
now constitute the largest single area of investigation by magistrates
nationwide, and this week were responsible for raising to 65 the number of
parliamentarians currently under investigation for corruption-related
offences.
Meanwhile, Belgian justice officials have asked for the assistance of their
Italian colleagues to resolve the mysterious assassination in July 1991 of
Mr Andre Cools, the Belgian Socialist deputy premier. The killing is now
believed to be related to a pay-off of L70bn on the L550bn contract to
supply 46 Augusta helicopters to the Belgian armed forces.

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kim Young-sam, South Korea's new president, yesterday announced a
'100-day programme for a new economy', intended to stimulate the economy and
remove bureaucratic controls on business.
The move comes amid indications the administration will adopt a gradual
approach towards financial liberalisation to avoid disrupting economic
recovery.
Mr Kim promised that central bank lending rates would be cut and the money
supply eased to boost economic growth, which amounted to 4.5 per cent last
year, the lowest rate in 11 years.
The finance ministry said this week economic growth was expected to fall
below the target level of 5 to 6 per cent during the first half of 1993.
Reducing interest rates represents an abandonment of the tight monetary
policy the government pursued last year to cool the overheated economy.
Inflation should be controlled instead through a voluntary restraint on
prices and wages, said Mr Kim, who suggested he might impose a mandatory
freeze.
The government has delayed plans to deregulate most commercial interest
rates until at least later in the year because of fears that this might
drive interest rates higher.
It has also postponed introducing a requirement to use real names in
financial transactions. Financial accounts can now be held under pseudonyms
and are used to hide money generated from the large underground economy.
Other proposals in the economic programme include support to small
businesses, which suffered record bankruptcies last year. State assistance
for technological research and development will be increased, while many
administrative restrictions hampering business operations will be abolished.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Japan's money supply revives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST severe monetary contraction in Japanese post-war history may be
over, according to figures published yesterday which show that the money
supply has started to grow again.
The Bank of Japan said the money supply in February grew by 0.2 per cent
compared with the year before. In January, there was a year-on-year
contraction of 0.3 per cent.
The money supply's revival may help to fuel the recent strong rally in the
Tokyo stock market. The Nikkei average closed at 18,537 yesterday, down by
190 points on the day, but 10 per cent up from a close of 16,817 two weeks
ago.
Some analysts believe the rebound in Tokyo share prices may mark the end of
a three-year bear market as the decline in the economy bottoms out with
signs of rising output in areas such as steel and bulk chemicals.
The rally, however, has mainly been driven by speculation about the
government's plans for a further package of measures to stimulate the
economy. These are likely to be finalised shortly before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the prime minister, leaves for a visit to Washington on April 15.
The renewed growth in the broadly defined money supply, M2 and certificates
of deposits, follows the Bank of Japan's recent cut in its official discount
rate to a historic low of 2.5 per cent.
The money supply grew by 0.5 per cent from January, when it had contracted
by 0.3 per cent. It fell by 0.5 per cent last September, the first
contraction on record, and then by 0.6 per cent in October and November.
Broad liquidity, which measures monetary conditions more generally, rose by
2.9 per cent in February, up from a growth rate of 2.6 per cent in January.
The Bank of Japan said the rise was due to increased holdings of commercial
paper by financial institutions and reduced tax payments by corporations.
A government savings survey, however, suggested renewed strong growth in
personal consumption, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of gross
domestic product, is unlikely.

JUSTICE Byron White yesterday announced his retirement from the Supreme
Court, thus handing President Bill Clinton a first and early opportunity to
begin reshaping the highest court.
Justice White, who is 75, said that after 31 years 'someone else should be
permitted to have a like experience.'
Appointed by President Kennedy in 1962, he is the only nominee of a
Democratic president now sitting on the court.
Not since 1967, when President Johnson elevated the late Justice Thurgood
Marshall, has a vacancy occurred during a Democrat presidency.
At least one other member of the court, Justice Harry Blackmun, has recently
spoken openly about retiring. Though appointed by President Nixon, he has
emerged as one of the most liberal members, whereas Justice White has become
more conservative.
Two names most frequently mentioned as likely Clinton nominations are
governor Mario Cuomo of New York and Mrs Marian Wright Edelman, guiding
light behind the Children's Defence Fund and a close friend of the president
and his wife.

THE International Monetary Fund has endorsed Egypt's compliance with the
Fund's first stand-by agreement with the country, triggering the forgiveness
of Dollars 3bn worth of official debt and enabling the start of talks on a
fresh stand-by accord, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo.
The Fund's board approved Egypt's economic reforms late on Thursday in
Washington, freeing the final tranche of a Dollars 370m loan agreed in a
deal originally struck with the IMF in May 1991.
Endorsement of the programme had been due by last November, but was delayed
first by disagreement over the scale of cuts in Egypt's budget deficit, then
by IMF concern over the speed of the government's privatisation programme.
Thursday's approval signals IMF satisfaction with Cairo's progress on both.
Talks can now begin on a second stand-by agreement with the IMF which, if
approved, would trigger further debt forgiveness under the terms of a Paris
Club deal agreed with Egypt in 1991.

Romania's four-month-old minority government yesterday survived a vote of no
confidence brought by pro-reform opposition parties unhappy with the pace
and depth of the country's transition to a market economy, writes Virginia
Marsh in Bucharest.
With the support of nationalists and ex-communist parties, the left-wing
Democratic National Salvation Front government defeated the no confidence
motion by 260 to 192 votes.
Opposition parties brought the motion last week after the government
presented its four-year governing strategy but refused to allow parliament
to vote on it.
The opposition said the strategy failed to specify measures to restructure
and stem economic decline, and criticised the government for aiming to raise
state involvement in managing market reform - a 'dirigism' which, it said,
showed the government did not understand the workings of a market economy.

<TEXT>
The US International Trade Commission has brought to an end a dumping suit
filed against British steel producers with a ruling that the US industry is
not injured by exports of new steel rails from the UK, writes Nancy Dunne in
Washington.
The ruling, delivered late on Thursday, came after a 5-1 vote in which only
the Commission chairman, Mr Don Newquist, a Democrat, found that the dumping
caused injury. Two other Democrats joined three Republicans in the vote.
The outcome sends a reminder to US steel producers, who have filed dozens of
dumping and countervailing duty suits against their foreign competitors,
that they cannot count on a finding of injury from the non-partisan
commission.
The US Commerce Department, which is believed to be more susceptible to
political pressure, had found a dumping margin of 70 per cent on the rail
imports. The suits were filed by Bethlehem Steel Corporation and CF&amp;I Steel
Corporation in November 1992. The US imported almost Dollars 70m worth of
rails in 1991 from Japan, the UK, Luxembourg and Germany.
British Steel accounts for the lion's share of the UK's steel rail exports
to the US. The privatised steel maker sold 27,000-28,000 tonnes in the US
last year, worth Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m and up sharply from the 15,000-16,000
tonnes exported to the US in 1991, adds Andrew Baxter in London.
Yesterday the company welcomed the ITC's decision, but noted that the
outcome was only what it has considered all along to have been reasonable.

<TEXT>
Mr Attilio Bastianini, one of three deputy leaders of Italy's small Liberal
Party, was arrested by Milan magistrates on corruption charges yesterday,
writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The arrest of Mr Bastianini, a 50-year-old lecturer at Turin's prestigous
Politecnico, was based on allegations of receiving L250m (Pounds 110,000) in
relation to a contract with Anas, the state roads authority. Anas contracts
now constitute the largest single area of investigation by magistrates
nationwide, and this week were responsible for raising to 65 the number of
parliamentarians currently under investigation for corruption-related
offences.
Meanwhile, Belgian justice officials have requested the assistance of their
Italian colleagues to resolve the mysterious assassination in July 1991 of
Mr Andre Cools, the Belgium Socialist deputy premier. The killing is now
believed to be related to a pay-off of L70bn on the L550bn contract to
supply 46 Augusta helicopters to the Belgian armed forces.
The Belgian authorities have interviewed in recent days Mr Giuseppe Cortese,
production manager at the time of Augusta, the helicopter manufacturer owned
by Efim, the Italian state holding company controlled by the Socialist Party
and now in liquidation. According to leaks from Milan magistrates, Mr
Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, is due to be questioned soon
about the helicopter sale by Belgian judicial authorities.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Clinton triumphs in House votes: Tougher battle ahead as
Senate verdict on budget and stimulus plans due next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton faced a tough battle for his economic programme in
the US Senate yesterday after winning a sweeping victory in the House of
Representatives.
'We are really trying to break the gridlock,' Mr Clinton said after winning
almost total party loyalty from his fellow Democrats in separate votes on a
short term Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11bn) stimulus programme and on a
longer-term budget plan aimed at cutting the federal deficit to Dollars
184bn in 1997.
But the two bills face more obstacles in the Senate, where some conservative
Democrats are reluctant to vote for the stimulus measures, and where
senators from oil states are equally reluctant to back a plan that depends
in large measure on a new energy tax.
The Senate is expected to vote on the budget and stimulus plans next week.
For the moment, however, President Clinton seems to have preserved important
momentum for his economic programme. Mr Clinton's reading of earlier
presidencies, including those of Mr Franklin Roosevelt and Mr Ronald Reagan,
has encouraged him to believe he has a fleeting opportunity to push a great
deal through Congress at the start of his term. Although 11 Democrats
deserted the president on the budget vote, and 22 on the stimulus vote, Mr
Clinton has succeeded in preserving much greater party loyalty than the last
Democratic president, Mr Jimmy Carter.
'I think it's the first of a number of victories,' said Congressman Richard
Gephardt, leader of the House Democrats.
Helping Mr Clinton along is the growing perception among members of Congress
that they had underestimated the extent to which their voters were prepared
to tolerate tax increases and cuts in favourite spending programmes if, in
return, a serious attempt were made to tackle the budget deficit.
Congress has, in fact, decided to outdo Mr Clinton in its zeal for deficit
reduction: the programme passed by the House will cut spending by Dollars
60bn more over five years than Mr Clinton's initial proposal, while the
version debated by the Senate yesterday also proposed additional spending
cuts.
Both House and Senate versions, however, preserve essential outlines of Mr
Clinton's scheme: increased revenues through higher income taxes for the
wealthy and a new energy tax, matched by deep cuts in defence spending,
federal subsidies and government management costs, and offset by raised
'investment' spending on the environment, education, health, technology and
infrastructure.
The House vote, however, is only the first, and arguably the easiest battle.
The budget resolution provides the general outlines of spending and
taxation: the details of spending cuts and tax rises may be harder to secure
when Congress addresses them this summer.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Moscow seeks active G7 backing for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S deputy premier for the economy and finance has proposed to the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries a seven-point plan that will
demand more resources and greater engagement in the Russian economy than
they have so far been prepared to agree.
In talks with the G7 'sherpas' (senior officials) in Hong Kong a week ago
and with western diplomats in Moscow since, Mr Boris Fyodorov has proposed a
package which, depending on how it is costed, would be worth between Dollars
10bn and Dollars 40bn-plus.
But Mr Fyodorov has stressed, according to western diplomats, that the money
is less important than a continuous and serious engagement in economic
reform, with major foreign states making sure Russia fulfils the conditions
on which money is advanced.
The main points of the package are:
A 'budgetary support' fund of around Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn, mainly
destined for creation of a social safety net - though western analysts also
say it may be used for other programmes, such as military conversion and
nuclear safety. This is the major new element in the package and the most
controversial. The west may find it hard to sell politically and is
reluctant to be seen forcing Russia to create a pool of unemployed which
they would then support.
A small business support programme, worth several hundred million dollars.
A Dollars 6bn fund to be used to stabilise the rouble. Such a provision is
already made in the current, much derided IMF-administered package of
Dollars 24bn but has not been used because the government has not been able
to create the conditions for rouble stabilisation.
Debt relief from the interest and principal due on the Dollars 80bn of
foreign debt which Russia has inherited from the former Soviet Union -
which, with arrears, runs at Dollars 40bn this year.
Access to western markets for Russian products from high-tech armaments to
low-grade steel.
Bilateral credits from various contries - though this is now seen as less
important and some ministers, including yesterday Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the
first deputy prime minister, are against accepting any further increases in
indebtedness.
Better co-ordination of the aid and a tougher conditions regime.
Mr Fyodorov, who greatly impressed the G7 sherpas in Hong Kong, has made a
point of not asking for assistance but co-operation.
The west believes that he, with Mr Shokhin and Mr Anatoly Chubais, the
deputy premier in charge of privatisation, are firmly in command of the
economic strategy.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Kinkel urges practical assistance for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KLAUS Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday called for a direct
programme of practical measures to support the Russian reform programme of
Mr Boris Yeltsin, and floated the idea of Russia being formally admitted to
the Group of Seven industrialised states.
Such membership would depend on Russia 'resolutely pursuing' its reform
programme, he said. But it was clear that in terms of 'human and material
resources' Russia fulfilled the necessary preconditions to join the club.
He also suggested that inviting Mr Yeltsin to attend the G7 summit in Tokyo
in July would demonstrate 'the unchanged political importance of the Russian
federation, and the world-wide reputation of its president.'
German officials are concerned that any programme of western assistance for
Russia, which could be drawn up by finance and foreign ministers meeting in
Japan on April 18, should do nothing to encourage Mr Yeltsin's opponents in
accusing him of being a 'lackey of the west.'
Such a programme should now be focused on direct practical assistance for
the population, including a significant element to improve living conditions
for officers in the Russian army, they believe.
They want other members of the G7 to contribute towards housing for the
military, for which Germany is already paying DM12bn (Pounds 5bn), to head
off any cause for military unrest.
They also suggest direct involvement in the Russian government's
privatisation programme, and aid to relieve desperate shortages of drugs in
hospitals, and food in old people's homes, as ways of bringing relevant
western assistance to the Russian people.
Mr Yeltsin has sought to reassure western leaders, including Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, that he has the support of the army in his constitutional
struggle for power with the Russian Congress of People's Deputies. There are
fears in Bonn, however, that regional commanders in areas such as Georgia
and Moldova are acting like 'independent warlords' over whom neither the
Russian president, nor his Moscow army commanders, have real control.
The German military housing programme is building 36,000 apartments for
officers returning from the occupying force in east Germany. However there
are no comparable programmes to help those coming back from Poland and
Hungary, the Baltic republics, or other former Soviet republics.
'We must show that co-operation is worthwhile, and that confrontation brings
nothing to Russia,' a senior German official said.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Election 93: Socialists face second
round knock-out - Conservative parties' pact expected to lead to huge
majority / The mechanic of the French election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW France starts a lengthy process which will give it a new government
on or around April Fools' Day. Opinion polls attest to the generally low
standing of politicians in France, but never have so many sought to join the
profession. A record number of 5,169 candidates are contesting the 555 seats
in mainland France and Corsica - an average of 9.3 candidates per seat
compared to 8.3 at the last parliamentary election in 1988. Representatives
from overseas departments and territories make up the 577 seats in the
National Assembly.
France's majority voting system provides for two rounds, though not all
constituency fights will go to a second round. The first round is tomorrow.
Candidates who win 50 per cent or more of the vote are elected. Most of
these early outright victors will be candidates of the Gaullist RPR and
centre-right UDF parties which are well ahead in opinion polls.
In fact, the RPR has already won a seat in French Polynesia which voted
earlier than metropolitan France because it needed more time between the two
rounds to tabulate results and convey election information across its south
Pacific islands.
If the first round produces no absolute majority in a constituency - which
will usually be the case - a second round takes place on March 28. Any
candidate winning more than 12.5 per cent of votes in the first round can
take part in the run-off. Victory goes to the candidate winning most votes.
Some candidates who have only just scraped through to the second round will
try to pass their support to other candidates with a better chance. For
instance, the Socialist party has said it will instruct its candidates to
stand down if they are beaten by Green candidates, to allow the Green a
better chance in the second round. The Socialists calculate they will only
rarely be overtaken by the Greens, but they hope their gesture will be
reciprocated by the environmentalists in the more frequent instances in
which Socialist candidates outdistance Green ones in the first round.
The only effective difference between France's two-round majority voting
system and Britain's single-round majority system is that French deputies
generally get elected with a higher share of the vote than their UK
counterparts. Both systems tend to accentuate electoral swings  - hence,
some projections predict that the RPR/UDF could get 80 per cent of seats on
40 per cent of the vote.
As in the UK, the French system also tends to squeeze out smaller parties.
Their best tactic is to field joint candidates, as the Verts and Generation
Ecologie (and, of course, the RPR/UDF) have done. The environmentalists'
problem is that their support is thinly spread, in contrast to the
Communists whose strength is maximised by being geographically concentrated.
In 1986 the elections were fought under a proportional representation (PR)
system, introduced by President Mitterrand and his Socialists to reduce the
swing to the right. But the Chirac government scrapped this for the 1988
elections, and returned to majority voting - just as 'fringe' parties were
on the rise. If the Greens poll well but gain no seats, there may be calls
for some return to PR, perhaps adding a national list of deputies elected by
PR to the 577 constituency deputies elected by majority vote.
If, when the final results are in on March 29, it is confirmed that the
RPR/UDF have won, then the Socialist prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
will immediately submit his resignation to President Mitterrand. The latter
will then consult leaders of the victorious conservatives to discover whom
they want as prime minister, and whom he feels he can accept. One idea,
mooted early in the campaign, was for the new RPR and UDF blocks of deputies
to present Mr Mitterrand with a fait accompli by designating their choice
for prime minister. But neither Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, nor Mr
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the UDF leader, will want to be bypassed.
The manoeuvring could take several days. There is one constraint. Under the
constitution, parliament has to start its summer session on April 2. It
would look bad if the 'class of 1993' were to take their seats in the
Palais-Bourbon, with the government bench empty. Yet, leaving nomination of
a new prime minister and government until the day before - April 1 - might
be the sort of joke that President Mitterrand would enjoy.

FT  20 MAR 93 / UN aid convoy finally reaches besieged Srebrenica: Personal
triumph for French commander
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UNITED NATIONS aid convoy, led by the charismatic French commander of UN
forces in Bosnia, was yesterday greeted by thousands of cheering and weeping
people as it finally reached the besieged town of Srebrenica in eastern
Bosnia.
The convoy of 16 trucks, carrying 175 tonnes of food and medical supplies,
had been repeatedly blocked by the Bosnian Serbs over the past nine days,
and was only the third to reach Srebrenica since Bosnia's civil war began
last April.
Its arrival in a town whose population had swollen to 60,000 people by the
inflow of refugees from the surrounding region and where 40 people were
reported to be dying every day, was a personal triumph for General Philippe
Morillon, the UN commander.
Gen Morillon, in the teeth of disapproval of his superiors in the UN, had
gone to Srebrenica last Thursday and declared that he would not leave the
town until aid for its desperate population arrived.
Serb authorities allowed the convoy into eastern Bosnia only after the
general, who had gone to the border to negotiate with the local Serb militia
commander, agreed to Serb demands that the convoy should travel without
military escort and leave behind two Belgian doctors and three UN military
observers.
The general also insisted to the local Serb leaders that he had the
authorisation of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia for the convoy to
proceed to Srebrenica.
Once in the town, Gen Morillon warned that, following a lightning offensive,
Srebrenica was close to capture by Bosnian Serb forces, who were only 2kms
away.
A UN official had earlier reported that Moslem positions and targets 4kms
away had been hit by a shell every second during a 15-minute period.
The convoy was due to spend the night in Srebrenica and evacuate the
hundreds of sick and wounded in the trucks that brought in supplies.
Conditions in the town were reported to be appalling by UN officials.
Diarrhoea was rampant as the result of contaminated water and food was so
scarce that fights broke out over supplies dropped by US aircraft.
The people, many without shelter and adequate clothing, wandered about the
streets in an 'indescribably filthy' condition and as many as 30 people
wounded by shellfire were treated every day in local clinics chronically
short of medical supplies, the official said.
Before the arrival of the convoy in Srebrenica, Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, had urged the US to provide heavy helicopters to
fly in supplies and evacuate wounded people from the town. She asked
Washington to double the amount of food it has been parachuting into the
stricken town.
Shortly afterwards, the US State Department announced it would double its
airdropped relief supplies in Bosnia to 60 tonnes a day.
In New York, meanwhile, the UN Security Council yesterday began
consultations on a resolution proposed by France, and backed by the US and
Britain, authorising immediate enforcement of the no-fly zone in Bosnia.
It is expected to be adopted next week.
The initiative was taken by France following the bombing a week ago of two
Moslem villages by Serbian aircraft in the first major violation of the ban
on military flights over Bosnia since it was imposed by the Council last
November.
The western move is also aimed at encouraging Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the
Moslem Bosnian president, to accept the plan by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen, the international mediators on the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,
to divide the country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.
Mr Izetbegovic on Thursday boycotted the talks in protest to the events in
eastern Bosnia, but returned to the negotiating table with the mediators
again today after the arrival of the convoy in Srebrenica.
The mediators are convinced that, if they manage to convince the Bosnian
president to sign their plan, it will become easier to pressure Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to do the same.

POLAND'S coalition government led by Ms Hanna Suchocka is to press ahead
with its mass privatisation plans despite the defeat by 12 votes in
parliament on Thursday of legislation underpinning the proposals, writes
Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The government's counter-offensive includes the resubmission of the
legislation in 'the near future' as well as the speedy implementation of
parts of the scheme which can be brought in under existing laws. 'We want to
move ahead fast with what will be in effect a policy of fait accompli,' said
a source close to Ms Suchocka.
The plan to try to salvage mass privatisation is to be finalised by the
cabinet today and announced on Monday.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Election 93: Industrial output in
France picks up slightly

<TEXT>
FRENCH industrial output rose slightly in January, showing an increase of
0.4 per cent against the previous month, according to the latest figures
from Insee, the state statistics institute.
The small rise suggests the economy may have stabilised, after a fall in
gross domestic product in the final quarter of 1992, the first decline since
the Gulf War.
A further fall in the current quarter would put France technically in
recession.
This means the ruling socialists, who are expected next weekend to be
replaced by the conservatives in the final round of the parliamentary
elections, may be able to leave office without taking France into recession.
January's industrial output was still 4.7 per cent lower than that of
January last year.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Schlesinger sceptical of Bonn deal on finances
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE solidarity pact agreed last weekend between the German government and
opposition parties was a helpful but less than ideal compromise, according
to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central
bank.
The deal had removed uncertainties from financial markets and would help
correct imbalances in the lop-sided mix of monetary and finance policies, he
said in Berlin yesterday.
It would reduce budget deficits to around 2 per cent of gross national
product by 1996, compared with more than 4 per cent this year, and 0.5 per
cent before unification.
But the reduction would be achieved mostly though increased taxes and
welfare contributions, he told the American Chamber of Commerce.
At the same time new public borrowing demands implied in the pact were only
'temporarily tolerable', he warned.
The Bundesbank repeatedly urged during the negotiations that deficits should
be controlled through spending cuts and not via the easy route of tax rises.
Mr Schlesinger chose his words carefully to avoid any danger of damaging the
hard-won political compromise - and charges of political interference - but
he did not try to conceal his scepticism.
All in all, it was to be hoped that the advantages of the budget
consolidation plan outweighed the possible disadvantageous effects of the
tax increases, he said. Local authority spending had to be reined in,
especially since firm spending cuts had not yet been identified.
Mr Schlesinger, who had been unable to make his feelings known before for
fear of disturbing markets in advance of the bank's council meeting on
Thursday, said the package was not the ideal way to encourage growth.
'Public sector demands on financial markets of the size proposed are
tolerable only temporarily if monetary policy is not to be over-burdened and
private productive investment is not to be hampered,' he said.
Postponement of the key element in the solidarity pact until 1995 was 'not
exactly ideal'. He was referring to the introduction of a 7.5 per cent
income tax surcharge which will take effect in January 1995.
He made plain that the deal had little influence on the decision on Thursday
to lower the official discount rate from 8 to 7.5 per cent. This had been
made on the basis of flattening money supply growth, moderate wage increases
and prospects of slackening inflation, he said.

FT  20 MAR 93 / GM told to return to Finland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, the US car maker, is to be forced to resume car production
in Finland, at least temporarily, as a result of a German court order won by
its former Finnish partner Valmet, the majority state-owned paper machinery
and engineering group.
The two companies are locked in a legal conflict following GM Europe's
transfer of Finnish production of its Opel/Vauxhall Calibra coupe from
Valmet's plant at Uusikaupunki to one of its main German plants at
Russelsheim, near Frankfurt.
The district court in Darm-stadt, Germany has issued an interim injunction
in favour of Valmet ordering GM to resume production in Finland.
GM said the court ruling involved only a preliminary order and was 'not a
final decision on the merits' of the case.
The US carmaker said it believed the order was 'wrong' and that it would
'appeal and pursue all available legal remedies to protect its legitimate
interests.'
Under the terms of the order GM would have to produce 30 per cent of its
Calibra output at the Valmet plant.
It said that under German law the order took 'immediate effect'. In order to
comply with the order it was 'studying the matter' and would advise Valmet
of its proposals to restart production in Finland.
Calibra sales were currently running at around 3,000 a month across Europe,
it said.
GM ceased all production of the Calibra in Finland in mid-December. It moved
the Finnish assembly to Germany to improve capacity utilisation at the
Russelsheim plant and to avoid the added cost penalties of production in
Finland.
Output of the Calibra began in Finland in March 1991 at a time when GM
needed extra capacity in western Europe with new car demand at a record
level, but sales have since begun to fall dramatically and GM is being
forced to take several measures to cut costs. The assembly agreement with
Valmet was not due to expire until the end of 1996.
GM halted the production in Finland in December after it failed to agree an
assembly fee per car with Valmet following several months of abortive
negotiations. GM claimed that it was suffering a DM5,000 (Pounds 2,118) per
car cost penalty for production in Finland versus production in Germany.
The loss-making Valmet group produced 34,556 Opel/Vauxhall cars in 1992 and
21,532 in 1991.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Virgin may sue BA as talks fail: Branson threatens to
produce fresh courtroom evidence of 'dirty tricks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIRGIN ATLANTIC abandoned talks aimed at settling the 'dirty tricks' dispute
with its larger rival British Airways yesterday, and threatened to produce
new evidence against it in UK or US courts.
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, also called for an independent
investigation into the dispute by the Department of Trade and Industry. He
said an official request would be made next week. The DTI can investigate
companies and take civil action against them.
Weeks of tense and often sour negotiations almost led to a settlement at one
stage. The draft agreement would have seen BA pay Pounds 9m compensation to
Virgin. The talks foundered on a clause limiting discussion of the case.
Virgin said the clause would 'gag' it, 'restricting (its) ability to refer
to the case in any further actions or to provide information to anyone else
in a similar dispute'. Mr Branson said: 'We should have the right to refer
to matters of historical record.'
BA denied it 'sought to 'gag' Virgin'. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing
director, said: 'We have simply asked them to agree not to rake over the
events of the past. The fundamental point on which we cannot agree with
Virgin is their requirement to be able to reopen past events.'
The talks were set up after BA publicly apologised to Virgin in January and
paid it Pounds 610,000 in libel damages following revelations that BA had
been engaged in covert operations to undermine Virgin's business.
Last week, Virgin said it was ready to settle if BA dropped the clause
forbidding it from referring to the matter in future.
But yesterday's Virgin statement said: 'British Airways have sought from
Virgin onerous and impractical undertakings including silence over matters
of historical record.' It accused BA of 'consistently refusing to
acknowledge the full nature of the extent of the activities which have taken
place over the past three years'.
The company yesterday ins-tructed its UK lawyers to consider 'all the
remedies available' including civil cases in the UK under misuse of
computers legislation, in the US courts under anti-trust rules, and in
Brussels under the Treaty of Rome.
'There's a great deal of material in our possession (that has not yet been
made public),' warned Mr Branson. He said court orders could force BA to
release yet further evidence of 'dirty tricks'.
Virgin said it had been advised that it could recover tens of millions of
pounds of compensation in an anti-trust action in the US. Such laws in the
US are complicated and action could take years with no guarantee of success.
The UK government is likely to be unhappy if the case goes to the US courts.
It has put pressure on the two companies not to go to court because adverse
publicity might hurt its position in sensitive talks with the US government
over aviation deregulation.
Mr John Prescott, opposition transport spokesman, called on Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, to intervene. 'There could be considerable
implications for British aviation policy if this matter is now pursued in
the American courts as Richard Branson intends,' Mr Prescott said in a
letter to Mr MacGregor.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Franc under strong pressure on eve of French election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc continued to come under strong selling pressure inside the
European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, as investors speculated that a
new political administration in France might be forced to sever the link
with the D-Mark.
In the run-up to tomorrow's first round of parliamentary elections, the
franc remained close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark. French franc money
market interest rates rose, amid signs that some international investment
houses were borrowing francs and selling them in the hope of profiting from
a possible devaluation.
Mr Edouard Balladur, a finance minister in the last conservative government
who is tipped as the next French prime minister, yesterday sought to
alleviate the pressure on the French currency.
Damping speculation that a conservative government might abandon the
socialist policy of protecting the franc inside the ERM, he said on radio
that the French right had no intention of following the UK's example of
leaving the mechanism. 'It's not a model for me,' he said, describing the
consequences for the UK economy as 'almost tragic'.
Some foreign exchange dealers, however, believe that a new French
administration might abandon the Socialist franc fort policy because it has
meant keeping interest rates at about 12 per cent at a time when the French
economy is slowing down.
Tomorrow's poll marks the first round of voting in the parliamentary
elections, with the final round scheduled for next Sunday. The conservative
coalition of the RPR and UDF has such a strong lead - with 42 per cent of
the vote against the ruling Socialists' 20.5 per cent, according to final
opinion polls - that a change of government appears inevitable.
The critical question is how the conservative vote will split between the
RPR and UDF. The polls suggest the two centre-right parties are neck and
neck. However, the final outcome could influence the allocation of cabinet
seats and President Francois Mitterrand's choice of premier.
Even in its final days the French electoral campaign has been notable only
for the absence of excitement. The inevitability of the conservative victory
has contributed to the subdued mood, as has the familiarity of the main
party leaders, such as the RPR's Mr Jacques Chirac and the UDF's Mr Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, and the similarity between the main parties on critical
areas of policy.
The franc fell as low as FFr3.416 against the D-Mark at lunchtime in London,
with some London-based dealers reporting that the currency was being sold in
large amounts. There was no sign of foreign exchange intervention by either
the Bank of France or the Bundesbank.
The franc later closed unchanged on the day at FFr3.41 against the D-Mark,
around 2 centimes above its ERM floor, and was at FFr3.4105 in late New York
trading.

FT  20 MAR 93 / NatWest to charge daily for overdrawn accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to impose a charge of Pounds 3.50 a day on
current account holders who overdraw substantially without authority. The
bank's new charging structure will penalise up to 1m customers who overdraw
regularly.
The bank, which has 6.5m personal customers, said yesterday the new monthly
charging structure would benefit about 1m customers who only overdraw
occasionally. It is to abolish its Pounds 20 fee for warning letters telling
customers they are overdrawn.
There has been considerable speculation that NatWest would become the first
bank to introduce charges for customers who stay in credit. The new charges
indicate that it has instead chosen to penalise its most unprofitable
customers.
NatWest is the first of England's big four banks to introduce a daily
overdraft fee. Most banks already charge on a monthly rather than quarterly
basis and impose fees for sending warning letters and returning cheques.
Under NatWest's new structure, to be introduced from June 1, the most
persistent overdrawn customers will suffer substantially. They face charges
of up to Pounds 355 a quarter if they stay constantly more than Pounds 50
over their agreed overdraft limit.
The fall in base rates since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism in
October has made more current accounts unprofitable for banks because they
can no longer earn as much from interest on re-lending their deposits.
Mr David Powell, NatWest's director of personal financial services, said the
new structure would remove some of the existing 'cross-subsidies' under
which customers who regularly enter overdraft are charged less than they
cost the bank.
Mr Powell said that 60 per cent of customers would not be affected by the
change because they remain in credit. He said customers who regularly
overdraw typically cost the bank up to five times as much per account than
others and it was fair that they paid more.
He said the bank expected to neither gain nor lose under the new structure,
although it hoped it would eventually save money by persuading customers to
change their behaviour.
NatWest is also removing the system of waiving fees for customers who go
into overdraft provided that their average cleared balance during a quarter
is above Pounds 500.
Customers in overdraft will be charged Pounds 9 a month, and a Pounds 3.50
daily fee if they have an overdraft more than Pounds 50 in excess of agreed
limits. They will not be charged for warning letters.
NatWest produced figures to show that a customer with a Pounds 500
unauthorised overdraft for a quarter, who gets one warning letter and one
returned cheque, will be Pounds 182 better off a year under the new
structure.

Archaeological excavations at Canterbury Cathedral show that there was a
huge cathedral on the site in Anglo-Saxon times - confirming that the
Anglo-Saxons were builders of great churches, contrary to the prevailing

FT  19 MAR 93 / Union officials lose legal support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEEU engineering and electrical union has withdrawn legal representation
from three of its own officials at Timex.
They are due to appear in the Court of Session in Edinburgh today in a
further escalation of the bitter four-week-old strike at the company's
Dundee plant.
Senior counsel have warned the AEEU it could face massive financial damages
in the court because of an alleged conflict of interest.
The three union officials are alleged by Timex to have breached an interdict
 -an injunction - limiting picketing outside the plant.
They are Mr John Kydd Jnr, former convener at the plant, his deputy Mr
Willie Chrisstie and his father Mr John Kydd Snr, who is union divisional
secretary. Their costs will be met from legal aid.
The union is appealing against the original interdict and this comes before
the court next week.
Today Timex wants the court to prevent the union and four named officials,
including the three facing breach of interdict charges, from holding
meetings, demonstrations and gatherings within 50 yards of the plant between
7am and 9am and from 4pm to 6pm.
The dispute started when the US multinational dismissed its entire workforce
last month after they agreed to return to work from a strike 'under
protest'.
The company has been hiring an entirely new set of workers to take over
their work. It has also resorted to the courts for support in what promises
to become a legalistic wrangle.
'The dispute is over as far as the company is concerned,' said Mr Peter
Hall, Timex's managing director in Dundee.
An estimated 190 newly recruited workers are being bussed into the company
every morning past large crowds of angry and former employees and their
supporters.
A spokesman added that production is at 'levels that satisfy customers
needs'. The plant is moving from a single shift to a second shift next week.
However, the AEEU continues to give official recognition to the dispute and
is paying strike pay to its members involved at Timex. The union is
increasingly concerned at the way in which the Timex dispute has worsened in
the past few weeks. Last week Timex failed to secure an interdict against
all its 320 former employees from taking part in the picketing.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Arts: Moved by the Greek miracle - Patricia Morison admires
the exhibition currently in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forty years ago, ER Dodds began his wonderful book, The Greeks and the
Irrational with an encounter in front of the Elgin marbles. A young man
accosted him and said, 'I know it's an awful thing to confess, but this
Greek stuff doesn't move me one bit . . . It's all so terribly rational, if
you know what I mean.'
These days, people are quite unembarrassed about admitting that Dead White
Marbles leave them cold. On the one hand, mass tourism allows millions of
people to experience Greek art in its homeland. A frenzy of excitement
greeted the 1972 discovery of the Riace bronzes, fished from the sea off
Italy. On the other hand, without a beach close at hand, many people find
Greek art less appetising.
The Greeks have lost their supremacy. Seemingly timeless masterpieces such
as the Apollo Belvedere and Venus de Milo are now widely known to be copies
made some four centuries later than the lost originals. Tutenkamen's magic
appeals far more widely than the sculpture which enraptured Winckelmann and
his followers.
Into this complicated picture, there comes an extraordinary exhibition. The
Greek Miracle. Classical Sculpture from the Dawn of Democracy. The Fifth
Century BC, has brought together some 40 sculptures, none of them Roman
copies. First seen in Washington, the show has now moved to New York, to the
naturally lit spaces of the Metropolitan Museum's Robert Lehmann Wing.
The Greeks have lent 22 objects, of which 20 have never been seen outside
Greece. Among them are works shown in every textbook on the origins of
western art. Here you will find the 'Kritios Boy', the tombstone of the
daughter of Hegeso, 'Hercules carrying the Heavens' from the Temple of Zeus
at Olympia. Young Athenian nobles gallop on a severely eroded fragment of
the Parthenon frieze. From the Temple of Victory on the Acropolis there
survives the exquisitely graceful relief of the winged goddess of victory
loosening her sandal.
Other museums have contributed pieces such as the beautiful Chatsworth
Apollo from the British Museum. A life-size marble statue of Theseus,
crouching in combat against an Amazonian, was dug up only 60 years ago in
Rome, where it was probably taken as loot by Emperor Augustus. He is
frequently not on view in the Capitoline Museum; this show represents a
chance not only to contemplate him, but to escape the baking misery of
queues for Greek museums in the tourist season.
In New York, the show has been enriched by more objects from the Met and
lent by private owners. One such is a magnificent water-jar presented to the
goddess Hera in gratitude for victory in the games. Greek theatre and Greek
cultural expansion are evoked by a silver stag's head drinking-cup, one of
the famous rhytons from the Black Sea region. The figures around its rim
have been explained as a scene from the play Philoktetes.
Memorable above all is the Met's particular coup de theatre. The first
exhibit is a pink, life-size statue of a youth, a kouros of around 600 BC,
from the Met's collection. Its rigid frontality, the scrolling lines of its
stylised muscles, are the work of an artist still trained in the Egyptian
way of representing the human form. One foot is extended, but there is no
illusion of movement.
Behind there stands another kouros, one of a dozen found at the Temple of
Apollo on Mount Pton. It was made only 80 years later and yet a great change
has taken place. He is softer and suppler, the muscles seeming to swell
beneath the skin. His face, however, is still Oriental, flat-cheeked and
framed in stiff loops of curls.
Next in this revelatory line-up comes the 'Kritios Boy' of about 480BC,
found on the Acropolis. If he does indeed represent the divine Theseus, then
it is not hard to imagine Athenians worshipping such an uncannily beautiful
image. The show tries to remind us that Greek sculptures were once brightly
painted and inlaid, with gleaming weapons, jewellery, and locks of bronze
hair. The 'Kritios Boy' would have had 'real' eyes, like the little bronze
head which shares the inset eyes, eyelashes, and lips of the famous
Charioteer of Delphi.
The 'Kritios Boy' really does appear about to walk. His spine is curved and
one beautiful buttock droops in the contrapposto pose which Greek art
bequeathed to artists of the Renaissance. Here, then, is the Greek miracle,
that in one century of experimentation, craftsmen had learned to fashion
images of such dazzling naturalism.
But, perhaps unwisely, the phrase 'Greek Miracle' does not stand alone in
the show's title. It is hitched to the 2,500th anniversary of the birth of
democracy in Athens, ushered in by the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508BC.
President Mitsotakis writes, 'Although we take (democracy) for granted in
our time . . . only in ancient Athens and in the United States has democracy
lasted as long as two centuries on a continuing basis.' He overlooks, as
many people do, the oligarchic interludes. However, the point is that this
show marks a warm point in US-Greek relations.
There may never have been such an ambitious cultural exchange. At the
National Gallery in Athens, the Greeks are able to feast their eyes on From
El Greco to Cezanne. The 72 masterpieces from the Met and the National
Gallery in Washington include paintings by Veronese, Caravaggio, Vermeer,
Goya, Rubens, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Manet, Gauguin and Degas.
The problem with talk about democracy is that it sends up a flurry of
familiar questions. What exactly had the art of Greece's Golden Age to do
with democracy? Would such a massive production of cast bronzes and polished
marbles have been possible without slave labour? Athenian democracy excluded
not just slaves but women, too. Moreover, Pericles could never have boasted
about the glory of Athenian art without imperial wealth raked in by a
ruthless foreign policy.
An article in The New York Review of Books took a scornful view of what it
called the historical naivete underlying this show. As far as the
unimpressive catalogue is concerned, this is justified. The introduction by
Nicolas Gage (author of tear-jerking best-seller Eleni), is positively
comic. Victorian sentiment meets New Age-ism in gush about Attica's austere
landscape where 'men reached a level of excellence that has remained an
inspiration for mankind, the mind and spirit in equilibrium as never before
or since.'
But these objects are presented first and foremost as an aesthetic
experience, an alluring vision of a Golden Age which produced art of the
utmost refinement, strength and grace. We respond to images which seem to
speak of a people who valued friendship, family and horses. Sons greet their
fathers in the afterlife with a gentlemanly handclasp. The gravestone of a
little girl kissing her pet turtle-dove speaks as winningly now as two
centuries ago when it was unearthed and taken for an English nobleman's
collection. Ktesilaos and Theano gaze at each other with unfathomable
gestures, although the temptation is to read it as an image of devoted
married love.
Meanwhile, scholars continue to wrangle over what exactly was the nature of
Greek pederasty. Is it an accident that there is not a single erect image
either on view or in the catalogue, nor even a reference to the Greeks'
uniquely tolerant attitude towards homosexuality? Perhaps this has something
to do with the seal of official approval. What we now enjoy in the cool
daylight of New York, is an unforgettable presentation of those eminently
rational, miraculously talented Greeks.
The Greek Miracle continues until May 23. From El Greco to Cezanne, at the
National Gallery in Athens until April 11. Sponsor of both exhibitions is

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clark poised for decision on trio of bid
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of C&amp;J Clark, Britain's second largest shoe manufacturer, is
expected to meet on Monday to decide which of the three bids for the company
it will recommend to shareholders, writes Peggy Hollinger.
It is likely that the debate will be heated, with several board members
expected to object to a proposal to offer the chosen bidder exclusive rights
to due diligence for a certain period. This could, in effect, deter a bid
from an outside party.
The company and its advisers, Schroders, are considering offers from shoe
manufacturer FII, a consortium of existing shareholders backed by Electra
Investment Trust, and an informal approach from Berisford, the foods and
property group.
It is believed that Berisford has set certain conditions for making a formal
offer including exclusive rights to pursue due diligence and the board's
approval.
If it goes ahead, the offer would be an all-share deal with some members of
the Clark board likely to be invited onto Berisford's executive.
Berisford is believed to be interested in the brand opportunities offered by
Clark's shoes.
The consortium of existing institutional investors, backed by Electra
Investment Trust, is believed to be offering about 200p a share, valuing
Clark at Pounds 154m. The consortium hopes to buy out the family's 70 per
cent holding, but would back the existing management.
Meanwhile, FII is believed to have made an offer of shares or cash, valuing
Clark at Pounds 140m.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Costain peace pact with Peabody
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the UK construction company, yesterday made peace with Peabody
Resources, part of Britain's Hanson conglomerate, and agreed to sell its
Australian coal-mining assets to Peabody for Dollars 200m plus a net asset
adjustment.
The additional asset adjustment is subject to a final audit, but is
estimated to add around Dollars 34m to the purchase price at current
exchange rates. Peabody will also assume around Dollars 65m-worth of
borrowings at the Australian coal operations.
The deal between Costain and Peabody comes at the end of a long and stormy
legal battle in the Missouri courts. The transaction is now expected to be
completed 'shortly' and Peabody and Costain will dismiss their respective
lawsuits against each other. They will also drop claims and counter-claims
for damages and costs.
The lawsuits arose after Costain walked away from its original deal to sell
the Australian coal assets to Peabody for Dollars 200m. Instead, the British
construction group announced that it would sell the business to Altus
Finance for Dollars 245m. Both Altus and Peabody would have assumed ADollars
120m of debt.
Peabody sued, claiming that it had exclusive negotiating rights with Costain
over the assets and, in February, a US judge granted a permanent injunction
preventing Costain from selling the operations to the French buyer. At that
point, Peabody said that it hoped to proceed with the purchase, and talks
with Costain restarted.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Navy to complete overdue repairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL NAVY is to take responsibility for finishing work on an armed
support ship constructed by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.
The move to take the ship, Fort Victoria, out of the contractor's hands
follows a series of problems and delays - the ship is 2 1/2 years overdue.
Defence officials said yesterday that six months of the delay were not
attributable to the contractor but to changes in navy requirements.
In an attempt to resolve the remaining technical difficulties, Harland sent
the ship to the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. The yard is a
subsidiary of VSEL, the Cumbria-based shipyard group. But the navy will now
try to rectify the defects at its own Fleet Maintenance and Repair
Organisation in Portsmouth.
The Ministry of Defence said that Harland had 'completed the vessel to a
standard that we are willing to accept'.
The ship, designed to supply stores and fuel, was ordered in April 1986, at
an inflation-adjustable price of Pounds 127m. No details were available on
the financial settlement reached with Harland over the defect rectification
work.
A sister vessel, Fort George, was ordered from Swan Hunter shipyard on
Tyneside in December 1987 and is virtually complete.

FT  19 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Broker boost to properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY shares were sent surging forward yesterday as one leading agency
broker issued a major buy note on the sector, producing the highest turnover
in Land Securities, the UK's biggest property group, for nearly four years.
James Capel's decision to turn positive on the sector came as a result of
Tuesday's Budget, where changes to advance corporation tax meant that
property stocks were yielding an all-time high against the equity market for
gross funds. Capel's Mr Alan Carter said: 'Even though the sector has shown
some gains of late, we believe there is further recovery to come.'
The broker's recommendations sent the shares of all the leading stocks
sharply forward. Land Securities advanced 11 to 517p in very heavy turnover
of 8.5m, while British Land gained 12 at 275p, Brixton Estates 7 at 197p,
Great Portland Estates 7 at 169p, Greycoat 3 1/2 at 19p and MEPC 13 at 418p.
The only stock Capel was not recommending was Hammerson, where the broker
believes the recent bid spec-ulation has taken the shares too high.
Yesterday the 'A' shares closed a penny firmer at 376p and the ordinary 8
ahead at 416p.
Second line property issues rode on the coat tails of the leaders' rise.
Frogmore Estates appreciated 7 to 398p, Helical Bar 6 to 152p, Speyhawk 2 to
14 1/2 p and Chesterfield Properties 28 to 253p.
However, other property analysts expressed a more cautious view. Mr Graham
Stanley at NatWest Securities said a blanket rerating of the sector was
untimely and that pension and gross fund investors, although underweight,
would be selective in their investments.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cheung Kong 28% ahead - Hong
Kong Results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEUNG KONG, Mr Li Ka-shing's flagship Hong Kong group, yesterday reported a
28 per cent rise in net earnings to HKDollars 6.2bn (USDollars 800m) for
1992 from HKDollars 4.88bn in 1991.
The result, which was within the market's forecast range, was achieved on
virtually static growth in turnover to HKDollars 10.3bn from HKDollars
9.9bn.
Underlining what an exceptional year 1992 was for property development
companies in Hong Kong, Cheung Kong's operating profits - at HKDollars 3.4bn
 -were three times those earned in 1991.
The directors declared a final dividend of 60 cents a share making 80 cents
for the year - a rise over 1991 of 18 per cent.
Mr Li expects economic conditions in Hong Kong and China to provide the
basis for the improved performance of Cheung Kong in 1993.
The group signed five joint venture deals with mainland parties to develop
property in China last year, principally in Shanghai, Guangdong and Hainan.
Mr Li said the economic reforms the Chinese government was pursuing were
encouraging.
The property market in Hong Kong stabilised in 1992, but with the overall
economy remaining robust he expected the market for small to medium-sized
flats - the market which Cheung Kong dominates - to improve towards the end
of the year.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cookson raising Pounds 45m via assets sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOKSON GROUP, the industrial materials company which launched a Pounds 186m
1-for-4 rights issue earlier this month, is raising another Pounds 45m
through the sale of a number of non-core businesses.
The move is part of the management's strategy of selective disposals to
refocus the group on four product divisions: electronic material, ceramics,
engineered products and plastics.
Cookson has sold the business, and some manufacturing assets, of its
Industrial Precision Castings subsidiary to Charles Baynes.
Minneapolis-based Spectrum Colours, which produces colour concentrates for
plastics manufacturers, is being sold to Sandoz Chemicals.
Agreement has also been reached on the sale of Cookson's 80 per cent stake
in IST Laboratories, an engineering design house founded in 1987 which
develops specialist integrated circuits.
Finally, the group is selling its US speciality plastics compounding
businesses, Monmouth Plastics and Texapol to MA Hanna.
The businesses being sold had turnover of about Pounds 23m in 1992. After
exceptional items, Monmouth, Texapol and Spectrum had combined operating
profits of Pounds 2.3m last year, while IPC and IST incurred operating
losses after exceptional items of about Pounds 4.1m.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Charles Baynes' Pounds 10m purchase as
profits rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARLES Baynes, the specialist engineering and packaging distribution
company, yesterday announced two acquisitions totalling nearly Pounds 10m
and a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.47m to Pounds 5.56m.
The directors said that a one third drop in operating profits under new
accounting rules was a better guide to performance in 1992 than pre-tax
profits up by a quarter.
The group has adopted FRS 3 and has restated its 1991 figures accordingly.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 4.13m (Pounds 6.05m).
It will pay a final dividend of 0.9p (0.85p) bringing the total to 1.43p
(1.35p) out of earnings per share of 2.8p (3.91p).
The company bought Thomson Valves, from Rolls-Royce, for Pounds 7.9m and
Industrial Precision Castings, from Cookson Group, for Pounds 1.9m.
The acquisitions were partly funded by a 12.5m share placing with
institutions, which raised Pounds 6.8m net of expenses. The number of shares
in issue increased by 10 per cent.

CREDIT Commercial de France (CCF), the French banking group, saw net profits
rise by 7.6 per cent to FFr978m (Dollars 173m) last year from FFr909m in
1991, in spite of the strains on the banking market.
The French banks have in the past year come under intense pressure because
of the impact of the slowdown, which has depressed demand for credit from
consumers and industry, and the fall in value on their investments in
property and industry.
Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman, said CCF, which earlier this year joined
forces with BHF Bank of Germany to take a significant stake in Charterhouse,
the London-based merchant bank, had been affected by the pressures on the
banking market. However, he said, it managed to maintain growth because of
cost cutting, productivity gains and prudent provisioning.
The group saw net banking income rise by 3.1 per cent, just above the French
inflation rate, to FFr7.86bn from FFr7.62bn in 1991. Cost-cutting measures
produced a slight fall in operating costs to FFr5.15bn from FFr5.19bn over
the same period and gross operating profits rose to FFr2.33bn from
FFr2.06bn.
CCF also managed to restrain provisions at a manageable level, mainly
because it is less exposed than other banking groups to the most vulnerable
areas of the economy, notably commercial property and small businesses.
The level of provisions rose to FFr1.26bn from FFr1.15bn.

BMW, the current star of the German motor industry, has replaced its
retiring chairman with the youngest member of the board.
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, 45, currently responsible for production, will take
control at the luxury car group's annual meeting on May 13.
At the same time, Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, 64, the outgoing chairman, will
propose an unchanged dividend of DM12.50 on ordinary stock and DM13.50 for
preference shares.
Bolstered mainly by the launch of the new 3-Series, and outselling rival
Mercedes-Benz for the first time, BMW managed to ride through the worst of
the downturn which cut Volkswagen's earnings by 87 per cent last year.
Even so, net group profits shrank to DM726m (Dollars 436m) compared with
DM783m, on sales up almost 5 per cent to DM31.2bn.
The figures reflect the sharp downturn in the domestic market which hit all
German automotive groups in the second half of the year. At the halfway mark
BMW's earnings were up 10.5 per cent and turnover had risen 12 per cent.
Mr von Kuenheim said in January that unit sales would fall during 1993.
The appointment of a young engineer to the top post reflects both BMW's
self-confidence in the face of recession and a noticeable trend across the
industry towards handing power to the younger generation.
Mr Pischetsrieder's place on the board will be filled by Mr Joachim Milberg,
49, an engineering academic whose industrial experience includes a spell at
Gildemeister, the machine tool manufacturer.
Mr von Kuenheim is expected to take over as chairman of the group's
supervisory board.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Ciga rescue package threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CIGA, the Italian hotels group controlled by the Aga Khan, has agreed to
suspend any independent action to resolve its severe financial difficulties
pending a study by Mediobanca on how to reduce its debts.
The decision, which followed a formal request from Ciga's creditor banks,
makes virtually certain the collapse of the rescue package worked out by the
company last December. Ciga then agreed to sell the majority of its Italian
hotel-owning subsidiary to Situr, a fast-expanding private property and
leisure group, for L301bn (Dollars 187m). The deal, which was subject to
approval from Ciga's creditor banks, received a very cool response from the
bankers. Separately, Situr, which recently made unspecified claims of
irregularities in Ciga's accounts, threatened to pull out if agreement were
not reached by the end of this month.
Mediobanca is to study alternative plans for Ciga to reduce its debts, which
amount to about L1,000bn, on behalf of the creditor banks. While that is
under way, the company has agreed not to take any decisions other than those
concerning its everyday activities.
Preliminary results showed Ciga's group turnover rose by 10 per cent to
L510bn last year, while the number of guests staying increased 8.9 per cent
to 1.34m. Publications of figures for group earnings is likely to be delayed
for some time, possibly until June. In 1991, group losses almost tripled to
L98.9bn.
The company firmly rejected the accusations of irregularities in its
accounts made by Mr Luigi Clementi, Situr's managing director, and accused
Situr of breaking the agreement on silence which the two sides had
undertaken during the negotiations. Ciga said 'such false insinuations will
be firmly refuted'.

<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, yesterday refused to be
drawn into the controversy generated by remarks from a board director of the
Deutsche Bank.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, director of the Deutsche Bank responsible for corporate
finance, on Wednesday said both groups wanted to see Deutsche's stake in
Daimler reduced from the current level of 28 per cent.
Daimler said yesterday that Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive, had held
discussions with Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive and his
predecessor, Mr Alfred Herr-hausen, over the level of the holding. But
Daimler insisted that there were no talks on the issue and no plans for the
stake to be cut.
Mr Schmitz told investors on Wednesday that 'there are those in the bank who
may feel sorry not to have got out (of Daimler-Benz shares) when the price
was better'.
He said: 'There is a consensus within the bank and Daimler Benz that it is
in the interests of both entities that the stake does not remain at 28 per
cent for too long.'
Although Mr Schmitz said there were no immediate plans to cut the stake, the
report of his comments triggered a fall in Daimler's share price by DM8.10
to DM606.20. It recovered after Deutsche Bank put out a statement repeating
that there was no intention to sell the stake and Mr Schmitz's remarks had
been misinterpreted, closing at DM613.50.
Mr Schmitz's comments came at a sensitive time as Daimler is in the throes
of a major restructuring involving significant job losses and a
reorientation of the core automobile business at Mercedes Benz.
Profits for 1992 are likely to fall by almost a quarter to DM1.5bn. Deutsche
Bank has had the Daimler stake for over 60 years.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: SCA cushioned by hygiene side
contribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCA, Sweden's second largest pulp and paper group, yesterday announced a
SKr451m (Dollars 58m) profit after financial items for 1992.
A strong performance from its Molnlycke hygiene division helped to cushion
'extremely unfavourable' conditions for traditional forest industry
products.
The result was 63 per cent down on 1991's SKr1.22bn profit but it stood in
sharp contrast to the company's two leading domestic competitors, Stora and
MoDo, both of which have disclosed deep losses for 1992. SCA is holding its
dividend at SKr3.20 per share.
SCA said it expected 1993 profits after financial items to rise to
SKr1bn-SKr1.5bn, even though conditions remain very difficult and falling
prices have eroded much of the benefit from the devaluation of the Swedish
krona. Sales fell to SKr32.1bn from SKr32.7bn. reflecting price and volume
pressures resulting from industry overcapacity.
SCA benefits from having a more diversified range of products than other
Swedish forestry groups and Molnlycke, in particular, has proved a recession
strength. It boosted operating profits by 24 per cent to SKr901m as sales
rose to SKr12.5bn from SKr11.6bn.
The group's packaging business was hit by lower prices and volumes, with
operating profits falling to SKr462m from SKr607m on a 5.5 per cent drop in
sales to SKr8.98bn. Graphic paper plunged to a SKr313m loss from a SKr186m
profit, on sales down to SKr5.07bn from SKr5.39bn. Forest and timber
activities saw operating profits fall 20 per cent to SKr375m, as sales
declined to SKr3.52bn from SKr3.69bn.
Restructuring had a positive impact, with annual costs now SKr2bn lower than
in 1990. Staff numbers fell 4,200 to 26,600 during the year as part of an
overall plan to cut 6,500 jobs between 1990 and 1994.
Net earnings after tax rose from SKr901m to SKr6.2bn, after taking in
SKr5.86bn in extraordinary gains, mainly related to the sale of the group's
energy business. The disposal has cut group debt from SKr17.6bn to
SKr10.8bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KREDIETBANK, Belgium's third-largest bank, has boosted consolidated net
profits by 14.3 per cent for the nine months to the end of December 1992.
The growth in earnings was bolstered by a 41 per cent increase in money
market activity, notably currency swaps and options.
A net dividend of BFr185 for ordinary shares and BFr233.58 for the AFV
special shares is to be considered at a general meeting on April 29, as
compared with BFr183 and BFr231.45 respectively in 1991-1992.
The bank's financial year was shortened to nine months in line with the move
to achieve a single balance sheet for the Almanij-Kredietbank group, and was
marked by a weak economy at home and abroad.
On an annualised basis, consolidated net profits of BFr7.3bn (Dollars 214m)
would rise to BFr8.5bn, an increase of 14.3 per cent. Earnings per share
amounted to BFr515 (BFr525) over the nine months.
In spite of narrower margins, brought about by the inverted interest rate
structure and fierce competition, Kredietbank group increased its gross
income by 7.7 per cent and lifted its return on shareholders' capital to
12.3 per cent.
Costs rose 5.1 per cent, while depreciation and write-downs amounted to
BFr11.8bn. The bank described the provision as a modest 4.4 per cent rise,
but said it had made a 'substantial' allocation to internal reserves to
cover latent risks.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Hong Kong dispute may hit trade with UK, China warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S economic ties with China would 'inevitably be affected' if the row
over Hong Kong persists, a senior Chinese official said yesterday.
Mr Li Lanqing, minister of foreign economic relations and trade, accused Mr
Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, of undermining the smooth transfer to
Chinese rule by persisting with his plans for democratic reforms.
Asked whether the dispute would affect commercial relations, Mr Li replied:
'I believe that if the governor sticks to his present manner of doing
things, economic and trade relations will inevitably be affected.'
China has a long history of retaliating economically against countries which
displease it politically. The most recent example was the freeze Beijing
placed on business with France last year after the French announced they
were selling advanced Mirage fighter-bombers to Taiwan.
According to the UK Department of Trade and Industry, Sino-British trade was
worth Pounds 1.38bn (Dollars 1.95bn) last year, with the balance
increasingly heavily in Beijing's favour. Chinese exports to the UK amounted
to Pounds 954m, up 35 per cent on the previous year.
Mr Patten warned in response that Beijing might damage its own economic
interests if it allowed the row over his political reform package to affect
Sino-British trade and economic ties. He said that if China were to link
Hong Kong's political development to its economic relationship with Britain
'it would have all sorts of consequences elsewhere and in other areas".
China is keen to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and wants
its most favoured nation trading status renewed in the US. Mr Patten hopes
to meet US president Bill Clinton in April or May and press for
unconditional renewal of China's MFN status. Britain has been a supporter of
China's entry into the Gatt.
Mr Patten said: 'We have been arguing very strongly against trade to be
politicised. It's why I'll be arguing for free trade rather than for
allowing political considerations to interrupt trade when I travel to the
US.'
In Beijing, British officials noted that Mr Li had been merely responding to
questions at a press conference. But there seems little question that
commercial ties would be affected if the atmosphere between Beijing and
London continues to be soured by the Hong Kong issue.
The impasse over Hong Kong has already set back a HKDollars 175bn airport
project and a HKDollars 10bn container terminal.
China has been enraged by Mr Patten's plans to broaden the scope for
democratic elections to Hong Kong's Legislative Council. Beijing has accused
the governor of ignoring past agreements on Hong Kong's transition to the
Chinese rule by 1997.
In London Mr John Major, the prime minister, told parliament: "The
government stands four square behind the governor and behind the government
of Hong Kong,' adding: "The governor has acted sensitively, resolutely and
correctly and we shall continue to make that clear to the Chinese
government.'
Mr Li said that while China wanted 'co-operation' and not 'confrontation' on
the Hong Kong issue, it would 'never barter away principles'.
In Beijing the People's Liberation Army joined attacks on Mr Patten at a
session of the National People's Congress.

Anarchy, greed and the lust for power were behind a bloody war between taxi
operators in rural South Africa, a judicial inquiry said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Johannesburg.
A report by the Goldstone commission into the taxi war in Groblersdal, in
the eastern Transvaal, said one of the root causes was lawlessness and 'a
culture of taking the law into one's own hands'.
The report gave no figures for casualties in the taxi war which erupted in
1991, but said there was 'serious loss of life, injury and damage'.
The inquiry into taxi wars is part of a broader attempt by Judge Richard
Goldstone to define and defuse the roots of South Africa's political
violence.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UN attacks Serbs on aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Sadako Ogata,
yesterday vehemently condemned the Bosnian Serbs for again blocking relief
convoys to the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica and called on world
leaders to send in aid 'by all possible means'.
Mrs Ogata's statement, made in Geneva, followed the abandonment of the
latest attempt by a UN convoy to reach the stricken town, where thousands of
people are facing starvation and require urgent medical treatment, when its
route was blocked by Serb forces.
UN officials believe that the Serb authorities were holding up the convoy to
allow the Bosnian Serb army, which was only 5km from Srebrenica and rapidly
closing in on the town, to pursue its offensive. General Lars-Erik Wahlgren,
the overall commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, went to the
Bosnian Serb army headquarters at Lukavica, outside Sarajevo, to try to
persuade the Serbs to stop the offensive.
Referring to 'the unacceptable attitude' of the Bosnian Serb military, Mrs
Ogata said they were preventing access of humanitarian aid to the people of
eastern Bosnia 'despite all their verbal and written commitments'. The
statement said that at least four other convoys were attempting yesterday to
reach other Bosnian enclaves, but were reported to have been halted either
by fighting or at Serb checkpoints.
UNHCR officials reported up to 30 deaths a day in Srebrenica and said that
starving inhabitants and refugees from neighbouring townships were fighting
over food supplies dropped by US aircraft. 'The drop zone is crowded with
starving people. Gun and knife fights are all too common,' one official
said.
Michael Littlejohns adds: A new round of Balkans peace talks finally was
under way in New York yesterday as Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and
EC mediators, met all of the main parties, including Bosnian president, Mr
Alija Izetbegovic.
However, these were bilateral negotiations. There was still no indication if
or when there would be a plenary session involving Mr Izetbegovic, Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat
leader, and Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, Belgrade's foreign minister. Mr
Izetbegovic's said his meeting with Mr Vance and Lord Owen was very short
because of the 'bad news' of continued fighting in Bosnia. But he added:
'That doesn't mean we interrupt the negotiations.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / Delors slates G7 summit 'circus'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday described
the summit meetings of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations as 'a
Barnum circus with 3,000 journalists,' and called for a radical
reorganisation of international economic organisations.
'The G7 should be setting an example but all it can offer is platitudes,' Mr
Delors told a meeting of the International Management and Development
Institute, a gathering of corporate executives and politicians from Europe
and North America, in Washington yesterday.
'The duty of the most prosperous countries is to co-operate and deliver a
concrete signal to the rest of the world,' he added, complaining that the G7
had spent the last four years telling the world it had the goodwill to
complete the Uruguay round of negotiations on new world trading rules, but
had failed to fulfil this.
Arguing for closer linkage between international economic institutions such
as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank under the auspices of the United Nations, Mr Delors
said the next two years offered an opportunity to create a new framework 'in
the same spirit as after the war, because we face a new world'.
Mr Delors was due to visit the White House later for a 20 minute opportunity
to get acquainted with President Bill Clinton. European officials denied
that any longer negotiating session had ever been planned, but a full summit
meeting in Washington between the US and the EC was expected to be announced
for May 7.
White House officials said they expected some discussion of trade issues,
but Mr Delors was also expected to bring up broader questions, including G7
co-ordination and aid for the republics of the former Soviet Union.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, denied that any snub was
intended by the shortness of the meeting.
'Commissioner Delors asked for a courtesy call. We granted that,' she said
yesterday.
Some senior administration officials have complained privately, however, of
a 'snow shower' of visitors from Europe wanting to see the new president.

THE long-strained relationship between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the
business community in Germany has been further damaged by an extraordinary
attack by a leading Kohl aide on the chief spokesman for German industry.
Mr Friedrich Bohl, the minister in the Chancellor's office, who regularly
speaks on behalf of Mr Kohl, issued an outspoken public rebuke of Mr Tyll
Necker, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI), apparently for
criticising the 'solidarity pact' agreed at the weekend.
The official statement distributed by the government information office
accused Mr Necker of 'sweeping and indiscriminate accusations' against the
political establishment.
Mr Bohl went on to suggest that the industry federation was itself
responsible for increasing wage rates for years beyond the level justified
by economic conditions, and in allowing a steady inflation of all the
ancillary personnel costs in industry.
His outburst was apparently directed at a speech delivered by Mr Necker in
Munich on Wednesday, in which he accused 'the political establishment' of
failing to adjust its promises to the downturn in the economy.
Mr Necker said he was 'relieved' by the weekend agreement on how to finance
the solidarity pact, but he also underlined his concern that it would depend
too much on borrowing and tax rises, and too little on spending cuts in the
west.
The pact is intended to operate on two levels: as an agreement between the
central government, the opposition and the 16 federal states on financing
subsidies for east Germany in the medium-term; and as a deal with employers
and trade unions on increased investment and wage restraint.
The one element that is still missing is a deal on wages in the east: IG
Metall, the giant engineering union, is threatening to hold a strike ballot
in defence of its contract for a 26 per cent pay rise in April, and an
increase of more than 30 per cent in 1994, to reach parity with western
wages.
The bitterness of Mr Bohl's statement took officials at the BDI by surprise.
They regarded Mr Necker's speech as normal criticism from the private
sector.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Prague to seize shares in assets row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Czech government is preparing to seize shares held in privatised Czech
companies by Slovak investors following a bitter dispute between Prague and
Bratislava over the allocation of assets from the former Czechoslovakia.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, said the transfer of shares to
Slovaks from last year's voucher privatisation will be withheld as a
guarantee against Czech claims for compensation from Slovakia.
'The shares of Slovak shareholders are being held by the government as
security before signing agreements on property and on balancing the assets
and liabilities of the (former) Czechoslovak State Bank,' he said. Shares
with a nominal value of around Dollars 10bn (Pounds 7bn) were to be
transferred to investors starting on March 29.
The move brought an angry reaction. Mr Julius Toth, the Slovak finance
minister, doubted the move was legal. The prime minister, Mr Vladimir
Meciar, said it was 'discrimination' against Slovak citizens.
Slovak investors are estimated to have bought shares worth about CzK24bn
(Dollars 830m) in Czech companies, roughly equal to what the Czechs claim
they are owed by Slovakia. Until now, Bratislava has offered to pay CzK1bn
in compensation. Czech citizens invested CzK7.5bn in Slovak companies. Mr
Roman Ceska, the Czech deputy minister of privatisation, said Slovak
investors will be compensated based on the cost of participation in the
voucher privatisation. 'Compensation will be based on the cost of
participation (in the voucher privatisation), that's CzK1,035 (per
investor), but not on the nominal value of shares,' he said.
The announcement dismayed Czech investors in voucher shares. Delays in
transferring shares to Czech owners are inevitable, as it will be necessary
to sift through all transactions to identify Slovak investors.
'It will create big problems in clearing and registering the shares,' said
one investment fund analyst.

The International Cocoa Organisation's full council meets in London this
afternoon in an attempt to find a way forward towards a new economic
agreement, writes David Blackwell. Yesterday members were talking
individually to Mr Peter Lai, president of the negotiations, to try to
narrow the gap between producers and consumers. United Nations-sponsored
talks on the pact ended in failure a fortnight ago.
The present agreement ends on September 30, and cannot be extended. Today's
meeting will decide whether it is worth returning to Geneva for another

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: SEC backs changes to sales of
mutual funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPORTANT change in the way in which mutual fund shares are sold in the
US could be in the offing.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission, the securities industry watchdog,
yesterday voted to propose a rule change which would allow investors to buy
shares in mutual funds - the US equivalent of the UK's unit trusts - through
advertisements in newspapers and magazines.
At present, investors can only buy shares in a mutual fund after seeing the
full official offering document for the investment vehicle.
This contrasts sharply with the situation in the UK, where 'off-the-page'
advertising by unit trust companies is commonplace.
The proposed rule change, however, would only apply to funds which have been
registered with the SEC for two years or more, and investors would receive a
full prospectus with confirmation of their order.
Advertisments would also be subject to the same legal liability provisions
as traditional prospectuses.
The proposed rule change, which has been published for comment, would not
require Congressional approval.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sabena joins with Delta to
market route
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELTA Air Lines, said yesterday it had signed a code-sharing agreement with
Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier, to market jointly a daily round-trip
flight between Atlanta and Brussels.
Delta, based in Atlanta, became a leading transatlantic operator when it
acquired former Pan Am route authorities.
The new flight will begin operating on June 1, using Delta Boeing 767
aircraft. There will be a combined Delta and Sabena flight crew, and Sabena
will reserve a block of seats, using its own flight designation, in the
three service classes. The airlines will also share terminal facilities in
Atlanta and Brussels.
United Airlines - which, like Delta, is one of the 'big three' US carriers -
said yesterday that it was considering cutting or rescheduling deliveries of
Airbus A-320 jets.
The company's president, Mr Jack Pope, told Dow Jones that there had been no
talks with Airbus to date, but that reductions in Airbus deliveries might
have to be considered because of the weak domestic market. United has 50
A-320s on firm order and a further 50 on option.
On Wednesday, United revealed that its negotiations over reduced deliveries
of Boeing aircraft had been completed, but declined to reveal the revised
agreement until discussions with engine manufacturers had also ended.

FDA panel

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WARNER Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals company, has finally received a
recommendation for marketing approval for its Cognex drug to treat symptoms
of Alzheimer's disease.
An advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday
unanimously recommended approval of Cognex to treat mild to moderate
symptoms of the disease, which afflicts about 4m Americans.
The panel's findings were a coup for Warner Lambert, which failed in two
previous attempts to get marketing approval for the drug. In two reviews of
the drug in 1991, the committee declined to recommend Cognex because of
unclear evidence of its efficacy. Warner Lambert has since completed two
further trials.
FDA committee members yesterday said the company had clearly met criteria
proving the drug's efficacy, although they also noted that only a small
number of patients received a significant benefit from using Cognex.
Cognex will now need approval by the FDA before it reaches the market. The
FDA generally follows the advisory panel's recommendations.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: GAN warns of steep decline to
FFr400m net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GAN, one of France's largest insurance groups, yesterday warned of a sharp
decline in net profits to FFr400m (Dollars 71m) in 1992, from FFr2.32bn in
1991, because of the competitive state of the insurance sector and its
exposure to the fragile property market.
The group, a state-controlled company which is a candidate for privatisation
under the conservatives - firm favourites to win this month's parliamentary
elections - was also affected last year by a fall in the value of its asset
sales and the poor performance of CIC, its banking subsidiary.
GAN, which will announce its final results for 1992 in late April, is the
latest leading French insurance group to have reported poor figures for last
year. The insurers have for several years been struggling in
intensely-competitive markets for both life and damage insurance.
However, the recent economic squeeze has aggravated these problems by making
it more difficult for the insurers to compensate by raising money from asset
sales. It has also forced them to make steep provisions on the value of
their property portfolios and industrial investments.
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the state-controlled company which is
France's biggest single insurer, recently reported a fall in net profits
from FFr3.8bn in 1991 to FFr1.1bn in 1992. Axa, the largest private sector
insurer, saw profits slide from FFr2.4bn to FFr1.5bn over the same period.
GAN has been particularly badly affected because of its exposure to the
property sector. It managed to increase turnover by 10 per cent (on a
constant basis) to FFr43.8bn last year with its bank-insurance interests
representing a quarter of the total.
The life insurance business remained profitable, but GAN experienced
problems in the damage sector. These difficulties were compounded by a
decline in profits from CIC, which was hit by the strains on the small
business sector.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MID-GLAMORGAN county council in south Wales is withdrawing its application
for about Pounds 7m of European aid for 33 projects because it says it
cannot now afford its share of the cost.
The council says that the projects, out of a total of 83 it put forward last
summer for European regional development funding, included a relief road for
Merthyr Tydfil, other improvements for roads and industrial land, and rail
park and ride schemes.
Dr Victoria Winckler, head of Mid-Glamorgan's policy unit, said that the
financial settlement imposed by the government for the coming financial year
meant that the council would not now have the resources for matching finance
for all 83 schemes. About 55 per cent of the cost would have to be met by
the council.
'They were all realistic projects intended to help to regenerate the
economy,' she said.

FT  19 MAR 93 / OFT life insurance proposals: SIB plan dismissed as
anti-competitive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Office of Fair Trading has produced two reports. The first, under the
Financial Services Act 1986, is a direct reaction to the rules for
investment regulation proposed by SIB and Lautro in July.
The OFT argues that SIB's proposed rules are anti-competitive because they
do not give consumers enough information to make informed choices of brands,
products or sales outlets.
It suggests changes to these proposed rules in four areas:
Disclosure of surrender values in the later years of a policy: under SIB's
rules the surrender values investors would receive if they stopped paying
premiums only need to be shown for the first five years of the policy. The
report finds that surrender values in later years are relevant to a decision
on whether to buy the policy in question, 'or indeed any life product'.
Disclosure of companies' charges in illustrations of future investment
returns: life companies currently publish projections of the likely future
returns on their policies on the basis of an average charge for the
industry. They are not allowed to publish illustrations using their own
charges, even if they are substantially different. The report says these
rules mean that investors will 'make different decisions from those they
would make if they had better information'.
Commission disclosure by independent financial advisers: the report says:
'Without early automatic disclosure of commissions, in actual cash amounts,
an investor will not know the price of advice and cannot compare it with
that for the advice of other IFAs (including those remunerated by fees).'
The commission of agents tied to one company was not within the scope of the
OFT's report, and they would not be obliged to disclose commission. Sir
Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said there were technical difficulties
in forcing disclosure on tied agents but that a method of revealing their
commission 'would be something very much to be welcomed'.
He added that independent advisers operated in two markets - 'the market for
independent financial advice, and the market for selling life insurance'. He
said: 'There has to be a price which is paid for that advice, and as nothing
else is paid, commission must be regarded as that price. The market doesn't
work very well unless people can tell what they are paying.'
Differential pricing among tied outlets: life offices are not allowed under
current SIB rules to offer the same product at different prices through
different tied agents, such as building societies, although the costs
involved for the different agents may vary. According to the OFT this limits
the likelihood that 'the most efficient means of distribution will prevail
and reduce overall costs to investors'.
The OFT is happy with the rules for disclosing an adviser's status (whether
independent or tied) and dis-closure of product details.
In a separate report the OFT sets out a different structure for investor
protection in life insurance sales. Here the OFT calls for transparency of
persistency rates. Companies would have to tell prospective consumers the
percentage of clients who hold their policies to maturity.
Sir Bryan suggested that companies be required to disclose two rates; the
proportion of policyholders remaining after two years and the proportion
which hold policies to maturity. Poor persistency rates are regarded as
evidence that companies sell inappropriate policies to consumers.
The OFT urges that policyholders should receive annual statements similar to
those received by shareholders or unit trust holders. The documents would
give policyholders information about the latest investment returns and say
whether investments were performing better or worse than expected.

of Fair Trading:

FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Delors warns Clinton over trade war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday he did not foresee a trade war with
the European Community, but EC commission president Jacques Delors said he
remained concerned about the threat of a transatlantic trade war.
After a meeting at the White House, Mr Delors said he had warned the
president of serious consequences if the US carried out a threat to
retaliate next week in a US-EC dispute over bidding for government
contracts.
'The retaliation that is planned is not good for the mood between the EC and
the US,' Mr Delors told reporters.
Although he remained concerned about the possibility of a trade war, he
added: 'I am ever optimistic.' Mr Delors said he was happy with Mr Clinton's
'open attitude' and with the 'spirit of co-operation' between the EC and US.
Mr Clinton's assurance came in response to a reporter's question before the
meeting. 'I don't want a trade war with the EC and I don't think we'll have
one,' he said.
The meeting, which lasted more than an hour, comes after mounting tensions
between the US and EC over a number of trade issues, including steel duties
and Airbus subsidies.
Before the Oval Office meeting, Mr Delors described summits of the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations as 'a Barnum circus with 3,000
journalists,' and called for radical reorganisation of international
economic organisations.
'The G7 should be setting an example but all it can offer is platitudes,' he
told the International Management and Development Institute, which brings
together corporate executives and politicians from Europe and North America.

<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS on side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement
ran into their first obstacle yesterday when Canadian and Mexican chief
negotiators took a tough line against the use of formal trade sanctions to
enforce labour and environmental standards.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, has taken on board demands
from prominent US senators and congressmen for agreements 'with teeth', but
he has yet to define how he sees the enforcement taking place.
Yesterday Mr John Weekes, the top Canadian negotiator, said Mr Herminio
Blanco Mendoz and Mr Rufus Yerxa, deputy US Trade Representative had
'exchanged concepts' on the agreements but had reached no firm conclusions .
Negotiators are expected to have little difficulty agreeing to establish
labour and environmental commissions, but trouble is expected in agreeing
their precise powers.
Mr Weekes said he would be consulting with the provinces, the
non-governmental organisations and the business representatives before
determining Canada's final positions.
He also implied that Mexico and Canada had no interest in writing a third
agreement over import surges because that was already embodied in the
completed Nafta text.
Negotiators will meet again on April 11. A deal is expected to take two to
three months, Mr Weekes said. This could get Nafta to the US Congress in
early summer.

FT  19 MAR 93 / IMF staff draw up plans for SDR fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund staff are working on proposals to make
substantial sums available to Russia and other post-communist states via new
allocations of Special Drawing Rights, the IMF's own currency.
Leading IMF constituent members - the US, Japan and Germany - are believed
to harbour various reservations on what would be a first general issue of
SDRs in 12 years.
But its broad outlines were discussed in Hong Kong last weekend at the
meeting of G7 'sherpas' convened to discuss assistance to Russia, according
to a G7 official in Moscow.
Under the proposal, which is said to have the support of Mr Michel
Camdessus, the managing director, the IMF's richer member states would
return their share - amounting on one estimate to around Dollars 5bn-Dollars
6bn - of an SDR allocation, which would go towards a trust fund for support
of the post-communist states.
In the case of Russia, much of the money earmarked would be used to provide
a social safety net for those made unemployed by the economic reforms, and
for pensioners and others on low incomes.
The attraction of the initiative for the IMF - still the principal
institution for the transfer of assistance to Russia - is that it could be
presented as a technical decision of its own, rather than as a measure
quickly cobbled together to answer to the political demands of the moment.
In addition, the risk of default would be borne by the countries which
contributed to the trust fund, rather than by the IMF itself.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Czech government is preparing to seize shares held in privatised Czech
companies by Slovak investors following a bitter dispute between Prague and
Bratislava over the allocation of assets from the former Czechoslovakia.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, said the transfer of shares to
Slovaks from last year's voucher privatisation will be withheld as a
guarantee against Czech claims for compensation from Slovakia.
'The shares of Slovak shareholders are being held by the government as
security before signing agreements on property and on balancing the assets
and liabilities of the (former) Czechoslovak State Bank,' he said. Shares
with a nominal value of around Dollars 10bn (Pounds 7bn) were to be
transferred to investors starting on March 29.
The move brought an angry reaction. Mr Julius Toth, the Slovak finance
minister, doubted the move was legal. The prime minister, Mr Vladimir
Meciar, said it was 'discrimination' against Slovak citizens.

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND suffered a serious political and economic setback yesterday when
parliament rejected the country's mass privatisation programme.
The plan's defeat in the Sejm by 12 votes increased pressure on the
coalition government of the prime minister, Mrs Hanna Suchocka, who appeared
visibly shaken and accused the opposition of 'irresponsible behaviour'. It
also jeopardised talks on a Dollars 450m (Pounds 317m) World Bank structural
adjustment loan, which had implementation of the scheme as one of its
conditions. The privatisation programme also forms an integral part of an
agreement between Poland and the International Monetary Fund for a Dollars
660m stand-by loan.
An informal opposition coalition, encompassing former communists and
anti-communists, united to defeat the coalition, which was also deserted by
10 deputies from the nationalist ZChN group, unhappy about the involvement
of foreign managers in the scheme.
The mass privatisation plan, first outlined two years ago, would have
transferred about 600 state enterprises into investment funds managed by
foreign advisers. Shares in the funds would have been distributed at a
nominal charge to the population. The funds were to have been dissolved
after 10 years, with the proceeds distributed to shareholders.
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister, said after yesterday's
vote that 'the country's political elites had decided to put a brake on the
economic reforms and exclude all those Poles who would have gained by the
programme'.
The government lost the final vote on the law despite defeating a series of
amendments, put by both the left and the right-wing parties aimed at
excluding foreign managers from the scheme. The government also overcame
amendments which would have reduced it to a pilot project involving no more
than 200 enterprises.
Ms Suchocka now faces the problem not only of rescuing the coalition's
cohesion but also deciding whether to press on with the plan.

FT  19 MAR 93 / BBC says Birt was not first executive hired as freelance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC acknowledged yesterday that Mr John Birt, the director-general, was
not the first top executive to be hired on a freelance basis.
The disclosure, by the board of governors, came after a meeting at which it
was decided that neither Mr Birt nor Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the chairman,
should resign.
The governors said that in future, 'the roles and responsibilities of the
board will be better defined' and that 'all board members' will 'receive
full information in relation to key public interest issues and approve all
decisions on matters of remuneration'. Their statement added that details of
the new approach and the changes to the BBC's current system will be given
in the next few weeks.
The board's statement did not name the senior executives who had enjoyed the
same contractual relationship as Mr Birt, and last night the BBC would not
elaborate. The statement said that at present all members of the board of
management were employed on a staff basis. Although the governors expressed
unanimous support for Mr Birt, they said it was an error to have employed
him on a contract basis.
The clear implication of the governors' statement is that while Mr Birt was
not director-general, they did not feel it necessary to require him to join
the staff of the BBC, particularly as precedents had already been set by
other senior managers and as his tax arrangements were legal. However, once
he was to become director-general, the governors felt he should join the
BBC's staff PAYE scheme.
They added that the precedents set for Mr Birt's tax arrangements, under
which his salary was paid into his private company, pre-dated the
appointments of both Mr Hussey and Sir Michael Checkland, the previous
director-general.
The governors said Mr Hussey made clear last year, when it was known that Mr
Birt would move to become director-general this year, that his contract
'should be completely renegotiated'.
But last November, when Sir Michael announced that he was leaving three
months early, Mr Birt suggested that the renegotiation of his own contract
should be 'put on one side' because of the pressure of 'urgent and
widespread further responsibilities'. Mr Birt took over as director-general
on January 1.
It also emerged yesterday that governors appear to have taken steps to
protect the BBC from other possible repercussions concerning Mr Birt's
previous freelance status, by asking for a financial indemnity from Mr Birt
over his tax affairs at Tuesday's special meeting of the board.
However, it was not clear yesterday whether Mr Birt has yet signed such an
indemnity, which would make him and his private company, John Birt
Productions, responsible for his tax affairs during the period of his
freelance contract. Without such an indemnity, the BBC would be responsible
for Mr Birt's tax if there were any problems with the Inland Revenue.
Mr Robert McLennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman and a member of
the BBC's general advisory council, last night said the statement simply
confirmed that 'Mr Hussey has lost all moral authority and therefore the
ability to speak effectively for the BBC at this time of difficulty'.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Government closer to pits deal: Four power companies accept
arbitration over coal contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday persuaded at least four electricity companies to
accept binding arbitration to resolve disputes over contracts for coal-fired
power. Ministers have blamed the disputes for delaying a white paper aimed
at saving some of Britain's 31 threatened pits.
The arbitration is the latest, and ministers hope the last, in a series of
government initiatives over more than eight months to cajole the two
generators in England and Wales and the 12 regional electricity companies
into concluding deals with British Coal.
Ministers are pushing the industry to conclude a final deal so that the
government's white paper and the new contracts between British Coal and the
generators, backed by deals with regional power companies, can be published
before April 1.
Existing deals between British Coal and the generators run out on that date.
The Department of Trade and Industry is still uncertain whether the
remaining obstacles can be overcome during the next few days but has
provided time at next Thursday's cabinet meeting for government approval of
the scheme.
Ministers are also continuing to play down expectations on the number of
pits which might be saved. Legal advice on the cross-Channel interconnector
published yesterday was said to have undercut significantly the call from
the Commons trade and industry select committee for a 16m-tonnes expansion
of the market for coal.
Senior Conservative MPs believe that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, is preparing opinion at Westminster for a deal that
might save fewer than 10 of the 31 threatened pits.
The arbitration initiative follows a statement to MPs by Mr Heseltine on
Wednesday that he would not publish a white paper until the electricity
industry had signed contracts on coal-fired power.
Most power industry executives believe a deal can be reached on 'base'
contracts for 40m tonnes of coal next year and 30m for each of the next
four. However, several regional companies are against signing anything until
they see how the white paper affects the energy market.
Talks between British Coal and the generators for additional contracts,
thought to involve only about 40m tonnes over five years, have been put on
hold while the base contract problems are resolved.
The base contract differences involve National Power, PowerGen and at least
four regional companies.
Both the generators and at least two regional companies have agreed to
arbitration.

FT  19 MAR 93 / China warns Patten over trade

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S economic ties with China would 'inevitably be affected' if the row
over Hong Kong persists, a senior Chinese official said yesterday.
Mr Li Lanqing, minister of foreign economic relations and trade, accused Mr
Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, of undermining the smooth transfer to
Chinese rule by persisting with his plans for democratic reforms.
Asked whether the dispute would affect commercial relations, Mr Li replied:
'I believe that if the governor sticks to his present manner of doing
things, economic and trade relations will inevitably be affected.'
China has a long history of retaliating economically against countries which
displease it politically. The most recent example was the freeze Beijing
placed on business with France last year after the French announced they
were selling advanced Mirage fighter-bombers to Taiwan.
According to the UK Department of Trade and Industry, Sino-British trade was
worth Pounds 1.38bn last year, with the balance increasingly heavily in
Beijing's favour. Chinese exports to the UK amounted to Pounds 954m, up 35
per cent on the previous year.
Mr Patten said Beijing might damage its own economic interests if it allowed
the row over his political reform package to affect Sino-British trade and
economic ties.
He said that trade should not be politicised, and warned of the consequences
if China were to link Hong Kong's political development to its economic
relationship with Britain.
China is keen to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and wants
its most favoured nation trading status renewed in the US. Mr Patten hopes
to meet US president Bill Clinton in late April or early May, and press for
unconditional renewal of China's MFN status. Britain has been a supporter of
China's entry into the Gatt.
In London, Mr John Major, the prime minister, told parliament: 'The governor
has acted sensitively, resolutely and correctly and we shall continue to
make that clear to the Chinese government.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / Failure of Taurus blamed on lack of City leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAURUS fiasco has revealed a lack of leadership for the sort of large
infrastructure projects which affect the future of the City, according to Mr
Peter Rawlins, the former chief executive of the London Stock Exchange.
Speaking publicly for the first time since his resignation from the exchange
last week, Mr Rawlins warned: 'There is a real City management problem here.
It could happen again, and it will happen again unless we change our
approach.'
He refused to comment on the history of the paperless settlement project,
which was scrapped last week after a series of technical problems, but said:
'I took responsibility as chief executive for the stock exchange's failure.
But to characterise it simply as a stock exchange failure, or as a failure
just of the technology, is to miss the point.'
His words were echoed by other senior executives in the City who had been
involved in the project. Mr Patrick Mitford-Slade, chairman of the Siscot
committee, which designed Taurus, said: 'With hindsight, we were trying to
satisfy too many interests. It needed leadership from the Bank (of
England).'
A member of the City monitoring group set up to oversee the Taurus project
said: 'I don't think anyone understood the whole project. There was no
single sponsor.'
Bank of England officials have also acknowledged the difficulty of promoting
significant changes to the way financial markets operate which may be for
the good of the City as a whole but which damage some interests in it. The
Bank has stepped forward to take over the search for a successor to Taurus,
after exchange chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith approached Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, Bank of England governor.

The Bundesbank duly delivered a discount rate cut, but in a grudging way
that leaves the French franc exposed. Although the Lombard rate is merely
symbolic when the trend in rates is down, the bank's reluctance to cut it
suggests a gradual approach to relaxation. That will limit France's room for
manoeuvre just as its need for lower interest rates is becoming urgent.
By contrast, sterling is a beneficiary. The interest rate differential
between the UK and Germany has narrowed at a time when the prospect for a
base rate cut is receding. Yesterday's fall in unemployment was too good to
signal a trend. But after the positive data on retail sales and
manufacturing output, there are fewer excuses for cutting base rates. The
equity market may be mildly disappointed: the resulting strength of sterling
looks helpful to gilts.

<TEXT>
Reed's merger with Elsevier certainly looks good on a pie chart. There is
even a decent chance that it will work out in practice. Unlike many mergers,
Reed Elsevier contains titles and groups which can more or less stand alone.
So while common financial systems may be imposed from the centre and
co-operation over product development may grow, there is relatively little
risk that the Reed body will reject the Elsevier brain. The chemistry also
seems to work at board level. Implementation of strategy will be all, but
both sides have proved adept at acquisitions and the group's financial
strength is a great asset.
This year, the gathering recession in continental Europe is a worry. Yet at
least the group's main cyclical businesses are in the UK and US. And there
will be a nice kick to Reed's 1993 earnings since the pro-forma 1992 figures
were converted at a higher sterling rate than looks likely this year. After
five years of continuous revolution and flat earnings, Reed's shareholders
must be looking forward to a little growth.

UB's year ended with such a flurry of activity that it was difficult to keep
a fix on the group. But its annual results confirm that, though much may
have usefully changed at the margin, UB's fate will still be determined at
the core. Here, both McVitie's and KP produced predictably creditable
performances with promising growth in mainland Europe. Despite
rationalisation, Ross Young's recorded its customary miserable return on
assets.
The swing element is Keebler. The troublesome US subsidiary, which saw
profits drop by 60 per cent, accounts for 36 per cent of group sales. The
speed and strength of its recovery will be the spur for UB's shares. The
management's rhetoric seems right. Much can surely be achieved by applying
marketing spend more appropriately and cutting wasteful lines. The closure
of a Californian bakery hints at more regional retrenchment. Further
expansion into the own-label market could provide the incremental sales
increases needed to defray the costs of Keebler's expensive distribution
base.
This could provide UB with a recovery kick lacking in such sector stalwarts
as Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes. But the US market remains fearsomely
competitive. Investors may care to wait for a progress report at the interim
stage before chasing the shares much further.

FT  19 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Legal &amp; General
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having underperformed the Prudential by 25 per cent over the last two years,
Legal &amp; General is the Cinderella of the life assurance sector. Mortgage
indemnity losses are partly to blame. But L&amp;G is still losing money in
general insurance and estate agency while the Pru is free to concentrate on
what both companies do best: managing long-term savings.
Yet the tide may be turning in L&amp;G's favour. Increased provisions against
mortgage indemnity look conservative, although the same was said last year.
By reinsuring its household account, L&amp;G has capped exposure to future
storms and floods. If estate agency improves from here on, the market may
finally focus on the value of the life assurance side. With its shares
trading below the value attributable to shareholders in the life fund, L&amp;G
stands out from the crowd.
Underperformance may continue, though, until L&amp;G has convinced it can
compete successfully for new life and pensions business. The decline in
mortgage-related sales might explain away the recent poor new business
performance and a triple-A credit rating coupled with a respectable
investment performance should, in theory, leave it well placed to sell more
policies. But the market will demand hard evidence that marketing and
distribution are up to scratch before the shares trade at much of a premium
to the value of the life fund.

FT  19 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Low spirits at Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A little extra on the dividend to compensate for a poor profits performance
is a mixed blessing when the company concerned is Guinness. There is no
denying its comfortable cover ratio or the strength of its cash-flow, even
after stripping out the unusual fall in UK tax paid last year. Guinness
certainly has the resources to continue increasing its dividend, but it
looks odd to stress that when the company is not traditionally perceived as
a yield stock. The cynic might conclude that a return to rapid earnings
growth is even more remote than ever.
It is not just that the Japanese salaryman has been forced to trade down to
Johnnie Walker Red Label, pay for it himself and drink it at home. With
hindsight, the expansion into Spanish brewing, especially the purchase of
Union Cervecera, looks anything but a stroke of pure genius. The
restructuring will be expensive and arduous. There is incipient recovery in
the UK, but the improvement in the US is overshadowed by the threat of a
federal duty on spirits.
This is not to belittle underlying growth of 6 per cent in spirits and 9 per
cent in beer. Despite difficult markets, Guinness managed to improve the mix
of its spirits sales, but the jury is still out on when global recovery will
be strong enough to encourage large-scale trading up to premium brands.
Until then, the shares will hardly regain their premium rating.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Personal View: Hitting a high note at the opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY ISAACS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Royal Opera House were a publicly quoted company, its share price at
the end of this financial year would be riding high. The chairman, reporting
the results, would point to outstanding artistic achievement, and, at a time
when others are in difficulties, to a useful surplus on the current account,
after provision for exceptional items; to debt reduced and gearing improved.
No cause for complacency, but the company is very much on the right course,
with prospects fair.
The financial press might hail this as a turnround. They would be right.
Last summer the Arts Council committee, headed by Lady Warnock, which
carried out an appraisal of the Royal Opera House, fiercely and, in
retrospect it can be seen, intemperately criticised its management. It spoke
of a development crisis, a financial crisis, a management crisis.
Unattributed, leaked and, incidentally, sexist comment put it more brutally;
we could not run a girls' choir.
The Warnock committee urged that our development scheme be shelved; it saw
no cause for concern in the level of prices we charge; it made no comment on
artistic standards achieved, except to recommend a narrowing of ambition. To
all this we took exception. But it is, nevertheless, always salutary 'to see
ourselves as others see us'. Warnock, insisting that all planning be
governed by financial realities, conveyed a useful warning in a deepening
recession. The results of the 1990-91 financial year, in which we did better
than break even, selling 88 per cent of the financial capacity of the Opera
House, were perhaps untypical and would not in any case easily be repeated.
In fact, ROH itself had foreseen the danger. Early in 1992 the board
commissioned accountants Price Waterhouse to conduct a study of our cost
efficiency and working practices. That pointed to possible economies. In the
autumn, we tightened our belts, and redoubled our efforts. Extra
performances, on a stage already working full out, were crammed into the
schedule, and sold. Management structures and communications have been
strengthened. Employees, generously and responsibly, have acquiesced in a
wage freeze. Economies, within strict cash limits, were imposed. It hurt,
but it worked. We end the year wreathed in artistic laurels - for opera a
clean sweep of nominations, eight out of eight, for the Olivier Awards - and
with a surplus. The accumulated deficit is thereby reduced. We can look our
bank manager in the eye.
It would be foolish not to concede that Warnock concentrated the mind
wonderfully. We shall be stronger for acting on its criticisms. But if this
year's results are owed to incompetent management, then I can think of
institutions which could do with a dose of the same.
Opera and ballet we know are expensive; the forces deployed, dancers,
chorus, orchestra, make them so. But they are not elitist art forms. Their
followers are numbered in millions; broadcasts on radio and on television
carry the work of our three companies into millions of homes each year. The
prime minister, in any case, defused the 'elitism' grenade, supposedly
lethal in the hands of philistine backbenchers, when he shrewdly linked the
arts with sport and other outdoor pleasures.
The Royal Opera's subsidy is now down to 27 per cent of its income. This is
a lesser proportion than any other UK national company. If higher subsidy
were available we should use it principally to reduce or at least restrain
prices. If it is not, we shall soldier on.
Last year both the Royal Ballet and the Royal Opera toured Japan. The
Foreign Office and the British Council know our worth. In the UK, companies
and corporations in the City demonstrate by their support that London needs
great opera and ballet, and that they benefit from it.
A crunch is coming. The house is falling down. We have to repair the fabric
of a loved theatre, built in 1858. We have to modernise a stage not
thoroughly re-equipped since the start of this century. We shall improve
efficiency, reduce costs, and increase the number of performances,
particularly matinees. We must rehouse the Royal Ballet, now at Baron's
Court, at Covent Garden and gather our workshops under one roof. We shall
improve amenities, including air-conditioning, for audiences, and for
sponsors.
We shall shortly launch a vigorous appeal for funds. But there is one
condition precedent to success. If, and only if, matching funds can be
identified in the public sector, generous private donors stand ready to play
their part; a 50:50 split of a Pounds 90m target. The Royal Opera House,
fortified by that partnership, must be enabled to serve the nation in the
next millennium.

Anyone confused by all the name-changes among Britain's trade unions may
feel happier to know their bewilderment is shared by some of said unions'
members. Or so it seems from the reaction of staff at Tyne Tees Television
yesterday when asked what their own union BECTU's initials stand for.
Three unions at Tyne Tees - the NUJ, the EETPU and BECTU - are co-operating
in a campaign against rumoured job cuts and loss of local decision-making in
the aftermath of the merger with Yorkshire Television.
The NUJ, that's easy: the National Union of Journalists. The EETPU, now part
of the enlarged AEEU, we can describe, for short, as the electricians . . .
But BECTU?
The question stumped not only the NUJ's Tyne Tees FOC (that's 'father of the
chapel' or branch secretary), but also several BECTU brethren present.
Fortunately their branch chairman, John Moore, came to the rescue,
explaining that it stands for the Broadcasting, Entertainment,
Cinematographic and Theatre Union.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Observer: Old smut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given life after death, Shakespeare could be nudging one of his eastern
contemporaries and saying: 'There, see what you've done now.' If so, he'll
be referring to a jail sentence imposed in China on a certain Wan Jianguo.
Arrested for publishing pornography, he has been given four years in prison.
But if that seems a long time, it is nothing to the age of the smutty book
he published - the Golden Lotus, the work of an undisclosed hand during the
Ming dynasty.
Dating from about 1610, it has been blacklisted by Beijing censors pretty
well ever since. However, it is available to officials and scholars who
consider it a central work in the Chinese literary canon.
It evidently struck Wan Jianguo as having popular appeal as well, since he
printed 60,000 copies. Indeed, somewhere up there, the anonymous author
might be telling Shakespeare that if he'd been more erotic and got his works
banned, Britain's present government wouldn't have to order that children be
made to read them.

Eyes widened at a Reuter flash, timed 11.58am, that the Swiss National Bank
said it was lowering its discount rate from 5.5 per cent. But as the new
rate was quoted only as 'XXX PCT', heads were scratched also.
Until 12.02pm, that is, when another flash stated: 'Subscribers are asked to
please ignore earlier alert on Swiss National Bank discount rate, which was
transmitted in error.'
More head scratching though at 1.38pm when the bank finally announced a 1/2

Nice to see a reassuring touch of German humour. A mock tombstone ad in

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What would Sir Adrian Cadbury - lead author of the eponymous report on
Corporate Governance and former chairman of Cadbury Schweppes - make of
brother Dominic's promotion to the executive chairmanship of the firm
founded under the family crest?
'He would approve wouldn't he?' says Dominic in the good knight's absence,
seeing nothing odd in the fact that the confectionery and beverages outfit
now has both an executive chairman and a group chief executive.
True, he stresses that David Wellings, the new chief executive who has only
been with the firm since 1986, will be the 'ultimate decision-maker'. But it
will take a very strong chief executive to stand up to a member of the fifth
generation of the founding family who has been on the board since 1974 and
has been running the shop for the last decade.
While Dominic deserves the benefit of the doubt in view of the group's
rejuvenation under his leadership, the move leaves a funny taste -
fudge-like, perhaps.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Leading Article: OFT on target
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS report to the chancellor on the marketing and sale of
investment-linked insurance products, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the
director-general of fair trading, remarks that 'competition can take place
most effectively when investors have access to information of the right type
and extent, at the right time, and in an understandable form'. It is a
measure of the failure of practitioner-based regulation in the retail
investment market that it should still be necessary to make such a
self-evidently sensible declaration so long after the introduction of the
1986 Financial Services Act.
This report, together with a wider-ranging review of the life assurance
industry carried out under the 1973 Fair Trading Act, provides a welcome and
authoritative statement of good practice in an area where bad practice has
been all too common. Under his limited remit to comment on the existing rule
books of the industry watchdogs, the Securities and Investments Board and
Lautro, Sir Bryan chooses good targets, ranging from inadequate disclosure
of surrender values on endowment policies to the absurd practice of
projecting returns on the basis of industry-wide costs instead of individual
life offices' costs. He is pungent on the failure to reflect differing
distribution expenses in prices, and rightly critical of flabby disclosure
requirements for independent financial advisers.
In his wider report, the director-general is free to move closer to the
heart of the matter by addressing the absence of transparency in charges and
surrender values. Lack of disclosure has long prevented investors from
comparing the insurance industry's policies with a straightforward
investment in equities, gilts or the building society. Sir Bryan helpfully
provides an illustrative disclosure statement for a 25-year with-profit
endowment policy to show how it could be done. It is a form of help that too
many insurers would rather be without.
The OFT's conclusions will no doubt strengthen the hand of SIB in dealing
with its recalcitrant charges. The Treasury should also give the OFT's
bandwagon a well-deserved push. But whether the insurers can be persuaded to
go along with it is another matter. Many in the industry appear incapable of
recognising that the widespread sale of poor products to the wrong people
under the cloak of inadequate disclosure is undermining public confidence.
The public has no obligation to keep in business an industry that is afraid
to reveal the nature of the products it so vigorously peddles. Investors
deserve better protection than they have had so far from regulators who have
sought consensus at the expense of the consumer interest. The OFT has
provided a sound blueprint for a set of rules that would genuinely serve the
public interest. If the industry rejects it, the government should recognise
that practitioner-based regulation has failed in this area and opt for a
tougher, more independent watchdog.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Living together, but no love lost: France's next
conservative government is unlikely to dislodge President Mitterrand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within the next 10 days France will move from weak government to divided
government, an unsettling prospect for those inside and outside the country.
There are only two certainties. One is that shortly after the second round
of voting for the National Assembly on March 28 - the first round,
eliminating weaker candidates, takes place on Sunday - France will have a
conservative prime minister and government.
What little movement there was in opinion polls during the campaign involved
the Greens first gaining, and then falling back, in relation to the
enfeebled ruling Socialists. The combined vote of the Gaullist RPR and the
centre-right UDF - fighting under the joint banner of the Union pour la
France - has not wavered much from the 40 per cent mark. Given the majority
voting system, and the diversity of its opponents, the UPF duet seems sure
to get a large majority of seats.
The other certainty is that, short of cutting off his gas and electricity,
the new conservative government will be unable to get President Francois
Mitterrand out of the Elysee. There had been opposition talk that he would
have to respect the will of the people by packing his bags or calling an
early presidential election if the opposition won a landslide victory. Mr
Mitterrand has made clear that he regards that as constitutional hogwash.
Provided his health does not deteriorate further, Mr Mitterrand will stay
until his seven-year term runs out in May 1995. So France is embarking on up
to two years of cohabitation, a term that has far stormier connotations for
French politicians than it does for unmarried couples. The conservatives'
first cohabitation (1986-88) with Mr Mitterrand left lasting bitterness with
Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, who felt his spell as prime minister
destroyed his 1988 bid for the presidency. This time round 'nothing and no
one will stop us from carrying out our policies', Mr Chirac recently warned.
Mr Chirac regards holding the premiership as a poisoned chalice. But he has
recently sounded unsure about whether he might not put it to his lips - if
Mr Mitterrand offered it to him. His rival on the right for the presidency
in 1995, ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who leads the UDF, has
similar reservations and hesitations.
But few opposition leaders can be ruled in, or ruled out, for the top
government job. It is in Mr Mitterrand's gift and, savouring this power, the
president has given no hint of how he might bestow it, except that it would
not be on someone hostile to the European Community. In practice, the
president will not be able to ignore the leader of the party with the most
seats. So, the not-always-so-friendly rivalry between the RPR and the UDF to
get the edge on the other will be important.
The election will also determine the shape of the future opposition. The
worse the Socialist party does, the more pliable it may be for Mr Michel
Rocard, the most likely Socialist presidential challenger in 1995, to recast
in his mould. His call for 'a big bang' recomposition of the French
centre-left was broadly welcomed within the Socialist party. But Mr Rocard's
tactlessness this week in bad-mouthing President Mitterrand as someone with
whom the French people had 'personal scores to settle' left many Socialists
thinking that the only bang was the sound of a bullet entering Mr Rocard's
foot.
The overwhelming focus in 10 days will be on the new government, and its
attention will be fixed on the economy. Up to yesterday's half-point cut in
the Bundesbank discount rate, a frequent description of the French economy's
current state has been atonie (lifelessness). National output fell by 0.5
per cent in the last quarter of last year, but has since levelled out,
although some sectors such as cars are still seeing a drop in sales. The
rate of job losses slowed in January, albeit with unemployment at a painful
10.5 per cent of the workforce. Most French forecasters predict little
expansion in the first half of this year and only 0.5-0.7 per cent growth in
gross domestic product for the whole year.
France, however, is well-poised to grow. Its inflation rate is about 2 per
cent. Its trade balance will deteriorate this year (because of neighbouring
countries' devaluations), but from a handsome FFr30bn (Pounds 3.8bn) surplus
last year. And the finances of its households and companies are sound.
Banque Indosuez projects that the savings rate will rise from 12.3 per cent
last year to 12.9 per cent this year. The Caisse des Depots, the state
savings bank, calculates that company profits rose 10.6 per cent last year
and productivity increased 3 per cent, as managers cut investment and staff.
Banking on the economy's relative health, France's likely new governors  -
whatever their campaign rhetoric of fiscal conservatism - are not going to
let themselves be too constrained by the relative sickness of state finances
in going for growth. Mr Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the RPR party and
budget minister in 1986-88, said as much earlier this month. 'You will find
that dynamism, audacity, risk-taking will be the thrust of the future
government in economic policy,' he said.
The bill for the opposition programme of tax breaks for the construction
sector, cuts in indirect and direct taxes, and a switch of welfare charges
from company payrolls to the state budget will come to an extra FFr110bn
over three years, calculates Mr Juppe. More than covering this bill, he
claimed, would be public spending cuts, privatisation proceeds and smaller
dole payments/higher tax revenue owing to economic expansion.
The opposition wants to prove the forecasters pessimists. It does not want
to spend the whole of 1993 clawing back the output drop in the last part of
1992. It has seen what poor political reward Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy
has had for trying to be fiscally orthodox; even in that, he has failed,
because last year's FFr230bn budget deficit rose above 3 per cent of GDP and
may hit FFr300bn this year. Most important, France's rival conservative
leaders - Mr Chirac and Mr Giscard d'Estaing - now begin another election
campaign, to displace Mr Mitterrand in 1995.
The new government's principal constraint will be its desire to keep the
franc locked to the D-Mark as it tries to follow German interest rates down.
Here, the centre-right parties seem to think words will suffice. As long as
the new prime minister issues a resounding declaration in favour of the
franc fort, keeps any of the RPR/UDF 'soft money' advocates like Mr Philippe
Seguin or Mr Alain Madelin out of the finance ministry, and tables an
immediate draft law to give the Banque de France autonomy, that will be
assurance enough to the foreign exchange markets, claim many in the
opposition.
But the markets will only be convinced if Germany is. The centre-right
parties hope it will be, and have written into their election platform the
need for a 'new initiative' with Germany on monetary policy. Their
difficulty is that they will also be asking Bonn to join Paris in a more
protectionist trade policy.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, has struck fear into France's
conservatives by expressing impatience with French obstructionism in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Yet Mr Chirac has not only been
denouncing the Gatt negotiations, but also threatening to renege on last
summer's reform of EC farm policy. Quite why the RPR leader should risk an
EC bust-up on this, when most farmers vote RPR anyway, can only be explained
in terms of the 1995 presidential contest.
Seeing this coming, it would not be surprising if President Mitterrand were
to want a cool head at the top of his government, like Mr Edouard Balladur.
This RPR ex-finance minister is the prime ministerial candidate whom most
RPR and UDF voters can agree on. For precisely that reason, nominating him
to the Hotel Matignon would deny Mr Mitterrand the pleasure of making
mischief. But Mr Balladur is calm and polite - qualities which may soon be
in shorter supply in French politics than usual.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Indirect taxation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TUESDAY'S BUDGET showed that the government remains committed to two central
elements of Mrs Thatcher's fiscal reforms. One is the aim of reducing the
basic rate of income tax from 25 to 20 per cent by extending the 20 per cent
band. The other is to continue shifting personal taxation from direct to
indirect taxes, principally Value Added Tax. The storm over the extension of
VAT to domestic fuel could, however, impede this, unless the government
adequately recognises that low income households need additional help during
such a transfer.
Even in this most difficult of budgets, the chancellor has advanced the
Conservative election manifesto aim of extending the width of the 20 per
cent lower rate band. It will increase by Pounds 500 this year to Pounds
2,500, and by a further Pounds 500 next year. At this rate, it will be well
into the next century before the 25 per cent rate entirely disappears. But
the government is clearly determined to advance its manifesto aim year on
year.
The cost of these small extensions in the lower rate band is high - almost
Pounds 1bn for the full Pounds 1,000 promised. This is more than covered by
the restriction to 20 per cent of the reliefs on mortgage interest, the
married couple's allowance and company dividends. However, the complete
elimination of the 25 per cent band would require much larger sums.
Some of the money might be found from further cuts in public expenditure.
But the government's best bet would be a further shift to indirect taxation
by widening the base for VAT. The imposition of VAT on domestic fuel will
raise Pounds 2.3bn when fully implemented. Another Pounds 5bn could be
raised by introducing VAT at 8 per cent on goods and services currently
zero-rated, other than new building.
There is justification for shifting from direct taxes to indirect taxes,
which are easier to collect and harder to avoid. Such a shift may improve
incentives, and can help reduce the poverty trap. And the difference between
standard-rated items and those which are zero-rated is arguably so wide as
to distort choices.
However, any move to tax zero-rated goods reduces the progressivity of the
VAT system. Low-income households spend a higher proportion of their
resources on zero-rated goods such as food, public transport fares and
domestic fuel. Those which depend on social security benefits will not
benefit from tax cuts, unlike the better-off.
For a switch to indirect taxation to be politically acceptable, steps must
be taken to ensure that such households are not left worse off than before.
Uprating benefits in line with the retail price index is insufficient, since
the RPI does not reflect the importance of zero-rated items to low-income
household budgets. Each time the VAT net is widened in this way, a
once-for-all additional increase is needed to social security benefits that
reflects the extra costs imposed on those who depend upon them.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Bundesbank's slow tease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTLESS, many reservations were expressed at yesterday's Bundesbank
council meeting about the adequacy of last weekend's Solidarity Pact. But
the bank had no reason to puncture the bubble of optimism that last
weekend's agreement has inflated around Germany's politicians. Hence, it
duly obliged with a half point cut in the discount rate.
This latest rate cut does not, in fact, signal a change in policy. The
Bundesbank, by regularly dropping the discount rate floor and then allowing
its money market rates to catch up, has permitted short-term interest rates
to fall by 2 percentage points since September; long-term rates have fallen
too. Yesterday's move suggests that the process will continue at a similar
pace.
This modest easing reflects the modest pace at which Germany's current
economic imbalances are righting themselves. Wage settlements in west
Germany show signs of moderating but inflation remains stuck above 4 per
cent. The Bundesbank's broad money aggregate contracted in February relative
to its bloated fourth quarter base but is still rising at more than 7 per
cent on an annual basis. The solidarity pact's tax increases and spending
cuts bring some predictability to fiscal policy, but confirm that Germany's
fiscal day of reckoning has only been postponed.
German industry will argue that the Bundesbank could now ease policy a
little faster, given the fall in inflationary expectations and the
medium-term need for a sizeable D-Mark depreciation against the dollar. But
there can be no doubt that the bank's recent performance has been exemplary.
It appears to have contained post-unification excesses without letting
inflation rise above 4 1/2 per cent, while the German economy has still
managed to grow by an average 2 1/2 per cent a year since the beginning of
1989.
For France, by contrast, German's monetary relaxation began a year too late
and looks set to proceed too slowly. Germany's economic satellites  -
Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands - used yesterday's rate cut to obtain
further monetary relief. But the German reduction failed to ease the
pressure on the French franc. The differential between German and French
short-term rates has now widened from near parity last summer to 3 1/2
percentage points, as market fears of a post-election Franc devaluation have
grown. The French authorities may well resist a devaluation, given the
fundamentally sound state of the French economy, but the costs will continue
to be high.
Meanwhile, as if to rub salt into French wounds, sterling rallied yesterday
against the D-Mark, despite the considerably more feeble state of the UK
economy. The British government should now be able to follow Tuesday's
tax-raising budget with a cut in interest rates to aid recovery. To the
gnashing of Parisian teeth, chancellor Norman Lamont should take his chances
while he can.

FT  19 MAR 93 / A snail on Mogadon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party is whingeing and wailing fit to wake the dead. If it is not
careful it will disturb the voters. 'We wuz robbed', the party yells. Its
leader, Mr John Smith, has taken to observing, with understandable acerbity,
that the Conservatives deceived the electorate last year. Goodness me. 'I do
not know how the right honourable gentleman can sit there as prime minister
of a government who are capable of deceit on such a scale,' charged Mr Smith
in the Commons on Tuesday, staring straight across the despatch box at Mr
John Major.
He had a point. The Conservatives fought the 1992 campaign on the basis of a
tax-reducing Budget and many assurances that taxation would not have to be
increased. In his reply to the Budget speech, the shadow chancellor, Mr
Gordon Brown, took full advantage of his opportunity. 'There will be tax
rises now, tax rises later, and tax rises two years later,' he crowed on
Wednesday. That is a . . . triple Conservative tax whammy.' It was Mr Brown
at his best. Yesterday, Mr Smith put it to the prime minister that,
following Tuesday's Budget, the typical British family would pay Pounds 442
a year more from April 1994 and Pounds 650 from April 1995. Mr Major did not
leap to deny that arithmetic. He dodged it.
Labour is right to protest. Most of us remember the April election very
well. There are two possible explanations for the message of the
Conservative campaign, which might be summed up as 'read my lips - no new
taxes'. One is that it was based on a strategy of deliberate deception.
Heaven forfend. Deceive? Such honourable gentlemen? Surely not.
A more charitable interpretation is that the prime minister and the
chancellor were so witless that they allowed themselves to be fooled, as I
was from time to time, into believing Treasury assurances that the end of
the recession would become apparent during 1992. They were therefore free to
assure the cameras that no tax increases were 'planned' or 'needed', without
going into tedious explanations of the use of those code words, so familiar
to political practitioners. What they actually mean is: 'No increases
planned this afternoon. None needed this evening. Tomorrow may be
different.'
The chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, proffers a third interpretation. He says
that the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and power, and the
higher rates of taxation on petrol and cars, are all part of a package
designed to meet Britain's commitment to reduce CO emissions, made at Rio
last June. That was three months after the election. Those of us who take
our environmentalism seriously are perhaps too easily softened up by such
arguments. Harder heads will wonder whether Mr Lamont was merely looking for
the VAT increase that would be easiest to camouflage with pious excuses.
It is the task of the opposition to instil a recollection of 'Tory promises
betrayed' into the folk-memory. Yet not all voters will be overly impressed.
They are aware that during election campaigns politicians regard 'truth' as
a quaint conceit. Who can recall a British contest that was not an auction
of false promises of cost-free benefits for all?
Consider. Sir Anthony Eden bought the May 1955 election for the
Conservatives by knocking 6 old pence (2 1/2 p) in the pound off income tax
and abolishing purchase tax, the precursor of VAT, for certain goods. He and
his chancellor, Mr R A Butler, knew this was irresponsible, but they sedated
their consciences with a bowl of soothing Treasury advice, prepared by
time-serving officials. The stratagem was effective. The Tories won. Within
a month sterling was under pressure. Messrs Eden and Butler, purveyors of
political veracity, did not flinch. They presented an October Budget, taking
back in indirect taxation what they had given away in direct tax relief in
April.
In 1959 the then Mr Harold Macmillan ach-ieved a dubious victory by hiring
Colman, Prentis &amp; Varley, that year's equivalent of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, to
advertise the Conservatives as the party of prosperity. The Tories won.
Within a year the pre-election inflationary 'go' was followed by a
post-election deflationary 'stop'. The voters had been suckered once again.
Although the Conservatives are champion practitioners of electoral deceit,
they do not command a monopoly of the methodology. The 1966 election was
preceded by a copious outpouring of spending promises and plenty of smart
footwork by the Labour prime minister, the then Mr Harold Wilson. His
government assured the electorate that no increase in tax would be required.
Labour won. Almost immediately afterwards, the second Wilson administration
introduced special employment tax. The following year the Labour chancellor,
now Lord Callaghan, was obliged by the International Monetary Fund to
deflate, and devalue. He had the grace to resign.
All of this is most reprehensible, but it is a fact of political life. Mr
Bill Clinton became president because he recognised that in contemporary
two-party democracies, the governing party will always bluff. The task of
the opposition is to double-bluff. That is so obvious that even the British
Labour party is beginning to absorb the lesson. The danger is that it will
absorb it too well.
Nothing would be more fatal to the opposition's chances of returning to
government than a strategy based on the myth that the sole explanation for
the Conservatives' victory last April is that they pulled the wool over our
eyes. That may - must - have had something to do with it, but the true
reason for the defeat of Labour is that more than 65 per cent of the
electorate did not want the party then led by Mr Neil Kinnock to rule the
country.
Mr Smith's task, which he is undertaking at the pace of a snail on Mogadon,
is to refashion his party into one that voters actually want. He and his
colleagues have made a tentative start. They have jettisoned some of the
policies rejected last year, adopted a new line on constitutional reform,
and reduced the power of the trade unions over their affairs. More is
coming. Meanwhile they should hesitate before expending excess energy on
protestations against Tory deception. They cannot afford to be distracted
for too long from their real task, which is to create an electable
opposition.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Letter: Talisman the ideal basis for SE's Taurus mark II
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES ABRAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Bank of England's immediate response to the sudden demise of Taurus
illustrates clearly how important it is to the City that a computerised
settlement system is developed. The recent articles by Richard Waters
clearly explain both the development and the ultimate failure of Taurus.
However, it must not be forgotten that the London Stock Exchange already has
in place a very effective and efficient computerised settlement system,
Talisman, which provides for settlement by market participants without the
use of share certificates. I would urge that Taurus mark II should be
developed as a Talisman writ large.
The Talisman system involves the use of a stock exchange nominee company,
Sepon, as a custodian for market participants and also indirectly for
investors while their shares are in the course of settlement. Sepon should
become a central depository for all investors (holding shares long term
rather than just while bargains are being settled) and the London Stock
Exchange should extend its book entry transfer system to cover all
investors. This is not in conceptual terms a significant development and,
indeed, would be similar to what the London Stock Exchange originally
proposed.
In particular, under the system I recommend should be adopted:
investors would no longer themselves be on the company's register; instead,
the only shareholder on the register would be Sepon itself. This would
actually be more efficient than having the multitude of registered
shareholders proposed by Taurus;
professional registrars would in turn have their own accounts in Sepon
(keeping their own computerised records of investors) and could still
provide their services on behalf of the company to the majority of
investors. However, market participants, institutions, and stockbrokers or
their nominee companies could have their own Sepon accounts;
the ordinary investor holding through the registrar could still vote and
receive dividends himself (subject to appropriate verification);
the legal framework would be made simpler by the use of a single central
depository;
the company should be able to obtain from Sepon account holders the identity
of its 'shareholders'; and
probably, the government should make participation in Taurus compulsory for
all listed companies and not depend on persuasion.
The know-how and skills used in developing Taurus, and, indeed, Talisman
could surely be applied to implement this suggested new system very quickly.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Letter: Allegation contradicts reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BORIS N MALAKHOV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to make a few comments with regard to Mr Iwanciw's letter
(March 8) commenting on your editorial, 'Russia's backyard' (March 2).
The letter proved once again that lack of information or deliberate ignoring
of facts is the fertile soil for unfounded accusation. When published they
can seriously mislead readers.
The allegation that Russia is 'illegally dismembering Moldova' contradicts
not only the reality but the Financial Times editorial which was applauded
by Mr Iwanciw. It said that Russian troops 'are keeping fragile peace in
Moldova'.
The FT editorial also correctly stated that 'Russia undoubtedly has an
overriding interest in preventing the spread of conflict to its south and
west'. Moreover, we are interested in ending all armed conflicts on the
territory of the former Soviet Union. At the request of some governments of
new independent states Russia took the burden of peace-keeping operations.
By calling for a United Nations mandate we do not seek any rights to
intervene or any other special powers. We just believe that the expenses of
these peace-keeping efforts ought to be shared as is the case in other
regional conflicts where the UN is involved.
As to the human rights of the Russian-speaking population in some former
Soviet republics I would say that this is not as big an issue in
Russian-Ukrainian relations as it is in our relations with Estonia and
Latvia. And it is up to 9m Ukrainians to create schools in their language in
Russia. There are no legal or any other obstacles to this.
We are interested in positive discussions and solutions of problems when
they arise, not in propaganda. Those days are gone.

This, says Mr Kopper, sitting in his eyrie at the top of one of the bank's
frosty-blue twin skyscrapers in the heart of Frankfurt, is a typically
overdone reaction.
'When something like this starts to happen - when the downturn begins to
hurt - we Germans suffer from some specially Teutonic symptoms. We tend to
panic, to get hysterical. But it isn't as bad as that.
'It's difficult out there, but I know we'll solve it. I'm sure that the mood
is already changing.'
Mr Kopper, appointed chief executive of Germany's biggest bank just over
three years ago, says it is not surprising that Germans have become morose
about the economy. He believes it is labouring under a triple burden.
First, industry is suffering from a cyclical downturn - delayed by two years
of rapid expansion fuelled by reunification. Deutsche Bank forecasts that
western German gross domestic product is likely to fall by between 1.5 and 2
per cent this year.
'The downturn came about so quickly (in the autumn of last year), and the
problem was made that much bigger in September because of the currency
market turmoil, which, via the appreciation of the D-Mark, built another
hurdle for German industry,' he says.
Second, there are renewed concerns about Standort Deutschland - Germany as a
place to do business. 'This has resurfaced in a vigorous way, after being
submerged for a while under post-reunification euphoria,' Mr Kopper says.
'It involves everything - taxes, ecology, innovation policy, wage costs.'
Third, Germany is facing structural change - a need to reshape several
important industries. This challenge has become more pressing as a result of
the increased competition arising from the creation of a single European
market and from the penetration of low-cost imports from eastern Europe.
This is especially true, Kopper argues, in the steel sector where, along
with the UK, 'Germany is the only country in the EC to be facing a single
market very much on its own, without state subsidies'.
Solving all these problems at the same time will not be easy, Mr Kopper
concedes. Economic recovery will involve unpalatable measures, including
substantial job cuts across a broad swathe of industry.
'But there is a growing awareness that something has to be done, even among
union members,' he says.
'The problems will be solved, because they have to be solved. There is no
way round it. And it may do us some good. It will stop us from making
similar mistakes in the east of our country, from indulging in what I call
'monument protection' - support for smokestack industries.
'Success with restructuring in the west may give us an opportunity to
rethink some of the strategies developed by politicians for some of the old
industries in the new Bundeslander. We should seize the chance to use all
the money - currently intended to protect industrial dinosaurs  - to develop
new industries for the future.'
He believes that the country's politicians have made a significant
contribution to restoring confidence within Germany by successfully
negotiating a solidarity pact with unions and employers. This accord,
concluded last weekend, includes limits for wage increases, government
spending and financial support for eastern Germany. It is described by Mr
Kopper as 'a great step forward'.
He does, however, have reservations. He is disappointed that the pact
included no real cuts in government spending. But he declines to go into
detail about where he thinks the cuts should have been made.
It is likely, however, that Mr Kopper has voiced detailed views on the pact
to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Like most of his predecessors at the head of
Germany's most powerful financial institution, he has the ear of the
country's leader on issues of economic policy.
Potentially more significant for the reshaping of German industry, however,
is the influence wielded by the bank through its web of industrial holdings.
These include a 28 per cent stake in Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest
industrial company, as well as 30 per cent of Philip Holzmann, the
construction company, and 10 per cent of Allianz, Europe's largest insurance
group.
That influence is consolidated by a network of supervisory board
directorships held by Deutsche Bank's 13-member management board. In total,
Deutsche Bank board members hold more than 100 seats on German companies'
supervisory boards - bodies which appoint and oversee company management.
These investment holdings and management relationships are complemented by
Deutsche Bank's financial strength. Its profits, which will be announced
later this month, are expected to be about DM5.66bn (Pounds 2.4bn) - larger
than the combined profits of the three next largest German banks.
Critics say that such strength gives Deutsche Bank an excessive influence in
German industry and its current restructuring.
But Mr Kopper rejects such views. 'We take our part in finding and
implementing industrial solutions and in making those solutions work. It is
not our aim to make industrial policy,' he insists. 'That's what industry
must do for itself.'
He cites the case of Klockner Werke, the steel group which last December
became the largest German company in more than a decade to file for
protection from its creditors. Deutsche Bank, its largest creditor and
'house bank', devised the financial aspects of the company's survival plan.
But Mr Kopper insisted that the 'managers must set the plan in motion
themselves'.
An even more significant corporate relationship is with Daimler-Benz, the
country's biggest industrial group. The company's core automobile business
is suffering a sharp downturn and - in the minds of industry analysts at
least - there are serious question marks over the strategy of Mr Edzard
Reuter, the chief executive who is seeking to build a broadly diversified
'technology' conglomerate.
Mr Kopper says Deutsche Bank is not concerned with the details of the
current restructuring at Daimler, which involves sharp job cuts and a change
in strategy for Mercedes-Benz - the group's main profit source.
'We've had the Daimler stake for over 60 years and it's not our view to buy
today and sell tomorrow,' he says. 'That's why we can take such a hands-off
approach. Daimler is like a fund managing assets for us, of which we own a
certain part. As the largest shareholder, we like to select the fund
manager.
'As long as we're happy with what we see there, we'll stay out,' he says.
Is he happy? 'I am happy,' Kopper growls. 'If I weren't, I wouldn't be
non-executive chairman. And Edzard Reuter would not be chief executive.'

<TEXT>
Sir, The article on the effect of the changes in Advance Corporation Tax on
PEPs is misleading, especially with regard to unit trust PEPs ('ACT changes
may hit PEP sales', March 18).
The changes will not 'make PEPs particularly unattractive to basic-rate
taxpayers'. If nothing else changes, the yield on a PEP might fall from 5
per cent to 4.69 per cent. That yield would still remain competitive with
building society rates and is received gross by any taxpayer.
To suggest that these hypothetical changes at the margin will suddenly mean
that PEP changes will neutralise the benefits of PEPs is wrong, certainly so
far as unit trust PEPs are concerned. The yield on unit trust PEPs is quoted
after charges.
More importantly, the article is wholly hypothetical. We do not know how
companies will react; we do not know how fund managers will react. As Lex
pointed out, companies may come under pressure to increase dividend
payments; fund managers may switch into higher-yielding shares, such as
utilities; PEP managers may increase the weight of bonds in the portfolio.
Any of these changes would undermine the premises of the article. Indeed,
they could increase the yield of PEPs.
Investors should continue to consider unit trust PEPs wherever they are
concerned with long-term saving. Indeed, for higher-rate taxpayers the
advantages of PEPs have been enhanced. They should ignore the worst-case
forecasts and watch the reaction in the real world.

<TEXT>
Sir, Norman Lamont must be congratulated on the skill with which he has
increased the effective burden of tax on corporate dividends while
presenting his proposals as a possible 'solution' to the problems of Advance
Corporation Tax for which the Confederation of British Industry and others
have lobbied hard and long.
His two proposals are: (a) to reduce the rate of ACT from 25 per cent to
22.5 per cent from April 5 1993 and 20 per cent from April 5 1994; and (b)
to introduce a scheme for 'foreign income dividends' (FID) whereby dividends
can be paid effectively without ACT if they are paid out of foreign income
on which no UK corporation tax is paid.
These proposals are described as giving the corporate sector a cash flow
benefit of Pounds 2bn, reducing the surplus ACT problem by Pounds 300m and
at the same time raising revenue from 1995-96 onwards by Pounds 1bn. It
would be good news indeed if such benefits arise.
A closer examination, however, reveals that it is not that easy. By reducing
the rate of ACT which can be recovered from the company's own liability to
corporation tax this stroke of the pen reduces the gross income of the
shareholders and, if the shareholders insist on their income being restored
by payment of higher dividends, the Pounds 2bn of cash flow benefits will
disappear and reappear as a Pounds 1bn cost.
Commonsense would seem to indicate that the market will downgrade companies
which do not make up the difference.
Much the same point can be made about the FID proposal. A company paying an
FID can claim back the ACT paid on the FID but the recipient shareholder
will get no credit. The pension and other exempt funds which dominate the
market can now recover this credit. They will not appreciate companies which
pay FIDs unless additional dividends are paid to make up the lost credit. In
this event the benefits of paying FIDs disappear.
These are impressive conjuring tricks. The truth is that by reducing the
rate of ACT by 5 per cent the chancellor has increased the tax on
shareholders and their companies by the same amount. He has reduced the
amount of the company's tax liability that can be used as a credit by the
shareholders. It is all done by mirrors.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Arts: Festival of Britten with the Nash - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nash Ensemble's programme in the Festival of Britten may have looked
like a filler, but it certainly did not feel lightweight in the event.
Rather than relax when they approached small-scale works, both Britten and
Shostakovich were as likely just to compress serious thoughts into a more
concentrated space.
The only joviality on Tuesday at the Barbican Hall came at the beginning. In
1939 Britten supplied incidental music for a BBC radio adaptation of TH
White's The Sword in the Stone. The music must have been long forgotten by
the time two present-day composers, Oliver Knussen and Colin Matthews, dug
it out to compile a suite ten years ago, but it was a minor piece of
archaeology worth undertaking.
This is in no way a great score, not even important; but it is difficult to
escape the feeling that Britten was actually enjoying himself. The
cock-a-snook parody of famous motifs from Wagner is amusing given the book
(the film score to Excalibur hit upon the same idea without the laughs) and
there is enjoyment, too, in his use of the chamber ensemble. At this point
in his career there was no keeping Britten's inventiveness down.
The other Britten piece came from the end of his life: Phaedra, the solo
cantata written for Janet Baker, when the composer's energies could not
stretch to the opera which was her due. Its intensity, compressing Phaedra's
life experience into 15 minutes, was perfectly conceived for the work's
creator; less so perhaps for Jean Rigby, although her fine vocal dignity and
sense of deep emotion honestly conveyed brought their own rewards.
One problem was the need for clearer words, as earlier in Shostakovich's
Seven Romances on poems by Alexander Blok. (The Barbican is a difficult
venue for intimate works.) Joan Rodgers was the soprano in the Shostakovich,
not demanding attention as Vishnevskaya used to, but seducing the listener
with more suppliant tone. The music seemed here less hard, less
uncompromising than before; it is in any case not the composer's most
memorable.
As always, the Nash Ensemble deserves praise, both for its playing and the
imaginative programming. Trios by Debussy and Ravel, familiar Nash
territory, completed a generous evening's music, but how diffuse seemed the
Debussy, how uncharacteristically magniloquent the Ravel, in comparison.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Arts: Marc Laforet - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This pianist, Paris-born but 'of Russian descent', was Silver Medallist at
the 1985 Chopin Competition in Warsaw, when he was 18. The programme for his
Wigmore Hall debut on Wednesday was all Chopin, no doubt like a great many
of his recital-programmes since Warsaw. On the Wigmore evidence, Laforet is
plainly a good Chopinian at heart - but his execution slides too easily now
into fulsome routine. A personal moratorium on Chopin for a couple of years
might pay inspiriting dividends for him.
He may not have done himself justice in the Wigmore. His keyboard attack was
scaled to a much larger auditorium: though he never pounded, one soon felt
starved for some real pianissimo, which never came. Every tune was
plonkingly set out - with affection, certainly, but with a forthright
insistence that became tiresome; and often it submerged the ever-fresh
delights of Chopin's figuration.
So did a heavy hand in the bass, compounded with Laforet's penchant for the
sustaining pedal (before long one felt starved for some clean, dry sounds
too). In several of the 24 Preludes op. 28, the dense lower resonances
swallowed up anything ingenious that he might have been doing in the treble
range. Yet his left hand could scamper through the semiquavers of the
Prelude in G without pedal-feints, to bright, springy effect; we wanted much
more of that. In the event the marvellous variety of the Preludes was
severely shrunken. He did strike a vein of live drama for the very last
prelude, but it came too late.
If Laforet's actual playing sounded too much of an orotund muchness, there
was no mistaking his sympathetic grasp of Chopin's dramatic structures. He
knows very well where their nodes are located; he never failed to signal
crucial contrasts and turning-points. All that we missed was spontaneity,
fantasy, a sense of moment-to-moment re-creation. The B minor Sonata marked
a low point, with every small section faithfully spelled out but no incisive
larger trajectory, nor - in the Scherzo or the Finale - anything more than
beta-plus brilliance.
Before that, he had fixed properly pungent characters for four of the
Mazurkas (at Warsaw he won the special Mazurka Prize), though they came
rather near to sounding like French valses. The most intriguing exhibit in
Laforet's programme was his first, the A-flat Impromptu, in which he allowed
himself a shamelessly wayward rubato of the most period-winsome kind, but
knowing. That sounded like the real thing.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Arts: The Comedy of Errors - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like it or loathe it, director Gerard Stembridge's attack on Shakespeare on
the stage of Ireland's National Theatre is too savage to be ignored. I
loathed it.
The Abbey has not had a shot at Shakespeare since 1984. In Stembridge they
have chosen a director who is best known for television satire and recently
produced a witty and polished version of Haydn's La vera costanza. His
Comedy of Errors is set in country-and-western mode, the women sub-Dolly
Partons in sequins and diamante, the male leads in cheap singing-cowboy
suits. The set, by Monica Frawley (who also designed the costumes) and
Joanna Taylor is a sickly shade of deep pink, and features a clapped-out
Mini. The alley of small shops, brothel and hotel would be ideal for one of
Tennessee Williams's seedier plays.
This is one of Shakespeare's early and lesser comedies, featuring two sets
of twins, the gentlemen Antipholus and their servants Dromio, and a
convoluted series of mistaken identities. The verse is not Shakespeare's
best, but it does occasionally sparkle, and there is more to the play in
terms of intellectual content than is sometimes acknowledged. Because the
plot is so far-fatched it must be played at a cracking pace, and this at
least the Abbey cast achieve.
It is a play that lends itself to exuberant expressions of fun. A Stratford
production as far back as 1938 used song and ballet to fend off tedium, and
costumes from a mixture of periods. So when the Abbey actors reach for a
microphone and croon their couplets to a country music waltz they are within
a recognisable tradition. The trouble is that whether spoken or sung, the
lines are garbled, delivered in such strangulated tones that they are well
nigh incomprehensible. The blame does not lie in the mix of Irish and
American accents. The problem is that, with the shining exception of Aidan
McArdle's Dromio, nobody seems to have the faintest idea how to speak blank
verse.
Not surprisingly then, with this disregarded for words, the higher concerns
of the play, its exploration of identity, are lost, and what remains is
slapstick and farce. The servant twins, Dromio, steal the play from their
masters, Mikael Murfi showing himself as a consummate clown, with Aidan
McArdle keeping pace.
The problem with the production is one of pitch. It is not necessary to have
recourse to the vulgarity of the country music scene and crude visual jokes
(chain saws in place of drawn swords for example) to prove that Shakespeare
is not stuffy and boring. To choose the tattiest culture available as a way
of making Shakespeare palatable to a new audience is ultimately
condescending and insulting. He is not that difficult, but anyone unlucky
enough to be introduced to Shakespeare by this production will be baffled as
to how he got his reputation.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Arts: Monteverdi and Bluebeard - Opera double-bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ideal opera-house pairing for Bluebeard's Castle is surely more Bartok -
one of the ballets, either The Wooden Prince (with which Bluebeard was
coupled at its premiere) or The Miraculous Mandarin, which explores similar
themes of sexual dependency. For a company like English National Opera
without a resident ballet the choice becomes more difficult: Schoenberg's
monodrama Erwartung, instant box-office death, has been tried in the past,
and when David Alden's finely disciplined and severe production of Bluebeard
first appeared at the Coliseum two years ago it followed a bilious version
of Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex.
For the revival Oedipus has mercifully been abandoned, replaced by a
Monteverdi confection based upon The Duel of Tancredi and Clorinda, that
vivid, unclassifiable theatre piece published in the Eighth Book of
Madrigals in 1638. At its performance in Venice 14 years earlier, Tancredi
and Clorinda was prefaced by a group of Monteverdi's songs and madrigals,
and the same plan is followed at the Coliseum: five numbers, written in the
1620s and '30s and all sung in Anne Ridler's neat, witty translations, have
been integrated into a single dramatic package by Alden and his designer
Nigel Lowery.
One wishes the scheme had worked musically or dramatically, for such an
undeniably powerful and enduring vision of Bluebeard's Castle deserves a
viable and engaging prologue. The result is anything but viable or engaging;
the dramatic treatment of the sequence seems at best negligible and the
performances are adequate rather than outstanding. Alden presents a vaguely
late 20th-century setting and concocts an equally tenuous ritual involving
three singers in which the explicit musical confrontation of Tancredi
attempts to crystallise the tensions set up so self-consciously during the
madrigal sequence.
Paul Nilon, kitted out in some decidedly unbecoming long shorts, is the
Tancredi narrator, Christopher Ventris and Patricia Rozario the
protagonists; Harry Bicket conducts an on-stage ensemble. While all sang and
played decently enough, there was little sense of period style or lyrical
intensity or any feeling that there was any dramatic, musical or
psychological point to be made, only the need to fill 50 minutes before the
main business of the evening.
The Bartok at least fulfilled expectations. The production remains a
triumph, even though Adam Fischer's handling of the score does not have
quite the telling intensity and radiance that Mark Elder brought to it first
time around. Sally Burgess and Gwynne Howell repeat their roles; both in
their different ways have developed and strengthened them. Howell's
Bluebeard is yet more desperate, more impotent; brute power is clearly all
that is left within his human shell. Burgess's Judith is obsessively fixed
on self-destruction, unable to resist the compulsion to know everything and
so dominate her new husband the more completely. The clarity of their
singing is exemplary. There is a new narrator, Imogen Claire, who delivers
the spoken prologue rather more archly than her predecessor, but then
Alden's fussy handling of the fore-play is the only miscalculation in what
remains a spell-binding piece of stage craft.

If you are more interested in the arts than in American movies, American
comedies, or steam train drama (a repeat of All Creatures Great And Small on
BBC1, and another episode in the new series of Doctor Finlay on ITV) there
is only one programme for you on television tonight: Arena. This, too, has
an American subject: writer Philip Roth, still best known to British readers
for his 1969 novel, Portnoy's Complaint. Previously Roth has tended to stay
off the promotion circuit but now, having written a new book, Operation
Shylock, he is putting himself about like all the others (9.30 BBC1). On
radio, however, there is much wider choice. On Radio 2's Arts Programme
(10.00), Austin Mitchell visits Durham Cathedral which has been declared a
World Heritage Site. Radio 3 offers Strange Meeting in which Russell Davies
considers the achievements of Wilfred Owen who was born 100 years ago and
died at the Sambre Canal in 1918 one week before the armistice (10.45). And
on Radio 4 in Kaleidoscope Roddy Doyle talks about his new book, Paddy
Clarke Ha Ha Ha which draws on his childhood in the 1960s (9.15).

FT  19 MAR 93 / Management: On the shelf at 45 - Many employers appear
opposed to recruiting older staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone born much before 1950 is battling against stiff odds in the UK jobs
market. In some sectors even those born in the early 1960s are running into
trouble.
Evidence of widespread opposition by employers to recruiting older staff
came this week, with the publication of a survey of job advertisements by
the independent research group Industrial Relations Services. It found that
almost a third of advertisers specified an age bar, an increase from a
quarter four years ago. Of those that stated a preference, four out of five
wanted someone under the age of 45.
A newspaper advertisement by financial services company Laurentian Milldon
this week is not untypical. Advertising a sales job, it begins: 'Are you
aged 24-36, ambitious, energetic, a good communicator?' It finishes a touch
unconvincingly: 'We are an equal opportunity employer.'
Ageism is against the law in the US - but unlike racism and sexism it is not
outlawed in job selection in the UK. Inquiries by the FT this week confirm
the cult of youth is on the rise in most sectors and at most levels within
UK companies.
Cost is the most obvious incentive for hiring younger employees, although
Marc Thompson, research fellow at Sussex University's Institute of Manpower
Studies, sees pay as less of a reason these days for going for the under
45s. Performance-based pay systems are taking over from age-based ones in
many companies, he says. Thompson's research shows many objections to older
workers - such as the fear that any pay-back period on training will be too
short for older recruits - are not grounded in fact. Older employees may be
better timekeepers, take less time off and stay longer in their jobs.
Clearly not everyone is convinced. Jerry Turner from Laurentian Milldon
says: 'By and large, 24-36 is the client base age range they'll be selling
to - there's generally an affinity between people of a common age. Also, I
hate to say this, but people above that age don't have the bottle for the
job.'
Older middle managers are also liable to be cold-shouldered. The publishing
company Cornhill Publications believes that in general older managers do not
fit in with its young culture. Cornhill employs about 130 staff, mainly in
telesales. Most managers are in their mid-20s to early 30s. Simone Kesseler,
aged 30, Cornhill's business development director, said: 'It really isn't a
conscious rule, it's not really set in stone. It just happens that this is
the kind of business that attracts young people and they perform better in
this environment.'
Not surprisingly, the same attitude is prevalent in the computer industry
and in City dealing rooms. 'It is de rigueur that people recruited in the
derivatives industry are not only sub-45, but sub-35,' said Roger Steare, a
director of Jonathan Wren, the city recruitment consultancy. Given that the
derivatives market only got going in the last 10 years, the oldest of them
are in their mid-30s.
In banking, too, there may have even been a slight decrease in the average
age of staff. 'Firms are prepared to buy a little less experience to save a
little money,' says Steare.
He knows of cases where staff in their early 40s had been 'made redundant'
and replaced by people five years younger and cheaper.
IT companies and recruitment agencies deny they are discriminating against
age per se. Russell Clements, director of the IT recruitment consultants
Computer Futures, admits that advertisements often carry age specifications.
However, he stresses this only occurs when the company actually demands it.
He adds: 'When it's specified it reflects a degree of honesty.'
In the case of a maximum age limit, he adds, what is at stake is technical
know-how. The older ex-managers who fail to get basic computing jobs they
apply for are, he says, unreasonable to assume that age requirements were
the only factor. 'Age gets used as an excuse. It is very difficult to
separate the fact that those people who are older often don't have the right
experience.'
Age bars are often explicit in secretarial jobs. Debra Allcock, head of the
Industrial Society's secretarial development programme, is a former
secretary and has seen 'time and time again, those who are 40-plus having a
lot more difficulty getting jobs, even if they are highly skilled'. The very
senior secretaries working for chairmen and chief executives, may be older,
she says: 'But middle managers will often go for very young, glamorous
secretaries, particularly if they are recruiting themselves. It happens less
often if personnel departments are appointing.'
In a recent issue of the London Evening Standard, Centre Point Bureau had
three advertisements for secretarial staff, one specifying an age of 20-24,
the second for a 20-23-year-old, and the third for someone aged 24-28. The
reason for stating the age required, said the agency, is that: 'Age depicts
salary and the style of the department you're going in to.' On another
occasion they could equally have been looking for older secretaries, says
the bureau.
Reed employment agencies offers a 50 per cent discount on their fee to
employers taking on workers aged over 50. 'It's not that we think older
workers are worth less. But we had been coming up against companies who were
saying they didn't want to consider the CVs of anyone over 50,' says the
company.
It is not all bad news, however. Occasionally, the tables will be turned and
the older employee will find herself positively sought after. Wine merchants
Corney and Barrow recently advertising for 'a paragon to fill the enormous
gap which will arise when our telephonist/receptionist/clerical assistant
retires in May'. The advertisement added: 'Preference will be given to
mature applicants.'
Chris Trott, aged 58, a senior executive at Chusid Lander, the career
consultancy, believes employers are becoming more sympathetic to the idea of
the middle-aged manager.
'On the whole 'management' is becoming younger and younger. My impression
is, however, that a lot of employers have found they have discarded a lot of
experience as they discarded older people.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / People: Goold quits Whitecroft after 24 years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After 24 years with the company, the last two as executive chairman, Peter
Goold is to leave the board of Whitecroft, the mini-conglomerate, next
Monday.
Since 1990 profits, the share price, dividends and payrolls have tumbled as
the Wilmslow-based group restructured to survive the recession, after being
caught badly exposed in property markets.
David Kendall, chairman of Bunzl, will succeed Goold in a non-executive
capacity. Mike Derbyshire - a former Norcros senior manager brought in by
Goold as managing director a year ago - will step up to chief executive.
Martyn Ellis joined as finance director a few weeks ago.
Goold, 49, became chairman in 1990, with property prices tumbling and
Whitecroft overgeared. In the 1980s, the group had developed medium-sized or
smaller complexes of shops and offices, mainly in the Thames Valley, and had
gone into house building.
But it has since disengaged from property, house-building, double-glazing,
conservatories and engineering. The workforce has been cut from more than
3,000 when Goold became chairman to about 1,930 now, and Whitecroft is down
to four sound or promising businesses - lighting for factories and offices,
medical cotton fibre, specialised textiles and fire-resistant doors.
Goold developed a strategy of warning the City of bad news a week or so in
advance to minimise impact.
When Wriddinghitecroft finally fell into loss - on its interims to last
September - this was mitigated by being slightly less than he had led
investors to fear.
The share price, however, has been sliding for some time - tumbling last
year from 131p to 72p in a few days. It closed 1 1/2 p higher yesterday at
38p.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Management: The transnational's identity crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERFUL new management concepts tend to go through a natural but
unfortunate cycle. At first they are applied with care by an informed
minority. But then, as word spreads, they are seized upon with abandon and
taken to extremes, often becoming distorted.
So if the progenitors of a concept want to stop their brainchild getting a
bad name, they need to take corrective action rapidly.
With its famous but overworked 'cash cow' portfolio planning matrix in the
1970s, the Boston Consulting Group acted several years too late. But in the
mid-1980s, with his gospel of the 'globalisation of markets' and products
still freshly minted, Harvard's Theodore Levitt was much quicker to correct
the exaggeration of his disciples - including the Saatchi brothers - about
the 'homogenisation' of everything.
Now nearly as rapid remedial action has been taken by one of the fathers of
the most powerful current concept of global organisation: that of the
'transnational' company, otherwise known as the 'globally integrated
network' or, more loosely, the 'global web'.
All three names are equally ungainly. But the concept has caught hold
rapidly. Companies as different as Unilever, IBM, Monsanto, SKF and - more
tentatively, Sony and Honda - have started to embrace it as superior both to
the sort of centralised 'global' structure of most Japanese and some
American enterprises, and to the much looser 'multinational' typified in the
past by many European companies - including Unilever.
Far-sighted government advisers have also seized upon the 'transnational' as
the most likely form of international company with which they will have to
negotiate in the 21st century.
The trouble is that other companies and some academics - notably Robert
Reich, an influential Harvard economics professor who is now a member of
President Clinton's cabinet - have taken the concept too far, claiming that
it is becoming the only way for every large international company to
organise itself in the future, irrespective of its industrial or market
context.
Put simply - though the whole point of such organisations is that they need
to be far from simple - a 'transnational' is a company which shares internal
power between its units around the world, instead of continuing to hog it
all to its home country.
Like many companies these days, a transnational implements the fashionable
process of 'global localisation': it disperses around the world not only its
local sales and distribution, and some manufacturing, but also a degree of
research, design and development.
But it goes much further than that. It neither controls all these activities
rigidly from its home country, as 'global' companies do, nor does it allow
each national or regional operation virtual independence, as in a
traditional European 'multinational'. Instead, it disperses some of the
global control over these activities.
This is usually done for individual product divisions - as with Monsanto's
shift of its global resins headquarters from Missouri to Belgium, or IBM's
move of its network systems business to Britain. But some companies, such as
ABB, also operate part of their group head office in this fashion.
Within transnationals, almost no two divisions are organised in the same
way; thus Unilever's detergents business is now much more centralised than
foods.
The purpose of such a highly differentiated structure is for each division
and product line to gain the best of two worlds: the economies of scale to
be achieved through what academics call 'global integration'; and the
apparently contrary pressures for maximum responsiveness to differences in
national markets. The ideal balance between these pressures varies between
industries, divisions and even between product lines in one division.
The complexity of this concept is its advantage, in other words. But it is
also its drawback, especially when managers or academics try to apply it to
companies operating in less complex industries and markets than the likes of
Unilever and Monsanto. Robert Reich is a prime offender; his mistaken
advocacy of the 'global web' as a universal panacea has fuelled criticism of
the whole idea.
Hence a thorough corrective in the latest Sloan Management Review* from
Sumantra Ghoshal, a professor at Insead in France who created the
'transnational' concept with Christopher Bartlett, a Harvard professor.
Far from advocating the transnational structure as a universal solution,
says Ghoshal, they have argued repeatedly that it should be used only by
companies operating in highly complex business environments, where 'global',
'multinational' and 'local' structures are inappropriate.
Transnationals tend to be best suited to industries such as computers,
telecommunications, cars and pharmaceuticals and photographic equipment, he
suggests. They are least suitable in metals, textiles, printing and
publishing.
Just as one company can suffer from too simple an organisation if it is in a
complex and turbulent environment, another 'can pay an efficiency penalty
for adopting an organisation too complex for its environmental demands',
continues Ghoshal. Organisational complexity is costly and difficult to
manage, he admits and companies must simplify wherever they can.
The article gives plenty of practical advice on this. With a myriad of
matrices and circle diagrams, it is not an easy read. But nor is the
'transnational' the simple, all-purpose animal which some powerful people
seem to think.

FT  19 MAR 93 / People: Riddell for Invesco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Some people say you should never go back,' says Norman Riddell, 'but it
worked well for me once before.'
The new 45-year-old chief executive of Invesco MIM's UK and European
operations, replacing Nicholas Johnson who resigned over policy differences
in December, is an old Britannia hand himself.
He left in 1986, before the link-up with MIM and Invesco, but will still
recognise one or two faces on the board of the now much-enlarged fund
management group, notably Lord Rippon, one-time Britannia Arrow Holdings
chairman.
But the first time he returned to familiar territory was in 1987 when he set
up Capital House Investment Management for the Royal Bank of Scotland, his
first employer when he left school.
Riddell says he had already achieved a lot at Capital House, where he
started as the first employee shortly before the 1987 crash.
Funds of Pounds 1.4bn have now grown to Pounds 4.4bn - still, however,
nowhere near critical mass for a competitive fund management business.
'In a sense the fun part starts now - Capital won its first Pounds 100m
account only last week.'
But apparently the Invesco job, 'coming out of the blue', was too good to
resist. Despite the blight on the UK business, including the Maxwell
involvement as well as a long-running investigation by the self-regulatory
body Imro, he is attracted by a bigger company and 'a more global business'.
Invesco manages Pounds 40bn of assets worldwide, although only Pounds 7bn
fall in Riddell's new area.
He thinks he will get on well with his bosses in Atlanta, Georgia, despite
the unpromising first approach by chief executive Charles Brady which took
place over an 8am breakfast - on a Saturday. And he tries to appear
unconcerned by the Imro investigation: 'There are risks inherent in any new
position.'
While the Royal Bank has sold its merchant banking arm Charterhouse, he
stresses there are no such plans for Capital House.
Paul Field, 47, currently managing director of the retail operations at
Capital, was yesterday named as his successor.
