FT  19 MAR 93 / People: Cadbury Schweppes picks again from family pack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a four-year gap there will soon be a Cadbury back in the chairman's
seat at Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks firm. Dominic
Cadbury, the 52-year-old chief executive, will take over as executive
chairman from Sir Graham Day in May.
Cadbury, who joined the family firm five years before its 1969 merger with
Schweppes, has been chief executive since 1984, and is following his father,
grandfather and great-grandfather, as well as his brother, Sir Adrian
Cadbury, into the chairman's office.
Although Cadbury Schweppes is no longer a family firm, and Dominic Cadbury's
stake in the business is small, his elevation to the chairmanship could
raise a few eyebrows. Unlike Sir Graham Day, who turns 60 in May, Dominic
Cadbury will be an executive chairman and will have a group chief executive,
David Wellings, 52, who has been running the confectionary business since
1989.
However, Cadbury says that the two jobs are quite different. 'As chief
executive I would be seen as very much a hands-on businessman, I would not
expect to be that as chairman.'
David Wellings will be the 'ultimate decision maker, it would not work
otherwise'.
As a full-time chairman, Cadbury expects to help share the heavy travelling
and presentational burdens which fall on a ceo's shoulders.
Wellings has spent less time at the top of Cadbury Schweppes than Frank
Swann and Derek Williams, two other contenders for the ceo's job.
Having started his career with Cadbury Brothers in 1962, he spent 18 years
outside the group before rejoining in 1986 as managing director of Cadbury
in the UK.
David Lang, Henderson Crosthwaite's long-time Cadbury-watcher, is slightly
surprised at the timing of Dominic Cadbury's promotion but believes that it
is well-earned, nonetheless.
'He took over a company that was running out of gas and had serious problems
in North America. He has reshaped it and fought off an unwelcome predator.'
Despite the family connections, Lang describes Cadbury as a 'good team
player' who has surrounded himself with 'successful people'.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Technology: Sudden death of a runaway bull - The Taurus
project was blighted by misjudgment, mismanagement and neglect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a form of collective madness. The City's biggest computer project,
Taurus, cost hundreds of millions of pounds and kept computer departments in
the financial industry busy for years. But just a week after it was killed
off, no one in the City can think of any good reasons why it was being built
at all.
'It was a case of widespread myopia,' says one senior banker with a close
involvement in the Taurus project.
'We should have stood back more and taken a broader look,' says Patrick
Mitford-Slade, chairman of the committee that devised the system.
A London Stock Exchange executive close to the project adds that the
'uncritical acceptance of received wisdom' throughout the securities
industry meant that, once started, the project acquired a life of its own.
Last week, the illusion was shattered. Peter Rawlins, the exchange's chief
executive, called a halt to the project which was meant to automate the
ownership and transfer of shareholdings.
He paid for the exchange's mismanagement of Taurus with his job; but the
ramifications of the failure extend well beyond the badly battered and
demoralised exchange. At issue, say executives inside and outside the
exchange, is how the City reaches agreement on industry-wide issues. The
short-term self-interest of particular groups helped to turn the Taurus
project into a technologist's nightmare. Where is the leadership in the City
to prevent the same thing happening again?
Extensive interviews with people close to the Taurus project reveal a
sequence of misjudgment, mismanagement and neglect. No one was in overall
charge of a project which was set to overturn the legal and regulatory
foundations of the stock market, as well as its technological base. Most of
the people closely associated with the system's conception admit to
fundamental errors of judgment.
The full extent of the problems became clear to the stock exchange's board
only last week - five years after the project started in earnest and more
than a decade since it was first proposed. Taurus (which stands for the
Transfer and Automated Registration of Uncertificated Stock) was conceived
in the early 1980s, though it was the settlements crisis of 1987 that
provided the real impetus to the system.
The idea of a 'dematerialised' settlement system - in which share
certificates were to be scrapped, and share transfers handled by book entry
on computer - grew out of the exchange's successful Talisman project. In
1979, this batch-processing system had automated the settlement process
between stock jobbers (the precursors of today's marketmakers).
By 1981, the exchange proposed extending the idea to the market as a whole.
But its idea - a central computer to maintain all records of shareholdings -
was rejected by the registrars who are paid to maintain share registers for
listed companies, and who would have been put out of business by the
development.
'It didn't occur to us that what we should have done is go to the Bank of
England and say that there were too many conflicting interests for us to
handle,' says a senior exchange executive from that time. 'That was the
basic failure.'
This failure was to return to haunt the exchange six years later. By 1987,
the sharp increase in the number of share transactions, due largely to the
increase in trading by private investors of the new privatisation stocks,
had clogged up brokers' back offices, leading to a settlements crisis.
The banks which had taken over many of the City's leading stockbroking firms
a year before were appalled by what they found; to an industry accustomed to
mass processing of routine financial transactions, the mess in the
securities industry was shocking.
The exchange's response was to rekindle the idea of a central computer -
only to run into the same objections from the registrars. It was at this
stage that the Bank of England stepped in to try to promote an industry-wide
solution. Pen Kent, a Bank associate director, backed the formation of the
Siscot committee. Its brief was to hammer out a compromise which left no
particular interest group in the securities industry worse off than before.
The idea was fatally flawed. War broke out on the Siscot committee as rival
interest groups fought their corners. A number of concessions were made, all
of which turned Taurus into a highly complex system. 'This system wasn't
designed to meet multiple objectives - it was simply trying to avoid
clashing interests,' is the conclusion of one member of the industry-wide
Taurus monitoring group, set up in 1991 to review the project.
To complicate matters, the Department of Trade and Industry then imposed
constraints on the system which added to the technical problems that were to
follow. The key decisions were:
Siscot turned away from the idea of a central computer at the insistence of
Alex Tweedie, then director of Barclays global securities services division
and a member of the committee. The exchange also cooled to the idea,
calculating that it would cost Pounds 60m to build such a large database. It
would have required working close to the limits of the database technology
of the time, although systems experts reject suggestions that it was outside
the competence of the exchange's technical teams. They point out that
airlines and the big banks have extensive experience of systems of this
size.
Instead, Siscot proposed a series of distributed databases, linked together
by a communications network, with the exchange acting as a 'hub'. Market
intermediaries and service providers would then become 'Taurus Account
Controllers', each maintaining its own portion of the stock market.
Distributing databases, even today, is a complex task for experienced
systems integrators. The exchange, without experience, was proposing to
build a distributed database across 400 separate sites with a different
combination of hardware and software at each site.
For many listed companies, concerned in the late 1980s that they might be
the next victim in the UK's frenzied takeover boom, this posed a problem: if
records of their shareholders were scattered across a number of databases,
how could they tell who was buying their shares? The result was an
arrangement for companies to be able to search throughout the system, adding
to the complexity.
Private client stockbrokers argued that the nominee accounts in which all
shareholdings would be held would prevent private shareholders from
benefiting from the 'perks' that go with some shareholdings and from
receiving information from the companies they owned and voting at annual
meetings. The result was a concession that investors would still be able to
have their names on a company's share register, rather than simply being
pooled together with others in a nominee account. This 'name on register'
concept was also backed by listed companies and the DTI.
John Redwood, then minister for City affairs at the DTI, pushed for the
highest possible levels of investor protection from Taurus. This would have
included a Pounds 100m compensation fund - which the securities industry
could not find insurance backing for - and a hacker-proof communication
system.
Full encryption (security coding) was added, increasing the cost and adding
hugely to the complexity of construction and testing. The result was a
system as secure as the government's Cheltenham communications centre:
'Totally unnecessary,' a consultant sniffed.
By this stage, the project was ballooning out of control and no one was in
overall charge. This became clear during 1991, as the project became bogged
down in protracted talks between the exchange and the DTI over the legal
regulations that were to provide the framework for Taurus.
'It was a re-engineering of the legal and processing environment of share
transactions between all parties in the industry. No one was managing this
market project - the exchange was only concerned with getting its own system
working,' says a member of the Taurus monitoring group.
While the project was spiralling out of control, problems began to gather at
its heart, in the exchange's central computer development. The malaise and
constantly changing objectives in the project as a whole meant the exchange
was trying to build its core computer system on sand. Just how weak the
foundations were only became clear to the exchange's senior management in
the past six weeks.
'There were no redeeming features,' one computer specialist said, pointing
out that the exchange had broken virtually every rule of computer project
management during the five-year span of the project.
The errors which helped to consign Taurus to the scrapheap included:
The lack of an underlying architecture or logical design. Discussions with a
wide range of people involved in the project have revealed that the exchange
never completed a full design for its computer system - even though it
started industry-wide testing of some parts at the start of this year. The
core part of the system was never built and was only scheduled for
completion in the summer of this year - at the end, rather than the
beginning, of the development.
A number of core functions, such as overnight reconciliation of
shareholdings and the internal control procedures needed to ensure that the
entire network could operate effectively, had been labelled 'non-functioning
requirements' and were not due to be built until later this year.
Building a complex computer system requires a firm foundation in the shape
of an underlying design which sets out how and why the various elements of
the system are expected to work together. There was no such overall design
for Taurus; new elements were added on an apparently ad hoc basis.
'There was no operating architecture,' says one person close to the project.
'John (Watson) made no bones about it. He'd done it deliberately.' Driven by
a sense of urgency, and pressure from the securities industry, the project
team was striving first to complete the parts of the system that
communicated with brokers and others in the City.
A big error, in retrospect, was the decision to use as the heart of the new
software a computer package developed by Vista Concepts of New York. The
Vista product, a high-priced global custody system, is the market leader in
its field and has an excellent reputation.
There are simple rules for using computer packages, however, just as there
are for buying ready-made suits. Essentially, if extensive alterations are
needed, it is better to go bespoke. Up to 70 per cent of the Vista package
was being rewritten by separate teams working at the exchange in London and
in New York. Communication was poor: 'The London team never knew what they
were getting from New York until it arrived,' an exchange computer engineer
said.
The problems were compounded by the constant redefining of the project
requirements. The exchange paid Pounds 1m for the Vista package. Revisions
to it were projected to cost a further Pounds 4m, but by the end the
software had cost Pounds 14m and had still not been completed. Vista was
hired on a 'time and materials' contract rather than a fixed-price basis -
an arrangement now attacked by several exchange board members.
A second error was to attempt to shackle the modern, on-line, all-singing,
all-dancing Vista package to the 14-year-old Talisman software, used by the
exchange to clear bargains: 'You have to be careful with systems of that
age. Much of the software is unique or obsolete and will not tolerate
interference,' according to one expert.
Lack of effective project management. 'Whenever part of Taurus was late,' a
systems engineer recalled thoughtfully, 'it was always going to be delayed
by three months. Never a few days, never a week, always three months. It was
as if nobody really knew, but three months seemed enough time to put things
right.'
Large computer projects do not run themselves, anymore than buildings are
erected without architectural drawings and instructions. Taurus was built
nominally using a government rule-book or methodology called SSADM, which
specifies the steps that should be followed in the design of large computer
systems. It has been tried and tested on hundreds of computer projects.
Following the procedures in SSADM gives a project a good chance of success.
Yet it is clear that the Taurus team flouted the SSADM rules with abandon.
One expert said with horror: 'They were still specifying the operational
requirements of the system when they began testing - a cardinal sin.' It was
not entirely the fault of the Taurus team. The nature of the compromise
solution hammered out in the early stages meant all the participants felt
they had a right to demand changes, regardless of the project schedule.
No quality control. Computer systems engineers have their work checked by
independent consultants to ensure methodologies are being followed and
quality standards adhered to. Nobody seems to have overseen Taurus.
Why was the project allowed to run on for so long with no one in overall
control? The reason lies partly in the turmoil in the exchange in the past
three years, and partly in the failure by the securities industry at large
to take a firmer grip on the project.
The heads of computer departments across the City were deeply embroiled in
Taurus - and many moaned continually about the project - but few, if any,
ever called for a big rethink. 'Nobody was brave enough to stand up and say,
this doesn't make sense,' says a member of the Taurus monitoring group.
Among those with responsibility for overseeing the project were:
The exchange's settlements board, led by Rod Margree, an executive from
Barclays. Margree was brought in on secondment in early 1990 after Rawlins
told John Quinton, then chairman of Barclays, that the banks should become
more involved.
This was because dematerialisation under Taurus was intended as the first
step towards two other important objectives, both of which needed the closer
involvement of the banking industry - rolling settlement (when all
transactions are settled a set number of days after they take place) and
'delivery versus payment' (or DVP - the exchange of shares for cash, which
requires the integration of stock and cash clearing systems).
The settlements board was disbanded by Rawlins in 1992, along with the other
independent management boards he had set up in 1990, and Margree left the
exchange in August 1992.
The Taurus monitoring group, under Ian Cormack, head of the financial
institutions group at Citibank. Cormack's group included people with
extensive experience of technology projects in the securities industry,
including Mike Jones of Capel Cure Myers and Rab Harley of Kleinwort Benson.
The monitoring group met for just one and a half hours a month, too little
time to get deeply involved in such a complex project. The group expressed
its concerns in recent months to Watson and his project team. One member
recalls: 'They (the project team) said it couldn't be done in the timescales
 -they didn't say it hadn't even been started.'
A committee of the stock exchange board, known as the Taurus Review
Committee. Chaired by Peter Minchin of Lloyds Stockbrokers, the committee
included John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner of Cazenove, and Miles
Rivett-Carnac, who was this week appointed chairman of Baring Securities.
'The committee was only as good as the information it received,' one of its
members said. 'The non-executive board members could not delve into the
furthest corners of a project like this.'
A series of management consultancy firms pored over the project, though none
expressed serious reservations until recently. Touche Ross had been brought
in as a monitor for the project at the outset and helped to produce the cost
estimates used to justify the project. Its role was ended by Rawlins in
1990, who decided that the job done by the external monitors could equally
well be done by the exchange's management.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand supplied 18 staff on secondment to the project, led by
Watson. In the summer of 1991, when the concern of senior exchange
management was first aroused, a Coopers' consultant was asked to complete a
review of the project. His advice: that Taurus could still be completed,
with some management changes.
Senior partner Brandon Gough was also involved in discussions with the
exchange at that time - although Coopers now says that it never had any
direct involvement in the project, but was simply supplying consultants to
work under exchange supervision. In the spring of 1990, Coopers made Watson
a partner.
Stewart Senior, another Coopers consultant, was brought in to run the
technical side of the project at the start of this year. He advised the
series of tests under way should be suspended until the core of the
exchange's computer system was completed, a process which would take at
least 15 months. It was this information that finally persuaded Rawlins to
end the project.
Ernst &amp; Young was appointed to report to the DTI (and, later, the Treasury)
when the project was completed, to enable the government to allow officially
the system to go 'live'. It is thought to have had reservations about the
project for some time, though these were first expressed to the exchange
only in mid-February.
Concerns were first reported by an outside consultancy firm last autumn,
when Andersen Consulting - which would eventually have been required to run
the settlements system - was asked to review the project. It was this review
that revealed that there was no overall architecture for the Taurus system.
The exchange's senior management failed to take firm control of the project.
Between early 1990 - when he set up the settlement board - and the summer of
1991, Rawlins appears to have taken no interest in Taurus, which was to cost
his organisation Pounds 75m.
A member of the monitoring group recalls: 'There were times when Peter
seemed very half-hearted about the whole project.' When he finally took a
closer involvement, 18 months ago, Rawlins reviewed the project and decided
to go ahead, rather than scrap it at that stage.
When the recriminations have died down, the City will still be left with the
same problem it faced in the early 1980s: how to build a modern stock market
settlement system. For at least two reasons, the answer could be easier to
find this time around.
First, the trauma of Taurus is likely to make the various interest groups in
the City more conciliatory on the future development. However, the sound of
axes being ground is already being heard again in the City: custodians and
registrars arguing against a central registry, listed companies pushing for
greater visibility in their share registers, and private client brokers
saying that small investors should not suffer.
Second, the need for a system as complex as Taurus has disappeared. The back
offices of banks and securities houses have been overhauled in recent years
(much of the cost was incurred to prepare for Taurus), and market settlement
now runs far more efficiently. More private clients' shares are held in
nominees, reducing paperwork.
Also, share trading volumes have not risen inexorably, making a second
settlement crisis a distant fear. The next push, say custodians,
institutional investors and brokers, should be towards rolling settlement
and DVP.
However, the City must still find a new way to reach consensus on important
projects which are for the good of the financial industry as a whole.
Rawlins will not comment on the history of Taurus. But, looking forward, he
says: 'There is a real City management problem here. It could happen again
and will happen again.'

Peter Rawlins
A bright, iconoclastic young accountant, Rawlins was brought in as chief
executive of the Stock Exchange at the end of 1989 to cut its bureaucracy,
revamp its computer systems and find a new role for a venerable City
institution that many claimed had lost its way. He failed to give enough
attention early on to Taurus, which was begun before he arrived. It was not
until the autumn of 1992 that he switched his full attention to it. One
exchange board member says: 'Rawlins has done a good job in the last six
months getting to grips with it. But he made the mistake of relying for too
long on the project management team.
John Watson
As deputy chief executive of the exchange in the late 1970s, Watson had
developed the successful Talisman settlement system. A consultant (and made
a partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in 1990), he was brought in as project
manager of Taurus in the summer of 1989 and helped to forge a consensus in
the City by the end of that year. Critics claim now that he had no
experience of sufficiently large-scale technology projects. The project team
is also accused by Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the exchange, of
suffering from 'self-delusion' over the progress of the project.
John Redwood
An ambitious junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry until
last April, Redwood was responsible for the legislative and regulatory
framework for Taurus. His department's delay in drafting legal changes held
back the project. It also resulted in voluminous regulations that took the
many Taurus participants months to sift. Redwood also insisted on security
standards for the system that led the stock exchange into commissioning a
communications system from IBM that, it claimed, was the most secure
anywhere in the world outside the defence establishment.
Pen Kent
An associate director of the Bank of England, Kent took a close interest in
Taurus from the start. When banks came to the Bank of England in 1988,
complaining of the damage that could be done to their registration and
custody businesses by Taurus, Kent sponsored the setting up of an
industry-wide committee to find a way forward. Its brief was to find a
solution that was acceptable to all interest groups in the securities
industry, sowing the seeds for the compromise that followed. With the
collapse of Taurus, Kent moved quickly last week to set up a new task force
to find a way forward.

CHINA'S ATTEMPTS to undermine the position of Mr Chris Patten, the governor
of Hong Kong, were bluntly repudiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister,
yesterday.
He affirmed Britain's readiness for further talks with China without
preconditions, but told the Commons the government backed Mr Patten, who has
proposed democratic elections in the colony.
He said Mr Patten had acted 'sensitively, resolutely and correctly', and
assured MPs that Britain would continue to make this clear to China, which
is due to regain Hong Kong in 1997.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row looms on public-sector pay
limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is set to fight calls from Whitehall spending ministers for the
planned extension into next year of a tough squeeze on public-sector pay to
be imposed again through a formal and published pay ceiling.
Whitehall officials and senior ministers indicated yesterday that the
Treasury's spending plans for 1994-95 and 1995-96 would allow for an
increase in the public-sector wage bill of at most 2 per cent next year.
Some ministers believe that figure might come down towards zero in the next
few months as departments take on new spending commitments. The spending
ministers are arguing privately that the pay squeeze will be impossible to
enforce without a formal limit applying to all public-sector workers. But Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, plans to resist calls from colleagues in the
main spending departments for the present published 1.5 per cent pay ceiling
to be rolled over into 1994-95.
Mr Lamont will argue during this summer's public spending negotiations that
an unpublished Treasury ceiling for the overall wage bill should be met
through informal limits for each of the main departments. That would put the
onus on each department to strike a balance between wage re-straint, cuts in
capital programmes and job losses in areas such as the National Health
Service, schools, the police and the fire service.
The chancellor's stance appears to have set the stage for a political row
with some of his colleagues.
Last year spending ministers on the powerful EDX public expenditure cabinet
committee, charged with thrashing out the allocation of available funds,
pushed for the 1.5 per cent ceiling to be imposed for two years. Mr Lamont
succeeded then in restricting it to one year, but some of his colleagues are
arguing that the pressures on pay have intensified since that deal was
struck .
This week's Budget showed that Whitehall budgets in 1994-95 will be 0.25 per
cent lower in real terms than in the financial year which starts next month.
Unions representing public-sector workers reacted angrily to suggestions
that the government might set a pay ceiling for a second year.
Nalgo, the local government union, said: 'The government is storing up
enormous industrial problems for itself. 'Attempts to make public-sector
workers pay for the government's incompetent economic performance this year,
next year or any other year will not be tolerated.'
The Royal College of Nursing said the prime minister had made a clear
commitment to its pay review body to recommend pay levels in 1993-94. 'We
shall be holding him to that,' it said.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Budget package will help only 'one
in 30' on dole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will spend less than Pounds 1 extra a week on each of
Britain's unemployed as a result of the new measures in Tuesday's Budget,
Labour said yesterday.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, told MPs the new package would
help just one in 30 of those in Britain's dole queues.
He said that since Mr John Major's only Budget three years ago unemployment
had risen by 87 per cent and 9.5m people had experienced the pain of being
out of work. Unemployment was 'ruining the lives of 3m people and their
families and shattering the economy'.
In a wide-ranging dissection of the government's new proposals, Mr Dobson
nonetheless welcomed 'without reservation' yesterday's 22,000 fall in the
seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment figures.
Though the decline could be a freak, it was 'undoubtedly the only piece of
good news on unemployment for three years.
'If this is the start of a trend, it had better be an accelerating one
because at 22,000 a month it will take eleven years before all people out of
work are in work.'
On the specific steps outlined on Tuesday, Mr Dobson gave a guarded welcome
to the four Workstart pilot areas. These represent the government's first
acceptance of the principle of job subsidies to employers who take on the
unemployed.
But he said the great danger of the proposition was that employers might
simply substitute existing workers with those carrying the subsidy.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, who opened yesterday's debate,
was challenged by one of her own backbenchers on why Workstart - which will
initially involve 1,000 of those unemployed for more than two years at a
cost of Pounds 2.6m - did not go further.
Questioned by Labour on why the subsidy to employers had been pegged at
Pounds 60 a week, Mrs Shephard said a flat rate was easier to administer.
She said Tuesday's measures, costed at a net Pounds 125m, should be seen in
the context of the proposals announced in last year's Autumn Statement.
Welcoming the fall in the unemployment figures, she said it would help to
stimulate business confidence, especially as it had come so early in the
recovery cycle.
The number of unemployed people placed into new jobs by the Employment
Service was up on last year, while the number of people becoming newly
unemployed was down.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Details of Channel rail link
revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faced severe embarrassment over the Channel tunnel rail link
last night when Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, produced a
document setting out controversial details of almost the whole of the route.
Mr Prescott said the government appeared to have come up with a cheap plan
which would have serious consequences for the local environment.
The document - a copy of an insert due to run in the Kent Messenger
newspaper next week - shows that listed buildings and attractive woodlands
will be affected as well as houses and commercial property.
The highly detailed account of the route through Kent paints a picture of
widespread disruption to landscape features, some of which have been
untouched for many years.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, had originally been due to
announce the route the day after this week's Budget, in which Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, announced that the rail link would be financed
jointly by the public and private sectors.
The government had to postpone the announcement until next week, however,
following discussions with Labour, which was keen to avoid any delay in the
response to the Budget from Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor.
The leaked document spells out in full detail the entire route of the rail
link from the point where it crosses the Thames at Dartford to the entry to
the portals of the Channel tunnel at Cheriton on the Kent coast.
Examples of properties affected include commercial premises on Kent Kraft
Industrial Estate in Swanscombe, which will be lost, the clubhouse of Cobham
Park Golf Club, which will have to be relocated, and two listed buildings at
Brickton Farm, Charing Heath, which will have to be moved.
Other sites affected include Clay Ponds and Temple Woods, parts of a site of
special scientific interest, and the ancient woodland of Merrals Shaw, all
near Cobham, and the Donkey Shaw ancient woodland near Boxley.
Publication of the map in this fashion is likely to cause a furore in Kent,
where residents are acutely concerned about the effects of the line on their
property and the environment.
Mr Allan Prosser, editorial director of the Kent Messenger group, said the
article had been prepared with the co-operation of British Rail so readers
could be informed as quickly as possible after the government's announcement
how they would be affected.
He said the article was being prepared off-site by contract printers and was
the responsibility of Union Railways, the BR subsidiary responsible for the
rail link projects. 'No-one at the Kent Messenger group is responsible for
leaking that document,' Mr Prosser said.
Union Railways and the department of transport said they were not prepared
to comment until after Mr MacGregor made his announcement on the route next
week.
Mr Prescott put the cost of the leaked route at about Pounds 2.5bn, compared
with the Pounds 4.5bn previously suggested. The government appeared more
concerned with profit than meeting environmental considerations, he said.
He called for Mr MacGregor to make a Commons statement on the subject on
Monday.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Usdaw chiefs back reforms by Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAMPAIGN in the Labour party to introduce a one-member-one-vote (Omov)
system for the selection of parliamentary candidates achieved a significant
breakthrough when leaders of the shopworkers' union Usdaw came out in
favour.
This arrangement would replace the present system in which unions exercise a
direct vote in candidate selection through local electoral colleges
alongside individual members.
Usdaw's executive will recommend the change at the union's annual conference
in April. If carried, it will strengthen the chances of success for the
reform at Labour's conference in the autumn.
The change of union policy on reform will please Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, who also favours the reform and in the next few months will increase
pressure on other unions to support it. 'The outcome on Omov may now be too
close to call,' said one union official.
It is estimated that more than 1.5m union votes are committed to the new
system. It will be opposed by the Transport and General Workers, the
General, Municipal and Boilermakers and the Public Employees, which together
account formore than 2m votes.
The union block vote will fall from 89 per cent to 70 per cent at this
year's Labour conference, however, and the constituency parties are expected
to back the system.

THE CAMPAIGN in the Labour party to introduce one member one vote (OMOV) for
the selection of parliamentary candidates achieved a significant

The union block vote falls from 89 per cent to 70 per cent at this year's
Labour conference, however, and the constituency parties - with increased
representation - are expected to back OMOV.
USDAW said it would continue to back the use of an electoral college for the
election of the leader and deputy, but would back a cut in the union
proportion of the college from 40 per cent to 33 per cent.
It also favours reducing the union vote to party conference from 70 per cent
to 50 per cent over the next few years as individual membership grows.
Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU's general secretary, warned last night that if
Labour 'cuts itself adrift from the unions, it cuts itself adrift from its
most solid base of support.'
He added the current debate over the relationship between the unions and
Labour was 'overheated' and in danger of plunging the party into
'unnecessary, internal preoccupations.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / Major backs Patten stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S ATTEMPTS to undermine the position of Mr Chris Patten, the governor
of Hong Kong, were bluntly repudiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister,
yesterday.
While reaffirming Britain's readiness to have further talks with China
without pre-conditions he told the Commons that the government stood 'four
square' behind Mr Patten.
'No one should doubt that the governor has our total support,' he said.
In a tribute to Mr Patten the prime minister said he had acted 'sensitively,
resolutely and correctly', and assured MPs that Britain would continue to
make this clear to China, which is due to regain sovereignity over Hong Kong
colony in 1997.
Mr Major stressed that the governor's proposals for wider democracy were
widely supported in Hong Kong, in the UK and in the international community.
Mr Patten had acted entirely within the terms of the documents agreed with
China. 'We expect the Chinese government to do likewise,' he said.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Climbdown on trust tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN changes to the tax treatment of UK resident trusts suggested by Mr
Norman Lamont in his first Budget two years ago have been abandoned, Mr
Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, said yesterday.
The proposals, published in a consultation paper in March 1991, were
intended to bring the taxation of trusts more into line with the tax
treatment of individuals, reflecting the cut in the top rate of income tax
to 40 per cent and the changes to capital gains tax made in the 1988 Budget.
The central element of the plans envisaged that the income tax and capital
gains tax treatment of trusts would be integrated, so that trustees' income
and chargeable gains were added together and taxed at the basic rate up to a
threshold, and then at the higher rate.
Announcing the climbdown, Mr Dorrell said that many of those who had
responded had been concerned that treating capital gains as the top slice of
income would adversely affect beneficiaries entitled to trust capital,
because gains, more than income, would tend to be charged at the higher
rate. He added that ministers were still considering some of the more
detailed proposals in the document, intended to streamline and simplify the
tax treatment of trusts.
The announcement sought to play down the decision not to implement the main
plans, by emphasising it had been a matter for consultation.
But the paper only resulted after careful consideration within the Treasury,
in a review by Mr Lamont when he was financial secretary.

AVERAGE EARNINGS rose by an underlying seasonally adjusted 4 3/4 per cent in
the year to January, unchanged on the December figure. It remained the
lowest annual increase for 25 years.
There was, however, a  1/4 -point drop in the annual rate of average
earnings for manufacturing industry. They rose by 5 1/4 per cent in the year
to January compared with 5 1/2 per cent in the year to December. The annual
rate of average earnings for the service industries was unchanged at 4 1/2
per cent.
Unit wage costs for the whole economy rose by 1.9 per cent in the year to
the fourth quarter last year. Wages and salaries per unit of output have not
risen this slowly since 1968.
In manufacturing, industry unit wage costs fell by 1 per cent in the three
months to January compared with the same period a year before.
Manufacturing output per head was 1.8 per cent higher than in the three
months ending October, and was 6.4 per cent higher than in the same period a
year earlier.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Upturn continues to elude motor industry: Car output
'disappoints SMMT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK motor industry is still looking in vain for the production upturn it
has forecast for this year.
Car output fell 2.3 per cent and commercial vehicle output 15.73 per cent in
February compared with the corresponding period a year ago, a performance
described yesterday as 'disappointing' by Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Statistics issued jointly by the SMMT and Central Statistical Office showed
car output falling to 110,844 units from 114,192 in February last year.
Production for export rose 4.4 per cent to 49,206 from 47,130. Output for
the domestic market fell 8.2 per cent to 61,638 from 67,062.
Most analysts expect about 10 per cent growth in the severely depressed UK
market this year, and production is gathering pace at Toyota's plant at
Burnaston, Derbyshire, and at Honda's at Swindon, Wiltshire. Nissan also has
plans to expand output of its Sunderland plant this year.
The growth of output for export may be constrained by a swift and severe
downturn in leading Continental markets. Sales this year are down by about
25 per cent in France and Germany and by more than 40 per cent in Spain.
Car output for the first two months of the year totalled 219,986, up 5.03
per cent from the same period a year ago. Production for export was 12.27
per cent higher, at 99,498 from 88,622. January's production performance was
artificially boosted, however, because it contained five weeks' production
compared with four last year.
Commercial vehicle output in February fell to 17,912 compared with 21,255 a
year ago. Production for export was down 21.23 per cent from 12,956 to
10,207, reflecting the halt in production at Leyland Daf.
Commercial vehicle output for this year's first two months totalled 36,725,
down 2.47 per cent on last year's 37,655.
Production for export was 13.57 per cent lower, at 19,558 from 22,629.
In spite of the disappointment at February's figures, Sir Hal said:
'Compared with our EC partners, UK production still remains encouraging,
especially on the export front. However, current world trading patterns will
present our industry with a strong challenge over coming months.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / Jobless fall baffles Whitehall: Drop in unemployment may
signal recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS and statis-ticians struggled yesterday to explain last month's
sharp drop in unemployment. One baffled official confessed the figures were
checked twice, such was the surprise at the Department of Employment.
Most analysts said it was too early to judge whether the seasonally adjusted
fall of 22,000 represented a turnaround or whether it was a statistical
quirk. However, the official figures highlighted encouraging trends.
The Department of Employment said the February fall was driven by a drop in
the number of people registering for unemployment benefit. About 370,000
people joined the claimant count last month, 19,500 fewer than in the same
month last year. Outflows from the count were 391,200, over 33,000 more than
in February last year. Some of the outflows would have left the count to
join government employment schemes. The number of people involved in
Employment Training, for example, rose 5,000 in February compared with
January.
There was no regional explanation for the reduction in unemployment. The
good news was spread fairly evenly across the country with the jobless total
falling in all regions except Greater London, northern England and Northern
Ireland. Unemployment in the south-east, one of the regions worst hit by the
recession, fell by a seasonally-adjusted 5,700 in February compared with
January. But in Greater London it rose 800 on the month. In the north the
number of people out of work and claiming benefit rose by 600 and in
Northern Ireland by 200.
Some regions experienced their first drop in unemployment for three years,
noticeably East Anglia where it fell by 1,200 and the west Midlands where it
dropped 2,400. East Anglia and the south-west had the biggest percentage
falls in unemployment.
February's sharp overall drop has left in question the trend growth rate in
unemployment. February's fall cut sharply the underlying rate of increase as
measured by the three-month on three-month comparison. In the three months
to the end of February the jobless total rose by 19,500 compared with 41,800
in the three months to the end of January. February's fall was consistent
with a sharp pick-up in vacancies at Jobcentres, about a third of all
vacancies in the economy. These rose by a seasonally adjusted 17,600 in
February after falling by 4,400 in January, although the department warned
that the figures were subject to revision because of software problems.
Economists also pointed to a slowdown in the rate at which the level of
overall employment is falling. The workforce in employment dropped 85,000 in
the fourth quarter to 24.9bn, the smallest fall since the first quarter of
last year.
In manufacturing the number of people employed was estimated to have fallen
by 13,000 in January to 4.2bn. This was the smallest fall since May last
year. In the service industries the number of individuals in employment rose
by 51,000 in the fourth quarter after falling 254,000 in the third quarter.
The number of hours worked over time also pointed towards a pick-up in
activity. In January there were 9.45m overtime hours worked compared with
8.31m in December.
The Department of Employment issued the results of its quarterly labour
force survey yesterday. This measures unemployment through a household
survey rather than by simply adding up the number of people claiming
unemployment benefit. It showed that in the three months to the end of
November, unemployment was 2.8m. This was 66,000 more than the average
monthly number of unemployed recorded by the claimant count.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Housing market activity increases: Homebuyers show more
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS from estate agents of increasing activity in the housing market
emerged in building societies' lending figures yesterday, with a 40 per cent
rise in the value of new commitments to mortgages during February.
Although the value of new commitments to mortgages was only just above the
figure for February last year, the figure rose to Pounds 2.72bn compared to
Pounds 1.55bn in January.
'The figures support the reports of an increase in activity reported by
housebuilders and estate agents since the turn of the year,' said Mr Mark
Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association.
Mr Boleat said that housebuyers' confidence was still fragile, but had
strengthened over recent months. He said the doubling of the stamp duty
threshold from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000 in the Budget would give a
further 'modest boost'.
The fact that housebuying activity has accelerated only recently was
underlined by gross mortgage advances at Pounds 1.92bn for February - just
above the Pounds 1.79bn for January and below December's Pounds 2.14bn.
The association said the government's Pounds 750m scheme announced in
November to revive the housing market by giving housing associations funds
to buy empty homes accounted for only Pounds 200m of the Pounds 2.72bn new
commitments figure.
The net inflow of retail funds to societies fell to Pounds 208m in February
from Pounds 363m in January. The association emphasised that this was the
third consecutive monthly inflow after a poor 1992, when the yearly inflow
was only Pounds 295m.
Net retail receipts were up from Pounds 145m in February last year.
Societies' funds were badly affected last year by five months of net
outflows. Those dampened retail funding from a Pounds 5.8bn inflow in 1991
and a Pounds 6.56bn inflow in 1990.
The fall in base rates since last October has increased funding pressure on
societies. Mr Boleat said societies had added to their range of savings
products in response to competition from National Savings and unit trusts.

FT  19 MAR 93 / The Property Market: Portfolio for all seasons - Vanessa
Houlder profiles the long-term strategy of Trinity College, Cambridge's
richest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are hard times for many of Britain's traditional landowners. Leasehold
enfranchisement, the collapse in agricultural land values and the
treacherous property development market have damaged the interests of
landlords ranging from the Duke of Westminster to the Church of England.
But Trinity College, the richest college in Cambridge and one of the UK's
oldest landowners, appears to be riding out the recession with enviable
serenity. Its somewhat idiosyncratic portfolio, worth Pounds 207m, has so
far stood it in good stead during the downturn.
Its wealth, which mostly dates back to land and ecclesiastical tithes seized
from the monasteries by King Henry VIII, takes a form dictated by history
and chance as well as by conscious design.
Its portfolio includes: gravel royalties; agricultural land; shops in
provincial towns, including a large chunk of central Cambridge; the
Cambridge Science Park; Felixstowe Docks; and a range of equities.
It shuns offices, with the exception of three small London properties, on
the ground that they need frequent refurbishment.
It also avoids gilts, believing that the income from its shop portfolio is
an adequate substitute for fixed income securities.
In the past 35 years, the make-up of the portfolio has changed significantly
from one that was split evenly between farms, urban property and securities.
Nonetheless, its current breakdown - 5 per cent farmland, 50 per cent
property and 45 per cent securities - is still far out of line with the
average pension fund.
The differences between Trinity's fund and mainstream institutions do not,
it seems, stem from a relaxed approach to performance. Asset allocation is
reviewed by the college's finance committee (which includes Louis Freedman,
former managing director of Land Securities), which vets its investment
decisions.
The college insists it has pressing demands on its income, which last year
totalled Pounds 15m. 'We are fully stretched. We need every penny,' says Mr
John Bradfield, who ran the college's finances from the mid-1950s (when the
assets were worth Pounds 3.2m) until this year.
The money is used for the upkeep of its buildings, which costs more than
Pounds 1m a year, the support of its fellows and a number of bursaries and
trusts throughout the university. Some 15 per cent of its income is
redistributed to the university and poorer colleges.
But the college's objectives differ from those of most other funds in
respect of its time horizon. Even more than most funds, Trinity is investing
for the long term. 'You have to bear in mind the longevity of liabilities;
here they are infinite,' says Mr Jeremy Fairbrother, the college's
recently-appointed senior bursar.
Mr Fairbrother is only the third senior bursar to be appointed in the past
60 years, reflecting a strong degree of continuity in the management of the
college's affairs. This has generated a culture of long-termism, which has
been furthered by a historical view of past investment decisions. 'We have
to keep an eye on what has happened over the last four centuries,' says Mr
Bradfield.
His lack of enthusiasm for gilts owes much to a realisation that the
college's income would be minimal had it been endowed with fixed-income
securities. Inflation - with the exception of a long period of stability or
deflation during the 19th century - has been a pressing concern for
investors since the days of Elizabeth I, when it soared as large amounts of
gold were brought back from the New World.
The inflation suffered under Elizabeth I indirectly influenced the evolution
of Trinity's investment philosophy, since it led to legislation which
prevented landowners such as Trinity from selling land. The legislation was
amended in the 1850s as a result of the need for railway development, and
relaxed further in 1964.
Mr Fairbrother believes the lengthy period in which the college was locked
into its landholdings has left its mark on its investment strategy.
'Colleges became expert at handling property,' he said. Rather than trading
their assets, they looked at ways of adding value to them.
In the past 30 years, the College has enjoyed two spectacular successes in
adding value to its agricultural land. Farmland bought in 1933 at Felixstowe
was chosen as the site of a new port in 1968. Its deep water and its
exclusion from the dock labour scheme ensured that it became Britain's
largest container port. The port and its associated warehousing and
industrial estate bring Trinity more than Pounds 1m in rent each year.
If Trinity's success at Felixstowe was in some respects a lucky break, the
Cambridge Science Park is a considerable credit to the college.
The park, built on land acquired in 1440 by King's Hall, a predecessor of
Trinity, was proposed in 1969, when a university committee argued there
should be more science-based industry in Cambridge. The project, which began
in 1973, covers 120 acres, of which 10 acres are undeveloped. It houses 80
companies, including contract researchers, venture capitalists and a wide
range of technology-related businesses.
The park, which is the first, the largest and the most famous science park
in the UK, is seen as a model of its kind, and has attracted visitors from
more than 45 countries in the past 10 years.
Trinity is attempting to repeat the trick with its Eureka science and
business park in Ashford, Kent, on farmland it bought in 1957. It has
installed roads and has established academic liason with the University of
Kent and Wye College. Although Ashford is well placed for the rail link to
the Continent, the proposed park is not as well-favoured as the Cambridge
one. Success, if it happens, is a long way off.
Mr Fairbrother believes the rewards of working property assets justify their
place in a long-term portfolio. Markets in property are imperfect, compared
with those in equities, he notes. 'It is much easier to add value by active
management in property.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / Growth in M4 still sluggish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDICATIONS of continuing economic weakness were underlined by sluggish
growth in the M4 measure of the money supply last month.
M4 rose in the year to February by a seasonally adjusted 3.3 per cent, only
slightly above the 3.2 per cent rise in the 12 months to January, the Bank
of England said.
The year-on-year growth in M4 - which takes in notes and coins plus deposits
at banks and building societies - is only just inside the Treasury's
'monitoring range' established in the Budget of 3 per cent to 9 per cent.
Bank and building society lending to companies and individuals rose by
Pounds 700m in February.
M0, the narrow measure of money which is mainly notes and coins, rose by 4.5
per cent in the year to last month.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Overseas orders boost engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of international construction contracts involving British
consulting engineers jumped by more than 40 per cent from Pounds 41.98bn to
Pounds 60.06bn last year according to figures published yesterday.
Consulting engineers are estimated to have contributed Pounds 625m to
Britain's invisible earnings in 1992 - almost 39 per cent more than the
Pounds 450m earned in 1991.
The figures, published by the Association of Consulting Engineers, do not
include any contribution from British contractors or building material
producers working on international projects.
The increase in international orders was in part due to several large
transport and energy projects mostly in the Far East.
As a result the capital value of new projects for which British consultants
won contracts more than doubled to Pounds 27.75bn. More than a third of this
arose from the Pounds 10bn Bangkok Elevated Transport System in which Ove
Arup is involved.
British consultants have also been working on a Pounds 2.7bn landfill
project in Hong Kong which is part of the transport infrastructure of the
new Chep Lap Kok airport. Contracts were also won last year on several large
power station projects in China.
Mr Povl Ahm, chairman of the association, said that the level of
international construction orders from China was increasing. He was
concerned that Britain should not lose a share of this work because of
problems over Hong Kong.
But he added that there was no sign of significant recovery in world
construction orders outside the Far East. The capital value of Far Eastern
projects involving British consultants rose from Pounds 11.85bn to Pounds
28.85bn last year.

FT  19 MAR 93 / OFT life insurance proposals: Insurers attack 'unfair'
disclosure demands - Treasury wants agreement soon, Business may shift from
life houses, Annual statements for policyholders urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMANDS from the Office of Fair Trading for life insurance sales agents to
tell prospective clients much more about costs were attacked by many figures
in the industry.
Mr Brian Richardson, chairman of the Association of British Insurers' life
council, yesterday expressed 'regret and disappointment'. But Mr Tony Baker,
public affairs director at the association, described the new proposals as
'unnecessary and unfair' and said that some of them were likely to
discourage sales of new products. The association's objections focus on two
main elements of the Office of Fair Trading report. The first is its
suggestion that independent financial advisers should be required to
disclose their commissions in cash terms to prospective customers. The
second is its suggestion that customers should be told what the value of
their policy would be in each year if it is surrendered before maturity.
'It would serve to put some people off buying that product,' Mr Baker said.
'It would have an unnecessary and unfair effect on sales.'
Ms Julia Leisching, regulatory consultant to the financial services
industry, argued that consumers would be unable to understand tables of such
complexity.
Independent financial advisers (IFAs) reacted furiously to the report's call
for commission disclosure, although the other proposals met with broad
approval.
Mr Kenneth Davy, president of the Life Insurance Association, a trade body
for both independent and tied intermediaries, condemned the proposals for
commission disclosure as 'quite ridiculous'. He said: 'It will be extremely
detrimental for the IFA sector. The banks and building societies will be
delighted because they will be able to give essentially biased advice. The
OFT's own research provides no compelling evidence for commission
disclosure.'
His views were echoed by Ms Joanne Hindle, chief executive officer of IFA
Promotion, which promotes the use of independent advisers. She described the
pursuit of commission disclosure as 'misguided'.
She added: 'It is in everyone's best interest that full commission
disclosure is held in abeyance. Should the OFT recommendation be accepted by
the Treasury, there is a very real danger that we will see the level playing
field tilt away from the IFA sector, making it all too easy for a tied agent
to claim that he or she is paid less commission for selling a product than
an IFA.'
There were some dissident voices. Mr Tony Shepherd, a fee-charging
independent financial adviser and chairman of the Institute of Financial
Planning, welcomed all the report. He said: 'I personally am in favour of
commission disclosure because I think commission is the principal cause of
malpractice in the insurance industry.'
Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers
yesterday said it would try to convince the Treasury that IFA commission
disclosure is inappropriate.
Meanwhile, industry analysts say that the proposed rule allowing low-cost
sales outlets to price their products more cheaply may well hasten the rise
of so-called bancassurance. Banks and building societies which act as the
'tied' sales outlets for a single insurance company have lower costs and
consequently could, if current rules allowed, try to compete on price. Until
now, regulators have forbidden this but the OFT argues that rule is
anti-competitive.

FT  19 MAR 93 / OFT life insurance proposals: 'Knockout blow' by Carsberg
welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, has delivered 'a
knockout blow for the consumer', the Consumers' Association said yesterday.
Accountants and advisers agreed that the disclosure of surrender values in
the late years of policies, and the use of company charges in illustrations,
would greatly help consumers.
Surrender values in the first five years of a life policy are usually lower
than the amount of premiums paid because administration and sales costs are
extracted at the start of the policy. However, figures in the table provided
by the OFT show that values on offer after 20 years on a 25-year policy are
on average 57 per cent lower than if the policy were held until maturity -
although 80 per cent of the premiums have already been paid.
The OFT figures, which show the best and worst results for the 20 largest UK
life companies, show that this reduction varies from 47.1 per cent to 70.3
per cent.
The report's proposals on charges and illustrations have also been welcomed.
Under the present regime, companies must publish their 'reduction in yield'
(RIY), showing the number of percentage points knocked off a given projected
investment yield for charges, but cannot use it as a basis for projections.
Instead they use a standard figure set by Lautro.
Figures produced by Money Management, a Financial Times publication, show
that, assuming monthly premiums of Pounds 200 into a 25-year personal
pension and an annual return of 13 per cent, the impact of charges on the
projected final fund would vary from 8.5 per cent for the best company to
42.6 per cent (Pounds 169,989) for the worst.

FT  19 MAR 93 / OFT life insurance proposals: Early changes to rules
unlikely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY new rules for the life insurance industry are likely to be a long way
off even though the Office of Fair Trading has given its views about
encouraging competition.
Moreover, recent pronouncements from the Treasury, the Securities and
Investments Board and the insurance industry suggest there is far more
willingness by all parties to introduce a better disclosure regime.
The OFT first sought tougher disclosure rules for life insurance products in
1989 and yesterday's report reflects its comments on a two-year exercise
involving the industry and SIB.
Officially the report must be presented to the Treasury, which will then
decide if it agrees with the OFT's conclusions. The Treasury said: 'We must
decide first whether the current rules are seriously anti-competitive and if
so, are they enough so that investor protection is seriously impaired.'
If the Treasury decides they are anti-competitive, it can direct SIB to
draft a new set of disclosure rules aimed at meeting the OFT's objections.
Yesterday SIB said it would be speaking with the self-regulatory bodies
about formalising those parts of its proposed disclosure regime that the OFT
has accepted as suitable for promoting competition. Those rules include
disclosure of how many pence per pound each company's total expenses will
reduce final pay-outs by, and rules covering disclosure of each sales
agent's status.
The Association of British Insurers and other industry groups are preparing
to lobby strongly for the Treasury to reject the OFT report.
The Treasury is not inviting industry comment and has said it wishes to make
a decision as quickly as possible. 'We are quite willing to listen to
representations from all interested parties,' it said. 'But obviously the
Treasury wishes to make its own assessments.'
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, has publicly called
for improved investor protection in the industry.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was hopeful
that the industry would accept the proposed new regime. 'I do believe that
there is a new feeling in the industry,' he said. 'It is starting to feel
that the public is losing confidence in the product.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / Daf buy-out decision is likely in two weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of the management buy-out bid for the Leyland Daf plant in
Birmingham is likely to be settled within the next fortnight.
Its chances of success have been improved by the decision on Wednesday of
3i, the venture capital group, to advance equity finance.
Mr Ken Ogilvy, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, said
yesterday that detailed cashflow projections for the next six months of the
plant's operations were being prepared for presentation next week to the
credit committees of clearing banks and finance houses.
Coopers is trying to pull together a finance package for the buy-out team
led by Mr Allan Amey.
Banks and finance houses are needed by the management buy-out team to
provide the debt element of the financing package, which will also involve
the public sector.
The Department of Trade and Industry is understood to have been carrying out
its procedures of 'due diligence' yesterday on an application by the
management team for regional selective assistance.
This is a subsidy available to Leyland Daf under the terms of the Industrial
Development Act 1982 to provide funds for modernisation in order to
safeguard employment.
The speed with which the DTI has been processing the application underlines
the government's desire to keep open a plant in an area of high
unemployment.
If the joint receiver, Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen, the
accountancy firm, closes the plant it is unlikely to reopen.
Orders for Leyland Daf vans tail away from mid April because of uncertainty
about the future.
Mr Ogilvy said: 'Much beyond that the order book looks pretty poor.' Dealers
have been holding back from placing firm orders until the outcome of the
buyout bid is clear.
Mr Ogilvy said: 'We will not be in a position to strike a deal with the
receiver for another week or so.' The attitude of the banks was crucial, but
he felt that 3i's decision had put down a marker. 'It starts to focus
everybody's mind that what might be possible is possible.'
Mr Chris Rowlands, the Birmingham director of 3i, said the group's decision
to invest 'will help to accelerate other components of the financial
package'.
Leyland Daf has 100 acres of land, but Mr Ogilvy warned that 'it is not easy
to see a windfall' given the state of the property market.
He had talked to 'one or two people', but could not see any sign of
immediate speculative buying.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Cost of artificial joints is criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'FASHION TRADE' in joint replacements is costing the National Health
Service many millions of pounds each year, research in the British Medical
Journal claims today.
Manufacturers, say the researchers, encouraged surgeons to believe that 'new
improved' expensive implants used to replace hips were better than
conventional cheaper models. Yet they were sometimes less satisfactory.
Health service implants are manufactured by about a dozen companies, many of
them US-based. Although British prices have been lower than elsewhere in
Europe and the US, they have risen recently.
The researchers, from the John Radcliffe Hospital and Nuffield Orthopaedic
Centre, both in Oxford, and Birmingham Orthopaedic Hospital, claim that
while a 'perfectly satisfactory' hip replacement could be marketed for about
Pounds 100, prices in the UK vary from Pounds 250 to more than Pounds 1,000.
Knee-replacement joints costing about Pounds 300 to manufacture were selling
for between Pounds 700 and Pounds 1,500.
About 40,000 hip-replacement operations a year are performed in Britain.
Many hospitals, says the report, have stopped replacing joints this
financial year because they have run out of money. The report says this is
'most unsatisfactory when cheaper hips are available and waiting lists are
so long'.
Long-term clinical results over 10 years showed that failure rates of some
of the cheapest models on the market were less than 1 per cent a year.

FT  19 MAR 93 / BR seeks help for expansion of Thameslink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Rail yesterday appealed to the private sector to come forward with
ideas for financing a Pounds 325m expansion of the Thameslink cross-London
line.
It said it hoped to fund the long-outstanding project by taking advantage of
new Treasury guidelines aimed at encouraging private-sector participation in
transport infrastructure projects.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in his Budget speech on Tuesday
that three rail projects - the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express, the Pounds 2bn
CrossRail scheme from east to west across London and the Pounds 2.5bn
Channel tunnel rail link - were to be taken forward as joint ventures
between the public and private sectors.
British Rail said it was now looking at the possibility of applying a
similar approach to all its outstanding investment projects, including the
Thameslink expansion and the upgrading of the west coast main line between
London Euston and Glasgow.
The Thameslink line allows suburban and long-distance trains to cross the
City from north to south and back instead of terminating on one side of the
capital. However, limited capacity on the central London stretch means it
can carry only six trains an hour each way.
BR's Thameslink 2000 project, involving the expansion of stations and
junctions in central London, would quadruple capacity to 24 trains an hour
each way, turning Thameslink into a high-frequency operation serving a much
wider choice of destinations.
Separately, BR also wants to move the Thameslink station at King's Cross
from its present site in Pentonville Road to a new underground terminal
beneath the main King's Cross station. This would cost a further Pounds
650m.
BR's Network SouthEast division strongly denied speculation that the
decision to re-site the Channel tunnel rail link terminal at St Pancras
meant that the King's Cross project was dead.
In what appeared to be an unintentional leak of the contents of next week's
announcement of the Channel tunnel rail link plans, it said the plan to use
St Pancras as the international terminal 'also embraces the new low-level
station needed by the Thameslink 2000 service.'
Last week it emerged that three of Britain's biggest engineering companies -
GEC Alsthom, Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty - had put forward a plan for
funding the Pounds 900m West Coast main line project. The transport
department welcomed BR's efforts to attract private-sector participation.

A PUBLIC appeal is to be launched to raise money for Monktonhall
Mineworkers, the consortium operating Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh,
James Buxton writes.
The colliery is in financial difficulties. The appeal is supported by the Rt
Rev Richard Holloway, the bishop of Edinburgh.
Yesterday Lothian regional council, which has previously refused to help
Monktonhall Mineworkers, agreed to pay for a Pounds 25,000 study of the
company's viability.
Caledonian Mining, based at Newark, Notts, said it was withdrawing from
discussions with the mineworkers and their advisers, Price Waterhouse. It
had been dismayed by reports that it did not enjoy the support of the
miners, and by adverse publicity.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Hidden 'green' costs may add 4% to fuel bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIDDEN costs of government energy-saving schemes could add nearly 4 per cent
a year to domestic fuel and electricity bills, in addition to the value
added tax levy announced in the Budget, it emerged yesterday.
The new figures were released by government departments as the row over the
impact of higher fuel bills on poor households grew.
In Tuesday's Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said existing
energy-efficiency schemes would play a larger part than previously announced
in reaching environmental targets.
The UK committed itself at last July's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to
stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels in the year 2000.
Government projections say reaching that target will need a cut of 10m
tonnes of carbon (mtC) from projected levels of 170mtC.
New figures show that the government expects the Budget measures to save
3mtC and existing measures to save 4mtC. They also reveal that the biggest
part - 2.5mtC - will come from schemes organised by the Energy Saving Trust
created last year to encourage household energy efficiency.
If the trust is to meet this target it would have to spend between Pounds
300m and Pounds 400m a year on household insulation schemes, says a
previously published report by the Department of the Environment.
The rise in average energy bills across the country might then be between 3
per cent and 4 per cent if costs are passed on to customers, the report
suggests. However, households which participate in the schemes will be
cushioned from some of the rise by using less energy.
The electricity and gas utilities, which will make the investments
identified by the trust, are keen that all costs should be passed on to
customers.
The trust, headed by former cabinet minister Lord Moore, was one of the main
'green' planks of the Conservative election manifesto last spring but has
been criticised for a slow start. It has appointed a chief executive only
recently.
On Tuesday the chancellor said fuel taxes in the Budget 'together with
measures that have already been announced . . . should take Britain two
thirds of the way to meeting the Rio target'.
Midlands Electricity yesterday announced a 4 per cent tariff cut for
domestic customers, Michael Smith writes. The company said its efforts to
reduce prices would largely offset the Budget imposition of VAT.
The reduction, effective from April 1, is the largest announced for the
coming year by any of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and
Wales. Midlands said its customers will save more than Pounds 12 a year on
average. Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman, said he hoped it would be possible to
make further cuts next year. These would offset the price rises resulting
from the government's decision to introduce VAT on domestic fuel bills at 8
per cent.
London Electricity said it is cutting prices by an average of 2 per cent
from April 1, saving more than Pounds 6 a year for its average domestic
customer.
Other companies which have announced charges for next year include Seeboard,
which froze its prices, and South Wales Electricity, which cut rates by 1
per cent.
The reductions have been made possible by falling coal prices and heavy cost
cutting.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Amstrad launches 'Pen Pad' product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the consumer elec-tronics company, yesterday announced the first of
a family of 'personal digital assistants', hand-held electronic notebooks
which recognise and accept their owner's handwriting.
It can also be used to send faxes over the telephone network when connected
to a modem.
Designed by Amstrad and manufactured in mainland China, the 'Pen Pad', which
weighs under a pound, will be in high street shops by early May for Pounds
299.99 including value added tax.
It is not the first of its type, because Japanese and US companies are
already marketing hand-held computers which recognise handwriting.
Some of the world's largest electronics companies see a bright future for
such electronic notebooks and are planning their own versions.
The list includes IBM, AT&amp;T and Apple. Their products are expected to be
more sophisticated than Amstrad's version, although much more costly.
The Amstrad launch is an indication that the company, which recently
returned to profitability, is still capable of producing new product ideas.
Mr Sugar failed in December to persuade shareholders to sell him the shares
he does not already own, saying he could see no prospect of a 'blockbuster'
product on the horizon.

FT  19 MAR 93 / 24-hour BBC news opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE majority of those questioned in a Mori poll commissioned by Reader's
Digest has condemned one of the main initiatives of Mr John Birt, BBC
director-general, Gary Mead writes.
Seventy-three per cent opposed the launch of a 24-hour radio news service,
which is planned for next year. That rose to 80 per cent for those aged 65
and over.
Plans for an all-day television news service were even more strongly
rejected - by 81 per cent. But BBC1 appears to be popular: 73 per cent of
those in the survey said they would miss the channel if it went off the air.
Only 44 per cent felt the same affection for BBC2. More than half (56 per
cent) believed television broadcasting quality would deteriorate if the BBC
was changed. However, 60 per cent said they favoured replacing the
television licence fee with commercial advertising. Attitudes towards the
licence fee have scarcely altered since Mori's last Reader's Digest poll on
this issue in 1988. Then, 58 per cent said they wished to see the end of the
licence fee.
Almost 70 per cent in yesterday's poll said they would miss some form of BBC
radio - local or national - if it ceased broadcasting.

The futuristic Pounds 100m stadium proposed for Manchester. A centrepiece of
the city's bid for the 2000 Olympic Games, the stadium will seat 80,000
people. The overall project - worth Pounds 150m - includes a separate
6,000-seat facility for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics with a mix of
retail and leisure facilities. The designers envisage that access roads
approaching the stadium will form a 'Catherine wheel' to encourage
commercial development near the complex, instead of drawing it away. The
plan for the 121-acre facility has been drawn up by architects Sir Norman
Foster and Partners. It will be about a mile from the city centre

FT  19 MAR 93 / Navy to complete delayed vessel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL NAVY is to take responsibility for finishing work on an armed
support ship constructed by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.
The move to take the ship, Fort Victoria, out of the contractor's hands
follows a series of problems and delays - the ship is 2 1/2 years overdue.
Defence officials said yesterday that six months of the delay were not
attributable to the contractor but to changes in navy requirements.
In an attempt to resolve the remaining technical difficulties, Harland sent
the ship to the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. The yard is a
subsidiary of VSEL, the Cumbria-based shipyard group.
But the navy will now try to rectify the defects at its own Fleet
Maintenance and Repair Organisation in Portsmouth.
The Ministry of Defence said that Harland had 'completed the vessel to a
standard that we are willing to accept'.
The ship, designed to supply stores and fuel, was ordered in April 1986, at
an inflation-adjustable price of Pounds 127m. No details were available on
the financial settlement reached with Harland over the defect rectification
work. A sister vessel, Fort George, was ordered from Swan Hunter shipyard on
Tyneside in December 1987 and is virtually complete.
The prospect of an order for a navy helicopter carrier that could save Swan
Hunter was kept alive yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary.
The Pounds 170m carrier is on a list of projects that the MoD has considered
abandoning to meet reduced spending targets. However, Mr Rifkind said
yesterday: 'It may well remain in the programme.' But he added that a review
of spending priorities was not yet complete.
VSEL is also bidding for the order in partnership with the Clydeside yard
Kvaerner Govan.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Scots colliery to open funds appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PUBLIC appeal is to be launched to raise money for Monktonhall
Mineworkers, the miners' consortium operating Monktonhall colliery near
Edinburgh. The colliery is in serious financial difficulties. The appeal is
supported by the Rt Rev Richard Holloway, the bishop of Edinburgh, and by
voluntary organisations.
Yesterday Lothian regional council, which has hitherto refused to help
Monktonhall Mineworkers, agreed to pay for a Pounds 25,000 study of the
company's financial and technical viability by Quayle Munro, the Edinburgh
merchant bank.
Caledonian Mining, a company based at Newark, Notts, said that it was
withdrawing from further discussions with the mineworkers and their
advisers, Price Waterhouse. It had been dismayed by reports that it did not
enjoy the support of the miners, and by adverse publicity in Scotland.
Monktonhall Mineworkers, which leased the pit from British Coal in June,
said last month that it was seeking outside investors because it faced a
critical shortage of funds. Its only source of capital is the Pounds 1.6m
raised by the 160 miners themselves.
Although Monktonhall continues to produce coal for its main customer,
British Coal, it has a deficit of Pounds 1.7m. The miners have not been paid
for seven weeks. Bank of Scotland has refused further advances.
The Quayle Munro report may lead the regional council to put money into
Monktonhall. It is also hoped that investors from the public and private
sectorsmay respond.

FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Nuclear bribe trial opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trial has opened in Newark, New Jersey, of two US companies alleged by
the Philippines government to have bribed former President Ferdinand Marcos
to win a contract in the mid-1970s to build a nuclear power station.
The two companies, Westinghouse Electric and Burns &amp; Roe, the engineering
consultant, deny the charges.
The civil action trial, brought by the Manila government, is being presided
over by Judge Dickinson Debevoise, who heard nearly four years of arguments
from the plaintiffs and defendants before committing the two companies for
trial.
The plaintiffs claim that a Dollars 17.5m commission paid to a Mr Herminio
Disini, a Marcos family associate, was a bribe, with Mr Disini acting as a
conduit to the late Philippines leader. Mr Disini, they allege, had little
experience in the power business, and his main strength was his ability to
influence the president.
The defendants maintain the commission was legitimate and that Mr Disini had
widespread business connections that would enable him to marshal the
logistical support for the project.
They had hoped to avoid a trial following the findings of an independent
arbitration tribunal under the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva
which reported in 1991 that it could find no evidence bribes had been paid.
But Judge Debevoise argued the US court would not be bound by the tribunal
finding, saying the ICC had disregarded the large body of circumstantial
evidence he had been reviewing.
The original jury trial was to have taken place a year ago, but in an
out-of-court settlement Westinghouse agreed to revive and upgrade the
mothballed plant and operate it for 30 years. However, the settlement
collapsed when the new government of President Fidel Ramos found it could
replace the 620 MW nuclear plant much more cheaply with conventional power
stations.

FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Dasa warns of 600 fewer aircraft sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world recession in the airline industry has forced Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa), part of the consortium that builds Europe's Airbus aircraft, to cut
its forecasts for aircraft sales and traffic growth over the next 20 years.
It lowered its estimate of medium-sized and large aircraft to be sold over
the same period by 600 to 10,800.
Much of the decline will be over the next three years, with a recovery only
in the second half of the decade.
Traffic will grow at 4.9 per cent a year over the next 20 years; last year's
forecast was 5.1 per cent.
The company warned in its latest world market forecast that even these
figures might have to be reduced if world economies failed to recover well
or fuel taxes rose or the construction of high speed train links continued,
especially in Europe.
Dasa estimates sale of large and medium-sized aircraft - defined as those
with over 70 seats - will be worth Dollars 835bn at today's values over the
next 20 years.
It raised its forecasts for the share of sales to the Far East and Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is expected to announce today its approval of
Oregon's plan to ration health care for the poor while simultaneously making
basic medical treatment more widely available.
Last year President George Bush had rejected the Oregon plan on the grounds
that it infringed federal disability regulations. It has subsequently been
revised in order to meet these objections.
The nub of the Oregon plan advanced by Governor Barbara Roberts is to
subject 688 medical procedures to cost benefit and quality of life analyses.
The state Medicaid programme, which covers the less well-off and which is
partly federally funded, would continue to cover the top 568 medical
services, but would not pay for the remaining 120.
Excluded would be certain expensive operations, such as some liver
transplants and care for the terminally ill, and a variety of other
services, including obesity and fertility counselling. According to state
officials, Medicaid could be made available to 360,000 recipients, compared
with 240,000 at present.
However, even administration approval is unlikely to prevent lawsuits
against the plan, which may block its implementation . On Wednesday, several
interest groups, representing sufferers from cerebral palsy, spina bifida
and Aids, urged the president to block the plan.
The Oregon scheme is attractive to the administration, itself grappling with
healthcare reform, not least because President Clinton has often spoken of
the need for the state to act as practical and experimental laboratories for
new policies. In meetings with governors last month, he specifically urged
them to be innovative in administering their Medicaid programmes, for which
costs have soared.

FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Brazil races to beat US wrath over piracy
 -New copyright laws are being pushed in an attempt to avoid sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAUNTED by the spectre of US trade sanctions after a three-year breathing
space, the Brazilian government is rushing to push through legislation on
patent and intellectual property protection.
Brazil is one of the most likely candidates to face action next month under
section 301 of the 1974 Trade Law for barriers to US trade. Currently on the
US priority watch list, Brazil will face sanctions if it is put back in the
group of worst offenders for failing to recognise patents for products since
1945 or processes since 1971.
With the April 30 deadline for action looming, the Clinton administration
has received strongly worded petitions from the US pharmaceutical and video
games industries which claim to be losing between Dollars 300m-600m a year
through piracy in Brazil.
Super 301 sanctions, imposed on Brazil in 1988 for failing to provide patent
protection for US pharmaceuticals, were lifted in 1990 after promises by the
Collor government to introduce a new law on patents and trademarks.
Although legislation was presented to the Brazilian Congress in 1991 - two
years and more than 1,000 amendments later - it is still to be voted upon.
Its progress was halted by special interests and the Collor corruption
scandal which paralysed law-making for much of last year.
The new administration of President Itamar Franco is seen as more
protectionist than its predecessor and US officials say there is 'a definite
lessening of support' for the legislation. But Brazil appears increasingly
isolated on this issue, at a time when even China and Albania are
implementing intellectual property legislation and the Uruguay round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is discussing a set of international
norms.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's foreign minister, has been pushing
for a new law, particularly as the Clinton administration is expected to
have less sympathy for Brazil than that of former President George Bush.
Last week, a government proposal was concluded that, subject to presidential
approval, will go before the current session of Congress. Foreign drug
companies are unhappy about a proviso which would force them to seek
licences if they are found charging excessive prices.
The bill however does meet other important concerns such as offering
'pipeline' protection for products under development, and almost immediate
implementation. The government has proposed that it come into effect from
January 1994.
These points are likely to be contested by nationalists who have been
lobbying for a 10-year grace period. But a US official points out:
'Brazilian pharmaceutical companies have had 22 years of protection and
freedom to copy, justified on the basis that it would allow local industry
to build up and innovate, but in all that time they have not invented a
single new product'.
Although the lack of protection has deterred foreign investment, 70 per cent
of the Brazilian market remains dominated by multinationals and the other 30
per cent consists of small companies which simply assemble or copy foreign
products.
The Brazilian government hopes that what Mr Cardoso describes as 'a very
reasonable proposal' will improve trade and relations with the US.
Although over the last three years, some traditional tensions - such as on
the environment, debt and Brazil's ban on computer imports - have been
removed, there are still strains in the relationship. There is Brazil's
continuing support for Cuba and its fears over the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
Of all the major Latin economies, Brazil has perhaps the least close
relationship with the US. Brazilian trade to the US has dropped sharply  -
the US now accounts for only 19.3 per cent of its export market compared
with 24.3 per cent in 1989.
Pointing at the dramatic fall in Brazil's annual surplus with the US from
Dollars 5bn in 1988 to less than Dollars 2bn last year, Brazilian officials
say that the country has not had enough reciprocity for the progress it has
made in bringing down tariff barriers.
Brazil was one of the main victims of recent US countervailing duties on
steel, the US still restricts transfer of sensitive technology to Brazil and
slaps high tariffs on many Brazilian products, such as orange juice
concentrate.
The new bill on patents and trade marks faces a stormy passage through the
often nationalistic Brazilian Congress. Under pressure from the national
pharmaceutical company lobby and the Roman Catholic Church, which is
demanding that living serum and biotechnology references be excluded from
the law, the government has already decided not to ask for the bill to be
voted on an expedited basis.
The government is nonetheless hoping that its actions will be sufficient to
ward off US retaliatory duties. Mr Cardoso claims to have received no direct
threats: 'We're not doing this because of the risk of reprisals but because
we ourselves want the changes.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / Venezuelan leader again under assault: Joe Mann reports from
Caracas on a move to impeach Perez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE MANN

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez, who survived two attempted coups
last year and repeated demands for his resignation, now faces possible
impeachment 11 months before he is due to leave office.
The initiative, launched by Mr Ramon Escovar Salom, attorney-general, has
generated a new wave of rumours about another military uprising, renewed the
debate about early presidential and legislative elections (at present due in
December), and sapped confidence among investors.
As attorney-general, Mr Escovar acts independently of the administration.
However, he himself has been accused of being motivated in this action by
personal ambition.
The Supreme Court has been asked to rule on whether there is sufficient
merit in Mr Escovar's petition to impeach the president for allegedly
embezzling some Dollars 17m in 1989 from a secret Interior Ministry account
for national security and defence expenditures.
Mr Perez insists the money was used for 'secret' security and defence
purposes. His opponents say it was spent on his 1988 presidential campaign,
and possibly for other non-security purposes.
There is little public sympathy for Mr Perez, a popular figure before he
began implementing economic reform measures four years ago. President in the
oil boom years from 1974 to 1979, he has become for many Venezuelans a
symbol of corruption and old-style backroom politics.
If the high court rules in favour of the petition, the senate must decide if
just cause exists to try the chief executive. A positive senate vote would
then cause the president to be suspended and stand trial before the supreme
court.
The petition, unprecedented in recent history, has created new uncertainties
in a country still jittery over last November's foiled military uprising.
The executive branch in the past wielded huge power, hardly fettered by the
supposedly-independent supreme court. Important decisions were influenced by
the presidency or leading figures in the country's two big political
parties: Mr Perez's own Democratic Action party and the Christian Democrats,
Copei.
However, this seems to be changing. Last week, the court ruled that the
government's use of special summary courts-martial to try military and
civilians accused of participating in last November's rebellion was
unconstitutional.
This means that the accused rebels must be retried before ordinary
courts-martial, something the government had wanted to avoid because of
defence attorneys' delaying tactics. It has still not managed to prosecute
the military accused in the attempted coup in February last year.
Ironically, Mr Perez lobbied successfully last year for changing the
composition of the supreme court, effectively taking a first step towards
de-politicising it.
For the president, the attorney-general's initiative extends his political
purgatory. He and his administration, committed to widespread economic and
political reform, have faced over the past 13 months two military uprisings,
hundreds of anti-government protests and riots, repeated calls for his
resignation and press attacks.
Partly as a result of his policies, Venezuela's economy has been the fastest
growing in the region since 1990. However, this has not been enough for
investors, who are worried about the political uncertainty and doubts about
the policies of the next president.

<TEXT>
BROTHER Industries, the electronics group, plans to transfer production of
portable typewriters from its home base in Japan to the US and to export
typewriters back to Japan from its US factory.
The company said it would begin importing models from the US from next week.
Brother said it would become more internationally competitive by
concentrating typewriter production in the US which is the largest
typewriter market.
The move is one of the most radical taken by a Japanese manufacturer since
the recent appreciation of the yen to shift to overseas production to
improve competitiveness.
The recent rise in the value of the yen against the dollar has made exports
from Japan less competitive, while exports into the Japanese market from the
US should make Brother more competitive.
Brother makes 20,000 English language typewriters each month mainly for
export to the US and Europe. About 15,000 are portable models.
It expects to export from US to Japan about 2,000 typewriters a month.

FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Brown defies 'pessimism' over Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday admitted widespread US 'pessimism and
defensiveness' about the North American Free Trade Agreement, but promised
to fight for it and pledged its commitment to 'freer trade'.
In a speech prepared for delivery to Mexican businessmen in Monterrey,
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown warned 'worried and disillusioned workers'
against searching for scapegoats. In such a climate 'foreign trade becomes
an issue that may not be considered rationally'. The administration had made
Nafta implementation one of the pillars of its economic programme.
As he spoke, trade negotiators from the US, Canada and Mexico entered their
second day of talks in Washington on Nafta side agreements, concerning
labour rights, the environment and import surges, which will have to be
settled if the pact is to win congressional approval.
Mr Brown called on businessmen in all three countries to re-examine their
operations and demonstrate their commitment to high environmental and labour
standards. Some critics of Nafta were using those issues 'to hack away at
the underpinning of support'.
'There are some who are trying to graft other agendas on top of a trade
agreement, whether or not that agreement might be killed in the process,' he
claimed. 'Be assured this is not the case with Bill Clinton or Ron Brown.'
Meanwhile, a confidential report from the Texas attorney-general's office -
and allegedly prepared for Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative -
claims that Nafta will affect US state laws more than any previous
international agreement.
'Once approved by Congress, the agreement will supersede all conflicting
state and federal laws,' it says. This could include health and safety and
environmental agreements that are more stringent than federal laws.
To protect state laws, it recommends that the proposed side agreements state
explicitly that non-discriminatory standards are not necessarily obstacles
to trade.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Peru pays off arrears with IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERU yesterday regained its financial respectability by clearing more than
Dollars 1.7bn of arrears to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
dating back to 1986.
A short-term bridging credit extended jointly by Japan's Eximbank and the US
Treasury was deposited on schedule to allow the immediate clearing of Peru's
arrears with the Fund, totalling some Dollars 860m.
The IMF board then gave its formal blessing to the country's 1993-95
economic programme. This allows extended fund facility to come into play,
assuring the cash-strapped Fujimori regime a total of Dollars 1.4bn over the
next three years and allowing repayments to the US and Japan.
Through a further series of financial manoeuvres, Peru also yesterday
cleared arrears of some Dollars 900m with the World Bank, which immediately
activated credits of Dollars 1.03bn.
Peru is a beneficiary of the IMF's 'rights accumulation approach', aimed at
allowing a small group of countries to pay off deep arrears with the
multilateral institutions.
While settlement with the multilaterals is a crucial first step towards
resolving the foreign debt problem, Peru is far from home and dry.
Agreements must now be reached with the Paris Club over debts totalling some
Dollars 8bn. Then there are the commercial banking creditors, owed around
Dollars 6bn, plus a Dollars 1.3bn debt with suppliers. The last two
categories of debt are almost entirely in arrears.
In coming weeks Peru will be seeking extensive write-offs on its
government-to-government debt in Paris. Experts say that, if the balance of
payments is to become even remotely viable in the medium term, Peru will
need to win conditions better even than those granted to Poland.
Peru's total foreign debt currently stands around Dollars 21bn - Dollars
19bn of that is long-term, public sector debt.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Argentina to probe Italian bribes link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem has announced an investigation into
allegations that his brother-in-law extorted bribes from companies three
years ago when he was a foreign ministry official in charge of relations
with Italy, Spain and Middle Eastern countries.
He and other former and serving officials are suspected of involvement in
Italy's widening corruption scandal.
Mr Menem said he was 'going to be absolutely inflexible with those who have
not acted correctly.'
On Tuesday, ex-president Raul Alfonsin said he sent a letter in 1990 to
then-foreign minister Domingo Cavallo alerting him to complaints from
businessmen that Mr Karim Yoma, brother of Mr Menem's estranged wife Zulema,
had demanded bribes to process applications for Italian government soft
loans. Italy has credit lines to Argentina worth over Dollars 1.0bn.
The allegations against Mr Yoma, who left the government in 1990, are the
latest in a series of claims, from the opposition and the press, that other
senior government officials in Argentina and Italy demanded 'commissions'
from companies applying for loans to import Italian machinery or finance
investments in Argentina. Officials are also suspected of approving projects
to Italian companies on suspiciously generous terms.
In 1987, Argentina signed investment and loan agreements with both Spain and
Italy breaking its economic and political isolation following the 1982 debt
crisis and defeat in the Falklands conflict. Although it was Mr Alfonsin who
signed the agreements, most of the loans began flowing after Mr Menem took
office.
Mr Menem has denounced Mr Alfonsin's allegations as a smear campaign in the
run up to Congressional elections. However, Mr Alfonsin has touched a raw
nerve. Mr Menem's government has been rocked by over a dozen corruption
scandals in the last two years, three of which involve members of his wife's
family.
In December 1991, Mr Miguel Angel Vicco was forced to resign as Mr Menem's
private secretary, when the press accused him of corruption. It was Mr Vicco
who introduced the president to several Italian businessmen suspected of
attempting to misappopriate Italian loans.

NORTH KOREA'S declaration of a 'semi-war' status is part of efforts to boost
the authority of Mr Kim Jong-il as the country's next leader, Mr Han
Sung-joo, South Korea's foreign minister, said yesterday.
Mr Han, in a meeting with foreign journalists, also described North Korea's
rejection of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a 'quasi-crisis' and
predicted that the problem will eventually be resolved.
He said there were no plans to ask US troops in the Team Spirit war games to
remain in South Korea after the exercise ended yesterday because North Korea
appeared not be seeking a military conflict.
Mr Han suggested Mr Kim Jong-il had decided to place North Korea on a
'semi-war' footing last week because doubts had been raised about his
authority after the Team Spirit exercise was resumed this year.
Team Spirit, the annual US-South Korean military manoeuvres, were suspended
last year as a goodwill gesture to Pyongyang following the signing of a
non-nuclear agreement between the two Koreas.
Mr Kim told North Koreans that he was responsible for the suspension of Team
Spirit, which Pyongyang claims represents a security threat.
But the military exercise was resumed this year after North Korea refused to
allow challenge inspections of suspected nuclear facilities by South Korea.
Mr Kim Jong-il is the son of President Kim Il-sung and his designated
successor. But it is thought he might face opposition once his father dies.
The International Atomic Energy Agency yesterday gave North Korea an
extended deadline of March 31 to agree to inspections at two sites near its
Yongbyon nuclear complex.
A special meeting of the agency's 35-member board of governors in Vienna
insisted that the nuclear safeguards agreement between the IAEA and North
Korea was still in force despite North Korea's announcement last week that
it was withdrawing from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Since ratifying the NPT last year, North Korea has received six inspection
visits from the IAEA, which is responsible for monitoring compliance with
the treaty.
The IAEA board told North Korea, which was represented at yesterday's
meeting, that it was 'urgent and essential' for it to allow the agency to
carry out the additional inspections.
Experts believe the sites may reveal the extent of North Korea's programme
for separating plutonium, which it could use for nuclear weapons.
On February 25 the IAEA gave North Korea a month to respond to its request.

Zaire had two rival prime ministers yesterday after President Mobutu Sese

A 'political conclave,' convened by Mr Mobutu but boycotted by the Sacred
Union opposition alliance, named Mr Faustin Birindwa as prime minister on
Wednesday night.
The appointment was a direct challenge to Mr Tshisekedi, who was sacked by
Mr Mobutu last December but refused to accept the president's authority. His
stand was backed by a majority of Zaire's interim parliament, the High
Council of the Republic (HCR), and by the governments of the US, Belgium and

that a steady recovery is under way, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney.
The independent statistical service said its average measure of gross
domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter. It also
revised GDP growth in the September quarter to 0.8 per cent from 0.5 per
cent.
The figures mark Australia's fifth successive quarter of growth since the

slightly higher than the 2.4 per cent recorded in the 12 months to
September.

Bombay police said two men were arrested yesterday for planting bombs in a
wave of attacks which killed at least 250 people and injured more than 1,200
in Bombay last week, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
Bombay police chief Amarjeet Singh Samra said one of the men had driven a
jeep packed with plastic explosives to a market place in central Bombay. The
other had confessed to planting a bomb in the city's crowded jewellery
market.
Six suspects arrested so far have all been linked to the Memon brothers,
smugglers who have since escaped to Dubai.
The police allege that the Memons have been involved in the narcotics trade,
gun-running, silver smuggling and foreign exchange rackets.
Police said the intention of the bombings was to 'disturb the peace in
Bombay and take advantage of the turmoil to further their illegal business.'
Meanwhile, the death toll in the blast in central Calcutta rose to 80.
Police have found no links between the Bombay and Calcutta blasts.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK may lose valuable Chinese markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SO FAR, the row over Hong Kong is nothing much more than a nuisance,' said
Mr Paul Hudson, business development adviser for the Essex-based polymer
chemicals group Yule Catto, from his hotel room in Guangzhou yesterday.
'But it would be a shame if it were to decline into a battle, because the
British are thin on the ground in China, and the few of us putting in
investment need the best of political relations, not the worst,' said Mr
Hudson, who has spent the past two weeks travelling China seeking joint
venture partners for a manufacturing plant in the country.
Mr Li Lanqing, China's minister for foreign economic relations and trade,
warned the democracy plans of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten 'will
inevitably affect economic relations and trade relations between China and
Britain'.
If the threat were to become a reality, it could hardly come at a worse
time. British economic planners have targeted exports as central to the
non-inflationary growth strategy intended to lift the economy out of
recession.
The government's aim is to boost Britain's share of world trade from 5.3 per
cent today to 6.3 per cent by the year 2000 - adding Pounds 10bn to exports
at current prices, and eliminating the visible trade deficit.
Fast-growing markets such as China are at the heart of this strategy.
Indeed, Mr Richard Needham, UK minister of trade, has visited the country
three times in the past year. Targeted sectors include transport,
telecommunications, power generation, agriculture and food processing.
The Chinese action would affect future opportunities far more than present
business, since Britain has lagged behind European competitors in China over
the past decade.
Britain's exports to China have been stagnant over the past seven years (see
chart). According to the department of trade, UK exporters 'have performed
less well, both in value and in share of the market, when compared to
exports by our European competitors'.
France's exports rose Dollars 742m in 1986 to Dollars 1.59bn in 1991, while
exports from Italy rose from Dollars 1.14bn to Dollars 1.47bn. The US has
boosted exports over the same period from Dollars 4.7bn to Dollars 8.0bn.
But it would be premature to predict serious dangers for UK exporters.
France and the US attracted the wrath of the Chinese government last year
because of military sales to Taiwan. Both were warned that trade relations
would suffer. The Chinese government forced the closure of France's
consulate in Guangzhou, and banned French companies from bidding for a
Dollars 1bn subway contract in the city.
There are few clear subsequent signs that exporters in these countries have
suffered, and it is questionable whether China can afford to discriminate on
anything but a token basis against so many potential sources of foreign
technology and investment.
Perhaps most at risk if relations deteriorate would be high-profile
contracts. But dangers are not confined to Britain's corporate giants. In
Birmingham, Mr Robin Hornby at Curdworth International Machine Tools, sells
more than half of its re-manufactured machine tools to China, after entering
the market in 1988.
He sees rapid growth in demand as pressure grows to upgrade the technology
in Chinese factories: 'Our output is growing, we are taking on new staff,
and are bucking the recession. It would be terrible if, after the time and
money we have spent developing the Chinese market, we were thrown out
through no fault of our own. The government would have a lot to answer for.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / Japanese household spending falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH IN Japanese household spending slowed sharply last year, rising by
just 0.4 per cent from the year before, according to a survey of almost
3,000 households published by the government's management and co-ordination
agency.
The survey found that spending when the head of the house is employed rose
by 0.5 per cent compared with 3.3 per cent in 1988 and 0.9 per cent in 1991.
Spending by other households, the self-employed, unemployed or pensioners,
did not rise last year from 1991.
The survey underlines the stagnation of Japanese consumer markets. Most of
the increase in spending came from higher expenditure on utilities, such as
gas and water, transport charges and education. Spending on food, clothing,
furniture and domestic appliances fell.
Consumer spending is likely to remain depressed for some time as the
Japanese labour market deteriorates.
Large manufacturing companies are announcing sweeping measures to cut costs
by reducing staff over the next three years. The uncertainty this has
created is encouraging more cautionary spending.
The 1993 wage round, expected to come to a head in the next two weeks, is
likely to deliver rises of less than 3 per cent.
However, there are signs that some areas of industry may have reduced
inventories of unsold products to the extent that they are starting a
moderate increase in production.
Steel production in February rose by 0.6 per cent from the year before,
while the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association forecasts that vehicle
sales this year will rise by 1.6 per cent to 6.91m units, up from the 6.8m
units sold last year.

FT  19 MAR 93 / A critical naira adds to Lagos transition woes: Exchange
rate strategy is called into question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE results of Nigeria's weekly foreign exchange auctions were expressed
as medical bulletins, the condition of the naira would be described as
critical and consultants summoned to the bedside.
Exchange rate management is the acid test of the credibility - and
competence - of the Transitional Council appointed at the end of last year
by President Ibrahim Babangida to govern the country until an elected
president takes over on August 28.
After the 40 per cent devaluation of the naira a year ago, Nigeria's central
bank maintained a stable official exchange rate, pumping an average of
Dollars 120m into the market weekly at an average rate of N19 to the dollar.
By December there were signs that this strategy was in trouble. Not only had
the country's gross foreign reserves fallen from Dollars 3.7bn in August
1992, to little more than Dollars 1bn, reflecting the debt buy-back
operation with the London Club of commercial banks as well as the cost of
supporting the naira, but the gap between the official and bureau-de-change
rates had widened to 20 per cent from 5 per cent in mid-year.
Only one auction was held during December and by the time sales resumed on
January 12, the rate had slipped to N20.5 to the dollar while demand had
increased to more than Dollars 200m a week. After two January sales, the
central bank, blaming the delayed presentation of the budget, cancelled
weekly auctions until mid-February while also delaying the delivery of
dollars to buyers at the two January sales for nearly three weeks,
ostensibly to allow time for it to scrutinise import documentation submitted
by the banks.
Then astonishingly, given mounting demand pressures, the central bank opted
for a Dutch auction system at the February 18 sale. It supplied Dollars 80m
in the face of demands for Dollars 337m, with the result that only 17 of the
80 participating banks were successful, and the auction rate fell from
N20.55 in January to N24.99 to the dollar, while in the parallel market the
'free rate' declined to N27.60. A week later the central bank again
cancelled the auction, describing bank bids of between N31 and N33 as
'outrageous'.
At last week's and yesterday's auctions the rate was pegged at N24.99, but
with demand of more than Dollars 720m and the central bank selling just
Dollars 150m, the banks received only 21 per cent of their requirements.
Chief Ernest Shonekan, leader of the Transitional Council, is being told -
in the very bluntest terms - by his many supporters in the business
community that this is not what they expected from a 'businessman's
government'. In the words of one, the Abuja economic summit 'dream' has,
within a few weeks, become a nightmare.
With virtually no room for manoeuvre, the TC will find it difficult to
satisfy its supporters. There is simply no quick fix solution to the
overhang of liquidity from last year's 56 per cent increase in the money
supply, while any attempt to peg the exchange rate is destined to fail as
the premium widens in the parallel market, where the rate is now N35 to the
dollar - a 36 per cent gap against the official rate.
Some bankers believe that a further tranche of stabilisation securities that
takes another N7bn or N8bn out of the market would stabilise the rate around
N30 to the dollar.
But the combination of escalating inflation - unofficially put at 60 per
cent and rising - higher interest rates, the already-programmed interruption
to imports and the planned phasing out of the petroleum subsidy, will have a
devastating impact on the economy and potentially on the political
transition due to culminate in presidential elections in June.
As the soon to retire President Bagangida told the Abuja economic summit
last month: 'It is a rare feat for a country to make a successful transition
to democracy with a declining economy'.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Nigerians to hold talks on payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and TONY HAWKINS

   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIAN officials are due to meet Paris Club creditors next week to discuss
trade and payments delays and arrears estimated at more than Dollars 4bn
(Pounds 2.8bn).
There are fears in some quarters of a re-run of the 1982-83 arrears crisis
when Nigeria built up a Dollars 5bn payments backlog largely on open account
trade.
The meeting will take place against a background of a deepening balance of
payments crisis and mounting pressure on the Naira. Since its agreements
with the IMF and the Paris Club of official creditors lapsed a year ago,
Nigeria is understood to have accumulated foreign payments arrears of more
than Dollars 3bn.
Britain, owed Dollars 600m at the end of January, is the largest creditor,
followed by France with Dollars 500m, and Germany with Dollars 400m.
Nigeria's total foreign debt stood at Dollars 27.6bn at the end of 1992, of
which Dollars 16.5bn was owed to the Paris Club. In the last year, foreign
reserves have fallen from Dollars 5.9bn to Dollars 1.4bn at the end of 1992.
This was largely the consequence of the Dollars 3.4bn buy-back of debt owed
to the London Club of commercial banks early last year, and of the failed
strategy of propping up the Naira at an average of N19 to the dollar during
1992, estimated to have cost the country more than Dollars 1bn.
With imports running at more than Dollars 700m a month Nigeria now has less
than eight weeks' import cover.
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) subsequently allowed the Naira to slide
until it reached N25 to the dollar last month. It has been pegged at this
level but at the cost of a widening premium in the parallel market.
At the last two auctions, the CBN sold Dollars 150m in the face of demand
for Dollars 721m so that banks received 21 per cent of their requirements.
Meanwhile, the free market premium has doubled from 20 per cent at the end
of last year to 40 per cent today.
Exchange controls were tightened early this month when foreign payments on
open account trade and bills for collection were temporarily barred.
The Central Bank also deferred payments on letters of credit until 90 days
after the goods are shipped by suppliers.
The clamp on open account and trade bill payments is justified, the CBN
says, by widespread 'round tripping' and fraudulent payments abroad. It says
it is reviewing payments documentation but no payments will be approved
until April 5.
Bankers believe that up to a half of Nigeria's imports may be financed in
this way and that payments of at least Dollars 1bn have been deferred for
more than a month.
The Nigerian delegation is unlikely to get more than a sympathetic hearing
at the meeting. It will be told that the debt relief Nigeria desperately
needs is dependent on an IMF agreement which is unlikely to be reached until
a newly elected civilian president takes office at the end of August.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Thai stock market speculators charged
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A WEALTHY Thai stock market player and 11 of his relatives and alleged
associates were charged with share manipulation in a Bangkok court yesterday
in the first such case initiated by the newly created Securities and
Exchange Commission.
Mr Song Watcharasriroj, better known as Sia (tycoon) Song, and the others
pleaded not guilty. They were charged with creating the false impression
that there was a high volume of genuine trading in the stock of Bangkok Bank
of Commerce; of failing to report taking a 5 per cent stake in the bank; and
of failing to make an offer for the company when their stake exceeded 25 per
cent.
The SEC and other regulatory authorities, such as the central bank, have
sought to exert more control over Thailand's growing but notoriously
speculative stock market.
Speculators, notably rich housewives, crowd into public dealing rooms of
securities companies each day and treat them as betting shops. Ignoring
fundamental profitability or dividend payments, Thai punters typically
follow big players such as Mr Song in piling into and out of a few chosen
shares. Prices soar or plunge as a result, prompting one stockbroker to
refer to such shares as 'bungee-jumpers.'
Although the move against Mr Song has helped cool the market's speculative
fever - the SET index fell 2.82 points yesterday to close at 903.44 - the
court could take years to conclude the case.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Foreign company jobs lose allure: Robert Thomson on how a
job-for-life tradition is being breached
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Northwest Airlines, the US carrier, offered prospective recruits a
one-year employment contract, with a promise of more if business conditions
improve, there was apparent confirmation this week of Japanese perceptions
that working life at a foreign company can be brief and unpredictable.
Northwest's plan, intended to reduce personnel expenses, follows the
cancellation by Eastman Kodak (Japan) of an agreement to hire eight trainee
engineers, and the introduction of early retirement schemes at NCR and IBM,
the US technology companies, all of which received unflattering coverage in
the Japanese media.
The prominence of the reports has bruised the image of foreign companies,
which have struggled to attract high quality Japanese graduates.
During the US-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks, intended
to remove cultural and other 'structural' barriers to trade, US negotiators
complained that international companies are disadvantaged in graduate
hiring, which is often influenced by old-boy networks and the corporate
preferences of individual professors.
Graduates wanting to join foreign companies also face pressure from their
parents, who often argue they should play safe by joining a famous name such
as Toyota or Matsushita in a country in which employees introduce themselves
first by company name and then by family name - as in 'I am Toyota's Mr
Sato'.
Mr Mark Bedingham, chairman of the European Business Council In Japan, said
students considering a career with a foreign company tend to have three
worries: lifetime employ-ment; whether the company is big enough to offer a
range of career experiences; and whether certain positions will always be
reserved for foreigners.
Having dubbed the trend the 'foreign company disease', Japanese business
magazines have linked personnel policies to news of huge lay-offs at home by
companies such as General Motors and Volkswagen. The presumption is that
foreign companies under pressure in their home markets will increasingly
need to shed staff in Japan.
The Eastman Kodak case has received particularly heavy coverage, even though
about 90 Japanese companies are reported to have breached naitei  - the
agreements to hire students reached before their graduation. Public
criticism of the breaches prompted the Labour Ministry and the Nikeiren, the
employers' federation, to urge companies to honour the often informal
contracts.
Eastman Kodak said on Wednesday that the eight students had each been paid
Y2.5m (Pounds 14,600) as compensation and the company has attempted to find
alternative employers.
Some of the Japanese companies which breached the agreements have yet to be
as forthcoming, and one reportedly did no more than despatch a vaguely
worded letter to students suggesting that their intake was 'postponed
indefinitely'.
'We must accept some criticism. We feel sorry for the eight students, and we
have honestly tried to find them new employment. Two have decided to
continue their studies, two have new agreements, and another two are
negotiating with companies introduced by us,' Eastman Kodak said.
Labour Ministry officials say they are aware of 324 students affected by
broken agreements, but the actual number is likely to be far higher.
Cancelling agreements is in sharp contrast to the unseemly rush to hire
graduates in the late 1980s, when the most pressing corporate concern was a
labour shortage.
The attention on personnel policies could also lessen opportunities for
takeovers by US and European companies, whose acquisitions in Japan more
than doubled last year. Mr Thomas Lynch, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick,
said Japanese employees tend to be nervous about their future on hearing of
a foreign acquisition.
'Foreign companies should address the issue head on. We try to get our
clients to emphasise what they have to offer on employment policies, and the
reaction of the Japanese employees is often 'Oh, that's no so bad',' Mr
Lynch said.

The Oriental Daily, Hong Kong's biggest selling newspaper, Tin Tin Daily,

Anglo-Chinese row and not that of Mr Chris Patten, the governor, Simon
Holberton reports from Hong Kong.
Between them the three newspapers sell about 700,000 copies a day.
The Economic Times said it was 'convinced' that the explanation of recent
events given by Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong, was correct.
Most newspaper commentaries since last Friday have refused to support the
governor in what he describes as his 'principled' stand that talks between
Britain and China could not proceed if Hong Kong officials were not full
members of the UK negotiating team.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Yeltsin will play by the rules: but what are they? - John
Lloyd on the constitutional jigsaw that limits president's options in his
struggle with congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin and his supporters among the Group of Seven
industrial countries have indicated that he should stay within the law in
his bitter power struggle with the conservative Russian Congress.
Though leaving some ambiguity on how far they would support Mr Yeltsin if he
adopted authoritarian powers, most G7 governments and Mr Yeltsin himself
have made clear that the game should be played, as far as possible, by the
rules.
Those rules are the existing constitution of the Russian Federation, a
Soviet-era document adopted in April 1978 and amended nine times before Mr
Yeltsin's battle with congress began.
Last week congress substantially weakened the office of the president by
cancelling its agreement with Mr Yeltsin last December under which a
referendum was agreed for April 11 and amendments to three clauses of the
constitution, to which the president had objected, were frozen.
This has left the president at the pleasure of congress: the amendments now
added to clauses 109 and 121 allow parliament to suspend any presidential
decree pending a revision by the constitutional court, and to sack the
president if he commits an act it deems unconstitutional.
Though the decisions of congress mark a shift in the balance of power
between president and parliament, the problem already existed. Parliament -
the congress and the smaller, permanent supreme soviet - is governed by a
constitution which gives it total power because in the era in which it was
written it was understood that no representative body had any real power
over the Communist party.
Thus the excision of the party from national life has left a Soviet-era
parliament basing its argument for democratic authority on a Soviet era
constitution.
How does Mr Yeltsin break out of this without violating that same
constitution? In particular, how does he take his arguments to the people by
offering them a referendum, or plebiscite, on who rules the country and, as
he wishes, on the private ownership of land? The answer is he probably
cannot, but his advisers will try.
They will base their arguments on the constitution and the law on
referendums. Both give the congress and supreme soviet pride of place in
approving a referendum: the president's men are forced to make four,
apparently rather narrow points.
First, the constitution gives - literally - 'all power. . . to the
multinational people'. Since a referendum asks people's opinion, it cannot
be cancelled.
Second, though the constitution and the law on referendums gives deputies
the right to call a referendum, it nowhere gives them the right to cancel
it: thus they cannot abridge the December agreement.
Third, a referendum can be demanded by the signatures of 1m people (for
which a campaign has started), and the law on referendums and the
constitution state that parliament must then agree to holding it.
Last, article 5 of the constitution allows the 'most important issues. . .
to be put to popular discussion' as a prelim-inary to a referendum. A
plebiscite, it is argued, counts as part of a 'popular discussion'.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister who made his mark as Mr
Yeltsin's legal adviser, sought to talk down the air of crisis when he told
the Russkii Vesti newspaper that 'it should be obvious to everyone that no
extraordinary measures can be taken by anyone - not the president, nor the
congress, nor anyone else'.
It seems that, in the tradition of Russian politics, there will again be a
lull - though perhaps only a short one - before the next storm.

FT  19 MAR 93 / West steps up moves to aid Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the industrialised countries have moved into a higher gear in
mobilising plans for assistance to Russia.
In Washington yesterday Mr Larry Summers, Treasury undersecretary-designate
for international affairs, told Congress that rebuilding the Russian economy
was a task comparable to the post-war Marshall Plan. He said the G7 nations
would have 'significant support' available to Russia 'in the coming months,'
but he disclosed no details.
He argued that past estimates of the Russian economy were largely inaccurate
because they had focused on the volume of output rather than marketable
value. The focus now, he said, should be on facilitating the sale of
marketable Russian goods at home and overseas.
President Bill Clinton, it was announced, would confer next week with Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, before his meeting with
President Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver on April 3-4.
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, is also to give what has been
billed as a 'major' speech on the need for assistance in Chicago next
Monday. It will be designed in part to meet resistance in Congress to any
substantial increase in bilateral US aid.
The administration itself is understood to have under review a series of
measures designed to provide immediate relief to the average Russian and to
demonstrate the extent of US support for Mr Yeltsin.
According to a senior officials quoted in yesterday's Los Angeles Times,
options include emergency shipments of pharmaceutical supplies for Russian
hospitals, more grain and meat shipments, new housing for the Russian
military and proposals to assist the conversion to civilian purposes of
military factories.
Meanwhile the Japanese government is proposing a special meeting of G7
finance and foreign ministers in Tokyo on April 18 to consider a
multilateral Russian aid package. Bowing to western pressure not to delay
such a consideration until the economic summit in the Japanese capital in
early July, Mr Hisashi Owada, the vice foreign minister, is in Washington
conveying the latest Japanese thinking before flying on to Paris.
The April session would take place immediately after the US visit of Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister. Japanese officials still favour a
variety of short term assistance measures, including food and construction
aid, rather than a more ambitious package under G7 auspices, partly on the
grounds that much of last year's Dollars 24bn package has yet to be
disbursed.
Russian economics minister Mr Andrei Nechayev left for Germany yesterday to
discuss further aid to Moscow, particularly supplies of baby food, milk and
other foodstuffs, Itar-Tass news agency said.
Tass said Mr Nechayev would discuss an extension of credits and the purchase
of industrial goods on favourable terms. He was expected to hold talks with
his counterpart Mr Gunter Rexrodt.

FT  19 MAR 93 / France's Socialist party asks election candidates to favour
ecologists

<TEXT>
France's Socialist party has asked its election candidates to stand aside in
favour of ecologists in individual constituencies if greens win more votes
than them in the first round of the general election on Sunday, writes
William Dawkins in Paris. The move is in line with former Socialist prime
minister Michel Rocard's recent appeal for a 'big bang' in French politics,
leading to a grouping of centre-left, human rights and ecology movements.
Candidates winning more than half their constituencies' votes will be
elected automatically on Sunday. But the rest go through to a simple
majority run-off a week later, provided they win more than 12.5 per cent of
the popular vote in the first round.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Amato overruled on public works
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian parliament has rejected the government's efforts to find a
solution to the problem of public works contracts blocked because of
companies' alleged involvement in corruption scandals.
First the Senate and then the Chamber of Deputies yesterday refused to
accept a decree intended to restart work on projects, especially road
schemes, frozen because the companies involved are under investigation for
having paid bribes to political parties to secure the work.
The break in the ranks of the four-party coalition majority over the
corruption issue underscores the loosening grip of party discipline and the
contrary mood of parliament towards the future of the Amato government.
The failure to break the impasse also has severe economic repercussions. Mr
Francesco Merloni, the public works minister, warned yesterday that 40
projects in 11 regions could be closed. For Anas, the roads authority, he
estimated that 30,000 jobs could be at risk.
The main point of controversy in the decree were measures to get round
existing tight rules removing companies from the list of those authorised to
carry out public works. This was strongly opposed by critics of the decree
who regarded it as letting the companies off too lightly.
But parliament, having made itself highly unpopular with the construction
industry by this move, courted it with another.
Yesterday, approval was granted in principle for the L36,400bn (Pounds
16.6bn) project to introduce a high speed train network to connect Milan
through Bologna, Florence and Rome with Naples on a north-south axis, and
Venice through Milan with Turin on an east-west axis.
The high-speed network is to be funded 40 per cent by the state and 60 per
cent by private investors. Different consortiums will construct and operate
different sections of track. The approval is only the beginning of a long
bureaucratic path before work starts and not the least of the problems is
that many of the construction companies intending to be involved in the
project are caught up in corruption scandals. In addition the project
itself, involving such large sums of money, is likely to be subjected to
special scrutiny.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Wary Bundesbank tiptoes forward again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADVANCING slowly and carefully covering its rear, the Bundesbank almost
lived up to market expectations with yesterday's cut in the discount rate to
7.5 per cent.
But not quite. A 0.5 point reduction in both rates had been predicted almost
unanimously by Bundesbank watchers. By leaving the Lombard rate unchanged at
9 per cent, the bank further enhanced its reputation for unpredictability.
More importantly, it opened up a little more room for manoeuvre in its
management of money market rates.
Frankfurt economists pointed out that when rates are moving generally
downwards, the discount rate, the official floor level, was a far more
important indicator than the Lombard. Mr Ulrich Beckmann of Deutsche Bank
Research said that at one percentage point, the gap between the two had been
exceptionally restrictive. The 'normal' gap was 1.75 points.
Mr Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Baer, said leaving the
official ceiling rate unchanged was partly intended to prevent a rapid
appreciation of the US dollar against the D-Mark.
The day's decisions, announced without a showpiece press conference,
suggested that the central bank, assisted by the government/opposition
solidarity deal last weekend, low wage rises and flattening growth in money
supply, feels while not all the political and economic variables are fully
under control, they are less volatile.
If these conditions persisted, inflation continued to improve and the
government spelt out clearly where it will make public spending cuts,
economists said there were few obstacles in the way of a slow and cautious
downward progression in the official rates.
Larger steps - Mr Wolfgang Roth, the Social Democrat opposition economics
expert, called for full one point cuts instead of 'tiptoe steps' - were
widely ruled out on the risks of sharp exchange rate reactions and on the
basis that guarding the stability of the D-Mark was the central bank's prime
mandate.
Although in present circumstances the Lombard rate played 'no role', Mr
Martin Hufner, chief economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, said the central
bank was offering a subtle warning. 'It is making clear it wants to proceed
with small steps, and telling markets: 'Be careful with your expectations
and do not get carried away',' he said.
In contrast to the cautious appraisal of economists, government politicians
were enthusiastic. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, congratulated himself
on his contribution as one of the architects of last weekend's solidarity
pact. The bank's decision would 'give a positive impulse to economic growth
in Germany,' he said.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, called the cut an important signal
which would strengthen the domestic economy's capacity for growth, and at
the same time allow European neighbours' central banks to follow suit and
enjoy similar benefits.
In the wake of last weekend's political deal he said the responsibility for
maintaining stability now lay with wage negotiators who had to ensure that
future pay deals were related to productivity.
However, most economists regarded the dire state of German industry,
underlined by the 87 per cent slump in car-maker Volkswagen's profits,
revealed this week, and February's money supply figures, released yesterday
while the bank's central council was meeting, as far more telling factors in
the decision than the solidarity pact.
Provisional reckonings showed that according to the M3 measure, money supply
contracted again last month, although at a much lower rate than the 2.4 per
cent a year shrinkage in January. Even so, the 0.1 point fall reduced the
annual rate of growth for the six months to March to 5.5 per cent - within
the central bank's target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent.
Economists, sitting patiently before their screens, promptly reworked their
forecasts, concluded that M3 was destined to stay on target, and spoke. Bank
Julius Baer's Mr Grebe went on the record immediately: 'They must do
something.' Less than two hours later, they did.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Six face arrest in Efim fraud inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROME magistrates yesterday issued six arrest warrants in connection with a
fraud inquiry into the activities of the finance subsidiaries of Efim, a
state holding company which was placed in liquidation last July.
The six included Mr Giuseppe Carrapico, a well-known Rome businessman and
owner of Rome football club, and Mr Mauro Leone, the son of the former
Italian president Giovanni Leone and former deputy chairman of Efim.
The arrest warrants were based on a string of fraud charges related to the
activities of Efim's financial services arm, Nuova Safim and its factoring
and leasing subsidiaries, Safim Factor and Safim Leasing in which BNL, the
state-controlled commercial bank, had a minority state until 1991.
The charges centre on alleged irregular leasing contracts for old people's
homes and health clinics, as well as alleged false billings for the supply
of equipment and services.
The investigation came to light last September, shortly after Efim had been
placed into liquidation with debts that are now known to be close to
L18,000bn (Pounds 8.21bn). Safim Factor and Safim Leasing have subsequently
been placed in liquidation as a result of the fraud enquiry. The extent of
losses suffered by Nuova Safim as a result of the fraud has not been
disclosed but it is understood to have been considerable.
At the same time yesterday, the Italian parliament agreed to waive the
immunity of three deputies from Naples accused of vote-buying in last
April's general election.
The three are Mr Francesco Di Lorenzo, the Liberal who resigned last month
as health minister, Mr Alfredo Vito, a Christian Democrat party boss and Mr
Giulio Di Donato, the leading Socialist in Naples.
Both the latter two deputies were yesterday advised they were under
investigation for alleged kick-backs in the privatisation of Naples rubbish
collection.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale: Voters desert the French far right - Le
Pen out of tune as campaign fails to make ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE lights dimmed. Strains of soft choral music filled the room. The
audience leapt to its feet in rapturous cheers. 'Le Pen Vite, Le Pen Vite,'
chanted the crowd ecstatically, as a burly figure swept on to the spotlit
stage, pausing only before the television crews.
Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen had arrived on Wednesday evening at the Pierre de
Coubertin sports stadium in Paris for his last rally of the French
parliamentary election campaign. The leader of France's extreme right-wing
National Front strolled around the stage with the wide smile and
conversational manner of a television chat show host rather than a
politician. The cheers and chants continued all evening. There were boos
whenever Mr Le Pen, his voice hoarse after weeks of speeches, spat out words
such as 'socialist' and applause for every mention of his election slogan
'Clean Hands and Head Held High'.
But there were empty seats in the stadium and the rally, like the rest of
the campaign, was not quite as triumphant for the Front as Mr Le Pen would
have wished.
Until recently the party, with its anti-immigration policies and its
denunciations of the established parties, was one of the fastest-growing
forces in French politics. It gained ground in the opinion polls from its
foundation in 1972 until last year when it won 13.9 per cent of the votes in
the regional elections.
The Front has faltered in the current campaign with the final opinion polls
suggesting it will win 10.5 per cent of the votes. The main reason for the
decline in the polls is the loss of supporters to the Gaullist Republican
Rally (RPR), one of the two centre-right parties. This is due to the
influence of the outspoken Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister in the last
conservative government and a leader of the No faction in last autumn's
Maastricht referendum. Mr Pasqua's patriotic views and his trenchant
criticism of France's economic ties to Germany have struck a chord with the
Front's less extreme supporters.
The audience at Wednesday's rally was a typical mixture of petit bourgeois
Le Pen supporters and skinhead thugs. However, the RPR's success at winning
over the petit bourgeois element poses a serious threat to Mr Le Pen's aim
of mainstream acceptance.
The recent outbreak of skinhead riots in France and violence involving Front
militants are worrying signs that he may be finding it more difficult to
quell the thuggish faction in his party. The Paris supporters were in no
doubt as to who to blame for the party's electoral difficulties. They roared
with derision at the names of prominent socialists and conservatives such as
Mr Michel Rocard and Mr Jacques Chirac.
But the biggest boos of all were reserved for Mr Pasqua.

FT  19 MAR 93 / French finance ministry officials welcome interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Relieved French finance ministry officials yesterday welcomed the interest
rate cut as 'a new gesture in the right direction,' though the move was not
enough to prevent fresh selling of the French currency, writes William
Dawkins in Paris.
The Banque de France left its intervention rate unchanged at 9.1 per cent.
It is believed not to have intervened to try to restrain the franc from
falling at one point to FFr3.4080 against the D-Mark, its lowest for 10
weeks, though still well above the ERM floor of FFr3.4305 per D-Mark. By
afternoon, the French currency had recovered to FFr3.4065.
Economists said it was unlikely the French central bank would follow suit
with a rate cut, given the market's lingering uncertainties over the
monetary policy of the conservative government, expected to win the general
election this month.
Dealers attributed the franc's initial weakness to the fact that the foreign
exchange markets had already discounted an easing in German rates and were
disappointed that it was only a half percentage point cut.
Nevertheless, the Bundesbank move gives French monetary authorities a little
extra breathing space in the final days before an election which some senior
politicians, such as former prime minister Mr Raymond Barre, expect to be
accompanied by a heavy speculative attack on the franc.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Surprise fall in unemployment: Pound rises sharply as
figures boost hopes of economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT fell last month, for the first time in nearly three years. The
unexpected decline sent the pound sharply higher yesterday and raised hopes
that recovery is taking root.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally
adjusted 22,000 in February. The drop was the biggest since November 1989
and kept the unemployment total below the politically sensitive 3m mark.
The Department of Employment said there was no obvious explanation for the
fall, which confounded City expectations of a 35,000 month-on-month
increase.
While welcoming the fall in unemployment, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment
secretary, greeted the news cautiously. 'It would be consistent with
previous recoveries for the figures to be volatile for some time,' she said.
In the House of Commons, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said
he feared the February fall was a 'freak'.
'We are delighted if there are fewer people officially out of work. We hope
it will continue for future months and years. But we do fear it is a freak,'
he said.
Unemployment now stands at 2.97m, compared with 2.99m in January, while the
unemployment rate has dropped from 10.6 per cent to 10.5 per cent. The
unadjusted total dropped 19,451, but remained just over 3m.
Neither the government nor independent economists were willing to read too
much into one month's figures, but the fall added to evidence that interest
rate cuts over the past few months have stirred economic activity.
Building societies, meanwhile, reported that the value of new commitments to
mortgages rose 40 per cent last month, and earlier this week there were
encouraging retail sales and manufacturing output figures.
Prospects for a UK recovery were given a further boost by the Bundesbank's
decision to cut its discount rate by  1/2 a point, providing a more
favourable environment for lower European interest rates.
The fall in unemployment took the currency markets by surprise and the pound
immediately rose 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark. Sterling later closed in
London at DM2.44, up a net 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day and 5 1/4 pfennigs on
the week so far. The pound also rose sharply against the US dollar, gaining
nearly 2 1/2 cents in London to close at Dollars 1.475 and closing later in
New York at Dollars 1.486.
February's drop in the jobless total reflected a reduced number of people
becoming unemployed, rather than a higher number finding jobs or joining
government schemes which take them off the register. Trends still show a
steady increase in the jobless total which is expected to carry on rising
for the rest of this year. The February figures, however, suggest a slowing
at least in the rate of job losses. In the six months to February, the
average monthly rise was 26,700, marginally lower than the 27,700 in the six
months to January.
Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said the unemployment
and mortgage commitments data suggested that the economy was improving.
'It appears that the large rises in unemployment towards the end of 1992
reflected a final shake out by companies in order to get their cost base
under control, rather than a new downtrend in orders and output,' he said.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Life industry to fight OFT plan for rule changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RULES for selling life insurance now in force 'have significantly
anti-competitive effects' and chief aspects of them should be changed, the
Office of Fair Trading ruled yesterday. The chancellor of the exchequer must
now decide whether to implement the OFT's proposals, which the life
insurance industry has vowed to fight.
The OFT urged that independent financial advisers be required to disclose
commissions in cash terms to prospective customers. It also said that
companies should be obliged to:
Tell prospective customers the surrender value of a policy in each year up
to its maturity date.
Use their own charges - and not industry average costs - when illustrating
to prospective customers what their likely returns will be.
Allow low-cost sales outlets, such as building societies, to price their
products more cheaply than other higher-cost agents.
The Association of British Insurers claimed the OFT's proposals would deter
consumers from buying life assurance products, and tilt the balance from
independent brokers in favour of banks and building societies.
Mr Brian Richardson, chairman of the ABI's life insurance council, said:
'There is a very real danger of overkill by regulation and excessive
disclosure which could add significantly to the insurance industry's costs
for very little real consumer benefit'.
Consumer groups, however, greeted the report with enthusiasm. Ms Jean
Eaglesham, head of money policy for the Consumers' Association, welcomed it.
She said: 'The fact that it has taken OFT intervention to provide firm
official support for the Consumers' Association's line reinforces our call
for statutory regulation of the financial services industry. Only then will
investor interests be adequately protected.'
The recommendations follow a year-long review of disclosure rules proposed
by the Securities and Investments Board and the self-regulatory bodies for
the retail financial services industry.
The life insurance industry has faced intense criticism since a SIB report
last year revealed that, in 1990, 37 per cent of unit-linked life policies
and 23 per cent of with profits policies were abandoned within two years.
Criticism was so great that last month the ABI mounted a public relations
campaign, as 'media representatives have attacked the industry by drawing
attention to high surrenders, poor surrender values, apparent high
commissions and expense costs'. The OFT's plans would require more
disclosure in all these areas.
Under the Financial Services Act, the OFT must determine whether the
self-regulatory bodies sufficiently promote competition. The OFT yesterday
also issued a report outlining what it believes are rules necessary to
protect investors.

FT  19 MAR 93 / German rate cut fails to lift European markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday cut one of its key interest rates in a move that
was welcomed by German industry and politicians as an appropriate step to
help the economy out of recession.
However, the decision by the Bundesbank's policymaking council to cut its
discount rate by  1/2 percentage point to 7.5 per cent, received a lukewarm
response in financial markets across Europe.
The French franc came under strong selling pressure inside the European
exchange rate mechanism last night, as investors felt that the cut in rates
had failed to reduce the relative value of the D-Mark against the French
currency. The Bundesbank action also failed to give European stockmarkets
more than a modest lift, although it helped to push up share prices in New
York, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 39 points to
3,465.64.
Investors expressed disappointment that the Bundesbank did not cut its
Lombard rate, which sets the effective ceiling for German rates, and remains
at 9 per cent.
The Bundesbank move underlines perceptions that the central bank has
embarked on a series of reductions in official rates, which could over the
next few months bring down the cost of borrowing across Europe. However,
rapid or large cuts are thought unlikely.
Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the bank's directorate, said that money supply
data released in the morning, and which showed the key M3 measure expanding
at an annualised rate of 5.5 per cent over the past six months, had been the
decisive factor behind the Bundesbank's move. 'The bank has used and will
use its room for manoeuvre on interest rate policy,' he told a diplomats'
meeting in Bonn.
Inside the ERM, the French franc weakened against the D-Mark, falling below
the level of FFr3.41 against the D-Mark for the first time since the start
of this year. It continued to trade at similar levels in New York.
The franc's fall to little more than two centimes above its ERM floor
against the D-Mark raised concerns that the ERM may come under strain
following the first round of the French parliamentary elections on Sunday.
French money market interest rates rose yesterday, raising concerns that
dealers were borrowing the franc to speculate against it. The rate for
borrowing one-month francs rose from 11.3 per cent to 12 per cent.
However, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, said the move
would encourage European neighbours' central banks to reduce their rates and
provide their economies with similar incentives.
Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands all reduced their
official lending rates in the wake of the Bundesbank's move.
In the French finance ministry, the Bundesbank's move was registered as
'positive'. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, said earlier that no
changes in French interest rates could be expected until after the
parliamentary elections, irrespective of what the Bundesbank did.
Yesterday's cut in Germany's official 'floor' rate followed political
agreement last weekend on the framework of a solidarity pact to help
recovery in the east. This may have helped relieve some of the uncertainties
about inflation and Germany's fiscal deficit troubling the Bundesbank's
policymakers.
News that producer prices in February were just 0.5 per cent higher than a
year earlier, compared with an 0.8 per cent rise in January, also indicated
further lessening of inflationary pressure.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Extra help with fuel bills as Major bows to backbenchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of a backbench revolt yesterday forced Mr John Major, the prime
minister, into promising extra help for 10m people on low incomes who will
be hit next year by the Budget imposition of value added tax on domestic
fuel and power.
The move marked a climbdown from earlier indications by Treasury and social
security ministers that compensation would be limited to uprating
income-related benefits in line with retail prices, including fuel costs.
The announcement eased alarm among Conservative MPs but the government
difficulties could be further deepened by separate official calculations
showing that hidden costs of government energy saving schemes could add
nearly 4 per cent a year to domestic fuel and electricity bills, in addition
to VAT.
Last night, there were no figures on how much the package announced by Mr
Major will cost - underlining the haste behind the move. Estimates
circulating among Tory MPs suggested the sum could be as high as Pounds 1bn,
which would have to be found from the public spending total already set for
1994-95.
The government was careful not to promise full compensation for the VAT
extension. It indicated that falling gas prices and the extra boost given to
benefit claimants this year would be taken into account. VAT on domestic
fuel will start at 8 per cent in April 1994.
Details of relief may not be decided until November - unless, as seemed
likely last night, pressure from Conservative MPs forces further
concessions. Some Tories are still pushing for an increase in the basic
state pension. The finance bill will be published immediately after the
Easter recess.
Amid complaints that the government's position had been 'misinterpreted',
the cabinet agreed for Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, to give
interviews to clarify the position. On Wednesday, Mr Michael Portillo,
Treasury chief secretary, appeared to rule out special help above price
indexation saying 'all such issues are made up of swings and roundabouts'.
Yesterday's decision will help 5m people on income support and a further 3m
on housing benefit, council tax benefit or family credit. Cold weather
payments will also be adjusted.
In the Commons, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, accused Mr Major of
'betraying' election promises by extending VAT.
Mr Major did not challenge Mr Smith's calculation that the 'typical' family
will have to pay Pounds 8.50 a week in extra taxes from next April and
Pounds 12.50 a week extra in the following year. But he said: 'I said last
year that we had no plans to raise taxes and nor did we. But we have an
overriding commitment to return the deficit to balance and to take the
action necessary to do that.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAPPOINTMENT that the UK government was unlikely to follow the Bundesbank
in reducing interest rates led to a decline in the Footsie futures, writes
Joel Kibazo.
The last full trading session for the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index
saw it open at 2,889 and it was quickly sold down, setting a day's low of
2,876 at 9.30am. But speculation and hopes that the German monetary
authorities were about to lower rates led to buying of the contract and by
midday it was trading at 2,912, the high for the session.
A subsequent period of sideways trading was followed around lunchtime by the
announcement from the Bundesbank that it was making a  1/2 percentage point
rate cut. This, however, failed to lead to follow-through buying and,
coupled with the lack of a similar move from the UK authorities, saw the
contract relinquish the earlier gain.
March traded in a tight 10-point range for the two hours until the market's
close. It finished at 2,877, once again at a small discount to the
underlying cash market, with turnover a reasonable 11,071 lots.
Today's expiry of the March index options provided the main feature in
traded options, leading to strong volume in the index options. Total
turnover was 32,164 contracts, of which 12,242 were dealt in the FT-SE 100
option and 4,314 in the Euro FT-SE. Asda was the busiest stock option, with
2,865 lots traded.

FT  19 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Spring Ram warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits warning from Spring Ram sent the shares spiralling downward as
they were relisted shortly before midday. As marketmakers struggled to keep
pace with the share price collapse on dealing screens, analysts began the
task of trying to assess the damage ahead of the group's results on Monday.
The shares finally stood at 63 1/2 p, a plunge of 65 1/2 on the day in
extremely heavy turnover of 26m.
Spring Ram warned that profits would be down towards the Pounds 26m level,
against market forecasts of around Pounds 41m. However, with the group being
in its closed period, few details emerged which would indicate the scale or
the exact whereabouts of the problems, according to analysts. One leading
building specialist said: 'The bottom line is which direction are underlying
profits taking. Until the results on Monday, the shares are under a cloud of
uncertainty.'
A bearish move by one of the leading securities houses sent shares in food
retailers into reverse. Dealers said BZW, one of the most prominent names in
the sector, had turned more cautious, with worries over margins following a
bout of aggressive pricing said to be one reason.
While Asda was still garnering favour prior to joining the FT-SE 100 Index,
the shares adding 1 1/2 at 75 1/4 p, the rest of the sector generally took
fright at the bearish talk. Argyll Group fell 12 1/2 to 362 1/2 p, Iceland
Frozen Foods 8 to 731p and J. Sainsbury 3 to 515p, while Tesco ended 9
adrift at 243p in turnover of 8.4m.
Much better than expected preliminary figures and a proposed one-for-one
scrip issue from Schroders, the merchant bank, propelled the stock sharply
ahead and prompted sympathetic gains in shares of the other quoted merchant
banks.
The 18 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 64m was well in excess of market
forecasts, as was the dividend.
Schroders ordinary shares jumped 115 to a record 1890p, while the more
widely held non-voting stock raced up 88 to 1588p, also an all-time peak.
SG Warburg advanced 14 to 617p, Hambros, due to report preliminaries in
June, moved up 4 to 334p and Kleinwort Benson added 6 at 377p.
Barclays and National Westminster continued to outpace the rest of the banks
sector, the latter settling 8 higher at 448p and the former - still helped
by the recent round of presentations to UK institutions - climbing 7 to
412p.
Drugs stocks continued to weaken on fears that the Clinton administration
would freeze prices. Glaxo Holdings slipped 14 to 619p, SmithKline Beecham
10 1/2 to 437p and Wellcome 15 to 887p. However, Boots was strong on the
back of press reports that the UK prescription business was to be overhauled
in favour of larger dispensers. The shares rose 6 to 512p.
Figures from United Biscuits came largely in line with market forecasts, but
a confident statement aided sentiment and the shares put on 10 at 398p.
Results from Guinness were not so well received as the drinks group reported
a downturn in the Spanish beer market. Analysts also predicted a flat time
in the whisky business over the next year and consequently there were few
changes to forecasts. The shares retreated 17 to 468p.
The sharp rise in sterling against the dollar brought British Petroleum's
strong post-Budget run to an abrupt halt, with the shares, which on
Wednesday hit a 16-month high, receding 5 to 299 1/2 p. Turnover in BP was a
good 12m shares, continuing the spell of hefty volume levels in the stock.
Profit-taking affected the exploration and production stocks, Lasmo slipping
3 to 186p and Enterprise 6 to 498p.
The market was cheered by the leap in figures at Legal &amp; General, which sent
the shares sharply forward. They strengthened 16 to 481p in light trading of
2.1m.
The sentiment in L &amp; G boosted several other stocks in the sector. These
included Royal Insurance, 10 up at 318p after 5.5m traded, and Sun Alliance,
also 10 ahead, at 361p.
Heavy selling of the Trafalgar House nil-paid shares left a hefty 11m traded
ahead of today's close of dealing in the stock. A more modest 2.5m was dealt
in the old shares. The nil-paid gave up 2 1/2 to 9p while the old shed 3 to
69 1/2 p.
Business services group BET declined 5 1/2 to 95p on suggestions that Robert
Fleming had downgraded profits expectations. The broker was said to have
reduced its current year estimate by Pounds 8m to Pounds 67m, and made a
deeper cut on the following year's forecast, lowering it by Pounds 14m to
Pounds 96m.
Securities house Kleinwort Benson was reported to be positive on British
Aerospace, where analysts are currently on a visit to the group's Rover car
subsidiary. The shares firmed 2 to 280p.
In motors, good figures at Evans Halshaw lifted the shares 19 to 288p, and
the sentiment flowing from those results led investors into Lex Service,
which helped the stock firm 9 to 319p.

FT  19 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Yorkshire TV talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong rumours that Granada Group is poised to buy a near-20 per cent stake
in Yorkshire Television set the broadcasting sector alight with takeover
talk and sent Yorkshire TV's shares smartly forward. Analysts said they
believed that Granada was negotiating with WH Smith for its Yorkshire TV
stake, with a Pounds 16m price tag being mooted.
Under present legislation there is a 20 per cent ceiling on a shareholding
in television franchise comapanies and a moratorium on full-blown bids until
the end of the year. A Granada move into Yorkshire TV would fit in well with
the former's strategy of expanding its television interests, which privately
it has said would include buying other broadcasting groups.
Granada tumbled initially yesterday as NatWest Securities suggested problems
ahead over the group's large pension fund surplus. However, the Yorkshire TV
stake talk lifted sentiment and the shares finished only a net 4 off at
366p. Yorkshire TV shot forward on the speculation, the ordinary shares
reaching 172p before ending 8 up at 165p. WH Smith 'A' relinquished 10 to
440p.

FT  19 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong pound restrains equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON market's continuing disenchantment with the chancellor of the
exchequer's Budget proposals and an impressive show of strength by sterling
kept the lid on share prices yesterday, in spite of a wealth of highly
encouraging domestic and international economic and corporate news.
The expiry today of the March Footsie futures contract was another factor
cited by dealers as being largely responsible for bringing some of the
unexpected downside pressure to bear on the cash market.
However, not even a constant flow of bullish news, which included the first
fall in UK unemployment figures for 34 months, highly encouraging data on UK
average earnings, unit wage costs and building society lending, proved
sufficient to offset the effect of a rising pound.
The latter was in positive territory all day, anticipating the half-point
reduction in Germany's discount rate, a move said to have been discounted by
the UK market for some days.
The extent of sterling's rise was seen by the market as indicating that
another hoped for reduction in UK rates could still be some way off.
Gilt-edged securities subsequently attracted strong support throughout the
session.
The FT-SE 100 Index settled a net 10.2 lower at 2,879.7, just a fraction
above the day's worst level of 2,879.6 registered only minutes before the
close of trading.
There was better news for the market's second-rank stocks which comprise the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index. Reports of sizeable switching operations out of the
FT-SE 100 and into the Mid 250 stocks saw the latter index finish 7.4 higher
at 3,133.3.
Equity prices were under pressure at the outset, when the Footsie future was
responsible for driving the cash market down by around nine points during
the first hour of trading.
The whiff of a German interest rate cut, however, plus some determined
buying of selected areas of the market - notably the property stocks -
brought about a keen rally which lifted the FT-SE 100 to the day's high of
2,896.7 shortly after midday.
Thereafter, bouts of selling pressure, especially in the leading
international stocks, saw the market retreat to close just off the day's
low. Traders were surprised at the extent of the market's decline,
especially in the face of a strong opening on Wall Street, which was almost
30 points ahead shortly after it opened.
A senior marketmaker at one of the leading UK integrated securities houses
said that the equity market 'now feels much more comfortable' after the 42.7
points decline since the Budget. But he emphasised that the big UK
institutions 'are still mulling over the advance corporation tax and tax
credit changes'.
Turnover of 706.3m shares was described as 'brisk but unspectacular', and
was again heavily weighted in favour of the non-FT-SE 100 stocks, giving
credence to the talk of switching into the smaller stocks. The value of
market business transacted on Wednesday totalled Pounds 1.4bn.
Spring Ram provided one of the session's real features, the shares plunging
after being relisted in the wake of the profits warning. At the close the
stock had halved from its pre-suspension price of 129p; turnover rocketed to
27m shares.

FT  19 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises as inflation
worries are overcome

Wall Street
BIG BOARD stocks rallied strongly yesterday as Wall Street shrugged off
forebodings of shrinking consumer spending and lingering worries about
inflation, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 38.90 up at 3,465.64, after forging
ahead more than 50 points in the afternoon and triggering the New York Stock
Exchange's rules limiting computer-driven programme buying.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 3.58 at 451.89. Nasdaq gains were more
modest, with the composite only 0.01 higher at 687.41, and the American SE
composite also posted a marginal rise, of 0.64 to 421.12. New York SE volume
amounted to 241m shares, and rises led declines by 1,257 to 645.
There was little stock market reaction to the release of data showing a 6.7
per cent drop in exports and a 4.8 per cent decline in imports for January.
In the bond market, however, the numbers sparked speculation that consumer
spending would ease, and contributed to higher bond prices. The drop in the
long bond's yield, and Germany's reduced discount rate, contributed to a
picture of falling interest rates and helped to lift share prices.
Equities also overcame Wednesday's inflation worries following reports that
the core consumer price index rose more sharply than expected.
The Dow rallied in spite of continuing pressure from drug company stocks,
which continued to lose ground yesterday.
Ford Motor climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 51 5/8 .
Analysts at Salomon Brothers increased their 1993 earnings estimates to
Dollars 3.25 a share from Dollars 2.10, reflecting a strong start to the
year by the US automaker. Salomon predicted first-quarter earnings of 80
cents a share, well above its earlier estimate of 25 cents. A year ago, Ford
earned 36 cents in the first quarter.
Anheuser Busch dipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 3/8 in heavy turnover. On
Wednesday, the brewer predicted a decline of about 7 per cent in
first-quarter earnings to 69 cents a share. Although Anheuser had already
warned Wall Street to expect slimmer sales volume, the company's outlook
grew grimmer after a blizzard hit the east coast ahead of St Patrick's Day,
an important time for beer sales.
Western Digital fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 5 7/8 in active trading after
predictions that third-quarter earnings will drop significantly below
analysts' estimates of 20 to 26 cents a share.
Gains in the Nasdaq market were offset by weakness in several healthcare
stocks. Tokos Medical tumbled Dollars 1 3/4 to a 52-week low of Dollars 6
3/4 after predicting disappointing sales. SciMed Life Systems, a medical
device maker, dropped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO closed firmer after fairly heavy trade, underpinned by strength in
US and Canadian bonds and equity gains on Wall Street. The TSE 300 index
rose 18.3 to 3,559.3 and advances led falls by 376 to 266 on volume of 44.5m
shares.

FAVOURABLE reaction to Wednesday's budget helped to lift equities, but late
profit-taking pared some gains. The overall and industrial indices both
added 26 at 3,477 and 4,474 respectively. The golds index rose 8 to 1,077.

FT  19 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses flat as Buba lowers
the floor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'An unchanged Lombard rate means nothing. It's the floor that matters,' said
Mr Marcus Grubb, a strategist at Salomon Brothers in London yesterday, after
the Bundesbank cut the German discount rate by half a percentage point, and
left the Lombard at 9 per cent.
Money market rates, he expected, should continue their decline on this
basis, and bourses should be underpinned by the prospect of consistent
interest rate cuts in Germany filtering through elsewhere, writes Our
Markets Staff,
Unfortunately, for the short term, markets had been discounting a cut of up
to 100 basis points, rather than 50, said Mr Grubb. In London, the FT-SE
Eurotrack 100 index moved from a moderate rise in midsession to a minuscule
one in the post bourse.
FRANKFURT recovered ahead of the Buba cut, the DAX index closing 11.11
higher at 1,696.19. It dipped a little in the aftermarket, with the DAX
future indicating a 4 point fall. Turnover rose from DM6.0bn to DM6.2bn.
Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, noted that the post-bourse
decline was limited, with some falls in financials but industrials more or
less steady. He said that the caution behind the cut, as well as a fall of
0.1 per cent in February's M3 against the January figure, should be good for
the D-Mark and the long term strength of the market.
However, he said, some German equities had risen by 20 to 25 per cent since
last October, and it was likely that the recent consolidation would continue
as investors balanced the interest rate prospect, and strong investor
liquidity against the effects of recession.
PARIS was unmoved by events elsewhere on the Continent and, with no prospect
of an easing in its own interest rates while the franc remains under
pressure in the money markets, the CAC-40 index closed 3.76 lower at
1,963.52. Turnover was strong at FFr3.5bn.
Domestic issues were uppermost in traders' minds as LVMH came in with solid
results, and declared that prospects for 1993 were favourable. The shares
gathered momentum during the day before finishing FFr73 higher at FFr3,442.
However, some analysts remained cautious about the group's prospects, and
maintained a hold recommendation.
Valeo fell FFr32 or 4 per cent to FFr763 following an analysts' meeting
earlier in the week, after which James Capel reiterated its sell note.
Michelin lost FFr5 to FFr171 as the group asked its French managers to take
pay cuts, and Peugeot was down FFr6 at FFr559.
AMSTERDAM cut its own discount rate and the CBS Tendency index climbed 1.4
to 107.6. Ahold went against the trend, falling Fl 2.50 to Fl 95.40, after
surprising many analysts by announcing a 1 for 10 rights issue. Elsevier
improved Fl 2.80 to Fl 129.30 on slightly better than expected results and
Nedlloyd climbed Fl 2.60 to Fl 28.40 on changes to its management structure.
MILAN paused for breath after the turbulence of the last few days, with a
modest rise in the Comit index of 4.48 to 497.22. Some analysts remarked
that Italy was unlikely to follow the Bundesbank's move in the short-term,
partly because of continuing political instability.
Fiat was among the day's gainers, managing to recoup some of its recent
losses with a gain of L76 to L5,426 before adding another L54 in the after
market.
Olivetti, similarly, benefited from the brighter mood with a rise of L58 to
L1,839, while Generali fixed up L320 at L34,900.
ZURICH expected the Buba cut, but the SMI index rose 15.6 to 2,154.1 after
the Swiss National Bank followed with an identical discount rate move.
Financials reacted with Swiss Re and Winterthur certificates both up SFr11,
to SFr595 and SFr695 respectively, and SBC bearers up SFr7 to SFr351.
Among strong industrials, Rieter registered rose SFr30 to SFr1,390 on news
that its textile machinery rival, Saurer, wanted to boost its Rieter stake,
although the latter said it intended to remain independent, while Saurer
said its move was not a takeover attempt. In retailing, Interdiscount
bearers fell SFr85 to SFr1,310 on a slump in profits.
DUBLIN came back from St Patrick's Day in celebratory form, the ISEQ overall
index climbing 28.28, or 2 per cent to 1,421.90 with the financial sector 3
per cent ahead.

FT  19 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Australian equities gain as confidence
returns - Kevin Brown tests the strength of a periodic rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia is in the middle of one of its periodic bull runs. But is this the
beginning of a sustained rally, or will investors lose heart once again, as
they have three times in the last 18 months?
On Monday, it looked as though the bears were back with a vengeance, as the
All Ordinaries index dropped 35 points to 1,626.4 in reaction to the
unexpected re-election of Mr Paul Keating's Labor government.
But heads have cooled in the last few days, and the signs are that the surge
of confidence which has flowed through the market in the last few months is
likely to continue to push prices up, at least for a while.
Last night's close of 1,669.6 was above the pre-election level, and 21 per
cent above the 1992 low in mid-November. The market, however, remains 27 per
cent off its October 1987 peak of 2,300.
Against the background of sustained underperformance in the last five years,
there are plenty of other reasons why investors should be more optimistic
about prospects for the coming year:
The election result removes political uncertainty, and suggests that
Australia is set for a period of consolidation, rather than the industrial
and economic upheaval which might have followed a conservative victory.
The recovery from the 1990/91 recession seems to be gathering pace. The
economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter, and by 2.5 per cent
over the year - one of the fastest growth rates in the OECD.
Inflation is running at an annual level of 0.3 per cent, and the current
account deficit, which at one stage looked likely to retard the recovery,
has recently contracted in line with government forecasts.
The Australian dollar has strengthened significantly in the last few weeks,
and is no longer regarded as a constraint on a further cut in official
interest rates, which the reserve bank is expected to announce shortly. The
improving outlook suggests that the only significant black spot on the
economic horizon is unemployment, which is likely to remain at near-record
levels for some time.
The sea of red ink which has flowed from the books of major Australian
companies in the last two years is beginning to dry up, confirming forecasts
that a recovery in corporate profits is under way.
Some well-known names have continued to disappoint in the current interim
profits season, including TNT and Brambles, the international transport
groups, and resources concerns such as Western Mining and Renison
Goldfields. But many companies have reported significant improvements,
including miners such as North Broken Hill Peko and CRA, food companies such
as Foster's Brewing, Arnotts biscuits ,and Goodman Fielder, and industrials
such as BTR Nylex, Coca-Cola Amatil, and Burns Philp.
The improved results have pushed up prices virtually across the board, so
that 10 of the Australian equity market's 24 sectoral indices now show an
improvement over the last 12 months, compared with three in December. But
many remain only marginally ahead, and the only substantial gainer has been
the media index, which is more than 50 per cent higher, mainly because of
the recovery of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
John Fairfax Holdings, the newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black,
Pacific Magazines and Printing, a spin-off from News Corp, and Mr Kerry
Packer's Nine Network Australia television group have also performed well.
The biggest test may come when the three major banks report their first-half
results in mid-year. National Australia Bank and ANZ are believed to be over
the worst of the bad debt problems which have plagued the sector, but a
question mark still hangs over Westpac, which is restructuring after losing
ADollars 1.5bn last year.
The optimistic view is that all the necessary groundwork for a sustained
rally has been done. However, wary investors will remember that Australian
bulls have been saying that for years.

FT  19 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei presses on to new
high for the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING by individuals, foreigners and investment trusts lifted a wide range
of equities and the Nikkei average gained 3 per cent, closing at a new high
for the year in active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei was finally ahead 554.53 at 18,727.90 after opening at the day's
low of 18,234.37 and soaring to a high of 18,788.30 in the morning session.
Volume swelled to 650m shares from 357m. Life insurers were also seen
participating in active buying.
Advances overwhelmed declines by 933 to 144, with 77 issues unchanged, and
the Topix index of all first section stocks jumped 42.61 to 1,408.26. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index moved forward 7.42 to 1,131.07.
Yesterday's advance took most market participants by surprise. 'Nobody
thought that it would recover this far,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi
Mutual Life. He added that most tokkin funds, or specified money trusts,
held by corporations faced book closing for the financial year today, and
suggested that the rise could have been the result of manipulation by some
investors.
Mr Alan Livesy at Kleinwort Benson said: 'I thought the bear market was
over, but I was not expecting this'. However, he warned that shares looked
overbought.
Mr Yuichi Kohashi, analyst at Daiwa Securities, argued that a rise in money
supply was the force behind the strength in share prices. 'The monetary base
for money supply increased 3.3 per cent in January and 4.7 per cent in
February,' he maintained.
According to chartists, the nearest resistance line for the Nikkei index is
18,908.47, reached last September, followed by 19,345.95, the closing for
the previous fiscal year-end last March.
Securities houses continued to rise on hopes that the recent market advance
would help their sagging earnings. Nomura Securities climbed Y100 to Y1,840
and Nikko Securities Y55 to Y845.
Trading houses were in demand on interest from investors looking to buy
oversold shares, following recommendations by a UK house. Marubeni was the
second most active issue of the day, appreciating Y66 to Y466, followed by
Itochu, Y34 ahead at Y466.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which sparked off the recent rally, added
Y18,000 at Y834,000, while NEC, holder of some 8,000 NTT shares, gained Y14
at Y770.
In Osaka, the OSE average surged 475.25 to 19,595.08 in volume of 69.6m
shares.
Roundup
A NUMBER of the Pacific Rim markets displayed resilience.
HONG KONG made headway, encouraged that China's criticism on Wednesday of
Governor Chris Patten's reform plans was milder than might have been
expected. The Hang Seng index closed 92.93 higher at 6,051.26, although down
from the day's peak of 6,102.72, in HKDollars 3.6bn turnover.
Cheung Kong and its Hutchison affiliate each rose 20 cents to HKDollars 22
and HKDollars 15.90 respectively. They announced higher 1992 profits after
the market closed.
SINGAPORE moved forward for the third consecutive day and the Straits Times
Industrial index rose 6.16 to 1,668.79 in volume of 112.8m shares.
Listed brokerage companies saw renewed interest after Monday's announcement
which allowed workers to use more money from mandatory retirement savings
for personal investment.
TAIWAN saw strong speculative buying of financial issues which helped the
weighted index rise 152.84, or 3.4 per cent, to 4,664.46 in active turnover
of TDollars 64.8bn.
Leading banks, which led last month's rally, were in demand, as were
construction issues on expectations of better profits and dividends this
year.
SEOUL was boosted by late buying of large capitalisation shares in continued
response to the easing of tension between South and North Korea. The
composite index put on 3.34 at 666.39 in turnover of Won645.79bn.
Construction issues were strong on news that Hyundai Engineering and
Construction had received a letter of intent from Libya for a Dollars 1.6bn
contract to build four electrical power generators. Hyundai Construction
shares advanced Won400 to Won18,600.
MANILA lost ground, unnerved by a government warning that power cuts could
reach 12 hours a day as ageing plants become less reliable. The composite
index weakened 20.46 to 1,435.58.
KUALA LUMPUR was mixed to easier in thin trading and the composite index
lost 0.15 at 640.24. Hong Leong Industries, which reported strong half-year
results, moved ahead 35 cents to MDollars 9.15, while Genting rose a further
20 cents to MDollars 15.50 after its better than expected 1992 results.
NEW ZEALAND retreated after the strong run of the last two weeks. The
NZSE-40 index shed 9.95 to 1,580.53.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Strong pressures inside ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH franc yesterday came under strong pressure inside the European
exchange rate mechanism for the first time since January, in spite of a cut
in the Bundesbank's officially posted interest rates, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank's decision to ease its discount rate by 50 basis points to
7.50 per cent had been well anticipated by foreign exchange dealers.
However, the decision to keep the Lombard rate unchanged at 9.00 per cent
was a cause of disappointment.
Some dealers suggested that the Bundesbank's decision not to lower the
Lombard rate, which acts as an effective ceiling for German interest rates,
was a sign that German monetary policy was still being eased very slowly.
The French franc fell as low as FFr3.4120 per D-Mark for the first time
since January 6 this year, closing at FFr3.4100. Its ERM floor against the
D-Mark is FFr3.4305.
A more worrying sign for the French authorities was that the franc slumped
in the ERM grid to -72 percentage points against its central Ecu rate, from
 54 percentage points on Thursday night.
Once a currency drops to -75 percentage points, it is generally accepted
that its central bank needs to respond by tightening monetary policy or open
intervention.
The dollar lost more than a pfennig against the German currency, dropping as
low as DM1.6520 and closing at DM1.6540. Dealers were more encouraged to
sell the US currency on the Bundesbank move, because high German rates still
provide a much better rate of return than US ones. In New York the dollar
fell to a close of DM1.6415.
The only currency to perform strongly against the D-Mark was sterling,
boosted by a surprising drop in the number of people out of work in the UK
in February. Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 22,000 last month,
when the market had been expecting a rise of 35,000.
The pound jumped more than 2 pfennigs immediately after the news broke,
bought by a broad range of foreign exchange operators. The UK currency ended
in London at DM2.4400, up 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day and 5 1/4 pfennigs on
the week so far.
Tensions inside the ERM will dominate over the next few days. 'All the signs
are in place for another big speculative attack inside the ERM in the next
week or so,' said Miss Joanne Perez, an economist at Banque Indosuez in
Paris. But she continued to believe that the French franc would survive the
pressures from the market.
However, the omens for the franc are uncertain. One dealer suggested that
the Bank of France had not intervened to support the currency because of a
need to build up foreign exchange reserves. By contrast, the Bank of Spain
intervened in support of the peseta at Pta71.50 against the D-Mark, although
the currency remains well above its ERM floor.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Money Markets: French cash rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rates in the French franc cash market rose sharply yesterday in
spite of the Bundesbank's lowering of its discount rate by 50 basis points,
writes James Blitz.
The German central bank's decision to cut its effective rate floor to 7.50
per cent from 8.00 per cent had been well anticipated by interest rate
markets in most currencies. Indeed, the June Euromark contract was barely
changed on the day, losing one basis point to close at 93.18.
However, there appeared to be disappointment in both currency and interest
rate markets over the Bundesbank's decision. One London-based analyst said
there was concern that the Bundesbank had not also reduced its emergency
funding, or Lombard, rate, which remains at 9.00 per cent. Others felt that
in an environment in which rates are coming down this was relatively
unimportant.
Activity was mainly concentrated in the French franc cash market, where
rates appeared to be pushed upwards by heavy borrowing of the franc,
possibly for speculative purposes on currency markets.
The cost of borrowing one-month French francs rose from 11.30 per cent to
12.00 per cent during the day, while the cost of borrowing three-month
French francs increased from 10.9 per cent to 11.10 per cent.
French franc futures were also under pressure, with the March contract
falling 7 basis points to finish at 91.18 and the September contract
dropping 8 basis points to close at 92.54.
According to one dealer, the immediate prospects for French rates depend on
whether the Bundesbank now reduces the rate at which it lends funds to
commercial banks, currently at 8.25 per cent.
Both sterling cash and futures markets were relatively unaffected by
sterling's sharp rise against the D-Mark and the dollar on the currency
markets.
In his Budget this week, Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said the
current level of base rates was consistent with the prospect of economic
growth in the UK. Yesterday's fall in the unemployment figures only
confirmed the view that another easing in monetary policy is not needed for
now.
Three-month sterling cash remained unchanged at 6 per cent. The June short
sterling contract ended at 94.27, down 4 basis points on the day.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kalgoorlie Super Pit's future
hangs on pipeline plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Australia's biggest gold mine, the Super Pit at Kalgoorlie,
depends heavily on a proposed 2,000-km gas pipeline to bring cheap energy
from the north of Western Australia.
Mr Ian Burston, chief executive of Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines, which
operates Super Pit, says that his company (which comprises a 50:50 joint
venture between Homestake Australia and Poseidon Gold) would consider
becoming part of a consortium to build and to operate the pipeline in order
to gain the advantages of cheaper electricity.
The pipeline scheme is being heavily promoted by the recently-elected
Western Australian government, which wants it operating in about two years.
The government has made it clear that it will put no money into the scheme
but it will hasten the necessary permitting procedures.
At present the Super Pit is supplied with electricity from Perth, 600 km to
the west, and about half the power drains away because of the distance.
Mr Burston says the present cost of power prohibits the use of conveyors and
other equipment that would enable a substantial increase in Super Pit
production. 'If we could buy electricity from the gas pipeline we could
consider other methods of moving ore out of the pit.'
Last year Super Pit produced 640,000 troy ounces of gold and this year
output is forecast to rise to 660,000 ounces. This will involve moving 56m
tonnes of material. Mr Burston suggests that the present mining methods -
using huge mechanical shovels capable of scooping up 20 cubic metres at a
time and trucks that can carry 200 tonnes in one load  - allow a maximum of
about 60m tonnes a year to be moved.
To boost production beyond that level, in-pit crushers and conveyor systems
would be needed. Mr Burston says conveyor systems capable of carrying huge
loads up very steep angles - necessary because the Super Pit walls slope at
45 degrees - are already available.
Super Pit was the brainchild of Mr Alan Bond, the now-tarnished Perth
entrepreneur who had the idea of amalgamating the small open-pit mines
developed in the area by many different owners. The area also is riddled
with 3,000 metres of underground workings and the Super Pit operators have
to take great care, detecting the voids with radar equipment.
Super Pit already produces more gold and processes more ore than any other
mine in Australia. It will ultimately absorb all of the previous open pits
and many of the shallow underground workings on the Eastern Lode System of
Kalgoorlie's Golden Mile.
When fully developed, the pit is expected to be as much as 4.2 km long, 1.5
km wide and about 500 metres deep, a man-made hole that will be clearly
visible on the moon - but only if KCGM can find a way to open up the present
mining bottleneck.

</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETROLEOS Mexicanos (Pemex), the Mexican state oil company, celebrated its
55th anniversary yesterday by announcing a small increase in oil and gas
reserves to 65.05bn barrels in oil equivalent terms, reversing a ten-year
decline.
Mr Francisco Rojas, Pemex's director-general, announced that new discoveries
had lifted oil reserves by 1.35bn barrels, which, after excluding last
year's extraction, brought a net increase of 50m barrels.
Pemex's production and exports of crude stayed almost exactly at 1991 level
 -total oil and gas production was 3.1m barrels a day, oil equivalent, with
crude oil exports averaging 1.367m b/d.
Both President Carlos Salinas and Mr Rojas strongly defended Mexico's
constitutional block on foreign oil companies receiving oil in return for
drilling work. 'Those obtaining service contracts without exception receive
a payment, or an incentive for productivity, in money. No resources, no
products will be transferred.' said Mr Rojas.
The director-general offered little evidence of progress in the oil
company's attempt to divide itself into four separate business units -
production and exploration, refining, gas and basic petrochemicals and
secondary petrochemicals.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombian coffee thrives in
free market - Growers are losing enthusiasm for a return to export quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH Colombia remains strongly committed to uniting coffee producers and
negotiating a new price-stabilisation pact, the country has done
unexpectedly well in the free market.
Last year it gathered a record harvest and achieved unprecedented exports,
earning more from worldwide green coffee sales than any other producer. That
very success - achieved at the expense of the National Coffee Fund's
resources - has stimulated a growing anti-pact lobby that is arguing for
fundamental changes in national policy.
The adjustment to the free market may have been less traumatic for Colombian
coffee growers, but the real price paid to farmers is the lowest in 10 years
and the external price is the lowest in the history of the republic. The
savings that made it possible to keep the domestic price from slipping
further have been exhausted - the minister of finance warned recently that
there could be no discussion of any increase until after the International
Coffee Organisation meeting in London next week.
'Since the pact broke up world prices have been three times as unstable,'
says Mr Diego Pizano, international adviser to the Federation of Coffee
Growers. 'During the pact, prices went up and down by 12 per cent, but in
the free market they have fluctuated by 35 to 36 per cent. This also affects
the industry and the consumers. Some of the big companies would prefer to
pay a decent price for coffee now, rather than see quality fall, which would
affect consumption.'
There are still many points of dissension between producing and consuming
countries with little negotiating time left. Producers have found it
particularly difficult to assess the US position and feel they are making
all the concessions - hence the reference in a document agreed at producer
meeting in Mexico City this month to 'the lack of flexibility' of consumers.
The March 31 deadline set by the ICO council could be extended by a few days
if next week's talks are going well, but Brazil and some of the central
American countries are clearly growing impatient with the process.
Although producers have accepted that there should be a universal quota
(covering all exports, not just those to ICO consumer members) and
'selectivity' as to the proportions of different coffee types within the
quota system, they want provision for a review after the first coffee year
under the new pact to allow fine tuning. They also support four groups of
coffee - with Colombian milds, which commands a 7 to 8 per cent premium,
separated from 'other milds' - while the US argues for three groups. Other
problems include the definition of the voting majority for council decisions
and, above all, the duration of the agreement.
'In the short term, the pact won't change the situation. It will start to
operate positively for stability in the longer term - is it worth signing a
pact for three years as the US wants? There's no point, it would be a big
mistake,' says Mr Gabriel Rosas, director of the Association of Private
Coffee Exporters. The producing countries are aiming for an agreement
lasting five to six years.
If the pact is to be structured so that it reflects market conditions,
reasons Mr Rosas, there is not an enormous difference from Colombia's point
of view - policies must anyway be market-oriented and the agreement should
be a means, not an objective in itself. Others criticise Colombia's pursuit
of the pact more energetically, arguing that it is better to sell as much
coffee as possible than to accumulate stock and benefit from slightly higher
prices.
Colombia exported 16.5m bags in 1992 with earnings of USDollars 1.3bn. This
year's exports are expected to be nearer average at 13.5m bags, and
Colombia's quota in a new coffee pact would be about 18 per cent - several
points higher than it was in the last pact.
This year's production will be affected by the spread of the coffee berry
borer, known as broca. The release of bees to attack the tiny beetle and a
fungus to suffocate it form part of the massive anti-broca campaign. This
extra drain on funds comes at a time when growers are striving to reduce
spending on inputs and disease control.
Meanwhile the coffee federation's efforts to take up to a tenth of the area
planted with coffee out of production are making slow headway. 'We can
probably reduce by 30,000 hectares but the plan for 100,000 hectares looks
difficult,' says Mr Pizano. 'The alternatives for growers are not attractive
 -for example, the price paid for passion fruit has dropped. Coffee gives a
guaranteed income and a small farmer can't risk losing that.'
Coffee now contributes about a fifth of Colombia's foreign earnings,
compared with 50 to 60 per cent during the 1970s. 'In macro-economic terms
coffee is less important - but it is still very important from the social
and employment points of view. And the coffee sector weighs heavily in terms
of domestic demand,' said Mr Rosas. 'Colombia needs a solid long term
policy. Producers cannot go on thinking of the pact as the answer to their
problems.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ministers reject French demands
on fish imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN community fisheries ministers yesterday rejected French demands for
a 30 per cent rise in minimum import prices on white fish and total ban on
Russian cod imports, opting instead for stricter enforcement of the floor
prices and controls put in place last month.
France, which got backing only from Ireland for its demands for stronger
checks on the flood of imports depressing fish prices, said immediately it
would re-present essentially the same demands to the European Commission
next week under the guise of 'emergency safeguard measures'.
But Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, EC fisheries commissioner, is understood to
regard yesterday's ministerial decision as adequate for the time being.
France's raising of 'safeguard' action was 'greeted in total silence' inside
the Council of Ministers, EC officials said.
Breton fishermen's leaders said they would 'continue the struggle' that has
led to often violent protests across France, while Scottish fishermen's
leaders dismissed yesterday's meeting as 'a non-event' with 'absolutely no
conclusions which will help us at all'. Some 200 French, and a few dozen
Scottish fishermen, demonstrated to reinforce their demands, their numbers
diminished by the arrest of three bus-loads of fishermen 30 miles south of
Brussels for allegedly carrying sticks and flares. Brussels' Charlemagne
building, where ministers meet, was completely cut off by a cordon of razor
wire, manned by one of the heaviest deployments of riot police of the past
two years.
The ministers concluded that the minimum import prices, controls on direct
landings of fish from non-EC vessels, and hygiene standards - which could
filter out part of the large quantity of Russian fish coming into the
community disguised as EC fish and via Nordic countries with preferential
tariff deals - were not being properly applied, and had not been given time
to work.
Although they left open the possibility of extending the floor price regime
to other species - at present it applies primarily to cod, haddock, whiting
and monkfish - they ruled out more radical measures.
'I think today we have gone as far as we could go,' said Mr David Curry, UK
fisheries minister. 'We've already agreed minimum import prices, and what's
happening is that they're not being enforced.' Mr Curry, had said on the eve
of the meeting that Denmark, Germany, and possibly the UK were still failing
to filter out cheap Russian fish.
Under these circumstances, he said, 'there is no point in multiplying the
rules'. Increasing the floor price, moreover, would 'give a greater
incentive for the fraud', he added.
An aide to Mr Charles Josselin, the French fisheries minister, said
judgments differed about the depth of the crisis, which has led to a
collapse in fish prices of 30 per cent and more. 'If the community does not
adopt these measures, the market will not be corrected,' he said.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US bank files claim for Dollars
200m on CIS grain loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US co-operative bank that represents farmers, utilities, and other
business in rural America has filed claims to recover Dollars 200m in failed
loans for exports to the former Soviet Union.
Russia has made only one payment on its US grain loans since late November
and was Dollars 526m in arrears this week. While Chicago wheat prices have
rallied sharply since Monday on hopes that the US and Russia might reach a
bi-lateral debt accord to reschedule the grain loans, the huge claim by
CoBank shows that bank, at least, has lost faith that the debt problem will
quickly be resolved.
CoBank, a Denver, Colorado-based financial co-operative with Dollars 12bn in
assets and 3,000 rural shareholders, is the Commonwealth of Independent
States' largest creditor in the GSM-102 programme for government-guaranteed
grain loans. CoBank holds Dollars 1.7bn guaranteed loans to the CIS, or
about 40 per cent of the Dollars 4.2bn in grain loans written in the
three-year programme.
Mr Jack Cassidy, CoBank's senior vice president for corporate relations,
said the bank delayed filing its claims on the CIS loans for as long as
possible. 'Our view was the Russians have the willingness, desire, and
capacity to repay over the longer term.' He added, however: 'It has become
obvious that the US government is unwilling to reschedule the debt
unilaterally'.
Despite high-level talks between US and Russian officials on the grain debt
two weeks ago, and several hints by Mr Mike Espy, US Agriculture Secretary,
that a Russian grain programme was being planned, there has been no movement
on debt rescheduling. The US Department of Agriculture seems to prefer
outright grain donations, which farm interests believe are no substitute for
re-opening the Russian export market.
'Our primary interest in this is moving grain for our shareholders,' said Mr
Cassidy. 'We would like to see that market re-open.' Russia, he said, was up
to date on its loan payments to CoBank. However, the US loan programme also
holds Russia responsible for all the debts of the FSU.

COPPER fell back from its highs during late LME trading as selling bore down
on the market. Resistance emerged around Dollars 2,210 a tonne for
three-month metal, which represents the ceiling of the current Dollars 40
trading range, and the market eased back to end at Dollars 2,198, still up
Dollars 20. The market's strength reflected widespread buying interest,
linked to supply-side concerns. Zaire's political situation is
deteriorating, there are labour problems at Chile's Chuquicamata and recent
falls in Comex stocks suggest output losses in Arizona early this year might
be larger than initially thought. GOLD edged back above Dollars 330 a troy
ounce on the London bullion market, but appears stuck in its current range
between Dollars 326 and Dollars 333. 'There has been some short-covering,
but it was capped by producer selling,' one dealer said. In New York raw
SUGAR prices were on the rise by midday on renewed technical buying and
continued sentiment that world supply is tightening.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK acts to halt gold VAT fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK AUTHORITIES are taking action to stop the so-called 'missing trader'
fraud which involves gold bullion and coins and is costing about Pounds 50m
a year in lost tax.
Traders have been importing or smuggling gold from countries where the tax
is low and then selling it in the UK inclusive of 17.5 per cent value added
tax. They then disappear with the VAT instead of paying it to the Customs
and Excise. Moreover, traders who buy the gold remain entitled to reclaim
the VAT they have paid.
Scope for this fraud has increased with the introduction of the European
single market. Luxembourg has no tax on gold bullion and coins, while the
Belgium's rate is only 1 per cent.
In the UK arrangements come into force next month whereby the seller of gold
bullion or coins will issue the usual VAT invoice but the buyer will pay the
tax directly to Customs and Excise.
The most notorious recent gold VAT fraud case lasted ten months and ended in
October with the conviction of three people who had conspired to cheat the
taxman of Pounds 5m.
The prosecution showed how a gang of highly organised smugglers took Pounds
35m of gold bullion from Luxembourg to the UK using specially-adapted cars -
when one of the defendants was stopped her vehicle was found to have 50 kg
of gold in the bumper supports and behind the horn.
The smugglers linked with jewellers in London who reclaimed the VAT on the
gold and they split the proceeds.
This is not the first time the UK authorities have had to deal with gold VAT
fraud on a massive scale. In 1979, when UK exchange controls were ended, VAT
was charged on bullion bars but not on gold coins. Fraudsters made a killing
by melting down coins, turning them into crude bars and claiming the VAT
when the bars were sold.
To prevent this fraud, in 1982 VAT was imposed on gold coins, a move which
virtually killed off UK interest in this form of investment.
Customs and Excise points out that the changes to take place next month
apply only to sales of gold between VAT registered traders. Tax on
non-business supplies of gold will continue to be charged and collected in
the normal way by the seller. There is no change to the arrangements for
supplies on the London Bullion Market, which are zero-rated.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Disappointment at marginal cut in German
discount rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and KAREN ZAGOR

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government bond market fell on disappointment at the Bundesbank's
move to lower the discount rate yesterday by only 50 basis points, though
other core European bond markets saw rate cuts in the wake of the German
move.
Long-dated UK government bonds also bounced higher yesterday on a surprise
fall in unemployment figures, continuing a rally that has picked up after
Tuesday's Budget.
The Bundesbank's cut in the discount rate to 7.5 per cent, together with the
decision to leave the Lombard rate unchanged at 9 per cent, disappointed the
bund market, which had hoped for a cut in both official rates. Although the
move lowers the floor for official money market rates, which currently stand
at 8.25 per cent, it was taken to reflect the Bundesbank's intention of
resisting pressure for cuts in interest rates too soon.
The German announcement was followed by rate cuts in Denmark, Switzerland,
Belgium and the Netherlands. Rates in France remained unchanged as the franc
weakened and 10-year bond prices slid by a third of a point.
On Liffe, the June bund futures contract opened at 95.95 and climbed to
96.05 before the Bundesbank news. The contract then slipped to 95.50, before
gaining some ground to end the day at around 95.77.
GILTS, meanwhile, bounced by nearly a point at the longer end of the yield
curve, as the market seized on signs that the UK economy was picking up,
though not in a way that threatened a rise in inflation.
Unemployment levels fell for the first time in three years, adding momentum
to a market already buoyed by the firmer pound. The June long gilts contract
on Liffe opened at 106 3/32 and closed at 107, around its highs for the day.
The 9 per cent gilts due 2008 jumped by three quarters of a point, pushing
the yield down to 8.06 per cent.
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at Warburg Securities, said: 'A strong
pick-up in the economy will take some of the sting out of the public sector
borrowing requirement. What the market is looking at is non-inflationary
growth, and it likes what it sees.'
The strength of the market fuelled expectations that the Bank of England
could today announce a gilt auction. Under the new 10-day notice period,
announced at the time of the Budget, this would allow the Bank to complete
an auction by March 31, ahead of the start of the new financial year.
Current demand suggests it would auction either 10-year bonds, to meet
demand from foreign investors, or longer-dated paper aimed at UK
institutions.
US TREASURY prices rose across the board yesterday, lifted by a
follow-through of Wednesday's late buying and supported by decreasing
imports and exports in the January trade deficit data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 1/32 at 104
9/32 , yielding 6.786 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was  3/16 higher to yield 3.839 per cent. Bullish investors were
encouraged by a commerce department report of slower exports and imports for
January, which gave some weight to the theory that consumer spending would
weaken.

THE Republic of Finland finally launched its long-rumoured Eurosterling
issue yesterday, raising Pounds 500m worth of 10-year Eurobonds.
The bonds, which carry a coupon of 8 per cent, were priced at 97.45 to yield
60 basis points over the 8 per cent UK government bond due 2003.
The view in the market was that the pricing of Finland's issue was tight,
and that the spread should have been at least 10 basis points wider in order
to compensate for Standard &amp; Poor's decision last week to cut the country's
credit rating by two notches, to AA-minus.
Spreads on Finnish paper in the secondary market have widened since the S&amp;P
down-grading.
Syndicate managers said that existing Finnish paper yielded between 45 to 50
basis points above Libor, but that yesterday's issue yielded only 30 basis
points above Libor.
Other factors hampering the deal included Finland's frequent borrowings in
the international bond market over the past year and the recent developments
in the former Soviet Union.
An official at the joint lead manager, SG Warburg, said that the Finland
deal was slower to place than Abbey National's Pounds 650m 10-year Eurobond
issue, which was launched last week. But he added that, so far, demand
outside the UK for the bonds had been good. When the bonds were freed to
trade, they were quoted at 97 1/2 bid to yield 65 basis points over the
underlying gilt.
Ms Inga-Maria Grohn, financial councillor at the Treasury Management Unit of
Finland's finance ministry, said that yesterday's issue was part of the
country's 1993 borrowing programme. The proceeds of the issue would be left
in sterling, but a decision had not yet been taken on whether to swap the
interest rate from fixed to floating, she said.
She expected Finland to raise between Dollars 9bn to Dollars 10bn this year
in the international market, slightly below last year's Dollars 11bn-Dollars
12bn, since the ministry had taken a decision to look more to the domestic
market. 'Last year, about 60 per cent was raised abroad and 40 per cent
domestically, but we would like to have more of a balance,' Ms Grohn said.
Also in the Eurosterling sector, HSBC Holdings increased Wednesday's Pounds
200m issue of subordinated Eurobonds due 2018 by Pounds 50m to satisfy
demand from overseas, especially from east Asia. The new portion was priced
at 99.022 to yield 145 basis points above the 9 per cent UK gilt due 2012,
compared with a price of 98.692 and a yield spread of 150 basis points on
the original amount.
An official at the lead manager, Samuel Montague, said the tighter pricing
on the new portion was designed to show goodwill to UK institutions, which
are concerned about long-dated issues being increased. Yesterday, the bonds
were trading at 99.70 bid, giving a spread of 146 basis points over the
underlying gilt.
The Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount rate prompted a further wave
of reverse floating rate notes in D-Marks and in French francs.
Credit Local de France's FFr500m was almost entirely pre-placed with
continental investors, who expect French interest rates to fall after the
election, said an official at the joint lead manager, CCF.
Elsewhere, good demand for short-dated paper in the Eurodollar sector
enabled Landesbank Schleswig Holstein Girozentrale to increase its
three-year Eurobond issue to Dollars 250m from an initial Dollars 200m. The
bonds were priced to yield 28 basis points over comparable US Treasuries
and, when they were freed to trade, the spread tightened slightly.
Ontario Hydro plans to launch a global Canadian dollar bond with a five-year
maturity early next week.
The deal is expected to raise CDollars 1bn and will be arranged by Goldman
Sachs, IBJ, RBC Dominion Securities and ScotiaMcLeod.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Credit institutions cool on
role in funding PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS and building societies are unlikely to play a central role in helping
to fund the UK's growing public sector borrowing requirement, a Bank of
England official said yesterday.
His comments came as UK credit institutions remained lukewarm about a change
announced in Tuesday's budget - that gilt sales to banks and building
societies would count towards the funding of the borrowing requirement in
future.
The institutions said that current conditions made it extremely unlikely
they would become substantial buyers of gilts.
The Bank official said: 'We're not thinking of angling gilts at them. What
we'll do is sell gilts to all-comers and, if they want to buy them, fine.'
He added, though, that there were likely to be issues of shorter-dated gilts
over the coming year which would prove more attractive to banks. 'I would
envisage that there would be some short-dated debt of five years or even
four years. That averages out the cost.'
The official said that the Pounds 5.5bn of gilts sold to banks in the 11
months to February this year could be counted as funding in any of the next
two or three years, should there been any need to 'top-up' the funding in
the future.
This buffer, together with the Pounds 3bn due already next year on
partly-paid stock and the change in the funding rule, meant that the Bank
had a head-start on reaching next year's target of Pounds 50bn, the official
added.
The chancellor announced on Tuesday that gilts sold to banks and building
societies would count towards funding, but that there would not be a move to
'under-funding'. This meant that it was very unlikely that there would be
sales of short-dated instruments, such as Treasury bills, to fund the PSBR,
the Bank official said.
Speaking after the budget, Mr Roger Little, director in charge of dealing at
Abbey National, said: 'It doesn't give us any more incentive to buy gilts
than before.'
Others said that they were unlikely to buy longer-dated gilts. 'I cannot
believe the Bank wants to force banks to buy the sort of long-term gilts
which they believe are unacceptably risky,' said Mr Peter Wood, finance
director of Barclays Bank.
The shape of the UK yield curve - five-year yields are only just above
money-market rates - also removes the attraction for banks of moving further
down the yield curve.
Mr Richard Goeltz, chief financial officer of National Westminster Bank,
said British banks would require a more attractive yield on two- or
three-year bills if they were to start increasing increase their portfolios
substantially.
He said the Budget had contained 'nothing that would lead us to start
building a portfolio of gilts tomorrow'. He added that the bank would have
to be more confident of yields on medium-term gilts to start taking the
capital risk.
A wider differential in the US bond market between money-market interest
rates and short-term bond yields encouraged US banks to take their holdings
of government bonds up to nearly Dollars 700bn at the end of 1992, from
about Dollars 450bn two years before. This has helped both to fund the
government borrowing requirement and guarantee the banks a healthy profit to
rebuild their depleted capital resources.
The Bank met gilt-edged marketmakers on Wednesday evening to discuss its
plan to switch to a monthly auction for 1993/94 while retaining considerable
flexibility in its funding policy.
Representatives of the marketmakers who attended the meeting said that they
were generally content with the Bank's approach, although there remained
calls in some quarters for a switch to larger and less regular auctions or a
fixed auction calendar.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sharp upturn for Swire Pacific -
Hong Kong Results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPARKLING year for property development helped Swire Pacific, the Hong
Kong-based aviation, property and trading group, boost 1992 net earnings
43.5 per cent to HKDollars 4.4bn (USDollars 570m) from HKDollars 3bn in
1991.
The result, which was at the top end of analysts' expectations, was achieved
on a 16 per cent rise in turnover to HKDollars 38.9bn from HKDollars 33.6bn.
Cathay Pacific, the airline, contributed about HKDollars 1.5bn to profits
both last year and in 1991.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said Swire Properties' profits had been
substantially higher than in 1991. This reflected significant increases in
income from the office, retail and residential parts of its showcase Pacific
Place development on Hong Kong island.
He said Swire Properties had earned exceptional profits of HKDollars 998.2m
from the sale of some office and residential properties, and the sale of an
option to buy a property to Sun Hung Kai Properties. Analysts said the
property group's contribution to operating profits rose by 114 per cent.
The industries division performed well last year, and strong growth was
expected in 1993, Mr Sutch said. Swire Bottlers in Hong Kong had a
successful year and was benefiting from the centralisation of its bottling
in a single plant. The US and China both performed well, he added.
The trading division's profits edged ahead, with improved performance from
all its main businesses, particularly those in Taiwan, he said.
Swire Properties' property investment portfolio had grown and continued
growth in rental income was expected. Mr Sutch repeated his warning that
1993 was likely to be a more difficult year for Cathay Pacific than 1992,
but overall the outlook for Swire Pacific was encouraging.
The directors declared a final B share dividend of 14.8 cents a share,
making 20.6 cents for the year - a rise of 15.7 per cent over 1991. The
final A share dividend was 74 cents a share making HKDollars 1.03 a share -
up 15.7 per cent.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hutchison Whampoa declines 5% -
Hong Kong Results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUTCHISON Whampoa, the troubled Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li
Ka-shing, yesterday posted a 5 per cent fall in profits before
extraordinaries to HKDollars 3.16bn (USDollars 410m) for 1992, from
HKDollars 3.32bn the year before.
The slightly better-than-expected results were struck on a 9.5 per cent rise
in turnover to HKDollars 21bn from HKDollars 19.2bn.
Profits after extraordinary items, meanwhile, fell to HKDollars 3bn from
HKDollars 4.3bn. An extraordinary loss arose from the closure of certain
'peripheral overseas telecommunications operations' and a provision against
an associated company.
Hutchison declared a final dividend of 39 cents a share, making 55 cents for
the year - a 19 per cent cut on the payout in 1991. Mr Simon Murray,
managing director, said 1993 would prove a turning point in Hutchison's
fortunes. 'I think we will do very well in 1993; it is going to be a good
year.'
Mr Murray scotched rumours that he was about to resign from the company. The
rumours had made 'good gossip', he said, but were far from the truth.
'I am here, and Mr Li has not given me any indication that he wants me to
go.' Separately, Mr Li said yesterday he and Mr Murray were 'still working
happily' together.
Mr Murray said that if provisions against Hutchison's investment in Husky, a
Canadian oil and gas producer, were added back, profits before
extraordinaries would have been HKDollars 4.6bn, 15 per cent higher than in
1991. He predicted that Husky, in which Hutchison holds 49 per cent, would
earn profits in 1993. In the year under review, it incurred a modest loss
but, he noted, was generating free cash-flows of CDollars 200m (USDollars
161m).
On Hutchison's telecommunications investments, Mr Murray said its 64 per
cent owned UK company had made a loss and would incur a larger loss in 1993.
It is launching a mobile telephone network in the UK and has invested Pounds
300m (USDollars 435m) of a planned Pounds 800m in the venture. British
Aerospace holds 30 per cent and Barclays Bank 5 per cent in the company.
Mr Murray stuck to his view that the UK venture would show excellent profits
by 1995. Many analysts believe Hutchison has taken a big risk with the
business, saying it has large costs and unproven technology.
Mr Li emphasised Hutchison's efforts to invest in mainland China during
1992. Direct foreign investment in China had become easier and more
attractive, he said.
Hongkong International Terminals, Hutchison's container port operator, had
signed joint venture agreements with the authorities in Zhuhai and Shanghai
to develop port facilities.
He said Hutchison was focusing on developing retailing and manufacturing in
selected cities in China. It was also pursuing property development projects
in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Qingdao.

<TEXT>
HONG Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), the Swire-controlled civil
aviation maintenance company in Hong Kong, yesterday said it had reached
agreement to construct and operate a USDollars 63m aircraft maintenance
facility at Xiamen in China.
Haeco will join with the China Xiamen Corporation for International
Techno-Co-operation (CXIC) to form Taikoo (Xiamen) Aircraft Maintenance
Company (Tamco).
Haeco will take 41 per cent of the joint venture, Cathay Pacific will take
10 per cent and CXIC 20 per cent. Ownership of the remaining 29 per cent of
the equity has yet to be placed.
The facility in Xiamen - a special economic zone in Fujian province - will
consist of a hangar capable of accommodating two Boeing 747s, together with
supporting workshops. It is expected to be operational in 1996 and will be
financed equally by equity and bank loans.
Mr Shi Zhao-bin, secretary general of the Xiamen Communist party, said that
the local government would make every effort to ensure the 'smooth
implementation of the project'.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japanese brokers declare a
new-found confidence - Doubts remain about the durability of the rally on
the Tokyo stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN executives of Japan's leading brokerages paraded through the stock
exchange building yesterday, announcing downward revisions of optimistic
profit forecasts, they tentatively suggested that the worst of the
three-year stock crisis may be over.
The revisions left only Nomura Securities expecting a net profit this year,
a modest Y2bn (Dollars 17m), but the figures were not as unsightly as was
likely in early February, when daily turnover on the Tokyo exchange was a
mediocre 200m shares and the government intensified its campaign to prop up
stock prices.
Japanese brokers' new-found confidence comes from an unexpected surge in
trading volumes this month and from a turnaround in their own share prices.
However, doubts remain about the rally's durability, and there are fears
that a large wave of selling will knock the market down again when the new
fiscal year begins on April 1.
'It is difficult to predict the future, but things may be getting better,'
said Mr Takashi Emmei, vice-president of Yamaichi Securities, which expects
a pre-tax loss of Y39bn, following on a Y53.2bn setback in the previous
year. It had forecast earlier that it would break even this year.
Like the other Big Four brokers, Yamaichi's losses would be larger but for
the stock market's renewed vigour and the robustness of the domestic bond
market. Nomura expects profits of about Y35bn from its bond operations and
will be helped by a Y18.48bn extraordinary profit on the sale of an Osaka
office building to another member of its group, Nomura Land and Building.
Despite yesterday's announcements, brokers' final results will be heavily
influenced by the movement of the Nikkei index over the next two weeks. The
higher the year-end close, the lower the amount they will be forced to
write-off as stock appraisal losses, which a friendly finance ministry
allowed them to defer at the end of the first-half.
These write-offs could be particularly damaging for the 10 second-tier
brokers. They forecast losses ranging from Y9.2bn at Tokyo Securities to a
daunting Y50.3bn at Kankaku Securities, which had previously expected a more
modest loss of Y21bn.
The second-tier brokers are more reliant on commissions, making their
profits more vulnerable during periods of weak prices and turnover. At it
lowest moments this year, turnover was one-tenth of that seen during the
'bubble' years of the late 1980s.
Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist at Credit Suisse Research Japan,
said the recent surge in turnover was due partly to increased interest in
shares, but brokers were also trading heavily on their own accounts and
public funds were still being pumped into the market. She said that, at
present income levels, one of the mid-sized brokers would have to cut staff
by 90 or more per cent to ensure a profit.
Until now, Japanese brokers have announced 'restructuring' plans seemingly
based on expectations of a market turnover of around 400m shares a day, far
above the level for much of this year. If the houses interpret the present
revival of the market as a reason to delay deeper cuts in expenses, they
will find it difficult to avoid a third year of embarrassing losses.
But Mr David Snoddy, financials specialist at Jardine Fleming, said the
brokers were fortunate in that, unlike Japanese banks, their problems were
to be found in the profit and loss statement, not on the balance sheet.
'It's easier to address the P&amp;L problem - they just have to keep cutting
costs.'

MOODY'S Investor Service, the US ratings agency, has lowered credit ratings
of three Japanese trust banks due to continued asset-quality problems.
Property-related loans have exposed the country's trust banks to increasing
bad loans, while heavy reliance on asset-management businesses focusing on
property and stocks has depressed their core profits.
Moody's lowered the long-term rating of Mitsui Trust and Banking to Baa2
from A3. Mitsui is providing financial aid to Dai-Ichi Real Estate and its
affiliates.
The senior debt rating at Toyo Trust and Banking was lowered to Baa1 from
A3. Moody's said Toyo might have to make large provisions on its bad loans,
placing significant pressure on its already weak earnings.
Yasuda Trust and Banking long-term ratings were downgraded to Baa2 from A3,
while short-term ratings were lowered to prime-3 from prime-2.

<TEXT>
MANDARIN Oriental Inter-national, the Jardine-controlled hotel group,
yesterday reported an 8 per cent rise in net 1992 earnings to USDollars
40.3m from USDollars 37.5m in 1991.
Turnover rose 16.5 per cent to USDollars 148.4m from USDollars 127.2m. The
company will pay a final dividend of 3.59 cents a share, making 5 cents a
share for the year - the same as in 1991.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said 1992 marked a return to profit growth for
the company. He said the start to 1993 was encouraging and in line with
expectations.
Turning to 1992, Mr Keswick painted a picture of uneven performance
throughout Asia. Its hotels in Hong Kong and Philippines witnessed a pick-up
in business.
In Thailand and Indonesia, they fared less well due to political
disturbances in the former and tough market conditions in the latter.
He said Mandarin Oriental was continuing to pursue opportunities in the
region. He gave an an example its plan to operate a hotel in Kuala Lumpur.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Seagram loss at Dollars 900m
after charge
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEAGRAM, one of the world's top four drinks groups, took the brunt of new US
accounting rules in fiscal 1993, resulting in a USDollars 900m loss.
A special charge of USDollars 1.4bn was taken in the 12 months ended January
31 to cover post-retirement medical benefits. Seagram owns 24.3 per cent of
Du Pont, the US-based chemicals giant, and most of the charge represents its
share of Du Pont's medical benefits provision.
Seagram warned shareholders in January of the non-cash charge. The costs
could have been amortised over 20 years, but the company chose to take the
charge immediately.
The final loss was equal to Dollars 2.38 a share. In fiscal 1992, profit was
Dollars 727m, or Dollars 1.92 a share.
However, before all special charges, Seagram posted a profit of Dollars 677m
in fiscal 1993, up slightly from fiscal 1992 on the same basis.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Allstate to float 88m shares
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLSTATE, one of the largest property-casualty insurance companies in the
US, said yesterday it planned to float up to 88m shares on the stock market,
in what would be one of the largest initial public offerings (IPO, the US
term for a flotation) ever seen in the US.
Allstate's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed a
maximum offering price of Dollars 26 a share. The company is wholly-owned by
the Sears, Roebuck retail and financial services group.
If all the shares were sold to investors, they would represent around 20 per
cent of the group's equity. Sears, Roebuck, which announced plans last year
to spin off substantial parts of its financial services business, would
retain an 80.1 per cent interest in Allstate.
The Illinois-based insurer, badly hit by heavy catastrophe claims last year,
will use the proceeds from the IPO to shore up the capital base of Allstate
Insurance Company, its main operating company, and repay short-term
borrowings.
Allstate made a net loss of Dollars 825m last year, against a Dollars 723m
profit in 1991. Had Hurricane Andrew losses and accounting changes been
excluded, Allstate's profits would have stood at Dollars 1.17bn.
Of the 88m shares being floated, 68.5m will be offered to US investors,
while 10m will be sold outside the US.
A further 9.5m will be available to US underwriters in the form of
over-allotment options, and up to an additional 1.5m shares for
international underwriters. If the over-allotment options were exercised in
full, Allstate would have 450m shares outstanding.
The Allstate IPO is the third element of Sears' retrenchment from the
financial services industry. The company has sold a 20 per cent stake in
Dean Witter, Discover, netting about Dollars 800m, and has said talks with
potential purchasers of its Coldwell Banker real estate business are at the
due-diligence stage.

AHOLD, the Dutch-based food retailer, is to lift its dividend by 10.6 per
cent, matching the increase reported yesterday in 1992 full-year results,
writes Ronald van de Krol. The company also said it would conduct a
one-for-10 rights issue later this year.
Ahold posted net profit of Fl 305.0m (Dollars 163m) in 1992 from Fl 275.8m
the year before, on sales up 7.3 per cent at Fl 22.3bn. The dual-currency
dividend is to be raised to Fl 1.15 and Dollars 0.45 a share from Fl 1.05
and Dollars 0.40 last year.
Ahold said net profit would have been Fl 8.1m higher but for the 6 per cent
decline of the dollar against the guilder.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Legal moves by creditors could
delay agreement on O&amp;Y debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of the biggest creditors of Olympia &amp; York's US operations have
threatened to delay implementation of numerous debt-restructuring agreements
unless progress is made in setting up a new board of directors for the
developer's US subsidiary.
Sanwa Bank and Citibank detailed their complaints in a filing to a New York
bankruptcy court that revealed disagreements between O&amp;Y's creditors in the
US and Canada. The filing alleged that the management of the US subsidiary,
Olympia &amp; York Realty Corp (OYRC), had been paralysed by these disagreements
and by the delays in reconstituting OYRC's board.
According to the filing, 'current management of the US properties does not
know to whom it should report and on what terms.'
It added that 'US creditors of Olympia &amp; York will continue to refuse to
consummate numerous out-of-court restructurings as the authority of current
management is in doubt.'
The dispute stems from petitions for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection made
by some of O&amp;Y's US subsidiaries at the same time as the Canadian parent,
Olympia &amp; York Developments (OYDL), sought court protection last May.
However, O&amp;Y's US buildings, under OYRC, were not included in the court
protection. OYRC's New York-based management has been trying to keep the
properties outside Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings by selling some assets
and negotiating debt-restructuring agreements with the creditors of others.
OYDL emerged from bankruptcy protection last week. It is now managed by an
administrator, who acts on the advice of a monitoring committee, comprised
of creditors.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bayerische Vereinsbank ahead 24%
to DM1.48bn
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, one of Germany's two large Bavaria-based banks,
yesterday demonstrated the banking sector's continuing resilience to the
country's worsening economic downturn.
The bank reported that partial 1992 operating profits - excluding the result
from own-account trading - were up by 24.1 per cent to DM1.48bn (Dollars
889m).
Vereinsbank, the first of Germany's 'big five' commercial banks to report
preliminary figures for 1992, increased total group operating profits by
32.5 per cent to DM1.62bn.
At the parent company level, total operating profits rose by 35.6 per cent
to DM1.06bn.
The dividend is DM13 per share, the same as in the previous six years.
The figures were ahead of expectations and seem likely to confirm analysts'
expectations of excellent profit figures from most of the large banks.
Vereinsbank's Bavarian competitor, Hypo-Bank, is expected to increase
partial-operating profits by 25 per cent, while Commerzbank and Dresdner
Bank are likely to produce double-digit profit growth. At Deutsche, the
largest bank, profits are likely to slip from the record level of 1991.
Vereinsbank will not disclose net profits - calculated after provisions for
bad debts - until its press conference, which is scheduled for Monday.
Analysts are worried about the impact of the worsening economic environment
on the bad debt situation.
The two Bavarian banks have done better than their larger, Frankfurt-based
competitors because their business is less exposed to commercial lending: a
much larger share of business is mortgage, construction-related loans.
While loan demand has slowed significantly at the bigger banks, the
Bavarians have benefited from their exposure to the construction sector  -
one of the few areas of the German economy which is still thriving.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GULF Canada Resources, the troubled Calgary-based energy company controlled
by Olympia &amp; York Developments, has suspended payment of preferred share
dividends and announced numerous asset sales.
The measures are designed to cut the company's CDollars 1.6bn (USDollars
1.27bn) debt and pave the way for an equity issue. Dividends on common
shares were eliminated last June.
Gulf Canada is 75 per cent owned by O&amp;Y, which last week emerged from
bankruptcy protection.
However, O&amp;Y's Gulf shares are effectively controlled by the creditors to
whom they were pledged. The creditors can take legal title on 30 days'
notice.
Gulf said it hoped to raise CDollars 400m from the sale of its Arctic
drilling business, as well as the planned disposal of some oil and gas
properties in western Canada and its 22.8 per cent interest in Home Oil of
Calgary.
The Home Oil stake has been for sale for more than a year. Mr Chuck Shultz,
Gulf's chief executive, said interest from prospective buyers has increased
in recent months. GW Utilities, another O&amp;Y subsidiary, has a 41 per cent
stake in Home Oil.
The Kulluk drilling unit and two support vessels have been sold to Amoco's
Canadian subsidiary. Terms were not disclosed, but Amoco said that the deal
gave it an opportunity to expand its Arctic fleet at well below replacement
cost.
Gulf suffered a CDollars 302m loss in 1992, about two-thirds of which
consisted of a write-down on its now-terminated investment in the Hibernia
oil project off the coast of Newfoundland. The company abandoned a CDollars
175m share issue last year.
In addition to its Canadian business, Gulf has interests in oil and gas
fields in Indonesia and Russia.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa cuts losses as sales
grow 4.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the struggling German airline, cut its pre-tax losses by DM31m to
DM300m (Dollars 180.3m) last year. Its after-tax loss will be DM380m, a
DM60m improvement on the previous year.
Lufthansa said 1992 sales revenue rose by 4.5 per cent to DM15bn, lower than
the 11.3 per cent increase in passenger volume announced earlier this year.
It did not comment on current-year trading yesterday and will release full
details of last year's figures in May.
'The market price for air transport services in 1992 was substantially below
the previous year's level,' Lufthansa said.
The airline was hit by intense competition and the strength of the D-Mark in
the aftermath of last September's currency market turmoil.
Lufthansa did not quantify the impact of currency changes for the full year,
but the appreciation of the D-Mark hit profits by DM254m in the first nine
months, Lufthansa revealed in November.
The airline said that investment was reduced cut last year by 30 per cent to
DM1.7bn, down from DM2.4bn in the previous year.
Lufthansa said it had shed 2,000 jobs during the course of 1992, taking the
workforce to a total of 42,292 people at the year-end.
The reduced losses for last year had been expected after Lufthansa said last
November that it had made a profit of DM280m in the third quarter of the
year, having made its first monthly profit of the year in September.
It warned at that time that it would revert to losses in the last three
months of the year.
The reduced losses are in part due to an accounting change under which
Lufthansa now writes down aircraft over 12 years to a residual value of 15
per cent, as a result of which the annual depreciation of these assets will
fall from 9.5 to 7.1 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELSEVIER, the Dutch publ-rishing group, saw strong increases in profits in
1992, in line with forecasts made last year after the announcement of its
plans to merge with Reed International of the UK.
The Dutch company, which will retain its listing on the Amsterdam stock
exchange, said operating profit before tax - which it traditionally regards
as the best measure of its performance - rose by 19.3 per cent to Fl 618.2m
(Dollars 329.7m).
Net profit was up 12.8 per cent at Fl 433.9m, while sales advanced by 7.2
per cent to Fl 2.43bn.
Elsevier, whose merger with Reed to form Reed Elsevier took effect on
January 1, said it would lift its dividend by 16 per cent to Fl 2.61.
Scientific publishing, the company's biggest and most profitable business,
posted further gains last year.
This was caused in part by the fact that Pergamon Press of the UK was
consolidated for the full year for the first time since the UK company was
purchased from the late Robert Maxwell in mid-1991.
However, sales of scientific books were below expectations.
In its professional and business publishing divisions, Elsevier reported
profit gains for Excerpta Medica, the electronic medical database, as well
as for Congress-ional Information Service of the US.
Elsevier, which has gradually moved away from consumer publishing because of
its dependence on cyclical advertising spending, said that its Dutch
newspapers were mired in a depressed market, with lower advertising volumes
putting profits under pressure.
However, its Bonaventura subsidiary, which publishes news, fashion, music
and car magazines, posted sharply higher results.

Ahold posted 1992 net profit of Fl 305.0m (Dollars 163m) last year from Fl

annual sales in the US, where it operates four leading supermarket chains.
US operating profit rose by 16.8 per cent to Dollars 169.6m, thanks to
increased results at three of its four chains.
In the Netherlands, where the group's Albert Heijn chain is the market
leader, operating results were up 14 per cent at Fl 222.1m.
Overall, consolidated operating profit rose by 11.3 per cent to Fl 519.4bn.
However, interest expenses increased by nearly 12 per cent to Fl 156.0m.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: LVMH's sharp setback blamed on
Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LVMH, the French luxury goods group, yesterday confirmed that it suffered a
sharp fall in net profits from FFr3.7bn in 1991 to FFr3.0bn (Dollars 530m)
last year, mainly because of the problems of Guinness, the UK drinks group
in which it owns a 24 per cent stake.
Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, was cautiously optimistic about the 1993
outlook for LVMH, which owns a string of prestigious brand names including
Louis Vuitton luggage and Hennessy cognac.
'Even without an improvement in the economic environment LVMH should hold up
well,' he said. 'If the environment improves we should benefit'.
This time last year analysts were forecasting a sharp increase in 1992 net
profits for LVMH to FFr4.4bn. The global luxury goods market has since been
badly affected by the economic slowdown, particularly in Japan. The group
has also been hit by the franc's strength following the September currency
crisis.
The news earlier this year of Guinness' restructuring plans prompted LVMH to
issue a warning that last year's profits would fall to FFr3bn due to the
reduced income from Guinness. It affirmed yesterday that the contribution
from the UK drinks group fell from FFr1.1bn in 1991 to FFr681m in 1992.
LVMH also saw sales fall from FFr22.04bn in 1991 to FFr21.66bn in 1992, due
to economic difficulties and adverse currency changes. LVMH said that, on
stable exchange rates, its sales would have risen by 1.2 per cent, slightly
below the French inflation rate.
Operating profits fell from FFr6.4bn to FFr5.5bn over the same period. The
only division to show growth was perfumes and cosmetics, where operating
profits rose from FFr636m to FFr809m mainly due to the impact of recent
fragrance launches - Dune by Christian Dior and Givenchy's Amarige. The
worst affected division was champagne and wines, which saw operating profits
fall from FFr1.3bn to FFr780m.
Mr Arnault said the outlook for the group's European markets was still
uncertain, although there were signs of fledgling recovery in the UK.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bronfmans sell Trustco
subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TORONTO'S Bronfman family is parting with another of its major businesses by
selling Royal Trustco's operating subsidiaries to Royal Bank of Canada
(RBC).
RBC has agreed in principle to pay CDollars 1.65bn (USDollars 1.32bn) for
the operations, which include mortgage and other lending, institutional and
personal trust services, and investment management. Royal Trust had assets
of CDollars 134bn under administration on December 31.
The deal, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, will
increase RBC's corporate assets by about CDollars 14bn, or 10 per cent. The
bank, Canada's biggest financial institution, had assets of CDollars 137bn
on January 31.
Trilon Financial, a Bronfman holding company which owns 47.5 per cent of
Royal Trustco, said it would back the RBC offer. Trilon had initially
proposed selling only part of its Royal Trust stake and contributing to an
equity injection.
Royal Trust was put up for sale after suffering heavy losses. These stemmed
partly from the impact of recession on its core home mortgage business in
Canada, but mostly from a costly acquisition spree in the US and Europe in
the late 1980s.
The value of its assets hasbeen written down by almost CDollars 900m in the
past three years, and Royal Trust has either closed or sold almost all the
foreign businesses which it bought in the 1980s. It continues, however, to
own the UK-based Royal Trust Bank.
Royal Trust said yesterday that it suffered a 1992 loss of between CDollars
850m and CDollars 900m.
Under the agreement, Royal Trustco will retain CDollars 4.3bn of loans,
about one third of them in the UK, and about one quarter non-performing.
Prior to the Royal Trust sale, the Bronfman group had raised more than
CDollars 2bn this year from the sale of controlling stakes in, among others,
MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forestry company, and John Labatt,
the brewing and entertainment group.
Mr Allan Taylor, RBC chairman, said yesterday that the acquisition of Royal
Trust advanced 'by several years' the bank's expansion strategy. Canadian
banks have been allowed to acquire trust and insurance companies only since
mid-1992.
RBC said it would finance the purchase partly through the issue of
non-cumulative preferred shares, which qualify as tier one capital under BIS
guidelines. It said it expected to have a tier one capital ratio 'in excess
of' 6 per cent when the deal is closed. Its ratio now stands at 6.7 per
cent.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: SCA cushioned by strong hygiene
operations rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCA, Sweden's second-largest pulp and paper group, yesterday announced a
SKr451m (Dollars 58m) profit after financial items for 1992.
A strong performance from its Molnlycke hygiene division helped to cushion
'extremely unfavourable' conditions for traditional forest industry
products.
The result was 63 per cent down on 1991's SKr1.22bn profit but it stood in
sharp contrast to the company's two leading domestic competitors, Stora and
MoDo, both of which have disclosed deep losses for 1992. SCA is holding its
dividend at SKr3.20 per share.
SCA said it expected 1993 profits after financial items to rise to
SKr1bn-SKr1.5bn, even though conditions remain very difficult and falling
prices have eroded much of the benefit from the devaluation of the Swedish
krona. Sales fell to SKr32.1bn from SKr32.7bn.
SCA benefits from having a more diversified range of products than other
Swedish forestry groups and Molnlycke, in particular, has proved a recession
strength. It boosted operating profits by 24 per cent to SKr901m as sales
rose to SKr12.5bn from SKr11.6bn.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: BASF AG sales fall 17% over two
months

<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals group, yesterday underlined the deterioration of
German industry when the company said its domestic subsidiary, BASF AG,
registered a 17 per cent decline in sales during the first two months of
1993, compared with the same period last year.
Mr Jurgen Strube, group chairman, said the situation in Germany had
continued to weaken since the beginning of the year. Orders had fallen to an
all-time low.
Unrelenting pressure on prices, the exceptionally low level of demand,
particularly in Germany, and low utilisation rates had led to lower profits,
said Mr Strube, although he insisted the group was still in the black.
During the first two months of 1993, the entire group's worldwide turnover
fell 10 per cent on the same period last year. In western Europe, turnover
fell 20 per cent.
Mr Strube warned that in spite of cost-cutting he no longer expected to
match last year's profits during the first quarter. The chances of achieving
1992 profit levels during the full year were becoming increasingly remote.
He said there were no prospects of a recovery in western Europe this year,
and any improvement in BASF's 1994 results would be self generated.
BASFsaid it was accelerating its restructuring. A further 4,000 job losses
were announced, as well as short-time working, plant closures and capital
expenditure cuts.
Last year had been a disappointment, said Mr Strube, who added he was not
satisfied by the way BASF had performed in comparison with international
competitors. The company had experienced a dramatic collapse during the
second half of 1992.
Group pre-tax profits for the year fell 41.3 per cent from DM2.11bn to
DM1.24bn on turnover down 4.5 per cent at DM44.5bn.

management shake-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor, yesterday announced a Dollars
618m special cash distribution to shareholders and a management
reorganisation which includes Mr William Anders, chairman and chief
executive, quitting day-to-day operations to become its non-employee
chairman.
The group said the restructuring, which includes sharp cuts in headquarters
staff and the elimination of two layers of senior management, was designed
to streamline costs and make sure its corporate governance was in keeping
with the 'best practices of the 1990s'.
Mr Anders, a former astronaut, has carried out the most radical contraction
by any US defence contractor in the post cold-war era since he become
chairman at the start of 1991. He has sold off many of General Dynamics'
businesses and last year distributed part of the proceeds to shareholders
through a Dollars 975m stock buy-back.
Yesterday, the company announced a further distribution in the form of a
special Dollars 20-a-share payment to the holders of its 30.9m shares. It
said that as it moved through 1993 it would evaluate whether additional
special distributions or stock purchases were appropriate.
A pay-out had been widely expected on Wall Street following completion
several weeks ago of the company's sale of its tactical military aircraft
business to Lockheed for Dollars 1.52bn. This took General Dynamics' cash
balances to more than Dollars 2bn.
The company is combining the roles of chief executive and chief operating
officer in the person of Mr James Mellor, 62, who is currently the chief
operating officer, and eliminating the roles of three executive
vice-presidents.

FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz silent on
controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, yesterday refused to be
drawn into the controversy generated by remarks from a board director of the
Deutsche Bank.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, director of the Deutsche Bank responsible for corporate
finance, on Wednesday said both groups wanted to see Deutsche's stake in
Daimler reduced from the current level of 28 per cent.
Daimler said yesterday that Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive, had held
discussions with Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive and his
predecessor, Mr Alfred Herrhausen, over the level of the holding. But
Daimler insisted that there were no talks on the issue and no plans for the
stake to be cut.
Mr Schmitz told investors on Wednesday that 'there are those in the bank who
may feel sorry not to have got out (of Daimler-Benz shares) when the price
was better'. 'There is a consensus within the bank and Daimler Benz that it
is in the interests of both entities that the stake does not remain at 28
per cent for too long'.
Although Mr Schmitz said there were no immediate plans to cut the stake, the
report of his comments triggered a fall in Daimler's share price by DM8.10
to DM606.20. It recovered after Deutsche Bank put out a statement repeating
that there was no intention to sell the stake and Mr Schmitz's remarks had
been misinterpreted, closing at DM613.50.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDIA, the leading Swedish insurance group, plunged to a SKr2.45bn
(Dollars 314m) operating loss in 1992, more than four times the 1991 SKr580m
deficit. This followed heavy credit insurance losses, a big decline in
property values and large claims from Hurricane Andrew.
The group indicated last month that it would not pay a dividend after its
net asset value fell 20 per cent in 1992 to SKr11.5bn. In 1991, it paid a
SKr4-per-share dividend.
Premiums rose 26 per cent to SKr36.5bn from SKr29.0bn, mainly because of
currency changes. However, its management operating loss deepened to
SKr3.64bn from SKr1.13bn, while its insurance loss rose to SKr479m from
SKr441m.
The company said its insurance result was hit by a small number of very
large claims and, in particular, Hurricane Andrew, which caused SKr550m in
losses. It reported a mixed development for its non-life insurance
operations, with Sweden, Norway and Britain showing a positive trend, while
Danish and Italian subsidiaries incurred losses.
Falling property values, both at home and abroad, cost the group SKr1.41bn,
while losses within the credit insurance sector amounted to SKr890m. The
group was heavily exposed to two credit insurance companies, Svenska Kredit
and International Credit, both of which collapsed last year.
The management operating result also included SKr1.09bn in costs to cover
discontinued business. This included a SKr200m charge for restructuring the
group's reinsurance operations and costs to run off business in its Pan
Financial credit insurance company.
The company is aiming to cut its non-life reinsurance premium volume by 70
per cent within two years.

<TEXT>
BMW, the current star of the German motor industry, has replaced its
retiring chairman with the youngest member of the board.
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, 45, currently responsible for production, will take
control at the luxury car group's annual meeting on May 13.
At the same time, Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, 64, the outgoing chairman, will
propose an unchanged dividend of DM12.50 on ordinary stock and DM13.50 for
preference shares.
Bolstered mainly by the launch of the new 3-Series, and outselling rival
Mercedes-Benz for the first time, BMW managed to ride through the worst of
the downturn which cut Volkswagen's earnings by 87 per cent last year.
Even so, net group profits shrank to DM726m (Dollars 436m) compared with
DM783m, on sales up almost 5 per cent to DM31.2bn.
The figures reflect the sharp downturn in the domestic market which hit all
German automotive groups in the second half of the year. At the halfway
mark, BMW's earnings were up 10.5 per cent and turnover had risen 12 per
cent.

A sharp fall in interest income together with losses in its publishing

That compared with previous profits of Pounds 698,000 and came on sales of

latter figure at Pounds 8.53m (Pounds 4.97m).
The results from the property investment and publishing group were prepared

Interest income declined to Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 6.12m), leaving the net

A final dividend of 0.65p makes a 1.15p (0.95p) total. Earnings per share

Pounds 10.2m, against Pounds 9.18m, on turnover up 22 per cent from Pounds

The rise was helped by a fall in interest charges from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw halved but sees improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVANS HALSHAW, the motor dealing and vehicle management group, last year
reached the lowest point of its fortunes in the recession, but yesterday
promised 'a real improvement in earnings' if early signs of market recovery
continued.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.71m in 1992 compared with Pounds 3.86m - a 56
per cent fall caused largely by the Pounds 1.6m cost of closing car and
truck dealerships in Bristol and Avonmouth.
Earnings per share on continuing businesses were 10.9p (13.6p). However,
with a final dividend of 7.65p, the total is maintained at 11.25p.
Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman, was relaxed about having an uncovered dividend.
He noted the improvement in trading over the first quarter, observed that
last year the company had taken Pounds 2m of costs out of the business and
pointed to likely benefits of the development programme, notably the
multi-franchise dealerships.
Last year, Mr Dale said, 'was the most difficult year for our industry I can
remember and I've been in it for 20 years.'
Group turnover was steady at Pounds 342m (Pounds 340m). Car and commercial
vehicle sales from the 43 dealerships contributed 20 per cent of the Pounds
5.4m operating profits, the rest came largely from parts and, most
significantly, service business.
Interest payments were Pounds 3.03m, against Pounds 3.24m.
After stripping out from the balance sheet contract hire vehicles, where the
amount borrowed to buy them is matched by the holding of vehicles as assets,
gearing was 15 per cent.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit blames trading down for decline to
Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KWIK-FIT Holdings, the tyre and exhaust fitter, yesterday blamed motorists
who have reduced and deferred expenditure on car maintenance for a 47 per
cent decline in full year profits.
Pre-tax profits in the year to February 28 fell from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds
17.1m on turnover down 8 per cent to Pounds 233.6m (Pounds 253.8m).
Commenting on the latest results Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief
executive, said the year had seen 'the toughest conditions in the automotive
industry Kwik-Fit has experienced in 22 years of trading.'
The reduction in consumer spending on car maintenance had coincided with
aggressive competition as companies fought for market share.
'We operate in a business that has a high fixed cost base and the decline in
sales has had a disproportionate negative effect on profitability,' he said.
Following record results in 1991 Mr Farmer said the group had been expecting
a slow start to the year, but believed that expenditure on car maintenance
and essential automotive products could not be deferred'.
However, not only was overall tyre demand down, but the sales mix changed
from premium brand products to economy brands and remoulds as motorists and
companies reduced their costs and expenditure. In contrast, exhaust sales,
which could not be deferred were maintained at the previous year's level.
Despite the rising cost of utilities, rents, rates and insurance, and the
associated cost of opening 19 new centres, together with the refurbishment
of 30 existing centres, Kwik Fit's overall costs increased by less than 5
per cent.
The group remained the market leader with 610 centres and more than 4m
customers last year.
Earnings per share showed a decline from 13.27p to 7.06p. However, the
recommended final distribution is maintained at 2p making an unchanged total
for the year of 3.35p.
COMMENT
Tough new tyre legislation last year should have given the Kwik-Fit business
a boost in the usually stronger second half. But no-one, least of all volume
sensitive Kwik-Fit, reckoned on the risks motorists were prepared to take.
Police surveys show that one-in-four cars on the road is illegal. Those
motorists who are changing tyres are buying lower priced brands, hitting
both turnover and margins while overheads stay fixed. And there are more
competitors. Yesterdays results were slightly better than some analysts had
feared and as a result the shares gained 1p to close at 107p. This recently
volatile stock has taken investors on a rollercoaster ride over the past
year, touching a high of 223p and a low of 71p. Pre-tax profits forecasts
range from about Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 19m producing earnings of between
6.5p and 7.5p per share. But without a pronounced and early recovery the
stock still looks fully valued.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Strong US boost helps Telemetrix to Pounds
9.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEMETRIX reported pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 9.8m in
1992, compared with a restated Pounds 4.1m, thanks mainly to strong sales
growth and sharply-improved margins in GTI, its US subsidiary.
Group turnover rose 17 per cent to Pounds 98.2m (Pounds 83.7m) as Telemetrix
completed a restructuring and management shake-up to concentrate on the
manufacture of components for local area computer networks and
telecommunication systems, test equipment and support services.
The most dramatic improvement came at GTI, the Nasdaq-quoted company in
which Telemetrix has a 61 per cent stake, and its Valor unit making
networking products. GTI's turnover improved 37 per cent to Pounds 60.9m
(Pounds 44.5m) while profits surged to Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 4.7m).
Mr Tim Curtis, chief executive, said the group saw great potential for
further growth in the LAN market, explaining that most personal computers
were still not connected to a network.
Zetex, the wholly owned UK maker of specialist semi-conductors, also saw a
sharp increase in profits to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.2m) on turnover up from
Pounds 12.1m to Pounds 15.9m.
Telemetrix said that group debt had been eliminated. Restructuring costs
associated with the closure of the defence sector business of the Trend
subsidiary, taken above the line, were Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 1.5m).
These were largely offset by a gain of Pounds 3.4m from the sale of part of
the holding in GTI.
Earnings per share were up sharply at 5p (1.7p). The dividend is lifted to
0.8p (0.6p).

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Keebler setback cuts UB to Pounds 162m -
Margin improvement and business consolidation are main priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED BISCUITS, Britain's largest biscuits and snacks manufacturer, pledged
yesterday to make margin improvement and consolidation of its business its
top priorities after reporting an 18 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 162.3m for the year ended January 2.
The result, which mainly reflected a severe setback at Keebler, the group's
US subsidiary, compared with profits for the previous year of Pounds 197.2m,
restated to conform with the FRS 3 accounting standard. Before restatement,
the 1991 figure was Pounds 211.3m.
Sir Robert Clarke, chairman, said that although market conditions in the
past 12 months were the toughest for many years, all divisions had begun the
current year well and trading was considerably ahead of last year.
He expected group turnover to slow in the next two years, but profits and
earnings to increase more rapidly. 'The name of the game is profit. The
traditional UB values of grinding out higher margins will now be evident in
continental Europe, Australia and the US,' he said.
Mr Eric Nicoli, chief executive, said: 'We realise a period of consolidation
and relative stability would be appropriate.' He foresaw no further large
acquisitions, apart from a possible bid for the biscuits business of Royal
Brands, the Spanish food manufacturer.
Profits were reduced by an exceptional item of Pounds 3.3m, compared with a
restated Pounds 12.6m the previous year.
Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 3.12bn (Pounds 2.98bn), with continuing
businesses advancing 6 per cent to Pounds 2.94bn. Operating margin, before
exceptionals, fell to 6.7 per cent (8.2 per cent).
Operating profit at Keebler fell 60 per cent to Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 65.6m).
UB expected Keebler this year to recover about half last year's fall in
profit under a new management which was more concerned with costs and
margins than with increasing volume and market share.
A 31 per cent increase in profits from continental Europe, where it has
recently made several acquisitions, helped McVitie's raise operating profits
5 per cent to Pounds 111.8m. Profit rose 1 per cent to Pounds 92.7m in the
UK, where a decline in the UK biscuit market early in the year was reversed
in the second half.
KP Foods also benefited from operations on the Continent, which increased
profits 15 per cent to Pounds 7.6m, helping the division lift operating
profit 3 per cent to Pounds 44.8m. In the UK, KP's profits grew 1 per cent
to Pounds 37.2m in the face of keen price competition, though it increased
its share of a declining savoury snack market.
Ross Young's, the frozen foods subsidiary, lifted profits 4 per cent to
Pounds 28.5m, though disposals and restructuring reduced turnover by 4 per
cent. The business enjoyed a good second half and was said by UB to have
been 'transformed and re-vitalised'.
Terry's, the chocolate business which is being sold to Philip Morris, the US
tobacco and food company, suffered a 6 per cent fall in profit to Pounds
13.4m despite a 15 per cent rise in sales. UB blamed the poorer result on a
weak UK market and price competition.
Earnings per share fell to 22.4p (28.1p). The final dividend is held at
9.8p, bringing the total for the year to an unchanged 15.3p.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity reduces deficit sharply to
Pounds 4.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE INDEMNITY, the UK's leading independent credit insurer, expects
renewed growth in the second half of the year, but is not expecting business
insolvencies to fall by more than 10 per cent.
Mr Vic Jacob, managing director, said that an equally grim picture emerged
from policy holders who told the company that they were not expecting much
increase in sales in 1993.
'That is not an encouraging sign for the next 12 months,' Mr Jacob said.
Trade Indemnity, which is 80 per cent controlled by nine European insurance
groups, has about 100,000 UK customers, representing what Mr Jacob termed a
'fair selection of the active corporate community' in the UK.
The group yesterday reported sharply reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.9m
(Pounds 46.6m) on gross premium income up 6 per cent at Pounds 147m (Pounds
139m).
Underwriting losses on continuing operations fell from Pounds 25.1m to
Pounds 6.7m, while the loss on discontinued business was Pounds 6.8m,
against Pounds 25.5m. Business insolvencies in 1992 fell only 4 per cent
from the record level of the previous year.
The company said the increase in premium income had been achieved despite
the fact that policy holders had been hit by a fall in sales on which
premiums are based.
The improved performance had followed better risk and underwriting control
and more targeted marketing.
Losses per share were 1p, down from 26.35p.

VESTEL Elektronik, the consumer electronics subsidiary of Polly Peck
International which is listed on the Istanbul exchange, reported pre-tax
profits down 25 per cent in 1992 to TL55.9bn (Pounds 4.1m).
Turnover increased by 16 per cent to TL1,523bn, underlining a sharp drop in
dollar terms, given inflation running at about 70 per cent. Analysts were
surprised by the results, having forecast sales closer to TL2,150bn. They
said sales in the last quarter were sharply down.
PPI's administrators are trying to sell Vestel, with the proceeds going to
PPI's creditors. The results, however, underline Vestel's financing problems
since PPI was forced into administration in 1990. Interest charges more than
doubled to TL462bn as PPI letters of credit facilities have dried up.
Vestel achieved about Dollars 70m (Pounds 49m) in exports.
The company sold 25 per cent of its white goods arm to Merloni
Elettrodomestici, the Italian group best known for its Ariston brand. The
sale realised Dollars 8.5m extraordinary income. Merloni is expected to take
up its option to become the 51 per cent majority owner.
The administrators are also in negotiations with a number of interested
parties to buy PPI's 86 per cent stake in Vestel.
Vestel's AGM yesterday elected Mr AN Kubali as chairman. His predecessor, Mr
Tashin Karan, who was credited with building up the company, retired.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: PRT Budget change may force Seafield
Resources overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEAFIELD Resources, the USM-quoted oil and gas exploration and production
company, yesterday warned Budget changes might force it to concentrate on
overseas exploration.
The warning came as the company announced a fourfold increase in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 256,000 in the 15 months to the end of December 1991,
reflecting a change in year-end, to Pounds 1.06m in the 12 months to
December 31.
The biggest overhaul of North Sea taxation in 10 years was announced in
Tuesday's Budget. The most controversial change would prevent companies from
offsetting exploration and appraisal spending against income from fields
which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax. Oil companies would pay about 64p net of
every Pounds 1 invested, compared with the present 17p.
Mr Roger Witts, finance director, said: 'Over time we may concentrate a
greater part of our cash flow on overseas exploration if we think prospects
are better.'
The company was reviewing strategy, but the industry would interpret
transitional relief arrangements broadly, he said. It would argue that the
two-year extension of PRT relief for companies with existing contracts
included those obligations attached by the government to licences.
Others in the industry believed, however, the concession extended only to
signed drilling contracts.
UK operating profits, including a first full-year contribution of the Victor
field gas were Pounds 1.27m, compared with Pounds 710,000, which included
the first five months of Victor production.
The group used about 90 per cent of the PRT tax shelter generated by Victor,
giving a total tax charge of Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 120,000).
Operating losses on US activities doubled to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds
300,000).
Victor contributed turnover of Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 2.7m) to a total of
Pounds 5.55m (Pounds 5.41m), the balance coming from US activities. Net
interest receivable was Pounds 426,000, compared with a charge of Pounds
160,000 last time.
Earnings per share rose to 1.7p (0.6p).

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Westminster Health float gives Pounds 130m
tag - Nursing home operator plans to raise Pounds 63m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTMINSTER Health Care, the nursing home operator, is planning to raise
Pounds 63m through a flotation likely to value the group at over Pounds
130m.
WHC yesterday issued the pathfinder prospectus for the float, which will
involve a placing with institutions and a clawback of up to 25 per cent for
the public.
The group is forecasting pre-tax profits for the year to May 31 1993 of
Pounds 3.85m, up from Pounds 1.67m.
On a pro-forma basis, taking the proceeds of the flotation into account, the
pre-tax forecast is Pounds 7.94m.
With a 15 per cent tax charge, and applying a multiple in line with Takare,
the nearest comparable quoted company, analysts expect a market value of
over Pounds 130m. Net assets after the float will be Pounds 79.5m.
WHC has expanded rapidly since it was founded in 1985. It has been backed by
National Medical Enterprises, a leading US health care group.
NME's stake will fall below 50 per cent through the float, but neither it
nor any other existing shareholders will sell shares in the float. NME
promised not to sell any shares for a year afterwards. WHC and NME have a
non-competition arrangement.
The prospectus referred to legal proceedings against NME in the US, relating
to allegations of improper and unlawful practices at its psychiatric
hospitals, but says that 'these matters do not involve WHC or any of the
non-executive directors nominated by NME'.
WHC will have 3,236 beds in operation in 47 homes by the end of May, with
another 600 beds in development and a further 300 beds planned.
Mr Pat Carter, chief executive, said the market for private nursing homes is
worth Pounds 2.2bn a year and there will be demand for 77,000 extra beds by
the end of the century because of demographic changes.
Capital expenditure is likely to be between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m a
year, Mr Kent Phippen, finance director, said. The group has a Pounds 40.5m
bank facility and a further Pounds 10m loan from NME.
After the float it does not expect to raise further equity capital for two
years.
WHC's policy on interest is to capitalise it up to the day a new home opens.
After that it is charged to the profit and loss account.
Practices in the industry vary, with WHC more conservative than some.
Pricing for the issue will be announced on March 31, with applications
closing on April 8 and dealings expected to start on April 15.
The public can register for a mini-prospectus from today by ringing 0500
304050. Sponsors are Barclays de Zoete Wedd and brokers are de Zoete &amp;
Bevan.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CrestaCare cuts losses to Pounds 1.49m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRESTACARE, the nursing home operator which is selling its sheltered housing
and commercial property activities, recorded a reduced loss before tax in
1992 of Pounds 1.49m, against Pounds 13.2m, writes Maggie Urry.
The group made an operating profit of Pounds 3.9m (loss Pounds 138,000) on
turnover up by half to Pounds 25.6m, compared with Pounds 17.2m.
A change in accounting policy meant a Pounds 2m adverse restatement of the
1991 figures. CrestaCare is now charging costs incurred after a home opens
to the profit and loss account. Previously it had deferred such costs until
the home reached a certain occupancy rate.
The operating profit from nursing homes rose from Pounds 1.52m (restated
from Pounds 3.5m) to Pounds 4.16m. Other activities lost Pounds 229,000
(Pounds 1.66m). The interest charge was lower at Pounds 2.9m (Pounds
458,000).
Exceptional costs of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 12.6m) largely reflected property
write-downs. There was a retained loss of Pounds 2m (Pounds 15.5m) and
losses per share were 1.8p (18.2p).
The good result from nursing homes encouraged the group to declare a 0.4p
final dividend (nil), to give a total of 0.5p (0.7p).
Year end borrowings were Pounds 21.2m, compared with net assets of Pounds
28.2m but the group expects to raise between Pounds 8.5m and Pounds 9m from
property sales.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ernest Green declines 35% to Pounds 302,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ernest Green &amp; Partners Holdings, the structural, civil and environmental
engineering consultancy, saw interim pre-tax profits decline by 35 per cent
from Pounds 468,000 to Pounds 302,000 on reduced sales of Pounds 3.64m,
against Pounds 4.03m.
Mr David Legg, chairman, referred to the depressed level of construction
work, but measures to match resources and costs to work available had
enabled the company to remain profitable in the six months to December 31.
In the previous first half the USM-quoted company had carried
rationalisation costs of Pounds 142,000, offset partly by Pounds 126,000
from property sales.
An unchanged interim dividend of 2.75p is payable from earnings of 2.8p
(4.6p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Supporters of Chelsea Football Club are being given the chance to buy shares
in a new company being set up to eventually acquire the club's Stamford
Bridge ground in London.
The new company, Chelsea Pitch Owners, is offering nearly 70,000 shares at
Pounds 100 each to the public.
The money will be used to buy the ground from Royal Bank of Scotland, which
acquired it when former owner Cabra Estates went into liquidation last
November. RBS granted Chelsea a 20-year lease and an offer to buy which
expires in 2012.
Directors of CPO include Mr Tony Banks, MP for Newham North West, and Mr
Dennis Wise, the Chelsea player.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: FMT ends search for European partner via
link with Rambaudi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FMT, the Brighton-based machine tool producer which was bought out from
Vickers in 1988, yesterday announced a co-operation deal with Rambaudi, a
Turin-based machine tool builder.
The deal, unveiled in London by Mr Mike Bright, chairman of FMT, and Mr
Bruno Rambaudi, chairman and president of Rambaudi, ends a long search by
FMT for a European co-operation partner.
FMT is one of the few surviving British-owned machine tool builders
competing head-on technologically with the Japanese producers in flexible
manufacturing systems.
For both companies the agreement represents a response to Japanese
competition. The deal brings together two companies with a complementary
product range. They will market each other's products in their home
countries, and work together on joint projects in third markets where the
best technology of both partners can be combined in a turnkey package.
FMT's product portfolio will be strengthened with Rambaudi's range of
vertical spindle machines, while the Brighton company's horizontal spindle
machines will be available to Rambaudi for the Italian market.
Both companies have seen sales and employment fall sharply over the past two
years because of recession. FMT's turnover has fallen from Pounds 22m in
1989-90 to a projected Pounds 11m this year, while Rambaudi's has fallen
from L70bn to L50bn (Pounds 22.8m). However, Mr Bright said recession was
not the driving force behind the merger. By working together, the two
companies would find it much easier to win European Community funding for
research and development.
The two companies are considering whether to work together on projects such
as high-speed milling and machining. Closer financial ties have not been
ruled out, although Mr Rambaudi said the initial priority was to ensure that
what has been decided is working successfully.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Shopacheck boost for Cattle's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATTLE'S (Holdings) reported a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for
1992, mainly as a result of the continuing strong performance of its
consumer credit business.
Profits increased to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 9.8m) on turnover lower at Pounds
217.8m (Pounds 244.7m) mainly reflecting the flotation of a 55 per cent
stake in Rosebys, the curtain and linen stores group, early last year.
The core consumer credit division, led by Shopacheck, the door-to-door
weekly credit business, increased profits to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 9m) on
turnover of Pounds 167.1m (Pounds 154.8m).
Mr Eddie Cran, chief executive, said the gain highlighted the
rationalisation benefits following the acquisition of Compass Credit at the
end of 1990. He added that the charge for bad debts fell 'despite the
difficult economic background'.
The insurance services division lifted profits to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds
600,000) while the hire purchase and leasing division reduced losses to
Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.5m) despite a continuing high level of write-offs and
increases in bad debt provisions reflecting the problems of its small
business customers.
The group has reduced its non-core activities, selling the Indoor Leisure
Centre at a small loss in December and reducing the size of the retail video
film hire and travel agency businesses and charging closure costs agains
profits.
Rosebys' contribution to pre-tax profits as an associate was Pounds 1.1m
last year compared to Pounds 2.2m in the previous year when it was a wholly
owned subsidiary.
The disposal realised a surplus of Pounds 4.6m, of which Pounds 3.2m was
transferred to reserves in respect of goodwill previously written off, and
Pounds 1.4m was credited to the profit and loss account as an extraordinary
profit.
Earnings increased to 7.82p (6.13p) per share; a recommended final dividend
of 2.6p lifts the total for the year from 3.8p to 4.7p, including a special
distribution of 0.5p.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Buoyant exports lift Rotork
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG SALES to UK water companies and the world oil industry led to double
digit profits growth at Rotork, the designer and assembler of valve
activators and associated electronic control systems, in 1992.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 10.5 per cent from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds
10.5m. At the interim stage, profits increased 11 per cent to Pounds 4.84m.
Mr Tom Eassie, chief executive, said that while many smaller UK companies
were affected by recession, Rotork had benefited from buoyant export orders.
'We're picking up business from all around the world,' he said.
Turnover increased 11 per cent from Pounds 51.5m to Pounds 57.1m.
Rotork Actuation, the valve division which accounts for more than 80 per
cent of sales, performed well. Order levels improved 'appreciably' from a
year ago, with especially strong growth in the final quarter.
The much smaller analysis division, which supplies air monitoring equipment,
made a small operating profit after losses in the previous year. However,
the division's sales are likely to remain subdued until stricter
environmental rules on pollution are in force.
Earnings increased 10 per cent to 22.69p (20.66p) per share. The recommended
final dividend of 6.5p makes a total of 11.15p (10p).
Rotork's shares, which have performed strongly since 1991, added a further
3p to 448p yesterday, compared to their 12-month low of 258p.
Because of the share price rise, and in order to improve the liquidity of
the shares, the directors are proposing a 1-for-1 one share split,
immediately followed by a 1-for-2 capitalisation issue. This will increase
the issued share capital from 28.9m to 86.7m shares.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: A tour of investors buys time for the bank
 -Barclays' chief meets dissatisfied shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW Buxton, chairman and chief executive of Barclays Bank, seems to
have won some time. His tour of shareholders in the past two weeks following
the announcement of a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss for 1992 has not reassured
all of them. But it has - at least temporarily - mollified some.
Mr Buxton has arrived on his own at the meetings and asked to see only the
top one or two executives of each fund. 'I got the feeling he realises the
level of dissatisfaction,' said the chief of one investment company after a
meeting with Mr Buxton last week. 'I think the will is there.'
Mr Buxton asked at least one investor whether he should resign. But most
investors say they believe he deserves some time to show that Barclays
management is getting better. 'A lynch mob is not being gathered. We just
responded to his invitation to talk and listen,' said one shareholder.
Another shareholder, who earlier described the bank's management as 'a
shambles', said Mr Buxton had indicated that he was trying to appoint a
chief executive swiftly. Mr Buxton, who was appointed chairman in January,
has said he wants to split his two roles 'as quickly as possible'.
A fund manager at one institution, who had earlier said he had strong
reservations about both Mr Buxton's intentions and the abilities of the
bank's board, said his perception had changed somewhat. 'I think he is
genuinely committed to working with shareholders.'
Mr Buxton told the Financial Times before starting his meetings that 'a
significant part' of his responsibilities would be passed to a new senior
executive this year. But he did not specify to shareholders when this
decision would be made, or whether an outsider would be appointed.
'At least he was making the effort to come and listen to shareholders. That
is quite a change from last year, when we were told he was going to be
chairman and chief executive without any consultation,' said one investor.
Shareholders started expressing discontent over Mr Buxton's appointment to
both roles last summer. Most now want an early disclosure of how the roles
will be split, and would like to see an outsider appointed. They are also
keen to be shown that the bank's assessment of loan risks has improved.
'The whole problem is that Barclays gives an impression of lurching along.
It is important for them to convey a sense of direction and purpose from the
top,' said one investor. Most investors contacted by the Financial Times
believe the bank deserves some months to make its reforms.
Not everyone is sanguine about giving such time. 'I think his position is
totally untenable. He cannot distance himself from the mistakes Barclays
made, and he has shown crass insensitivity by rejecting the advice many of
us gave about his appointment,' said an institutional investor.
There is some division of opinion among shareholders about how corporate
governance should be altered. Most investors favour bringing in a chief
executive, but at least one fund would prefer to see Mr Buxton stay only as
chief executive while a chairman is appointed from outside.
Resentment about the bank lingers from last year, when investors who
expressed concern say they were given the impression that they were in a
small minority.
Mr Buxton has impressed upon investors his desire to keep future discussions
about management changes at Barclays private. In his contacts with
shareholders, he urged them to make any future complaints directly to the
bank, rather than discussing them with journalists.
Shareholders said they were still uncertain about whether Barclays had
learnt from its poor lending in the property and construction sectors during
the late 1980s. One investor said Mr Buxton had been 'quietly positive'
about the reforms the bank was undertaking to reduce future bad debts.
Some remain concerned that Barclays has not yet made a clear decision to
reduce exposure to property lending. 'He said loans are assessed on an
account-by-account basis,' said one shareholder. The fact that the bank's
past controls allowed property lending to rise worries some.
Barclays has signalled its intention to impose tighter controls on its
lending portfolio by appointing Mr Alan Brown, formerly the head of its
Japan operations, to the new post of director of group credit policy. His
task will be to balance its portfolio, but he only took up his job this
month.
Mr Buxton will have further meetings next week. Investors he has met so far
appear willing to give the bank a breathing space - perhaps until the
interim results - to show it is changing. But the level of discontent has
been subdued, rather than banished entirely, by Mr Buxton's tour.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Reed Intl 10% up at Pounds 137m prior to
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED International, the publishing group, increased its pre-tax profits by
10.2 per cent to Pounds 137m in the nine months to December 31, its last
separate reporting period before the merger with Elsevier of the Netherlands
took effect.
Sales rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1.14bn). Reed said that
with little sign of economic recovery in the UK and only a weak upturn in
the US, most of the profits upturn was attributable to strong market
positions and greater efficiency.
Books continued to show strong growth and increased operating profit by 32
per cent to Pounds 46.9m, largely due to improved margins and cost control.
Underlying performance grew in all three divisions - professional, education
and consumer.
The largest profit gain was in Butterworths. Reed said several acquisitions
contributed to this result, but the main impetus came from production
savings and control of overheads. A strong publishing programme contributed
to a good result from consumer books.
Consumer publishing, comprising IPC magazines and Reed regional newspapers,
increased operating profits by 26 per cent to Pounds 50.4m. It was helped by
the return to profitability in the television listing sector and because
IPC's core consumer magazines and the regional newspapers both performed
well, in spite of a fall of revenue.
At IPC magazines, the downturn in advertising volumes was partly offset by
higher circulation revenue. At Reed regional newspapers, the increase in
operating profits was largely because of cost-cutting, although the group
said many titles had strengthened their market positions.
Business to business published increased operating profits by 19 per cent to
Pounds 21.2m. In the US, Cahners performed strongly in the medical and
specialist consumer sectors. Costs were cut through keen paper and print
buying, the implementation of pre-press technology and job losses. In the
UK, Reed business publishing closed three magazines or merged and various
activities were centralised, leading to greater efficiency.
Operating profits from travel and information services were 18 per cent down
at Pounds 35.1m because of higher development costs, the rephasing of a
major UK directory and difficult trading conditions in the US hotel market.
In spite of adverse trading conditions, Reed travel group increased both
revenue and profit by focusing on core activities.
Reference publishing saw operating profits dip to Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 7.5m)
and profits from exhibitions were also down at Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 9.6m).
Reed said both businesses were heavily geared towards the first calendar
quarter, so the results did not give a true indication of the underlying
performance.
Earnings per share rose 9.6 per cent to 17.2p (15.7p).
A final dividend of 7.25p gives a total for the nine months of 12.75p, an
increase of 6 per cent on a pro-rata basis.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Restructure bears fruit as Coats rises to
Pounds 109m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COATS VIYELLA'S pre-tax profit for 1992 rose to Pounds 109.1m compared with
Pounds 96.7m, as three years of restructuring began to bear fruit.
The figures have been prepared for the first time in accordance with the
accounting standards FRS 3 and draft standard FRED 3, the latter
reclassifing convertible preference shares as debt and the associated costs
as financing costs.
Excluding these two standards pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 122m
compared with Pounds 111.4m in 1991.
Turnover rose 6.5 per cent to Pounds 2.11bn and operating profits increased
19.7 per cent to Pounds 146.2m.
The dividend for the year is raised by 0.25p to 7.25p with a final of 4.25p.
Earnings per share were given as 10.2p against 10p.
The shares rose 11p to 245p.
'Given the economic circumstances, the results are very good,' said Mr
Neville Bain, chief executive.
The prospects for 1993 were even brighter largely thanks to the fall in the
value of sterling.
Mr Bain pointed out that this was already encouraging retailers in the UK
and exports markets to consider switching supplier to the UK.
'Dollars 1.50 to the pound is just what we've been looking for for many
years,' said Sir David Alliance, chairman.
The company earns most of its profits outside the UK, but the domestic
market was a strong performer in 1992 with operating profits at Pounds 60m
(Pounds 37.5m) as a result of restructuring and the economies of scale
arising from the Tootal merger nearly two years ago.
Again Brazil was the main problem concerning results. Sales fell by 40 per
cent amid local economic uncertainty.
The Brazilian losses cannot be offset against previous years' profits and
pushed the tax charge up to 40.1 per cent compared with 37.8 per cent in
1991.
Cash flow remained negative, but Coats expects the figure to be positive for
1993-94 as a cash release programme continues and restructuring costs fall.
The benefits of the first full year of Tootal's contribution showed up in
the Pounds 83.9m (Pounds 65.9m) operating profits from the thread division,
excluding the Brazilian losses.
COMMENT
The market registered approval of earnings and profits at the top of the
range of expectations by taking the shares up to a current p/e of about 24.
This can justified if the fall in sterling boosts turnover, margins and
market share, if the tax charge can be cut by several percentage points, if
thread margins filter through to the other divisions and if the Brazilian
profits hole is sewn up.
That is a lot of ifs, given that in the current year, pre-tax profits would
do well to rise much beyond Pounds 145m with a prospective p/e in the high
teens. The company is doing well, but further investment in the shares is
for the long term only.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Schroders expected to reveal inner reserves
of Pounds 80m in next results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHRODERS is likely to disclose next year that it has about Pounds 80m in
hidden reserves. The merchant bank said yesterday that it would publish its
inner or hidden reserves in its next set of full year results.
Analysts with a close knowledge of the group said these would be in the
range of between 15 and 20 per cent of its Pounds 462m in published capital
and reserves - a far higher proportion than most of its rivals.
Schroders also yesterday disclosed that it made after-tax profits of Pounds
64m, 23 per cent more than the previous year, excluding an extraordinary
item.
Pre-tax profits, after the transfer of an undisclosed sum to inner reserves,
were Pounds 67m, 20 per cent higher. 'We are particularly pleased with the
result, given that other merchant banks are finding conditions more
difficult', said Mr Win Bischoff, chief executive.
He said that more than half the group's revenues now derive from outside the
UK, although a large proportion of these were treated in its accounts as UK
profits.
Last year's fall in the pound boosted by Pounds 5m the value of Schroders'
overseas profits on translation into sterling. There was a similar benefit
to the sterling value of funds managed by the group, which rose in the year
from Pounds 27.7bn to Pounds 36.1bn. Mr Bischoff said that some Pounds 4bn
of that growth was due to the translation effects of sterling's fall.
Corporate finance operations, which are the traditional heart of the group,
acted in 99 transactions worldwide, with a value of Pounds 8bn. Of these,
Pounds 6.3bn were international.
The final dividend is 16p, making 22p for the year, a rise of 22 per cent. A
1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Disposal helps ASH profit leap to Pounds
45m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Peggy Hollinger
A profit of Pounds 32m on the sale of its loss prevention business helped
Automated Security (Holdings) report a sharp jump in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 45.1m for the year to November 30.
The pre-tax increase - with 1991 profits restated to meet new accounting
standards - was achieved on sales 11 per cent lower at Pounds 173.2m. At the
operating level, profits rose from Pounds 25.8m to Pounds 30.5m.
During the year, ASH sold its European security and specialist CCTV business
for Pounds 153m. The group also cut 620 jobs in the UK and US, resulting in
redundancy costs of Pounds 3.7m.
Lord Lane of Horsall, deputy chairman, said the rationalisation completed
during the year had left ASH 'very much better both financially and
operationally'.
Profits from continuing operations increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 24m.
However, Lord Horsall said that excluding the loss prevention business,
pre-tax profits were Pounds 14.8m. This would be the benchmark by which
ASH's future performance should be compared, he said.
Lord Horsall felt cautious about the immediate outlook in the group's two
main markets - the UK and US.
The final dividend is increased by 8 per cent to 3.05p, for a total of 5.3p
(4.9p). Earnings per share of 25.8p compared with losses last time of 6.6p.
Excluding the disposal proceeds, earnings were 8.8p.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hospital Corporation plans restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBT-LADEN Hospital Corporation International Group, which was created
in January last year when HCI of the US reversed into Bioplan Holdings, the
UK healthcare group, is to ask its shareholders to approve a substantial
restructuring.
An extraordinary meeting has been called for April 2.
The board is warning that without the planned substantial disposals it will
not be possible to restructure satisfactorily the group's banking
facilities, some of which expire at the end of this month.
The proposals involve:
The sale of the group's interest in the Bishop's Wood, Runnymeade and South
Cheshire Hospitals and the Meriden ward at the Walsgrave NHS hospital to
Generale de Sante International for Pounds 11.3m.
In addition, GSI will pay Pounds 500,000 for an option on HCI's interest in
two other hospitals in the UK, King's Oak and Sandringham private hospitals
which were completed a year ago and are operated in conjunction with the
NHS. When the option matures in December, GSI could acquire the interest for
Pounds 6.5m.
HCI's overseas operations will be spun-off to a new Cayman Islands
registered company, called Newco, to be set up by four of HCI's directors
including Mr Dennis Sokol, chairman.
In a complex settlement the four directors would cancel their 33.4m shares
in HCI - equivalent to about 40 per cent of the company's equity capital -
together with rights to another 16.5m shares. Based on the closing price of
8 1/2 p per share yesterday the 33.4m shares were worth about Pounds 2.85m.
Proceeds of the sale of the UK assets would be used to repay Pounds 8.3m of
borrowings, of which about Pounds 6.9m is bank debt. The balance would be
used to settle other liabilities and for general working capital purposes.
In the letter to shareholders the HCI board says 'the proposals are
necessary to secure the financial stability of the company.'
Following the restructuring, and assuming GSI takes up its option, HCI would
retain three independent hospitals, North Downs, West Midlands and Yale
private hospitals, and a nursing care centre at Westley Court which, the
board claims, 'represent an excellent opportunity for the shareholders.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Accounting change main factor in Spring Ram
Pounds 13m shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM, the kitchens and bathrooms group, warned yesterday that its 1992
pre-tax profit would be about Pounds 13m less than the expected figure of
about Pounds 39m.
It listed three main reasons. The biggest was that 'profits amounting to
Pounds 5.6m on certain contracts will now fall into 1993 in accordance with
the recently announced financial reporting exposure draft (Fred 4).'
It is understood that this does not affect an exceptional gain of more than
Pounds 5m made by selling its spare advanced corporation tax capacity to
companies with unrelieved ACT.
This gain is offset against the Pounds 3m-plus additional charges being
taken on Balterley Bathrooms, where false accounting was uncovered.
This means that the Pounds 26m pre-tax profit indicated yesterday will
probably include a net exceptional gain.
Spring Ram said a further Pounds 4m deduction from expected profits was due
to factory start-up and product development costs. It has built factories
for doors and tiles.
The third category of profit cuts, amounting to Pounds 3.3m, covered
depreciation and the treatment of government grants, both of which have been
the subject of criticism by analysts.
The company said: 'FRS 3 has been adopted and freehold buildings depreciated
for the first time.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trimmed Davis Service advances 21% to
Pounds 17.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVIS SERVICE Group, the business services company, yesterday announced a 21
per cent advance, from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 17.5m, in profits before tax
for 12 months to December 31 1992.
Group turnover declined by 20 per cent at Pounds 247m (Pounds 309m),
reflecting the disposal in April of its Godfrey Davis contract vehicle hire
business and the subsequent disposal of two of the company's three Ford
dealerships.
A provision of Pounds 1.5m was made for losses on the last remaining
dealership which Davis is set to withdraw from this year.
However, the combination into one division of the linen hire and laundry
units with workwear services produced benefits which saw sales in textile
maintenance rising to Pounds 112.8m (Pounds 107m) and operating profits
moving up from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 13.2m.
Support services, which includes office, hospital and military centre
cleaning, also moved ahead, returning sales of Pounds 53.3m (Pounds 44.5m)
and profits of Pounds 3.07m (Pounds 2.5m).
Site services were held back by recession in the construction industry, but
managed a rise in turnover to Pounds 46m (Pounds 44m), although profits were
flat at Pounds 3.42m (3.4m).
Mr John Ivey, chief executive, said he was looking for no more than a modest
improvement in trading conditions this year.
'We are not factoring in a recovery,' he said.
Adjusted earnings per share improved from 12.96p to 15p. The proposed final
dividend is 5.25p, making an unchanged total for the year of 7.98p.
Net debt at the year end was reduced to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 77.8m).
COMMENT
Davis has weathered the recession well. It reversed out of vehicle hire and
car sales at the bottom of the cycle but may not regret missing the coming
upturn there. It has focused instead on three core areas covering linen and
workwear rental and laundry; cleaning and other labour support services; and
the manufacture, sale and hire of portable buildings mainly for building
sites and schools. These businesses look ominously vulnerable in a
recession. But Davis has kept its head well above water by, for example,
merging its workwear services with linen and laundry operations to improve
efficiency in its textile services division. If and when the economy
improves, it should be well placed with pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.5m
forecast for this year. The shares reflect the optimism, trading on a
prospective p/e of 15.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil acts on Budget proposal as profits
leap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENTOKIL Group, the environmental and property services concern, yesterday
became the first company to recommend an increased dividend to compensate
for changes in the rate of advance corporation tax announced in Tuesday's
budget.
The company is recommending a 36.5 per cent net dividend increase so its
gross dividend is lifted in line with earnings, by nearly 30 per cent.
Rentokil said it did not want shareholders receiving gross dividends or
paying higher rate income tax to lose out because of the changes.
'We wanted to put shareholders in the same position they would have been if
the Chancellor had not changed (the rules),' according to Mr Christopher
Pearce, group financial director.
Mr Clive Thompson, group chief executive, said the increase aimed to
compensate pension fund shareholders rather than Sophus Berendsen of
Denmark, Rentokil's parent company, which was also affected by the ACT
changes.
Rentokil said pre-tax profits increased 29 per cent, from Pounds 94.6m to
Pounds 122.4m, in the year to December 31 helped by growth in continental
Europe and by currency factors. At the interim stage, profits increased 21
per cent to Pounds 51.1m.
Operating profits increased 27 per cent to Pounds 117.7m. Because the
company uses year end rather than average exchange rates, there was an
Pounds 8.8m exchange rate gain following sterling's fall in value in the
last quarter.
Interest income increased from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 4.65m as the company's
net cash position more than doubled to Pounds 60.2m.
There was an extraordinary cost of Pounds 7.64m to complete work recommended
by the US Environmental Protection Agency at a wood treatment site in
Virginia. The total cost of cleaning up the site has now risen to about
Dollars 22m (Pounds 15.4m). No further provisions are expected.
Earnings increased 28 per cent to 8.018p. A final dividend of 1.67p is
proposed, to make a total of 2.31p (1.692p) for the year.
COMMENT
If one wanted to be nasty, one could argue Rentokil's pledge of 20 per cent
growth 'forever' was met last year through default rather than design.
Without sterling's exit from the ERM and the decision not to adopt FRS 3,
which would have turned the extraordinary into an exceptional, profits would
have been only 12 per cent ahead. However, that 'only' is still impressive
given a downturn in the UK which showed the company is not recession proof.
The real question is how long Rentokil deserves its heady premium. Forecast
profits of Pounds 146m this year put the shares on more than 23 times. The
company and its stock market supporters believe 20 per cent growth will be
easy this year and there is still much scope for expansion in Europe and the
Far East. Even so, following their giddy rise since last September the
shares look in need of a breather, notwithstanding yesterday's 6p fall to
244p.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Arjo declines to Pounds 161m and cuts final
 -Worsening trading conditions expected, perhaps continuing into 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARJO WIGGINS Appleton, the paper group, yesterday announced a 30 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 231m to Pounds 161m in 1992 and warned
of worse to come in its European markets.
Mr Cob Stenham, chairman, said AWA expected 'a further worsening of trading
conditions in 1993, which may well continue into 1994.'
However, Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive, said AWA had fared better than
many of its competitors in Europe.
Mr Stenham said the company could not guarantee to maintain its 1992
dividend in 1993, although the decision on the final would be taken with a
clearer view of 1994 prospects.
This time the final has been reduced from 5.05p to 3.85p, a sharper cut than
had been expected when the interim was lowered to 2.65p (3.3p).
The group shocked shareholders in September when it announced the interim
cut. Analysts yesterday were still suspicious about dividend policy.
Some said it was driven by the interests of St Louis, the French group which
holds a 39 per cent stake. Mr Stenham said the board had been unanimous on
the payment.
He said AWA now aimed to keep dividend cover between 2 and 2 1/2 times on
average over a period of years. Earlier the policy was to keep cover within
that range each year.
The 1992 dividend was covered 1.8 times by earnings per share of 11.6p
(18p). Earnings were depressed by a rise in the tax charge from 37 to 43.2
per cent. Mr Tony Isaac, finance director, warned that the rate would rise
further this year, perhaps to 46 per cent.
Group sales rose to Pounds 2.62bn (Pounds 2.49bn) but margins were squeezed
by lower prices and operating profits fell from Pounds 247m to Pounds 193m.
Increased losses at Soporcel in Portugal, lifted the deficit from associates
to Pounds 3m (Pounds 1.6m).
The interest charge rose from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 28.9m.
Mr Isaac said debt rose from Pounds 147m to Pounds 285m, with gearing up
from 13.6 to 23.6 per cent. The group was two years into a three-year Pounds
500m programme of investment and acquisitions. Gearing would rise further in
1993, he warned, to about 35 per cent, but would fall in 1994.
Operating profits from European paper making fell 48 per cent to Pounds
70.5m. Despite growth in demand for many grades, overcapacity led to lower
prices. Appleton Papers, in North America, increased profits by 12 per cent
to Pounds 117m. Paper merchanting profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 15.5m,
after redundancy costs of Pounds 2.6m.
COMMENT
AWA's shares rose 5p to 169p yesterday in relief, and are up 40p from the
price they settled at on the day of the interim. AWA still has much fence
mending to do with investors, especially any yield funds who have bought
since September. There was some good news. Benefits from the merger two
years ago are coming through and are expected to add about Pounds 22m to
1993 profits, with more to come. The burst of industry-wide capacity
expansion inspired by the strong paper markets of the late 1980s is ending,
even if it will take a couple of years before utilisation reaches a level
which provides a decent return. Meanwhile a prospective p/e of over 17 looks
on the high side when the yield support is unreliable.

FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar faces legal threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE may be sued for failing to pay the second instalment to Davy
Corporation shareholders following its controversial takeover of the
stricken contractor.
Two former institutional shareholders in Davy have threatened legal action
unless they receive compensation from Trafalgar, the construction,
engineering and shipping group.
Bear Stearns, the US securities House, and Gruss Partners, the US investment
company, believe Trafalgar's offer document for Davy, acquired in June 1991,
was misleading.
Yesterday they sent a letter, through their solicitor, Goodman Derrick, to
Mr Alan Clements, Trafalgar's chairman, asking for compensation to avoid
litigation.
Trafalgar said: 'There is no substance to the claims and we will resist them
with the utmost vigour. The issues raised in the letter have previously been
considered by the Takeover Panel, which ruled in Trafalgar's favour.'
Trafalgar House's successful offer for Davy was in two parts, of 50p and 45p
per share.
The second instalment depended on it drawing upon an Pounds 118m letter of
credit from Midland &amp; Scottish Resources, which was operating the Ocean
Emerald Rig, in the North Sea.
Trafalgar was unable to draw upon the credit and therefore did not pay the
second instalment, totalling Pounds 54m.
Trafalgar believes it was let down by MSR, which was unable to obtain a
so-called section 10, ship mortgage guarantee, from the Department of Trade
and Industry.
However, Goodman Derrick's letter says: 'It seems to us - and to leading
Counsel - that it must have been well-known to all those concerned on behalf
of Trafalgar House that at the time of the offer document, it was far from a
formality to expect the section 10 certificate to be forthcoming from the
DTI.
'By referring only to the need for contraction completion . . . our clients
were misled into believing that the only conditions which had to be complied
with related to completion of the contract and its related formalities.'
Bear Stearns and Gruss Partners believe they lost Pounds 1.4m and Pounds
471,000 respectively - the difference between the price received for the
shares, 50p, and the highest market figure in the relevant period, which was
91p.
Mr Barry Cohen, senior managing director of Bear Stearns, said: 'There are a
lot of disgruntled former Davy institutional shareholders.'

FT  19 MAR 93 / Legal &amp; General lifts dividendafter advance to Pounds 116m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL &amp; General, the life and general insurer, yesterday reported a recovery
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 38.8m to Pounds 116.1m in 1992 and increased
its dividend from 18.8p to 19.1p, prompting a positive response from
investors who marked the shares up 16p to close at 481p.
The dividend increase was seen as a sign of confidence by analysts. 'It is
an attractive yield with a good asset backing,' said Mr Alan Richards of
James Capel.
A turnround in the group's general insurance business underpinned the
improved trading performance, with milder weather, increased premium rates
and reduced expenses cutting losses to Pounds 61m compared with Pounds
157.3m in 1991.
Losses on domestic mortgage indemnity (DMI) business fell to Pounds 75m from
Pounds 106.1m, in spite of further strengthening in reserves against future
claims.
L&amp;G now has Pounds 294m set aside in reserves (before reinsurance) to meet
potential future claims, compared with Pounds 220m six months ago. It now
believes it has enough reserves to meet all claims likely to emerge on its
existing book of business. Mr David Prosser, group chief executive, said
there was a 'reasonable possibility of insurance break-even'.
L&amp;G, which even before the change was reserving on a more conservative basis
than any of its rivals, has a share of between 8 and 9 per cent of the UK
DMI market.
Worldwide life and pensions business contributed Pounds 150.9m (up from
Pounds 126.4m) to pre-tax profits, of which Pounds 109.1m was generated in
the UK, up from Pounds 103.2m.
New premium income from life and pensions fell sharply, however. Worldwide
annual premiums dropped to Pounds 196.3m, from Pounds 223.2m, while single
premiums amounted to Pounds 874.6m (against Pounds 1bn).
In the UK annual premiums were down to Pounds 143.2m (from Pounds 170.1m).
Single premiums fell to Pounds 735.7m (from Pounds 903.9m).
Fund management new business increased to Pounds 2.32bn from Pounds 905.4m,
largely reflecting a rise in the UK to Pounds 2.23bn from Pounds 854.6m.
Total funds under management increased to Pounds 24.69bn (from Pounds
19.26bn).
Earnings per share rose to 18.5p from 8.96p.

FT  19 MAR 93 / GPA says net assets have halved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP has told its shareholders that its net assets have more than
halved, from Dollars 1.23bn to Dollars 520m (Pounds 366.1m) primarily
because it has been forced to compensate aircraft manufacturers for
cancelling orders.
Separately it also emerged last night that banks have granted the
financially troubled aircraft leasing group a further one-month waiver of
breaches on its banking covenants, narrowly beating today's deadline.
A financier involved in the GPA restructuring also said that the group was
very close to securing banks' approval to defer Dollars 1bn of debt
repayments until 1996.
It has received 100 per cent votes in favour from providers of a Japanese
club loan, worth Dollars 150m, and providers of an interim financing
facility of Dollars 325m. On its two bigger facilities, it has received
close to 100 per cent approval on one facility and almost 90 per cent on the
other. This deferral of repayments is conditional on GPA succeeding in its
attempt to raise Dollars 200m in new equity through a rights issue of
convertible preference shares.
Mr Maurice Foley, the group's deputy chairman, said that in order to satisfy
the banks, GPA needs to receive firm commitments for Dollars 100m of this
equity within a month and the rest within a further three months.
He said that slightly more than half of the equity would have to come from
new investors, because one third of its existing shareholders are too
financially stretched to subscribe for the convertible shares and another 20
per cent are unlikely to do so.
'We are talking to between three and six potential investors', he said. As
yet none of GPA's existing shareholders have committed themselves to taking
up their rights.
The restated net asset figure is included in a document sent to
shareholders. Mr Foley said the net asset figure was a 'pro forma' estimate.
He said that net assets could turn out to be different, 'either higher or
lower', when the accounts are audited.
On the basis of the estimate, net assets per share are Dollars 4.25,
compared with Dollars 10.10 last March.
Mr Foley said the decline also reflects provisions made to cover penalties
the group would face if its fails to take delivery of aircraft.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Guinness stays confident after first fall in 13 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS, the brewing and spirits group, expects to make 'steady progress'
this year after a 12 per cent slide in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 795m -
its first setback for 13 years.
Although there was little prospect of world market conditions easing, Mr
Tony Greener, chairman and chief executive, said the group's brands were
performing creditably and marketing expenditure was being increased.
'Our strategy for the future is one of organic growth, and we have
demonstrated our ability to perform in this way through the recession,' Mr
Greener said.
Spirits profits had achieved organic growth of 6 per cent and beer 9 per
cent in 1992.
Group profits last year were hit by an exceptional charge of Pounds 125m:
Pounds 77m for restructuring the Cruzcampo brewing business in Spain, and
Pounds 48m for reorganising Scotch whisky production.
Cruzcampo's profits declined by nearly 33 per cent to Pounds 41m as the
Spanish beer market fell 4 per cent. Improvements in productivity, including
a 15 per cent cut in the workforce over three years, are being accelerated.
Diluted earnings per share of 27.8p were 11 per cent lower but a final
dividend of 8.5p lifts the total payment to 11.85p, an increase of 10 per
cent. The rise was not enough, however, to prevent Guinness shares falling
17p, to close yesterday at 468p.
Spirits profits, before exceptional costs, improved 3 per cent to Pounds
769m on turnover 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 2.58bn. Overall, Scotch whisky
volumes were flat but premium and deluxe brands increased sales. The
Japanese market was affected by cutbacks in corporate entertainment but
gains were made in the take-home trade. Profits were well ahead in the rest
of the Asia Pacific region, and also improved in the US, South America, and
most European markets.
Brewing profits, before restructuring costs, rose 3 per cent to Pounds 252m
on turnover of Pounds 1.75bn, 10 per cent higher. Total volumes were lower
than in 1991 but the Guinness brand achieved significant growth in
continental Europe, Asia Pacific and the Caribbean. Draught sales helped the
brand gain 4 per cent of the UK beer market. The contribution from LVMH, in
which Guinness has a 24 per cent stake, fell from Pounds 123m to Pounds
101m.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Strong performance from Reed Elsevier: Newly combined group
ahead 19%; Upbeat statement on shape of the merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED International and Elsevier, the UK and Dutch publishing groups which
merged on January 1, said the fabric of their new organisation was taking
shape.
Reed yesterday reported nine-month figures to bring it into step with
Elsevier, which gave full-year results for 1992. From now on the merged
group will report combined results, although both companies will retain
their separate stock market listings in London and Amsterdam.
A strong performance by books and publishing caused Reed International to
lift pre-tax profits 10.2 per cent to Pounds 137m in the nine-month period
to December 31. Scientific publishing helped Elsevier increase its 1992
operating profit before tax - which it traditionally regards as the best
measure of its performance - by 19.3 per cent to Fl 618.2m (Pounds 225.3m).
The combined group produced a pro-forma statement for the year to December
31, which showed a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 412m in
the year to December 31. Sales were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 2.46bn.
Merger costs of Pounds 42m were taken as an exceptional item, as were
restructuring costs of Pounds 12m, although these were unrelated to the
merger.
Reed Elsevier said measures had been taken to ensure that the combined
group's medical publishing companies were managed on a unified basis, the
business-to-business operations in the US were merged, and the scientific
journal businesses in the UK integrated. 'Cost-savings have been identified
in other parts of the business, but in the current year much of the benefit
will be masked by the restructuring costs that follow such a significant
merger.'
The group's book, magazine and newspaper businesses had performed well in
difficult economic conditions and would benefit from cyclical recovery.
There was, however, little evidence this had started yet in the UK and in
1993 these markets were expected to weaken in the Netherlands.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Japanese brokers cut forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S top 14 brokerages yesterday sharply cut their profit projections for
the year to the end of March, reflecting the fall in share prices and
trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Daiwa Securities highlighted the
brokers' miserable forecasts by predicting pre-tax losses of Y8bn (Pounds
46.8m), the first time it will have been in the red since 1964.
However, the Big Four houses, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi, said the
rally in Tokyo prices over the past two weeks could mark a turning point for
the industry and the market, which has been falling for the past three
years.
The depth of the brokerages' problems was underlined by Yamaichi saying it
expected net losses for the year of Y48bn - in stark contrast to its
previous forecast, made at the half-year stage, that it would break even.
Last year Yamaichi reported net losses of Y52.3bn.
Losses will be particularly severe among the 10 second-tier brokers, under
pressure because of their dependence on commission income and their rapid
expansion during the late 1980s. Kankaku Securities expects net losses of
Y50.3bn, New Japan Securities Y39.5bn, and Sanyo Securities Y30.2bn.
The brokerages have been assisted by the Japanese government's campaign to
support stock prices until the close of the financial year. Each of the
houses will be required to write off appraisal losses on stock portfolios,
after having won a reprieve from the ministry of finance for the close of
the first half in September.
In another apparent attempt to bolster the Tokyo market, the ministry hinted
that the amount of public funds available for investment in stocks could be
increased next fiscal year. The ministry was echoing demands made by members
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Even with the government intervention, Nomura admitted its expected net
profits of Y2bn would come only after a Y18.48bn special profit on the
planned sale on March 29 of a building to its subsidiary Nomura Land and
Building. The sale will help cover an extraordinary loss of Y23bn.

FT  19 MAR 93 / Spring Ram falls on profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM, the kitchens and bathrooms company which was once a stock market
darling, lost half its market value yesterday as it warned that 1992 pre-tax
profit would be a third less than expected.
The company said the pre-tax figure would be not less than Pounds 26m, down
from a restated Pounds 36.2m in 1991. Analysts had predicted Pounds
37m-Pounds 40m. The share price fell from 129p pre-Wednesday's suspension to
63 1/2 p yesterday, valuing the company at Pounds 232m compared with its May
1992 peak of Pounds 651m.
Spring Ram's announcement followed haggling with its auditors over the
implementation of more conservative accounting principles. Questions about
the company's financial controls and accounting methods have undermined its
credibility before, most spectacularly last November when false accounting
was revealed at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary.
Yesterday's announcement listed Pounds 12.9m of deductions to the pre-tax
profit figure that the group would have announced under its old methods.
The biggest item was Pounds 5.6m of profits that the group had planned to
take in 1992 but which had to be pushed back. Analysts expressed unease
about this and were confused by the explanation that it was due to a draft
accounting standard.
Some shareholders suggested that Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director,
should resign. Calls for the group to appoint non-executive directors were
reiterated. Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, said yesterday the group planned to
appoint two.
The profit shortfall was due to new accounting standards. The group was
surprised that so many companies had reported under FRS 3 before the
deadline and had only recently decided to follow. Pre-tax profit grew from
Pounds 1m in 1982 to Pounds 37.6m, before restatement, in 1991, on turnover
of Pounds 194.2m. The results are to be announced on Monday.

A GROUP of leading computer companies yesterday announced plans to develop a
'unified' version of Unix, the computer operating system software that has
long been touted as a standard for 'open systems' - computers that can share
software and data. The move follows years of industry in-fighting.
The group includes IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems as well as
software companies The Santa Cruz Operation, Novell and Unix System
Laboratories, a unit of AT&amp;T.
It said that it would work to establish software standards. There are
numerous incompatible versions of Unix, and the fragmentation has caused
confusion, stunting the growth of open systems.
By establishing a standard version of Unix, the group aims to encourage
software developers to write new applications programs for Unix, thus making
their computer and software products more attractive.
Over the past few years there has been a series of failed efforts by
industry groups to establish a single standard version of Unix.

By establishing a standard version of Unix, the group aims to encourage
software developers to write new applications programs for Unix, thus making
their computer and software products more attractive.
An operating system is the software that controls the basic functions of a
computer. Applications software, such as accounting systems or
word-processing programs, are generally designed to run on a single
operating system and must be rewritten if they are to run on a different
one.
Over the past few years there has been a series of failed efforts by
industry groups to establish a single standard version of Unix.
This latest group may be more successful, however, because it includes
former antagonists, analysts said.
The group may also be more highly motivated to work together because Unix
faces a new challenger in Microsoft's Windows NT, a powerful computer
operating system that is expected to be launched in May.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Losses deepen 10-fold at
Hoogovens on price cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STEEP PRICE cuts and a stream of cheap imports from eastern Europe helped
push Hoogovens, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, into heavy losses in
1992. This has forced the company to omit a dividend for the second
consecutive year.
Hoogovens' net loss widened to Fl 595m (Dollars 318m), a 10-fold increase
from its 1991 loss of Fl 51m. More than half of the loss was due to
after-tax provisions of Fl 370m which were taken to pay for job cuts and
write-offs.
Although first-half losses in 1993 are likely to match the deficit seen in
the 1992 second half, the company expects to see a turnround in the downward
trend in the course of the first six months, thanks to its own cost-cutting
efforts as well as to firmer prices and rising demand in the market.
Mr Maarten van Veen, chairman, said Hoogovens would be able to ride out
Europe's steel crisis 'under its own steam'.
Price increases for steel announced in January were holding a development
which he described 'as very good news but something that was badly needed'.
In 1992, steel prices slumped by 6 per cent, taking the cumulative decline
since 1989 to 20 per cent.
Yesterday's figures were less gloomy than analysts had feared, and the
shares closed up 9.2 per cent at Fl 27.30.
In steel, losses widened to Fl 234m from Fl 98m. The aluminium sector, badly
hit by a flood of primary metal from the former Soviet Union, swung into a
loss of Fl 162m from a marginal profit of Fl 3m a year earlier.
The 1992 losses helped push down shareholders' equity to 21.2 per cent of
total assets from 27.4 per cent in 1991.
The company aims to strengthen its finances by reducing inventories and
deconsolidating some non-core activities, either by divesting or hiving them
off into partnerships. It gave no details but cited the example of its
recent venture in scrap metal with Klockner of Germany.
Hoogovens will also use part of its Fl 1bn stand-by credit facility from ABN
Amro and Rabobank towards meeting up to Fl 700m in 1993 loan redemptions.
The credit facility, formed in 1986, has never not been used until now.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Celestion on track with Pounds 11,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXTENSIVE restructuring at Celestion Industries, which now concentrates
on supplying lingerie and womens' swimwear almost exclusively to Marks and
Spencer, saw the company return to the black last year after disposing of
its audio division and Slix swimwear brand.
Pre-tax profits in 1992 were just Pounds 11,000 after a 1991 loss of Pounds
1.06m. But profits on continuing business more than trebled to Pounds 1.42m
(Pounds 395,000).
A similar picture applied to sales. Overall turnover was Pounds 35.5m
(Pounds 36.6m). But after stripping out results from Celestion Audio, sold
last June, and Slix, sold in December, turnover for the remaining core
business rose by 46 per cent to Pounds 28.9m (Pounds 19.8m).
Operating losses from the audio division and Slix totalled Pounds 1.2m
(Pounds 1.03m). There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 522,000 relating
to the disposal of the businesses.
Mr Charles Ryder, chief executive, said the disposals left Celestion free to
concentrate on building its business with M&amp;S through Celestion Textiles and
Vega, a lingerie supplier acquired last September. He expected sales growth
in Celestion Textiles this year to be in line with the 30 per cent achieved
in 1992.
Earnings per share were 0.2p (5.1p losses). The single dividend is increased
17 per cent to 1.4p (1.2p).

FT  18 MAR 93 / OCP consortium set deadline to top Gehe's FFr2bn bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FRENCH consortium seeking to outbid Gehe, the German medicines group, for
control of Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, France's largest medicines
wholesaler, was yesterday given a deadline of April 9 to beat the German
FFr2.12bn (Dollars 370m) offer.
The time limit is a consequence of the Paris stock exchange's decision
yesterday to grant legal clearance to Gehe's controversial bid for OCP.
The German offer, worth FFr800 per share for at least 50.01 per cent of the
fully diluted equity, will be open from today until April 16, said the SBF
stock exchange association.
Under French takeover law, any counterbid must be launched five trading days
before the close, in this case April 9.
Gehe announced a friendly offer last month, with the support of Mr
Jean-Pierre Duche, OCP's chief executive.
However the group's largest single shareholder, the Bourely family, with 15
per cent of the equity, subsequently opposed the Gehe offer and has been
trying ever since to mount a French counterbid.
The government has lent advice but denies having assisted the French
consortium.
OCP's FFr33bn annual turnover gives it 43 per cent of the French market for
drugs supplies to high street chemists, making it an important player in
pharmaceuticals marketing.
Potential members of the counterbidding group include Rhone-Poulenc, the
state-owned chemicals group, other French drugs companies, Cooperation
Pharmaceutique Francaise, a distributor of medical equipment and
pharmaceutical supplies, and leading investment banks.
The consortium has been hampered by its lack of a leader prepared to take
operational and management charge of OCP.
However, its members are discussing how to share out responsibilities and
maintain they have a good chance of winning control.
The SBF said the bid closure deadline might be extended because of a legal
appeal against a separate clearance for the Gehe offer granted by the CBV
stock exchange regulator.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: OCP bidder set time limit to top
Gehe offer

<TEXT>
A FRENCH consortium seeking to outbid Gehe, the German medicines group, for
control of Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, France's largest medicines
wholesaler, was yesterday given a deadline of April 9 to beat the German
FFr2.12bn (Dollars 370m) offer.
The time limit is a consequence of the Paris stock exchange's decision
yesterday to grant legal clearance to Gehe's controversial bid for OCP.
The German offer, worth FFr800 per share for at least 50.01 per cent of the
fully diluted equity, will be open from today until April 16, said the SBF
stock exchange association.
Under French takeover law, any counterbid must be launched five trading days
before the close, in this case April 9.
Gehe announced a friendly offer last month, with the support of Mr
Jean-Pierre Duche, OCP chief executive.
However the group's largest single shareholder, the Bourely family, with 15
per cent of the equity, subsequently opposed the Gehe offer and has been
trying ever since to mount a French counterbid.
The government has lent advice but denies having assisted the French
consortium.
OCP's FFr33bn annual turnover gives it 43 per cent of the French market for
drug supplies to high street chemists.
Potential members of the counterbidding group include Rhone-Poulenc, the
state-owned chemicals group.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Polly Peck administrators fail in court move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 17-MONTH attempt by Touche Ross, the administrators of Polly Peck
International, to sue the Central Bank of Turkish Cyprus for Pounds 45m was
rejected yesterday by the Court of Appeal.
The claim was part of the attempt by the administrators to recover between
Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m which was allegedly misappropriated from the
collapsed fruit and electronics group.
Touche Ross had claimed that the bank had knowingly assisted Mr Asil Nadir,
the former chairman of Polly Peck, in committing an alleged fraud or had
received the Pounds 45m knowing that it was being paid in breach of Mr
Nadir's fiduciary duty to Polly Peck.
Mr Nadir was alleged to have used the bank as a conduit through which Polly
Peck's money was diverted to 'friendly' hands in Northern Cyprus and
elsewhere.
Touche Ross had been given permission by the High Court to issue a writ
against the bank in Northern Cyprus, outside the jurisdiction of the UK
courts.
Three Appeal Court judges ruled yesterday by a 2-1 majority that the case
against the bank was not strong enough to justify allowing the writ to be
served in a foreign country.
Touche Ross said afterwards that it would be seeking leave to appeal against
the decision by the judges in the House of Lords.
Last year the Court of Appeal refused Touche Ross a Mareva injunction to
freeze Pounds 29m of assets held by the bank.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Debt collectors, telemarketing agencies and the public utilities have at
least one thing in common: they need to contact lists of consumers by
telephone, be it to nag them, persuade them or even to warn them.
It is most frustrating when the number dialled is engaged, goes unanswered
or is answered by an answering machine. But technology is now available to
weed out these calls. Only when the system detects a live voice will it
connect the call to the caller's headset. At the same time details of the
person called - name, address and so on - appear on the operator's computer
screen.
To help companies exploit the technology CMG, the IT management group, has
launched Predics (predictive dialling consultancy service). Independent
analysts believe predictive dialling can increase productivity by several
hundred per cent. CMG: UK, 071 976 0066.

<TEXT>
While national rivalry has been a potent force for good and ill, it is
perhaps less well understood as a force for deliberately inflating a firm's
accounts. National pride is, however, the only explanation building products
group Expamet International can offer for the behaviour of managers at what
used to be its Netherlands duct-making subsidiary, Brema-Air.
They were recently discovered to have inflated profit figures because, it
seems, the Dutchmen simply couldn't bear to be seen to lag behind the
group's UK businesses. However, Expamet is not taking the local managers to
court, since none of the miscreants made a penny from their misdeeds.
Indeed, Expamet boss Alex Orr, who understands the intensity of
international rivalries from the days when he ran the mile for Scotland  -
tells me that far from profiting, they even put Pounds 500,000 of their own
money into the company during the audit, although they took it out
afterwards.

FT  18 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Mexico City in Dollars 1bn water deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE British and two French water companies, working with Mexican partners,
have won contracts worth more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 704m) over 10 years
to improve water and sewerage services in Mexico City.
The contracts, described as among the biggest of their kind, are part of an
attempt to expand and upgrade the capital's water and waste water system and
to improve the service to about 9m people. The government is relying
increasingly on private sector enterprises to carry out work previously done
by the state.
North-West Water and its Mexican joint venture partner, the construction
group Grupo Gutsa, won a contract valued at Dollars 400m over 10 years to
provide services for five of the 16 municipalities, representing almost a
third of the city.
Severn-Trent and its partner Iasa won a contract valued at Dollars 350m in
four municipalities in the central and north-eastern areas of the capital.
A group incorporating Anglian Water and Lyonnaise des Eaux, which together
have a 49 per cent stake in a joint venture with Bufete Industrial and
Bancomer of Mexico, was awarded a contract for four municipalities covering
2.3m people, although financial details were not available.
The contract won by a joint venture of Generale des Eaux, with a 30 per cent
stake, the construction group ICA and bankers Banamex, covered three
municipalities and is expected to yield turnover of FFr500m (Pounds 63m) a
year after the first two years, according to the company.
The first stage will involve preparing a water census for the city,
installing meters and mapping the water and sewer network. New billing
methods will also be put in place and a large programme of repairs and
improvements carried out.

<TEXT>
THE FLOW of black news from German industry was interrupted yesterday by
reports of rising profits and pay-outs from two engineering groups.
Barmag, which claims to be the world's leading synthetic fibre machinery
maker, offered a DM2.50 bonus on top of a repeated DM10 dividend.
Vogele, a specialist in road-building equipment, proposed a DM2 increase to
DM12 after a 20 per cent increase in net profits in 1992.
Against a background of deepening slump elsewhere in engineering, Barmag
benefited from strong demand for exports. Net earnings rose by a third to
DM36m (Dollars 22m) on sales up 20 per cent at DM1.18bn, the company said
yesterday.
The group, which exports more than 80 per cent of its output, reported
especially strong growth in Asian markets. Incoming orders almost doubled
last year to DM1.53bn and according to an interim report, further
improvements are expected in 1993. At present Barmag has nine months' orders
in hand, around double the level in engineering at large.
Meanwhile, Vogele increased net profits 20 per cent to DM3.6m. The company
has continued to enjoy the fruits of the infrastructural building boom in
eastern Germany and exports more than half its road construction machines.
While it expected a further satisfactory result for the current year, it
noted that orders had fallen.

CBR, the Belgian cement group, proposed an unchanged net dividend of BFr270

from Brussels. The company said earlier its consolidated net profit per
share fell to BFr606 from BFr797 in 1991.
CBR said the 1992 profit fall was mainly due to the recession in the US and
to a lesser extent to a slump in the Dutch construction industry.
CBR is 43.2 per cent owned by Belgium's flagship holding company, Societe
Generale de Belgique.

CREDIT National, the French corporate banking group, saw net profits rise by
9.1 per cent to FFr585.9m (Dollars 103.6m) in 1992 from FFr537.2m in 1991,
in spite of the pressures on France's financial sector.
In recent weeks a series of French financial institutions have announced
disappointing results for 1992, when the banking sector was affected by weak
demand for credit, higher borrowing costs following the September currency
crisis and exposure to the precarious property market.
Credit National, by contrast, fared well, in spite of having to increase
provisions - mainly because of the need to make write-downs on its property
portfolio and investments.
The group managed to produce a healthy 15 per cent increase in operating
profits to FFr725m.
The group also benefited from a positive contribution from its partnership
agreement with IKB Deutsche Industriebank, the German corporate banking
group.
Credit National and IKB are expanding their partnership into a
cross-shareholding agreement under which each would take 5 per cent of the
other's equity.

A 155-page report condemns Uni's actions during the failed raid on Skandia
in the period August 15 1991 to August 25 last year.
Uni, during 1991 and 1992, built a 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia in spite
of a law forbidding Norwegian financial institutions from owning more than
10 per cent of foreign financial concerns without a special concession.
Uni borrowed heavily to finance the acquisition in an attempt to force the
Swedish insurer into a Nordic pact.
Uni last year collapsed into the hands of public administrators after
suspending payments to creditors.
The Uni affair has become known as Norway's biggest corporate scandal. The
finance minister is due to issue a report to parliament on the affair later
this year, and a public commission is soon to be named to launch another
investigation into the scandal.
The company's board has two weeks in which to appeal the ruling.
Separately, despite Uni shareholders' complaints, the bourse decided to
uphold its earlier decision to de-list the company indefinitely.

THE EAST Asiatic Company, the shipping and international trading group,
faces an urgent need to cut debt and restructure its capital this year,
according to Mr Michael Fiorini, chief executive, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
The company fell into the red last year with a loss of DKr1.18bn (Dollars
184m), compared with a profit of DKr245m in the previous 12 months. The loss
cuts EAC's equity capital to DKr1.75bn last year, from DKr3.14bn in 1991.
EAC will not pay a dividend this year after a 9 per cent pay-out in 1991.
The group made a primary operating loss of DKr55m, compared with a profit of
DKr506m in 1991, although sales increased to DKr17.30bn from DKr15.63bn.
After net financial expenditure, which increased to DKr615m from DKr99m, a
profit of DKr281m in 1991 was turned into a loss of DKr813m.
The final net loss figure was arrived atreached after income from disposals
and write-offs, and loss provisions for businesses that have been or will be
discontinued.
The group's result in the current year would remain unsatisfactory, said the
annual report, 'but the plans which have been made . . . should ensure that
EAC will strengthen its financial position in the course of 1993'.

<TEXT>
THE CITY of Boston was flabbergasted on Tuesday night when its mayor of 10
years, Mr Raymond Flynn, announced he was to be the next US ambassador to
the Vatican.
There had been no hint in the days before St Patrick's Day that the popular
Mr Flynn - Boston-Irish, liberal, Catholic and an opponent of abortion -
would be so honoured or was thinking of leaving his urban charge in the
middle of his third term.
Most local speculation had centred on who was to become the next ambassador
to Dublin, a nomination long expected to mark the visit to the White House
yesterday of Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister.
President Bill Clinton confirmed most rumours by announcing that he had
chosen Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of Senator Edward Kennedy from
Massachusetts and his two slain brothers.
Another woman with impeccable political credentials, but no formal career in
politics, is widely expected to get the plum embassy in Paris. This is Mrs
Pamela Harriman, English-born widow of the US statesman Mr Averell Harriman,
former wife of Mr Randolph Churchill, and mother of Mr Winston Churchill, a
Conservative member of the UK parliament.
Mrs Harriman is a great Washington and international socialite, long a
prominent Democratic party fundraiser and an early supporter of Mr Clinton.
She speaks French fluently and is widely reckoned to possess a political
acumen comparable to her considerable charm.
The Paris embassy, like that in London, is normally reserved for political
patronage, and Mrs Harriman was rumoured at one stage to be in line to be
ambassador in the country of her birth. She always denied this, expressing a
preference to stay in Washington now that it had a Democratic president.
It is now widely believed that Mr Raymond Seitz, the first professional
diplomat ever to be US ambassador to the Court of St James, has been asked
to stay on in his present post for at least another year. This would satisfy
the UK government, which regards him highly.
Another important embassy, that in Tokyo, also seems to have been earmarked
for Mr Richard Holbrooke, the Asian expert who served in President Jimmy
Carter's State Department.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Brazil still has no budget for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE months after it should have been voted by Congress, Brazil has no
budget for 1993. Six months into office, the government of President Itamar
Franco has still not filled thousands of administration jobs.
The delays are the fault of congressmen who, with their eyes on next year's
elections, are demanding government jobs for supporters and money for
projects in their areas as reward for their support for last year's
impeachment of President Fernando Collor and for voting through government
legislation.
Brazil's highly fragmented party system means that each bill must be
negotiated with 19 parties.
This year, the budget commission received a record 75,000 requests for the
Dollars 9bn which Congress controls of the government budget. On Sunday, Mr
Messias Gois, the commission's president, fled in tears from negotiations
after being attacked by the proponents of 5,000 amendments excluded from the
commission's proposal.
It seems to matter little what the projects are for. The latest budget
proposal awards more money to Bahia than to Amazonia for combating malaria,
yet the disease is almost unknown in the first and endemic in the latter. It
reduces to a third the government provision of resources for land reform -
one of Brazil's biggest problems. The most popular requests are bridges and
roads, because of the potential commissions and electoral appeal.
Some deputies are even directors of engineering companies. Mr Paes Landim, a
deputy who suggested using the army for road construction, had his amendment
shot down, he believes 'because the army don't pay commission'.
Complaining that Brazil was ending up with schools where it needs sewerage
and bridges where it needs hospitals, Mr Paulo Bernardo, the Workers' Party
representative on the commission, said: 'This is becoming a complete
marketplace.' Mr Gois told the Brazilian press that he had been offered
Dollars 1m bribes by some deputies to accede to their requests.
Finally this week, a compromise was reached by the commission, but it must
still pass through Congress. Waiting impatiently is Ms Yeda Crusius, the
planning minister, unable to plan without the budget.
Little better is the process under way to fill jobs in ministries,
government agencies and state companies. Mr Franco's wide congressional
support means 18 parties, further divided into regional blocs, jostling for
positions.
A group of deputies from Minas Gerais state have set up a system whereby
they award points for federal jobs in their state such as running state
companies. Points are then awarded to the deputies according to the level of
support they have given to Mr Franco. All then have the right to spend their
points.
None of this is very inspiring for Brazilians, who vote next month in a
referendum on whether to maintain a presidentiial system or return to a
parliamentary system and even a monarchy.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Rocard sows fresh discord among left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Rocard yesterday sowed further dissension in his Socialist party,
which faces electoral defeat in Sunday's general election, by repeating his
open criticism of President Francois Mitterrand.
In an interview in Le Figaro newspaper yesterday, Mr Rocard, considered the
party's likely standard-bearer in the 1995 presidential election, toned down
earlier remarks that Socialists were generally being victimised by an
electorate which had 'personal scores to settle' with Mr Mitterrand.
Popular sentiment against the president was 'without doubt unjust', and
Socialists had to accept some of the blame for it, he said. A recent poll
showed 62 per cent of voters disapproved of Mr Mitterrand's performance, and
only 24 per cent approved.
However, Mr Rocard went on to criticise Mr Mitterrand for failing, following
his 1988 presidential election victory, to reach out properly to parties to
the left and centre of the Socialists. The president had chosen to deal
'with individuals and not with political forces'. This was why, Mr Rocard
said, he himself had recently called for a 'big bang' recomposition of the
left after this month's election.
The criticism, four days before the first round of parliamentary voting,
provoked embarrassment and anger among Socialists. Mrs Martine Aubry, labour
minister, accused Mr Rocard of political cowardice. 'To blame others,
whether within or outside one's party, shows a lack of courage and is
especially worrisome for the rebuilding of the left,' she said. In a
reminder that Mr Rocard was prime minister from 1988 to 1991, she said:
'It's a collective failure.'
Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister and a Rocard protege, said his mentor
'could have spared us such unnecessary little comments'. Mr Charles Pasqua,
a hard-line Gaullist, lauded Mr Mitterrand for at least having had the
courage during the campaign to 'climb to the bridge of the sinking Socialist
ship and to tie himself to its mast, in the old navy tradition'.
The Rocard-Mitterrand rift reflects long-standing personal rancour, but may
just be a foretaste of internal Socialist recrimination. It overshadowed the
government's last pre-election cabinet meeting. That gathering produced a
proposal to use privatisation proceeds to fund state pensions, calls for the
EC to raise fish prices to help distressed French fishermen and demands that
Brussels desist from deregulation of European utility monopolies.
Opinion polls show that more than 75 per cent of farmers plan to vote for
the right-wing opposition, which has pledged to renegotiate last year's
reform of EC agriculture policy.
Some 2,000 employees of Thomson Tubes Electroniques, which makes television
tubes, voted yesterday to share work among themselves in order to avoid 412
redundancies threatened by the management.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Greece forecasts growth of 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greek economy ministry forecasts that growth this year will be
stimulated by a sharp rise in investment, with gross domestic product
increasing by 2 per cent.
According to the ministry's economic overview for 1993, overall investment
will increase by 7.2 per cent, led by a 10.9 per cent rise in the public
sector, which will benefit from generous European Community transfers for
infrastructure spending.
Private investment is expected to go up by 5.7 per cent, against a 0.6
increase in 1992 and a 6 per cent decline the previous year.
The ministry said its forecast reflected 'a positive business climate, with
the prospect of lower interest rates as inflation comes down and more
opportunities for investment as state enterprises are privatised.'
Private sector analysts have forecast lower GDP growth, close to last year's
l5 per cent, mainly because of a decline in agricultural output. However,
the ministry predicts that the effects of a winter drought will be
outweighed by higher growth in manufacturing.
Nonetheless, private consumption will rise by only 1.3 per cent, as a result
of a continuing public sector wage squeeze. Unemployment will rise to
390,000, equivalent to 9.9 per cent of the workforce.
Exports are forecast to rise by 15.3 per cent this year, after increasing by
14.5 per cent in 1992.
The year-on-year inflation rate, unchanged for the past three months at 14.5
per cent, is expected to decline in the second half of the year, falling
below 10 per cent by December.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Kohl hits snag on property claims draft law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIVISIONS in Germany's ruling coalition yesterday forced Chancellor Helmut
Kohl to withdraw temporarily a draft law on financial compensation for
former property owners in east Germany.
Its withdrawal follows continuing differences in the coalition about who
should be allowed to claim back property in eastern Germany, and ways to
finance a compensation fund. There are 1.5m-2m outstanding property rights
claims in east Germany.
The Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the Chancellor's
Christian Democratic Union, wants those whose land was expropriated by the
Soviet forces in eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949 to be given the right
to seek restitution.
But a 1990 agreement between the two Germanys and four allied powers said
these claimants - many of whom lost large landholdings - should have the
right only to limited compensation.
The bill seeks to raise a maximum of DM12bn (Dollars 7.2bn) to finance
compensation claims for property confiscated by the Nazis between 1935 and
1945 and by the former East German state between 1949 and 1990. Individual
claims could not exceed DM950,000, a significant increase from the DM300,000
proposed last December.
The draft law proposes that compensation pay-outs be based on 1935 land
valuations, rather than current property prices. Claimants, however, say
this is unjust.
The sense of injustice has been fuelled by the way in which the Finance
Ministry hopes to raise the DM12bn compensation fund.
For instance, an individual who successfully claimed back a factory
confiscated by either the Nazis or the communists must pay a property tax.
This will be based on the 1935 land valuation, which is then multiplied by
10.
After five years the claimant must pay a third of that sum to the Finance
Ministry. If the claimant cannot pay, the property would be sold.
A Finance Ministry official said yesterday: 'I really do believe that the
lawyers will say the bill is unfair, if not immoral, because claimants have
to pay for something which was stolen from them in the first place. But I
don't know if they will be able to prove it is unconstitutional.'
Ministry officials expect the bill will stay more or less intact despite
opposition from the CSU and east German politicians.
It is due to go back to the cabinet in two weeks, but officials acknowledge
that it may be referred to the constitutional court, a move which could
delay approval.

FT  18 MAR 93 / The Lang show is hard act to follow: French Socialists have
made the arts a success story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAY after day hundreds of people queue patiently, and not so patiently, on
the square outside the Georges Pompidou Centre in Paris waiting to buy
tickets for the Matisse exhibition.
The Matisse show has been billed as a highlight of the European arts year.
It is also an appropriately grandiose final fling for France's Socialist
government, which, after a decade of lavish support for the arts, faces
crushing defeat in the parliamentary elections, for which the first round is
held this weekend.
Despite the general disenchantment with the Socialists, the arts is one area
where they are still deemed to be successful, thanks partly to the personal
standing of Mr Jack Lang, the charismatic minister of arts and culture who
consistently tops the polls as France's most popular elected politician.
Few political acts are genuinely impossible to follow but that of Mr Lang,
53, is probably one of them. He is a flamboyant figure with apparently
indefatigable energy and a taste for snappy designer suits, who has
dominated the French arts scene since the Socialists first took power in
1981. Liberation, the bible of French culture buffs, even calls the 1980s
l'epoch Lang, the Lang era.
The conservatives now face the unenviable task of finding a way of following
Mr Lang after the elections.
French culture has had a new lease of life in l'epoch Lang, when the
proportion of the state budget allocated to the arts has doubled from 0.5
per cent in 1981 to 1 per cent, or FFr13bn (Dollars 2.3bn), in 1993. Mr Lang
has also pulled off the rare feat of developing popular and innovative
policies. He has done so by blending elements of conventional Socialist
cultural dirigisme, such as state subsidies and industrial restructuring,
with new themes, notably corporate sponsorship.
Mr Lang has even plundered some ideas from the conservatives. The Grands
Projets, the monumental modern architecture schemes including I M Pei's
glass pyramid in the Louvre museum and Jean Nouvel's Arab cultural centre,
are his most visible legacy. But they trace their roots to the 1970s review
of public sector building commissioned by the conservative President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing.
Mr Lang's record is far from flawless. French television is in a fragile
financial state, which culminated in last year's collapse of La Cinq, the
entertainment station. The Paris opera struggles from crisis to crisis
despite an annual budget of FFr800m (two-thirds of which comes from the
state) and the opening three years ago of the glittering FFr3bn Bastille
opera house.
The Lang regime, long criticised by the right, is now under fire from his
old supporters on the left. The latest film from Eric Rohmer, The Tree, The
Mayor and The Mediatheque, is a scathing satire of a Socialist mayor who
secures a generous grant from the Arts Ministry to build a media complex in
his tiny village. Le Canard Enchane, the satirical magazine, recently
published a leaked story about Mr Lang's plans to produce a film about his
own achievements.
But the electorate seems willing to overlook Mr Lang's shortcomings, as
illustrated by his success in the opinion polls. This has left the
conservative coalition of the RPR and UDF in a difficult position. Mr Lang,
the epitome of the sybaritic gauche caviar who have thrived under President
Mitterrand, is exactly the sort of Socialist the conservatives most loathe.
Moreover an extravagant Socialist arts minister is an easy campaign target.
But the right has been forced on to the defensive in the election campaign.
This is partly because of Mr Lang's popularity and partly because of an
internal split. The UDF favours an ascetic approach to cultural spending;
the RPR, whose leader, Mr Jacques Chirac, comes close to rivalling Mr Lang
with his munificent cultural budgets as mayor of Paris, is more indulgent.
All that the conservatives have produced in terms of policy is a pledge to
erase what they call the 'cultural inequalities' of Mr Lang's policies by
fostering cultural activity in the provinces and giving more power to local
authorities to launch their own arts initiatives.
This sounds suspiciously similar to both the Socialists' own arts manifesto
and to the policies pursued by the last conservative government between 1986
and 1988, when, despite constant debates over whether to scrap various Lang
programmes, the right did little to reverse his policies.
The conservatives are also searching for a suitable successor. Mr Alain
Carignon, mayor of Grenoble, and Mr Jacques Tubon, secretary general of the
RPR, have been mooted as candidates as has Mr Bernard-Henri Levy, the
populist philosopher whose girlfriend, Ms Arielle Dombasle, stars in the new
Rohmer film.
Mr Lang himself has always maintained that the true test of his influence
will be whether his reforms survive his departure from his opulent offices
at the Palais Royal in Paris. He will soon find out.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Turkey is offered ceasefire by Kurds
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S Kurdish rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire yesterday, promising
to end hostilities for 25 days if Turkish government forces agreed to hold
to their positions.
The offer was greeted by Kurdish deputies in Turkey's parliament as an
opportunity for a breakthrough in the eight-year insurgency which has
claimed more than 5,000 lives. However, the proposal delivered by Mr
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the rebel Kurdish Workers party (PKK), is likely
to be met with considerable official scepticism after recent government
successes against PKK bases in Turkey's Kurdish-speaking south-east. State
television made no mention of the offer.
Mr Ocalan, known as Apo, made the offer from his headquarters in Lebanon,
undertaking to suspend actions from March 20 to April 15, as a goodwill
gesture to coincide with the Nevrouz or Kurdish new year celebrations on
March 21.
This week Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, called for
nationwide vigilance to avoid last year's 'nightmare', when more than 90
people were killed as the government used armoured vehicles to reassert
control in towns along the border with Iraqi and Syria. The government
blamed the PKK for exploiting the festivities to provoke a separatist
insurrection.
Since then, the PKK has been under intense diplomatic and military pressure,
with reports that Syria has withdrawn its support. Iran, too, is distancing
itself from the rebels. The move follows a concerted diplomatic initiative
from Ankara.
Turkey has also won tacit backing from the Kurds of Iraq, underlined last
October during a sweep by Turkish commandos when PKK units were forced from
the border where they had attacked Turkish posts.

<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S minority coalition government yesterday won a parliamentary vote of
confidence in its economic policies, averting the immediate threat of an
early general election.
The 23 members of the populist opposition New Democracy party, which last
week triggered the country's political crisis, abstained in the vote, which
the government won by 172 votes to 154.
The government's reprieve, however, may only be temporary, as the tensions
between it and New Democracy are not fully resolved.
The New Democrats have sought to be consulted more closely on economic
issues.
The crisis broke out last week when New Democracy refused to support
Sweden's budget proposals, joining the opposition Social Democrats in voting
to return it to committee for review.
This led Prime Minister Carl Bildt to threaten a summer general election if
his four-party centre-right coalition did not win yesterday's vote.
The crisis unsettled financial markets over the last week and led to a sharp
weakening of the krona.
Money market interest rates fell and the krona strengthened in early trading
yesterday in anticipation that the government would survive the vote. The
trend was later reversed.

THE final vestiges of the system of price controls imposed by Italy's early
post-war governments have been removed.
As of yesterday the price of bread and milk, as well as cement and
fertilisers, was liberalised. The inter-ministerial prices committee, Cip,
will however continue to monitor the behaviour of the price of these items,
reserving the right to intervene if prices are raised unnecessarily.
The decision, in line with EC demands, was welcomed by traders' associations
and manufacturers. However, consumers' associations warned that both
producers and traders would seek to take advantage of the liberalisation to
raise prices. Inflation is running at 4.5 per cent a year.
Exports from five Italian regions of Parma ham, Gorgonzola cheese, salami
and other meats and dairy produce came under an EC ban yesterday to stop the
spread of foot and mouth disease, Reuter reports from Brussels.
EC officials said the ban, until the end of March, would apply to meats
processed since February 1 and dairy products.
Some 4,000 head of cattle, pigs, sheep and goats have been slaughtered in
Italy since foot-and-mouth was detected on February 28 following imports of
diseased cattle from Croatia.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Romania calls for talks on Balkans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Romanian foreign minister, Mr Teodor Melescanu, yesterday suggested a
full-scale Balkan conference should be called to discuss the problems of the
region, once a peace agreement settling the future of Bosnia-Hercegovina has
been concluded.
Mr Melescanu, who was in London for talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, said such a conference should be attended not only by all the
Balkan countries but by European Community members such as the UK and
France, the US, Russia and other countries closely involved in the problems
of the former Yugoslavia.
After the end of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, there would be an
urgent need for the Balkan countries to discuss how they could contribute to
the recovery and economic development of the devastated region. Solutions
would also have to be found to the problems of disputed borders, treatment
of ethnic minorities and the vast number of refugees scattered around the
Balkans.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Melescanu admitted that his
country did not like applying economic sanctions against neighbouring
Serbia. 'We don't like these sanctions because we think they are a bit like
sanctions against ourselves,' he said.
However, Mr Melescanu was quick to add that Romania respected the sanctions
because they were the result of an international decision and the only
alternative to military action.
Though much publicity had been given to the sanctions-busting fuel supplies
transported to Serbia in barges along the Danube - which Romania has
recently attempted to block - these amounted to only about 1 per cent of
Serbia's total needs, the minister said.
In Belgrade, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
said Bosnian Serbs had allowed two UN aid convoys blocked on the border with
Serbia since Monday to enter Bosnia yesterday.
The trucks, which had crossed the border bridge at Mali Zvornik, were headed
for the Moslem-held town of Gorazde and for Sarajevo. A third convoy with
aid for Tuzla had also been cleared and was due to set out this morning.
However, deadlock continued over a relief convoy to the stricken town of
Srebrenica, which has been stuck at Mali Zvornik for the past week. Bosnian
Serbs say the convoy cannot be accompanied by a UN military escort, on which
the UN has insisted. Gen Philippe Morillon, UN military commander in Bosnia,
has vowed to stay in Srebrenica until aid reaches the town.
The EC is to contribute Dollars 1.2m in food parcels to be air-dropped into
Bosnia by the US air force, Mr Manuel Marin, EC development and aid
commissioner, announced yesterday, David Gardner reports from Brussels.
The move follows pressure by Mr Hans van den Broek, EC external political
relations commissioner, to develop a joint approach to the conflict in
former Yugoslavia between the Community, the US and Russia.
The EC has also been stung by the high media profile accorded the US air
drops, given that the Community has provided nearly three-fifths of the
relief aid to ex-Yugoslavia, and the overwhelming majority of the ground
troops and officials who deliver this aid by land under near-impossible
conditions.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Clinton 'serious' on Ulster mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday said he was still giving 'serious
consideration' to sending either a special US envoy or a fact-finding
mission to help end the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
But he declared that 'the most significant thing I should be doing now is to
encourage the resumption of the dialogue between the Irish and the British
governments'.
The president spoke after a St Patrick's Day meeting in the White House with
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Mr Reynolds applauded Mr
Clinton's determination to contribute to a solution in Ulster, adding that
the US 'has the potential to be uniquely helpful'.
But Mr Reynolds ducked questions about whether he would support either of
the two initiatives under consideration. The UK government is opposed to the
despatch of an envoy but had indicated a willingness to accept a
fact-finding mission, depending on its terms of reference.
Mr Clinton stressed that 'I don't think the US can make peace in Northern
Ireland and I don't think that the unionists and the nationalists and
anybody else would expect that'.
He added, without elaboration, that he still supported the MacBride
principles intended to ensure that discrimination is not practised in any
foreign investments in the province. Mr Clinton also announced the
nomination of Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, sister to the three Kennedy brothers,
as the next US ambassador to Dublin.
Such modest US political pressure as there was on Mr Clinton to intervene in
Ulster has, if anything, abated since the visit of Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, last month. Yesterday a ritual St Patrick's Day
motion condemning violations of human rights in Ulster and urging Mr Clinton
to send an envoy was introduced into the House for the record by Congressman
Hamilton Fish, New York Republican, but it was not debated.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Iran denies exile claim of explosion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IRANIAN exile office claimed last night that the home of Iran's spiritual
leader, Seyed Ali Khamenei, had been rocked by an explosion, but the claim
was immediately denied in Iran, agencies report.
The French office of exiled Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr claimed
several people were killed in the blast yesterday afternoon.
An official of the Iranian newsagency IRNA denied there had been any
explosion at Khamenei's home. A statement from the Tehran Times said: 'This
story has no base, no truth.'
Khamenei became Iran's spiritual leader after the death in 1989 of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the country's Islamic fundamentalist revolution a
decade earlier.
Mr Bani-Sadr was the Ayatollah's first president but went into exile in 1980
after falling out with the regime.
The report comes a day after an Iranian opposition figure was shot dead in a
Rome street.

FT  18 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US pressure for managed Japan trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW voice yesterday joined the swelling US chorus demanding a form of
'managed trade' with Japan to counter that country's massive trade surplus
with the US.
Mr Derek Shearer, designated deputy undersecretary of commerce for economic
affairs, told a conference organised by the Economic Strategy Institute that
the administration should 'junk' the structural impediments initiative, a
key element of President George Bush's Japan trade policy, and negotiate
'results-oriented' import agreements, with targets for individual sectors.
The prestigious Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations last
month recommended negotiating 'temporary quantitative indicators' with Japan
 -that is, a series of specific trade goals along the lines of the current
semiconductor agreement. President Bill Clinton expressed interest in the
approach when he later met members of the committee.
The consensus developing in Washington is for negotiated Japanese market
shares for sectors in which free market forces are blocked by formal,
structural or cultural trade barriers.
This would avoid Japan 'bashing', strengthen interdependence and recognise
that most US trade problems are 'made in America'.
Mr Shearer, a former Clinton campaign adviser, said the administration had
not yet had time to develop an international economic policy for the
post-cold war world. However, its Japan policy had to recognise that
'Japanese capitalism is different'; the US ought to be 'humble' about its
capacity to change Japan in the way the Bush administration had tried
through the structural impediments initiative.
'We need a results-oriented policy, but one in the context of a global
partnership,' he said. Japan should be fully involved in the attempt to help
Russia because its expertise and capital were badly needed. US-Japanese
co-operation was also required as regards China.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont under fire from Brown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, yesterday said in the Commons
that the government had betrayed the British people by breaking election
pledges not to increase taxation.
He told Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that he would 'never be trusted
again'. Neither, he said, would the Tory party so long as it was led by Mr
John Major, the prime minister.
Mr Brown challenged Tory backbenchers uneasy about the extension of VAT to
domestic fuel and power to join Labour MPs in voting against the new impost
at the end of the four-day Budget debate.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, was ridiculed by
Labour MPs when he argued that the betrayal charge could not be sustained.
He claimed it had been made clear that if it became necessary to raise
revenue - 'and no government can rule out that possibility for all time' -
it would be done by extending the scope of taxation and not by raising rates
of tax.
Earlier Mr Brown called on Mr Lamont to say whether he had mentioned the
likelihood of increases in VAT and National Insurance contributions in his
personal election address.
While volunteering to make a rare intervention on the second day of the
Budget debate, Mr Lamont ignored the question.
Brushing aside Labour jibes, he challenged Mr Brown to say whether the
criticisms he directed at the government should also apply to France which,
with a Socialist administration, also had 3m unemployed, and to Ireland and
Spain, where, in percentage terms, unemployment was at a similar level.
Mr John Townend, MP for Bridlington and chairman of the Conservative
backbench finance committee, had less difficulty than the chancellor when Mr
Brown asked if he had promised his constituents there would be no increase
in taxation. 'I talked about no increases in direct taxation,' he said.
The Budget was welcomed by Mr Michael Brown, Tory MP for Brigg and
Cleethorpes, who underlined his confidence in Mr Lamont by saying he should
present not only the November Budget 'but the one after that in particular'.
Amid jeers and mocking laughter Mr Brown likened the significance of the
chancellor's proposals to the measures taken by Sir Geoffrey Howe in 1981
which 'won' the 1983 election for the Conservative party and 'sowed the
seeds' for the 1987 triumph.

The decision follows a meeting yesterday between British Coal and the NUM at

MR KEITH OATES, a BBC governor who voiced criticism of Mr Birt's financial

own pay.
The money, part of his Pounds 400,000 salary as managing director of Marks

adding that the money was paid for work done abroad, or in England for the
company's subsidiaries in other countries.
Mr Oates's fees, including those as a BBC governor, are paid under the PAYE
system.
A telephone poll of TV executives by Broadcast magazine found that more than
90 per cent thought both Mr Birt and Mr Hussey should resign.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Legal moves by creditors may
delay O&amp;Y debt deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of the biggest creditors of Olympia &amp; York's US operations have
threatened to delay the implementation of numerous debt-restructuring
agreements unless progress is made in setting up a new board of directors
for the developer's US subsidiary.
Sanwa Bank and Citibank detailed their complaints in a filing to a New York
bankruptcy court that revealed disagreements between O&amp;Y's creditors in the
US and Canada. The filing alleged that the management of the US subsidiary,
Olympia &amp; York Realty Corp (OYRC), had been paralysed by these disagreements
and by the delays in reconstituting OYRC's board.
According to the filing, 'current management of the US properties does not
know to whom it should report and on what terms.'
It added that 'US creditors of Olympia &amp; York will continue to refuse to
consummate numerous out-of-court restructurings as the authority of current
management is in doubt.'
The dispute stems from petitions for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection made
by some of O&amp;Y's US subsidiaries at the same time as the Canadian parent,
Olympia &amp; York Developments (OYDL), sought court protection last May.
However, O&amp;Y's US buildings, under OYRC, were not included in the court
protection. OYRC's New York-based management has been trying to keep the
properties outside Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings by selling some assets
and negotiating debt-restructuring agreements with the creditors of others.
OYDL emerged from bankruptcy protection last week. It is now managed by an
administrator, who acts on the advice of a monitoring committee, comprised
of creditors.
Citibank and Sanwa have objected to OYDL's efforts to dismiss the Chapter 11
filings in the US now that court protection of the Canadian company has been
lifted.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: United completes Boeing talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UNITED Airlines, one of the three large US carriers, said yesterday that it
had completed negotiations with the Seattle-based Boeing company over
reducing deliveries of new aircraft, although talks with engine
manufacturers were continuing.
The talks have been closely watched because United is a launch customer for
Boeing's new 777 wide-body jet, and there have been fears that these orders
might be affected.
United declined to comment on what reductions had been agreed, beyond
repeating that the cutbacks would be 'significant'. But Mr Julius Maldutis,
airline analyst at Salomon Brothers, told clients yesterday that United
would probably reduce orders by 29 aircraft next year, and by 28 in 1995.
United is scheduled to meet analysts today.
A Boeing spokesman would not give details of the negotiations but said the
results had been 'fully factored' into the reduced rate of production it
announced in January.
Meanwhile, American Airlines said that it planned to ground 25 McDonnell
Douglas DC10 aircraft between June and the end of 1993 - about half its DC10
fleet. The Dallas-based airline estimates that this will reduce its capacity
in the domestic marketplace by around 3 per cent in 1993 and by about 6 per
cent on an annualised basis.
In the wake of the extremely difficult domestic airline market condition,
the carrier has talked recently about reducing some of its less profitable
operations in the the US. There has also been speculation for many months
that American, one of the big three US carriers, may eventually reduce the
number of domestic hubs which it operates.
American stressed yesterday that it would continue to operate its fleet of
newer Airbuses.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Avonside declines to Pounds 4.56m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Avonside Group, the building services and housebuilding group which operates
in Scotland, northern England and Wales yesterday reported a pre-tax outcome
of Pounds 4.56m in 1992 on almost static sales of Pounds 51.5m.
In its first full set of results since flotation last March the group saw a
42 per cent decline from Pounds 7.88m but paid a final dividend of 2.2p for
a total of 4p. Earnings per share fell to 7.08p (12.4p).
Mr Christopher Glynn, chairman, said base rate fluctuations prior to the
withdrawal from the Exchange Rate Mechanism had undermined confidence among
housebuyers in the closing months of 1992. However, in 1993 an upturn had
been identified following the reduction in real interest rates.
Avonside also reported the Pounds 480,000 cash acquisition of a glazing
company to complement its BS heating subsidiary.

FT  18 MAR 93 / New York banks find new enthusiasm for Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rediscovered enthusiasm of New York banks for Latin America is not yet
shared by most other banks that suffered at their side during the 1980s debt
crisis. Non-US banks, in particular the Germans and Japanese, for tax
reasons were slower to sell off bad loans and will be slower to return, if
they ever do.
In 1992, German bank and US commercial bank exposure to Latin America was
roughly equal at about Dollars 37bn: seven years earlier, US commercial bank
exposure at more than Dollars 80bn was five times that of the German banks.
Others, such as the UK clearing banks have, by and large, become more
domestic in focus during the 1980s.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Life policy sales face sweeping changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING CHANGES to the way life insurance policies are sold will today be
proposed by the Office of Fair Trading.
For the first time independent life insurance sales agents would be required
to tell prospective customers the commission earned on each policy sold, and
agents would be able to undercut each other on price.
Life insurance companies would also have to spell out the value of policies
surrendered before their maturity dates.
The changes, which must be approved by the Treasury, could hit so-called
direct and tied sales agents who account for most new policies sold by
traditional life insurance companies. These outlets charge more than
building societies or independent financial advisers which have lower
commission costs or overheads.
The proposals come after years of wrangling between the life insurance
industry and regulators. The OFT has already rejected two sets of proposed
rule changes by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulatory watchdog, on grounds that they failed to promote sufficient
competition. The OFT has argued that consumers know too little about costs
to be able to make wise choices among a variety of available policies.
The life insurance industry has strenuously rejected efforts to force it to
disclose individual costs to consumers and has also fought against price
competition in policy sales.
Lautro, the industry's self-regulatory body, has argued that high-cost
outlets will be obliged to tell customers they can buy products more cheaply
elsewhere under the 'best advice' rules of the Financial Services Act.
Under the proposals, the OFT will urge that customers be shown illustrations
of investment returns taking into account each company's charges on
policies.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Letter: Budget whittles away at pensions and penalises with
ACT changes (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Miss JENNY NELDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, What the chancellor did not say in his Budget speech, but should have
done, was: 'Some of our multinational companies have a problem with surplus
advance corporation tax. I propose to help them at the expense of the
shareholders of all UK companies by reducing the latter's gross dividends by
6.25 per cent. In addition to helping those multinational companies, I shall
benefit by some Pounds 1.2bn per year.'
One hopes that the need to help the Treasury and the multinational companies
concerned will be appreciated by:
1) those who do not use up their personal allowances and who will face a 20
per cent-plus fall in their tax rebates on dividends;
2) higher rate taxpayers whose higher rate tax on their net dividends will
rise by 25 per cent; and
3) employers whose pension funds will require larger contributions to
compensate for the reduction in their gross UK dividend income of 6.25 per
cent.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Letter: Budget whittles away at pensions and penalises with
ACT changes (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN ELLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is intriguing that Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has cancelled the
statutory retail prices index increase in the amount of pensionable earnings
for the next financial year. It stays at Pounds 75,000.
It seems to be government policy that the relief will be whittled away by
inflation over time, rather as the mortgage interest tax relief figure has
been. It is all very odd; by the turn of the century not only will fewer
promised pension benefits be protected by any form of funded security, but
only the lower-paid will have any interest in pension funds.
It reflects a conflict of policy between the Treasury (determined to abolish
the perceived tax breaks of pension schemes) and the Department of Social
Security which, like its colleagues throughout Europe, for demographic
reasons is anxious to encourage the funded private sector to assume the
burden of the provision of retirement income in order to relieve the public
sector. Since a recent Institute for Fiscal Studies study indicated that the
tax breaks were in reality rather modest, shouldn't the DSS try to argue its
corner a little more strongly?
Otherwise, maybe the Goode Inquiry into pensions law should now call a halt
to its deliberations, and save some public money. Without trying to sound
hyperbolic, if the policy is continued then by the end of the decade there
are unlikely to be that many pension funds around to need increased
protection.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Mr Lamont's wedge and gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I do not want to spoil the party; but it is time someone pointed out that
the UK chancellor has announced what is to all intents and purposes a one
percentage point increase in the rate of income tax to come into effect in a
year. He was able to escape the uproar that a straightforward announcement
would have caused by taking advantage of the strange convention under which
one part of income tax is given the strange name 'employee National
Insurance contribution'.
On the main Budget strategy other commentators have followed my lead in
calling it Augustinian, after the saint who prayed to be made virtuous, but
not yet. The official Treasury more prosaically describes the Budget, which
imposes little extra taxation in the coming year, but which builds up to a
Pounds 10.3bn revenue increase by 1995-96, as wedge-shaped.
I want, however, to concentrate not on the wedge but on the gap that emerges
starkly from the Treasury's Budget Red Book. The projected growth of total
spending measured by nominal gross domestic product is reasonably consistent
with normal growth and declining inflation. The path is distorted downwards
in 1993-94 and upwards in 1994-95 'because of timing effects associated with
the fall in the exchange rate'. But the underlying movement is in the right
direction.
What has, however, changed for the worse compared with last year's Red Book
is the division of the projected nominal growth between real output and
inflation. The projected increase in real output is now about one percentage
point a year less for the next three years than the equivalent path
projected in the 1992 pre-election Red Book.
On the other hand, inflation - despite being at historically low levels - is
now projected on a higher path; and a decline is not expected until 1995-96.
The exit from the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) has not been the costless
joyride that the Europhobes have prematurely celebrated.
The output shortfall is the more worrying of the two. The chancellor seemed
to assume in his Budget speech that any resumption of growth would make
inroads on unemployment and that it was all a question of delays and lagging
indicators. Not so.
There are two key concepts. The first is the output gap. This is an estimate
of the degree to which increases in demand can readily be absorbed by
producers without increasing inflation. (In its modern form it is not a pure
physical measure. There could still be millions unemployed after the gap has
been reduced to zero.) The size of the output gap has been estimated by the
Bank of England to be in a very wide range between 2 1/2 per cent and 7 per
cent of GDP.
The second important concept is the growth of productive potential. If
actual output is growing faster than this, the output gap narrows and
unemployment eventually drops. If output is growing more slowly,
unemployment will increase. This will be so even if the chancellor is
proclaiming 'recovery'. The process will then only be alleviated by wasteful
methods such as premature scrapping of equipment, or forced or voluntary
retirement of workers from the labour force.
The growth of productive potential is estimated by the Treasury at 2 1/4 per
cent a year; but it could well be higher owing to the resilience of
productivity increases. If unemployment is to be reduced output will have to
grow at least as fast as this. Otherwise we remain in a growth depression.
Yet according to the Treasury's projections it is not until 1994-95 that
non-North Sea output even starts to grow fast enough to make inroads into
the output gap. Moreover, even if we take the lowest end of the Bank of
England range for that output gap, it is not quite filled even by 1997-98,
at least one year after the next election.
Some will say that I am taking too seriously estimates, which are only
projections by medium-ranking Treasury officials and are neither targets nor
even forecasts. In the early 1980s, at the end of the last recession, the
Treasury was just as helplessly pessimistic about growth in the late 1980s,
which in the end turned out too fast for comfort.
In fact, the Treasury does have alternative projections, which assume that
non-oil GDP will grow in the medium-term by  1/2 per cent faster and  1/2
per cent slower than its central projection. The only implications it shows
in detail are those for the Budget deficit, which are startling enough.
On the central projection, the public sector borrowing requirement only
drops to Pounds 30bn or 3 3/4 per cent of GDP by 1997-98, early in the next
parliament. This is above the Maastricht limit of 3 per cent, but I suspect
it would be sustainable - a matter on which the promised separation of the
government's capital and current accounts might shed light. The higher
growth projection, on the other hand, leaves the PSBR at 2 1/4 per cent of
GDP, well within Maastricht guidelines.
The policy problems are brought out most startlingly by the low-growth
projection. Here the PSBR falls only slightly, despite the projected tax
increases and remains in 1997-98 at 5 1/4 per cent of GDP. This is about the
same as in the last year of the Callaghan government.
What are the policy implications? Would we need ferocious cuts in spending
and tax increases to reduce the Budget deficit to a sustainable rate? Or, on
the contrary, would the deficit have to be allowed to run or even increase
to stimulate spending in a slack economy? I would be interested in the views
of informed readers, so long as they are typed, and they do not expect an
individual reply.
It is symptomatic of the lack of progress of macroeconomics that a response
anywhere between these opposites can be justified by qualified
practitioners. Simply doing horrifying algebra on the explosion of debt
interest is inadequate. For such sums normally assume that output is
unaffected by the deficit or measures taken to curb or increase it.
In fact, the Budget is not just a replica of that of households and
companies. On the contrary, it is reasonable for the public sector to spend
more at a time when the private sector is hesitant to spend.
Of course, it would not make sense to pay out larger and larger sums of
debt-servicing at high interest rates to the people whose money the
government has borrowed. If the long-term climate turns out to be
deflationary rather than inflationary, it would be best to use fiscal policy
as a shock absorber, and then concentrate on reducing interest rates.
Such a course would be difficult for Britain alone because of exchange rate
implications. Some have said that the UK is in no position to take a lead in
international economic policy, after the humiliation of its departure from
the ERM. The present state of world economic leaders is such that anyone
with ideas could take a lead.
It would however help if the British government did more to dispel the
widespread Continental view that its main recovery strategy is competitive
devaluation - a view I spend so much time trying to dispel on Continental
visits. But to do so would involve saying more about sterling than the
purely historical frightened sentences which appear in the Red Book. Nor is
British influence helped by Norman Lamont's seizure of every opportunity to
beat the patriotic tin drum for his backbenchers.

<TEXT>
MAKING DEMOCRACY WORK
Civic Traditions in Modern Italy
By Robert D Putnam Princeton
University Press, Dollars 24.95. 258 pages
Here is a book resolutely imbued with counter-cyclical character. Just as
cartloads of Italian politicians and businessmen are being arrested on
suspicion of involvement in corruption scandals, along comes a lengthy study
examining and, in many cases, upholding Italy's credentials as a paradigm of
democratic society.
The author, a professor of government at Harvard, aided by two Italian
academic collaborators, investigates the success of Italian regional
institutions since reforms introducing decentralisation were implemented in
the early 1970s.
This scholarly volume - proclaimed on the back cover as 'beautifully and
lucidly written' - suffers from some remarkable drawbacks, not least its use
of the most richly ponderous form of American academic argot.
If the author constantly repeats some basic themes, often involving phrases
of exemplary opacity such as 'norms of reciprocity' and 'vertical and
clientistic networks', this may reflect his own doubts about whether readers
are penetrating the maze.
The book draws its authority from extensive field-work over 20 years -
'thousands of interviews with politicians, community leaders and ordinary
citizens'. Curiously, none is quoted by name, although the book is peppered
with long extracts from the work of US political scientists.
Putnam makes occasional delicate reference to 'patron-client relationships',
but ducks the question of corruption as a source of inefficiency in
economics and government.
Yet the book reaches three conclusions of significance, both within and
beyond Italy. First, regions with the most flourishing economies tend to
have the best-run, most responsive and most stable regional governments.
Second, this combination of public-sector effectiveness and positive
economic performance is most evident in regions (particularly in north and
north-central Italy) with the longest traditions of civic engagement. Putnam
traces back to the 12th century evidence for his contention that 'civics
helps to explain economics, rather than the reverse'.
Third, Italian regional reform, far from stabilising the country's
cohesiveness, is undermining it. Regional reform, writes Putnam, 'appears to
be exacerbating, rather than mitigating, the disparities between north and
south'. He treats only sketchily the implications of the recent rise of the
northern 'leagues' campaigning for regional self-determination in areas such
as Lombardy or Veneto. But the reforms, combined with public outrage over
corruption, are creating pressures which could lead to a break-up of the
Italian state.
Putnam's conclusions are both exciting and depressing. Exciting because, if
the key to improving prosperity lies less in encouraging individualism, and
more in promoting civic public-spiritedness, then governments everywhere
might turn to the Italian model as a source of inspiration. Depressing,
because the book postulates a form of fatalism determining which regions
will fare well, and which will do badly.
In the US, this book will support the thesis that the self-help doctrines of
Reaganomics was ultimately detrimental to the nation's economic fate.
'History suggests that both states and markets operate more efficiently in
civic settings,' Putnam writes. This message might have emanated directly
from Hope, Arkansas.
In Europe, Putnam's findings support the new-found emphasis of the European
Community on 'subsidiarity' - bringing government decision- making as close
as possible to the people.
Yet the book also shows that simply increasing financial transfers to less
well-off regions often has little effect in reducing regional imbalances.
At the end of the last century, 'civic' northern Italy was more geared
towards agriculture than the south, and had a smaller percentage of its
workers in manufacturing. But by 1911 the north boasted incomes 50 per cent
higher than the south. By the mid-1980s, for all the funds poured into the
Mezzogiorno, the north-south income gap had widened to 80 per cent.
Between 1970 and 1988, supremely civic Emilia-Romagna jumped from 45th to
17th place in a list of 80 EC regions ranked by gross domestic product per
head. Calabria in the south - the least civic region - stayed in last place.
By providing evidence that Italian regions inherit their institutional
performances from centuries of civic traditions, Putnam has provided a
thesis with disturbing implications, not only for Italy. As one unnamed
regional president in an 'uncivic' region said to him: 'This is a counsel of
despair] You're telling me that nothing I can do will improve our prospects
for success.'
If this is a melancholy thought for Calabria, it is still more dispiriting
for parts of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe burdened by
traditions of autocratic government pre-dating communism.
Conversely, Putnam provides hope for now-liberated countries where efforts
to overcome the legacy of communism are helped by previous centuries of
civic-minded pluralism - for instance, in Bohemia or the Baltic states. A
sign of the longevity of pre-communist political and cultural traditions has
already been seen in the former Yugoslavia, as well as, less disastrously,
in the break-up of Czechoslovakia.
This week, the Italian prime minister has spoken of the risk that his
country could split between north and south. In Italy's current political
confusion, the regions' diverse traditions of civic responsibility, and the
evident failure of a large part of the political elite to live up to them,
are aggravating fissiparous tendencies. It is to be hoped that these
pressures will not force Italy to the brink.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Letter: Crucial point missing about Mexican air traffic
control affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KAVEH MOUSSAVI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Mexican air traffic control deal upheld', (March 3)
misses one crucial point. You report my saying that the Mexican government
has carried out no more than a perfunctory investigation of my allegations
that government officials solicited money from me. This in itself is
perfectly true, but it ignores the government's strenuous efforts to
discredit me, beginning before any investigation could possibly have been
launched into the truth of my allegations. This speaks volumes about
government priorities.
The sum total of the 'investigation' into my report was limited to a
half-page fax. It confined itself to one simple question: did I know the
names of the people who tried to squeeze a bribe out of me?
I do not know their true names, which has led the government to conclude
that the allegations were unfounded. According to the Mexican government,
the fact that a witness to a crime does not know the names of the culprits
means that no crime has taken place. By the same curious logic, it also
proves that the witness is lying and should be threatened with imprisonment.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Letter: Tradition of women health workers still maintained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARGARET A BUTTIGIEG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 1924 it took a 'personal note' from a former Health Visitors
Association president, Gertrude Tuckwell, to TUC general secretary, Fred
Bramley, to persuade the TUC to accept an application for affiliation from
the Women Sanitary Inspectors' and Health Visitors' Association.
Even then women trade unionists were having to battle to take their place
alongside their male colleagues. We won then - and the Health Visitors'
Association is still here now, thanks to merger with our parent union MSF.
Far from 'subsumed' ('Calling time on drinking with the boys', March 16),
the HVA has been protected from extinction by merger. It has allowed us to
keep our professional autonomy. Just as important, it has kept alive a
tradition of nearly 100 years of women health workers organising together
politically and professionally.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Letter: DTI's significant role in promoting overseas trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD NEEDHAM MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read the article about the Australian Trade
Commission ('Trading with purpose', March 4), which asked the question: 'Can
trade promotion organisations really help?' I have no doubt that the help
given to UK companies by the joint Department of Trade and Industry and
Foreign and Commonwealth Office overseas trade services organisation plays a
significant role in improving access to overseas markets and boosting UK
exports.
Our staff overseas spend much of their time helping to bring overseas buyers
and UK sellers together in one way or another. They also spot thousands of
opportunities every year that are passed on to UK companies. We continue to
help UK companies in easy markets (especially smaller firms) as well as
devoting resources to the important high-growth markets in Asia and good
prospects elsewhere.
We are clearly ahead of the Australians in at least one area. We have for
some years now used an independent survey organisation to ask companies that
have used our services for their views. While of course there is room for
improvement, I'm pleased to report that the feed-back we get is very good.
Around 90 per cent praise the helpfulness of our staff, a similar number
will use our service again, and less than 10 per cent overall are
dissatisfied with some aspect. We are devoting much effort to building on
this success by improving our quality of service and putting more resources
into work that will help British business to win in world markets.

SOUNDS AND SILENTS
I am 20 minutes into Hoffa, the David Mamet-scripted bio-epic about the
controversial American union leader who 'vanished' mysteriously in 1975, and
already my mind feels like Jack Nicholson's make-up. Wodges of mental putty
seem to prevent the air getting to my brain-cells. When I move my head, it
is weighed down by the world's stresses. And I seem to be hearing voices
from another epoch: the monotone snap-crackle-platitudes of Warner Brothers
bio-pictures of the 1930s and 1940s.
After JFK and Malcolm X here is another attempt by American film-makers to
process recent history into a Virtual Reality helmet. You put it on and it
feels as snug as the face-puffing prosthesis sported by Mr Nicholson. And
you are right there, insists the film, as the young Hoffa pummels America's
grumbling pre-war truckers into the close-knit Teamsters Union. You feel the
terror of Armand Assante's hot breath and Italian accent as our fund-seeking
hero beds down with the Mafia. You are there with the TV cameras watching
Hoffa row with Attorney General Robert Kennedy, played with cowlick and
stammering nasal twang by Kevin Anderson. And you watch the growing
friendship between Hoffa/Nicholson and co-star Danny DeVito, who directs the
film as well as playing his fictional best friend, Sancho Panza to the
American labour leader's Don Quixote.
Make that Jiminy Cricket to his Pinocchio. For history, if not screenwriter
Mamet, claims that Hoffa, who famously disappeared in 1975 and is now
presumed to be part of the New Jersey Turnpike (courtesy of Cosa Nostra
Building And Interment Services), was not above lying, bribing, conniving
and embezzling. But instead of his nose getting longer, his chutzpah did.
His hatred of the Kennedys exceeded even Malcolm X's. He bullied where he
could not persuade. He put his hand in the till of Organised Crime. Finally,
when America could stand no more, he was shoved in jail. Several years later
he was freed by Nixon - it takes one to pardon one - and after a few years
of impotent railing at the usurpation of his union by ex-comrades he
vanished into legend.
The real Hoffa was last seen at a roadside diner outside Detroit. This
allows Mamet and DeVito to sculpt their best scenes from Hitchcockian
surmise. These open, close and punctuate the movie: Nicholson and DeVito in
a waiting roadster; suspicious chap in diner; final flurry of guns, blood
and Mafia removal van.
The rest of the film, alas, consists of large, congealed chunks of
flashback. As in Chaplin, the use of a retrospective framing device does not
so much 'shape' the story as chill and distance it. Hoffa becomes a
two-and-a-quarter-hour trip through Memory Mausoleum. Doubly removed by the
'frame' of the movie screen and the 'frame' of the I-remember roadside
scenes, the long narrative tableaux become dull with historical
ineluctability and dubious reverence.
Even when Mamet is frank enough to admit that Hoffa could be nasty when
crossed - blowing up a warehouse, sending a set of unidentified severed
genitalia to a newspaper editor - the film never quite escapes its woofly
piety. For one thing, the screenwriter never concedes that if Hoffa sold his
soul it might have been (as many believe) to line his own pockets as much as
his union's. For another the violence, verbal and actual, is delivered by
Jack Nicholson, a man who exudes charisma even while standing still with a
latex-paralysed face reciting make-my-day threats.
The film is a soapbox masquerading as a cinema experience. Worst of all are
the would-be epic scenes of They-versus-Us confrontation in streets or
factory yards. Here, just as the soundtrack's initial splats and crunches
are slowly drowned by uplifting music, the particular brutalities of mob
violence are engulfed by the inspirational-generic. Note the way the camera
cranes celestially upward to turn a fracas into a heroic fresco.
So the cinema of holy revisionism marches on, building its gallery of saints
and martyrs. No doubt the next blockbusting bio-pic will be about that warm
reformer, union organiser and family man Al Capone. He did after all create
wealth, establish a fraternity of hardworking entrepreneurs and help supply
a needy nation with previously inaccessible beverages. Jack Nicholson and
David Mamet, strap on your hagiographic harnesses again . . .
*****
If you look in a mirror five times and say 'Candyman', claims the film of
that title, a tall man with a hook for a hand will materialise and
disembowel you. I have just tried this in my bathroom, urged on by
intellectual curiosity, and it failed to work. Should one ask for one's
money back?
One should perhaps ask for it back anyway. Clive Barker wrote the original
story, The Forbidden, from which writer-director Bernard Rose (Paperhouse,
Chicago Joe And The Showgirl) has fashioned this screamer that fails to
scream. First reason: the film runs out of plot after half an hour, by which
time we know all we will know - certainly all we will want to know - about
the ghostly gentleman with the limited repertoire of sadism and the
background as a murder victim who fell foul of a lynch-mob back in 1890. Not
to mention the Ph. D-writing heroine (Virginia Madsen) and her limited range
of spooked expressions.
Reason two: no one has any reason for doing the things they do. Why did the
murderers of the original Candyman, a black artist who made a white girl
pregnant, use such an odd combination of brutalities? (Hand-lopping followed
by honey-bees). Why does Candyman return to terrorise a Chicago slum
tenement? Why does Miss Madsen want to write a life-endangering Ph. D? Why
do girl and ghoul end up tussling with each other inside a giant bonfire?
(Answer to this one: the Guy Fawkes climax to the English story has been
transferred to America and lost all meaning.)
A shame after the creepy first half-hour. Here the director tries out his
celestial camera angles, turning Chicago into a bird's-eye maze, and the
dialogue's Gothic nihilism still has novelty value ('What's blood for if not
for spilling?') But as with many horror films, once the explanations and
elaborations begin, fear jumps up, asks for its hat and vanishes to another
hunting-ground.
*****
I find I wrote two short notes on the back of my press hand-out for Alison
MacLean's Crush: 'Rilke' and 'Bubbling mud-pools behind credits'. Weird
scenery and poetic attitudinising are the chief characteristics of this New
Zealand psychodrama. It begins with a bang - a car crash, leaving one
healthy survivor (Marcia Gay Harden) and one soon-to-be-embittered cripple
(Donogh Rees) - and then spirals into a tale of jealousy, revenge,
Rilke-quoting and the go-between antics of a young girl (Caitlin Bossley)
who engineers the final death duel in lovely, scenic Rotorua.
Debut features from undernourished movie cultures are always welcome. But
this one resembles an Antonioni movie hit over the head with a rolled-up New
Zealand travel poster. Nothing convinces us, therefore nothing moves us. And
the three main characters are skeletally drawn and schematically scripted.
When one of them plunged to her death down a waterfall-ribboned chasm, I
found myself admiring the palm trees and wondering about the cost of return
flights to Auckland.
The week's best film experience may not be in a cinema at all. Sounds And
Silents is a three-day event celebrating the art of film composing from
early music by Satie and Saint-Saens to an exciting new score by Jonathan
Lloyd for Hitchcock's reissued silent classic Blackmail. Queen Elizabeth
Hall, starting tonight with Blackmail; get busy if you want tickets.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Arts: Flawed 'Chatsky' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a particular excitement in encountering a little-known classic; and
there is an extra buzz when it has been re-translated by Anthony Burgess.
Though the playwright, Alexander Griboyedov (1795-1829), is hardly a
household name, Gore ot Uma (or Woe for Wit) is his best-known play; Burgess
has re-named it after its protagonist, Chatsky, and has given it a Wildean
subtitle: The Importance of Being Stupid. Everything about it is
interesting, and I am glad to have made its acquaintance. But I find its
performance flawed and was often irritated by the intrusive cleverness of
Burgess's translation.
Chatsky, returning from years of travel and surveying petty Russian society,
has much about him of Pushkin's Eugene Onegin - Byronic glamour, polish,
disdain. He is a doomed Romantic in his liberal ideals, his devotion to
literature, and his love for Sophie. Doomed, because petty Russian society
cannot be doing with such loftiness, and because Sophie has committed
herself in his absence to the perfidious Molchalin (an ambitious creep who,
behind her back, pursues her maid Liza). Funnily, then bitterly, the play
depicts the brand of philistinism, known in Russian as poshlust (triviality,
vulgarity), that would later be pilloried by authors from Gogol to Nabokov.
What the textbooks praise as 'the naturalism and pithiness of Griboyedov's
dialogue' is sometimes present in Burgess's version - as when Chatsky,
reproaching Sophie, says: 'But the past doesn't die. Alive in me, I thought
it was alive in you.' Or when a minor character bleakly remarks to nobody in
particular: 'I'm getting bored with this same old pantomime, acting the
happy husband.'
But when Chatsky talks of someone's 'debilitous intellection' and says 'His
brain is just an etiolated grub in an inedible apple,' though we chortle, he
becomes as remote from us as from everyone else onstage. And then there is
Burgess's clever-clogs use of rhyming pentameters. When a word like
'fractions' suddenly looms out for no good reason, you know you have to wait
until, at the end of the next line, you get clobbered by 'actions'. Sophie
says '-ish' (very 20th-century Brit) so that 'dish' can come chiming in.
Behind this kind of flashy parlance, Chatsky and 19th-century Russia grow
dim.
Colin Firth, dressed as if he had stepped straight out of Gericault, is a
pale, sardonic, unaffected Chatsky, and he circumnavigates the rhymes to
marvellously natural effect. All he lacks is the heroic blaze of Romantic
isolation. When he describes Sophie as having 'no sense of humour', I did
not recognise Jemma Redgrave. Her Sophie, played with numerous tiny actorly
effects of the eyes and voice, is awfully reasonable. She has no cruelty, no
perfidy. Just a nice girl in a tricky situation, she is so fake-earnest that
even her beauty becomes dull.
As her father Famusov, the play's most blatant philistine and hypocrite,
Dinsdale Landen gives a performance exactly in tune with Burgess's
translation: robust, rosy, ranting, roaring, rasping. He rattles off three
sentences in a single breath, then draws out a single syllable to
extortionate lengths. His eyes gleam, he is all provincial force and energy.
Here is busy Character Acting with a vengeance. (A pity so many of his
consonants are muzzy.) Jane Freeman, Rosalind Knight, and Murray Melvin give
less obtrusive performances that do more to bring this petty, snobbish world
to life.
In short, several different acting styles are at work here, and the
director, Jonathan Kent, has not fused them into a single convincing stage
world. Tim Hatley's several sets, claustrophobic and surreal, exaggerate the
bizarrerie of Griboyedov's satire. This production has turned Woe for Wit
into Chatsky without making it live as a play.
At the Almeida Theatre until April 24; then on a six week National Tour.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Arts: Sherlock Holmes - The Musical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1887, Dr Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) wrote the first of 56 'Sherlock
Holmes' stories. This provided motive and opportunity for Ellie Norwood,
Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett to play the tweedy sleuth. Now, Holmes has
become a singing detective in Leslie Bricusse's Sherlock Holmes: The Musical
at the Bristol Old Vic.
The scene opens at the Reichenbach Falls. Holmes surfaces again near
Victoria. But with Moriarty dead, Holmes is bored to distraction in
retirement. However, the King Charles spaniel thefts from the Duchesses
Monmouth, Richmond, Argyl and Tyneside signal Moriarty's survival. But this
Moriarty is 1890s New Woman Ms Bella Moriarty, with whom Holmes promptly
falls in love. His hormones corrode his judgment, and he finds himself
framed for murder. The barge-footed Lestrade of the Yard arrests him, and
even the woolly Dr Watson threatens to doubt.
Bricusse has done much better work than this, most recently songs for the
films Home Alone and Hook. Holmes lacks sophistication. The key is the
absence of the dog that did not bark (in 'Silver Blaze'); the musical misses
the complexities of Doyle's forensic style, and never hits on a musical
style to convey the dry wit of Doyle's stories.
The dialogue keeps up some acquaintance with traditional Sherlockiana, as in
'This is a three-pipe problem' and 'the little things are infinitely the
most important.' But the setting needs to change. Around Baker Street, a
jolly cockney chorus is trapped in a Mary Poppins chimberley-sweep vision of
London: 'It's a bleedin' garden of Eden' they sing, before the rhyming slang
number, 'Apples 'n' Pears'.
The songs are never complex enough, content to describe rather than move the
action forward. Stephen Sondheim's 19th-century crime musical, Sweeney Todd,
fills the songs themselves with suspense: 'The demon barber of Fleet . . .
pause . . . Street.'
But here, as the show eases into its songs, lulling strings and a high
wistful oboe signal an emotional number, while a jolly plucked bass and wire
brushes mean a singalong character tune. The music itself fails to surprise.
However, the show does have some spikey, atmospheric recitative signalling
Moriarty's return, and a fine complaint from the Landlady at 221B, Mrs
Hudson, with - for 1893 London - the anachronistic 'A Lousy Life'.
Other highlights are 'Men Like You' sung by Bella at Holmes, and a
reminiscence number called 'Halcyon Days' sung by Dr Watson and his old pal
Boffy in the police morgue.
Robert Powell as an imperious Holmes strikes a superior tone with Roy
Barraclough's excellent Watson, all slow wits and campaign memories.
Alongside them, Louise English as Bella Moriarty and Sarah Hay as Mrs Hudson
add scope and depth. The ensemble scenes are sharply choreographed by Tudor
Davies, and Bob Tomson's direction keeps the action flowing through Mick
Bearwish's versatile London set.
Bristol Old Vic until April 10

Channel 4 currently has a splendid Thursday night schedule. Tim Hunkin
(whose naturalness and lack of eccentricities contrasts so pleasantly with
the Loyd Grossman school of presenters) demonstrates the workings of
machinery in The Secret Life Of ..turning today to the photocopier (8.30).
When that ends at 9.00 the estimable Mary Goldring offers us The Goldring
Audit. Her subject today is British Telecom, and she finds that, nine years
after privatisation, Britain's largest company remains uncom petitive,
overmanned and bureaucratic. Then, at 10.00, comes Drop The Dead Donkey the
very funny series set in a television newsroom. What with this, One Foot In
The Grave, The Golden Girls, Red Dwarf and Waiting For God we seem to be
going through a period of classic comedy. Steve Humphries' series about
child rearing in the first half of this century, A Labour Of Love is proving
what a fascinating combination archive film and live reminiscence makes
(9.30 BBC2). In Disguises (9.30 ITV) reporters go undercover with fox
hunters and hunt saboteurs to report from both sides of the divide.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Arts: Towards the Millennium - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like all the best concepts 'Towards the Millennium' is proving to be simple
in principle, endlessly fascinating in its working out. As this rolling
festival sweeps through the 20th century, sampling a decade at a time, it
cuts across the intertwining lines of development that make up the texture
of music history. If anything was designed to belie the outmoded view of
musical evolution as a strictly linear process, in which X leads to Y and
then on to Z, it is this strictly chronological perspective, which throws up
all kinds of historical juxtapositions and short circuits.
Monday's programme at the Royal Festival Hall, conducted by Simon Rattle
with the London Sinfonietta and its Voices and Chorus, brought together a
clutch of folk-tinged works from the 1920s - Bartok's Village Scenes,
Janacek's Rikadla, Villa-Lobos' third Choros, Vaughan Williams's Flos Campi,
Stravinsky's Les Noces. Far from proving that in the Twenties the forces of
modernism suddenly dived for the comforting cover of the folk tradition the
concert showed how different strands of music could moved together almost
arbitrarily, only to diverge again almost immediately.
As a showcase of styles and of vocal and instrumental virtuosity it was a
great success too, carefully graded to begin with the faithful replications
of the Bartok, played and sung with wonderful pungency by the Sinfonietta
forces, and to move neatly into the Janacek nursery rhymes, even though
their discontinuity was not aided by Rattle's decision to respect the
composer's wishes and to read the texts of each rhyme before it was
delivered. The Vaughan Williams appeared as the culmination of this
progressive distancing of musical invention from source material. The folksy
background to Flos Campi comes to seem increasingly remote and almost
spurious, though the rapturous eloquence of Paul Silverthorne's solo viola
and the sheer sensuousness of many of the textures was never in doubt.
After that Les Noces was honestly bracing, fresh and startlingly original.
Almost any work of the 1920s (Wozzeck excepted) would be hard to set against
Stravinsky's masterpiece; in this context its ability to make the folk
material uniquely its own seemed quite extraordinary. Rattle concentrated
throughout on precision and textural clarity; a little more freedom, more
hedonism, was needed to make the performance comprehensively definitive.

This is just one scenario envisaged by NEC for its voice recognition system
which will be marketed in Japan this year. The machine can be programmed to
recognise 1,000 words which are relevant to each particular application.
The machine uses a technique developed at NEC's media research laboratory in
Kawasaki, called demi-syllable speech recognition. Each syllable is
dissected and analysed. NEC: Japan, 03 3798 6520.

Companies which shift large amounts of voice, data and video traffic between
offices are now offered a more efficient way of sending the information -
ATM (asynchronous transfer mode).
Whereas in the past large amounts of data had to be sent in parcels of
pre-determined size, ATM enables data to be sent in the most effective way.
So, video-conferencing could be allocated a pre-determined chunk of capacity
on the line for the period the service was needed and then the other voice
and data calls slotted in as needed.
Netcomm, of Basildon, has launched its DV2 ATM switch to allocate capacity
on these large networks. The device will be sold in the US by Netcomm's
partner, General Datacomm. Netcomm: UK, 0268 534228.
PictureTel, of Boston, Massachusetts, has launched a low-cost, colour,
video- conferencing terminal which can be wheeled from office to office and
plugged in at any socket which offers ISDN business phone services. The
units cost Pounds 15,600 each, and more sophisticated functions can be added
at extra cost. PictureTel: US, 508 762 5000; UK, 0753 673000.

Stealing personal computers is a growth business. In 1992 an estimated
Pounds 60m-worth of PCs were stolen in Britain, not to mention the portable
machines that were left on buses and aircraft.
To help ensure that machines which are recovered are returned to their
rightful owners, Firstlok, of Steyning, West Sussex, has devised a software
package that gives each PC a unique serial number which is registered on a
central database.
The software is loaded into each Dos-based PC from a floppy disc. Every time
the machine is subsequently switched on the serial number is displayed,
together with the Firstlok database phone number where details of the owner
can be found. The software also incorporates a password access control
device. Firstlok: UK, 0903 879568.

FT  18 MAR 93 / People: Birkdale's triumvirate shrinks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In May 1992 the UK advertising world was set abuzz by news that Richard
Humphreys was joining the Birkdale Group, a tiny collection of advertising,
PR and other marketing agencies with a Pounds 3m market capitalisation.
Humphreys had just left Saatchi and Saatchi Worldwide where he was president
and chief executive; the contrast spoke for itself.
Now it seems that Humphreys is feeling the constraints of Birkdale, for it
has announced that he is stepping down as chief executive. Humphreys will
stay as an executive director but is also joining 'a consortium of investors
which plans to acquire a substantial holding in a US-based international
advertising group', an ambitious-sounding project not too dissimilar from
the type of thing he gave as his reasons for joining Birkdale in the first
place.
At the same time, Simeon Galpert, one-time treasurer with WPP, is leaving
his post as Birkdale's finance director to 'pursue other interests'.
Of the triumvirate who hoped to make a substantial acquisition and put
Birkdale back on the map, only Neil McClure is staying - as chief executive
once more.
McClure is putting a brave face on the proceedings; but it is hardly
reassuring for shareholders to see the departure of two of the would-be
architects of the group's planned resurgence.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Technology: Ups and downs of hypertension - High blood
pressure treatments are working so well that scientists are looking beyond
traditional cures, writes Clive Cookson in a series on drug discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drugs to bring down high blood pressure are one of the great successes of
pharmaceutical research.
Over the past decade the industry has given doctors dozens of new drugs to
treat hypertension - the medical name for the condition - by several
different mechanisms. Their sales are worth more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds
7bn) a year, three times as much as the total market for cancer drugs.
'The treatment of hypertension is very good now and the side effects are
minor,' says Desmond Julian, medical director of the British Heart
Foundation, 'and because there is a range of drugs, you can normally find
one to suit any particular patient.'
In industrialised countries, 15 to 20 per cent of the adult population has
high blood pressure. Julian says patients with mild or moderate hypertension
should not be put on drugs straightaway; their doctors should urge them to
make changes in diet and lifestyle.
But for the 5 per cent of people with severe hypertension, drugs are usually
required to bring blood pressure down to a safe level.
Clinical trials have shown that the greatest benefit of hypertension
treatment is a 40 per cent reduction in the risk of suffering a stroke,
which is caused by the rupture of blood vessels in the brain. The effects on
other forms of cardiovascular disease are less clear-cut; indeed there is
still no statistical proof that lowering blood pressure cuts the risk of a
fatal heart attack.
The four main categories of anti-hypertensive drug, in order of increasing
novelty and price, are:
Diuretics, which reduce the volume of blood by increasing the flow of urine
from the body. A secondary effect is to open up small arteries by removing
sodium. Most diuretics are cheap off-patent drugs.
Beta-blockers, which slow down the heart beat, particularly during exercise
and emotional stress. ICI's Tenormin, the first blockbuster
anti-hypertensive, recently lost its patent protection.
Calcium channel blockers, which relax the blood vessels by blocking the flow
of calcium ions into the surrounding muscles. Patents are also expiring on
the first group of calcium blockers introduced in the mid 1970s such as
Bayer's Adalat.
ACE inhibitors, which block angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). This
prevents the formation of angiotensin II, a potent constrictor of blood
vessels. The pioneering ACE inhibitor, Bristol-Myers Squibb's Capoten
launched in 1981, has recently been overtaken by Merck's Vasotec, now the
world's best-selling heart drug.
Faced with such a wide selection of drugs, how does a doctor find the best
one for each patient? According to Julian: 'for the majority of people it's
a matter of trial and error. It's quite arbitrary which drug you start out
with'.
The treatment of hypertension varies considerably from country to country.
In the cost-conscious UK, normal practice is to start the patient on a cheap
diuretic or beta-blocker and, if the response is unsatisfactory, move to a
more expensive drug. In the US, a doctor is more likely to prescribe a
calcium blocker or ACE inhibitor as first-line therapy.
In an attempt to gather more information about the long-term effect of
different therapies, two large-scale clinical comparisons are planned: one
in Europe to be organised by Peter Sever of St Mary's Hospital, London, on
behalf of the British Hypertension Society; and one in the US, sponsored by
the National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute.
Each trial will cost at least Pounds 35m and will involve 30,000 people with
high blood pressure who will be treated for five years with either a
diuretic, an ACE inhibitor or a calcium channel blocker. The results should
show ifthe premium prices charged for the new drugs are justified by
superior performance, not only in lowering blood pressure but in reducing
deaths from heart attacks and other cardiovascular disease.
The trials may confound expectations and show that diuretics give as many
benefits as ACE inhibitors and calcium blockers, in the same way as the
recent Isis-3 mega-comparison of heart attack treatments undermined sales of
the expensive new clot-busters tPA and Eminase by showing that cheap old
streptokinase was just as effective.
Until comparative clinical data become available, sales of competing
hypertension drugs will depend, above all, on the marketing skills of their
manufacturers. There is fierce competition not only between the different
classes of medicine but also within each class.
Indeed, the ACE inhibitor sector is the best example today of 'me too'
development in the pharmaceutical industry. Tom McKillop, technical director
of Zeneca Pharmaceuticals (soon to be spun off from ICI), says ACE
inhibitors are a very unusual sector of the drugs market because there is
strong competition between several patented products. This is exerting a
downward pressure on prices, similar to that introduced by generic
(off-patent) drugs in more mature sectors.
'The ultimate anti-hypertensive has not yet been found,' says Claes
Wilhelmsson, research director of Astra, Sweden's largest pharmaceutical
company. 'But we have stopped all our research on traditional hypertension
drugs.'
There are so many products on the market that bring down blood pressure
safely and effectively that no company is trying to produce new ones, says
Jurgen Reden, research director of Germany's Hoechst. 'We are looking now
for drugs that do something more than reducing blood pressure - for example
producing a protective effect on the cardiac muscle and avoiding chronic
cardiovascular disease.'
ACE inhibitors show some beneficial side-effects, beyond controlling
hypertension. They seem to have some protective effect on kidney function
and to improve the general condition of blood vessels.
Companies with cardiovascular research programmes are therefore exploring
ways to intervene elsewhere in the metabolic pathways that control blood
pressure and heart function, such as the renin-angiotensin system and the
kallikrein-kinin system. For example, Jurgen Drews, research director of
Switzerland's Roche, says his company is investigating a new class of renin
inhibitors which would act at the very beginning of the process that leads
to high blood pressure.
The overall aim of such research, according to Reden, is 'all-round
protection of the heart, by keeping the blood vessel walls clean and in good
condition'.
High blood pressure results from the interplay of multiple genetic and
environmental factors. A research finding of great long-term significance
was announced last October; an academic team from France and the US, headed
by Jean-Marc Lalouel of the University of Utah, identified the first human
gene linked to hypertension.
Variations in the angiotensinogen gene were found to be related to
hypertension in families in Paris and Salt Lake City. It is believed to
affect blood pressure by controlling the retention of salt in the body.
Scientists say at least four other genes - and perhaps as many as 20 - are
likely to be involved in hypertension. As more are identified, it should be
possible to develop genetic tests to identify people at risk - and perhaps
eventually to think of correcting the genetic defects through gene therapy.
However, as Sever points out, high blood pressure is undoubtedly a disease
of western civilisation. 'Although the genetic link is an extremely
important and interesting finding, remember that the environment you live in
also controls your blood pressure,' he says. 'No one living in the African
desert ever suffers from hypertension.'
The series continues next month with a look at treatments for hay fever and
other allergies.

FT  18 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors - Yorkshire Food
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Food Group, the Bradford-based food processor which was
successfully floated this month, has enhanced its already strong Yorkshire
identity by appointing as a non-executive director Sir Marcus Fox, the
Conservative MP for Shipley who chairs the backbench 1922 committee.
Mike Firth, 46, the com-pany's forceful chairman, says he was eight years
old when he heard the future Tory MP being praised by his father, who worked
with him on Dewsbury council. He says of Sir Marcus: 'He's a great
Yorkshireman, who is obviously well connected as chairman of the 1922.
That's obviously useful, as food can be a bit of a political football.'
But the chairman says the main reason for appointing the blunt-speaking Sir
Marcus was to help to guide the board, which has ambitious expansion plans:
'If you want putting in line, you want people who can do it.'
Yorkshire Food expanded through buying from Berisford International
businesses which process dried fruit and nuts. Its shares started trading at
110p on March 9, valuing the group at Pounds 37.5m, and have since risen to
132p.
Sir Marcus, 65, last month became a non-executive director of Illingworth
Morris, the wool and fibre processors.

FT  18 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors - Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Beckett, the boardroom troubleshooter whose charges have included
Tace and Ultramar, has been appointed as a non-executive director at
Amstrad.
However Beckett, who once described himself as a 'very independent'
non-executive director, insists that his role at Amstrad will not be one of
company doctor.
'I happen to think Amstrad is one of the great success stories in Britain,'
he says. 'I am very much taken with Alan Sugar's attitude to the future; I
think the company can do great things.'
Beckett is Amstrad's second non-executive appointment. Last month the
consumer electronics company appointed Jeoff Samson, a former senior GEC
executive, following Alan Sugar's promise during his unsuccessful share
buy-back attempt in December to appoint two non-executive directors to the
board.
Yesterday Amstrad said the board has decided to pass responsibility for the
selection of a possible third non-executive to Beckett and Samson.
Beckett, aged 56, is an ex-managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields. He
was a non-executive at RHM until last year and is deputy chairman at Watts,
Blake, Bearne, and chairman designate at Horace Clarkson.

FT  18 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors - WH Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Orr (above left), former head of investment banking at Merrill Lynch
Europe, and Martin Taylor (right), chief executive and chairman-designate of
Courtaulds Textiles, have joined the board of WH Smith, bringing the number
of non-executive directors to eight. Stanley Honeyman, a chartered surveyor,
retired last October.
Taylor, 40, who has forged a reputation as one of the better managers of his
generation, says the attraction for him is 'to get closer to the way a
retailer thinks'. A former journalist with the Financial Times, he says that
at the moment he knows 'about as much (about the sector) as the FT retailing
correspondent'.
He adds that WH Smith presents an unusual opportunity in so far as there is
'no possible conflict of interest'. Courtaulds would be suppliers to or in
direct competition with the bulk of major retailing companies.
Orr, 55, was a senior director of SG Warburg before becoming finance
director of Grand Metropolitan in 1981. In 1987, he left for Merrill Lynch,
where he stayed for three years. He is now collecting an assortment of
non-executive positions - he is chairman of Molins and on the board of
Granada, Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed and Sketchley.
WH Smith was last week relegated from the FT-SE 100 index, its share price
hit by heavy losses at its DIY joint venture Do-It-All as well as by
concerns, unfounded in the event, that the budget would contain an
announcement about VAT being extended to published matter.

FT  18 MAR 93 / People: Brian Walsh moves from GKN to TI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TI Group chairman Sir Christopher Lewinton has put the finishing touches to
his new generation of managers with the hiring of Brian Walsh, GKN's finance
director, to replace TI's own Michael Garner, who has been in the job for 14
years and wants a change. Garner, 55, already a member of the Accounting
Standards Board, will play a larger role within that organisation.
'Michael pointed out to me that he had served seven years in two
administrations and that he wanted to make a change, but within TI if
possible. This gave me the opportunity to bring in a younger man, fitting in
with the heads of the three operating divisions, who are all in their late
40s or early 50s,' Lewinton said yesterday. The most recent recruit was Tony
Edwards, formerly of Lucas, to head the Dowty division at TI.
As well as being the right age, TI also believes he understands the
marketing business - very important to the Lewinton culture - having worked
at two consumer goods companies. At Singer he was vice-president and
director of finance and business planning between 1980 and 1982 and he then
moved to General Foods, initially as assistant corporate controller and
treasurer, and subsequently as finance director of the US grocery business.
These five years in the US were also important in his selection, says
Lewinton, who explains that 40 per cent of TI's business is in America.
City analysts, meanwhile, give Walsh high marks for his near six year spell
at GKN, where he identified earlier than some of his peers the onset of
recession and initiated tough cost-cutting measures.
Meanwhile, TI is looking forward to Garner, who remains an executive
director, involving himself in a range of accounting issues of direct
relevance to TI such as ACT, and the introduction of FRS3. 'One of the
problems of this country is that everyone stands in their separate corners -
industry, government, the treasury,' complains Lewinton. Under his
stewardship, Mark Radcliffe was seconded from TI to set up the National
Manufacturing Council at the CBI.
ASB chairman David Tweedie adds that with only two full-time members out of
the nine board representatives, his operation is under-resourced  - in
contrast, for instance, to the American counterpart FASB which has seven
full-time members. He sees Garner developing the contacts with industry for
which he himself has insufficient time.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Marketing (Management and Advertising): The direct seller's
party piece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to sell sex toys or Tupperware tubs in a recession, how do you
go about it? Throw a party, according to a growing number of small clothing
and hardware firms.
In recent years party plan selling - as the original Tupperware sales format
is known - has been expanding along with other forms of home-based
marketing.
Turnover in the direct-selling sector now amounts to more than Pounds 769m,
and is growing at 10 per cent a year, according to a recent report by the
Direct Selling Association. Some of the most successful firms are notching
up annual growth rates of more than 50 per cent.
The Ann Summers group, for example, which first made its name with sex
shops, has seen its sales of lingerie and marital 'novelties' almost double
in the last two years to Pounds 43m, primarily through party-plan selling.
The more mundane household item Betterware group - which, after the
cosmetics giant Avon, is now the second-largest direct-selling company in
the UK - has recorded a rise in its turnover from Pounds 2m to Pounds 65m.
Direct sellers themselves attribute this growth to their aggressive
marketing techniques - at a time of low consumer confidence personal contact
and word-of-mouth recommendation is, they say, more effective than
advertising.
'If people are told that times are bad, that they shouldn't spend money,
then they don't like going shopping. But the demand is definitely still
there if you take it to them,' claims Deon Melck, managing director of
Tupperware UK, the original pioneers of the suburban hard sell.
But another factor seems to be the attraction of part-time sales work at a
time of high unemployment. In spite of the changes in female employment that
have occured since Tupperware parties were first launched in the 1950s, the
majority of the 45,000 direct selling agents in the UK are still women.
Ninety three per cent of these are part time, and increasingly they schedule
the sales work for the evenings.
'It's a good job,' says 'Phil' a London-based saleswomen for Ann Summers,
who had previously organised Tupperware parties. Her commission from the
sales - 79 per cent of direct selling companies work on a commission basis -
is around Pounds 1,000 a month.
'In a recession people might not want to go out and buy a vacuum cleaner -
but they do want to have fun,' she adds.
In the case of Ann Summers this fun factor pays dividends. To break down
inhibitions, each sales party starts with games, continues with
demonstrations and then finishes with women placing their orders in
carefully sealed, anonymous envelopes.
At a typical Thursday evening party in Orpington, Kent, most of the 15
female guests arrived claiming that they were only there 'for a laugh' - but
then left after spending a total of Pounds 235.
Although most direct sellers recognise that their sales forces may contract
if jobs growth in the economy resumes, they insist that their turnover will
continue to rise in a recovery.
Nevertheless, as James May, director of the British Retailers Consortium,
points out, the sector still remains tiny compared with the retail market,
accounting for less than  1/2 per cent of total consumer sales.
According to the Direct Selling Association, however, retailers have
recently shown increased interest in direct selling. But attempts to fuse
the two sectors face a fundamental problem - sales staff may be less
motivated to market their goods if they can be easily purchased from a
nearby corner shop.
In an effort to prevent retailers from 'poaching' their ideas,
direct-selling companies are now attempting to step up product innovation.
Tupperware, for example, recently launched a new range of childcare
products. But as direct-sales companies themselves acknowledge, ultimately
their main weapon remains their low overheads, flexible sales force and,
above all, the personal customer contact.
'It works because we pay attention to the customer,' says Richard Berry,
director of the Direct Selling Association. 'In that respect maybe the
retailers could learn from us.'

FT  18 MAR 93 / Marketing (Management and Advertising): Blending genius and
magic - Guinness believes brand development is the key to its future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Guinness lost its genius? The question has been asked ever since
recession ended the company's meteoric growth record in the late 1980s. It
will be highlighted again today, when Guinness is expected to report a sharp
fall in last year's profits.
The doubts turn on more than the weak international economy and soggy
consumer spending. The fundamental issue is how much more mileage the
company can extract from the marketing magic which has helped it generate
profits by persuading Scotch drinkers around the world to keep trading up to
ever more expensive brands.
The blunt response from Tony Greener, Guinness's chairman, is that the world
ain't seen nothing yet: 'If somebody says: 'I thought Guinness's marketing
was pretty good,' I say yes, it is a hell of a lot better than five years
ago. But it is absolutely nothing as good as we aspire to in the future.'
Indeed, he says, the task of turning the company into a thoroughbred
marketing organisation has barely begun. Until recently, the overriding
priorities were to reorganise the spirits division, following the
acquisition of the Distillers Company in 1986 and to gain control of
international distribution.
Attention started to focus less than three years ago on brand development,
which Greener regards as the key to Guinness's long-term future. Since then,
more than 50 senior marketing executives have been hired from heavyweight
consumer products companies including Procter &amp; Gamble, Mars and Unilever.
The challenge now, Greener says, is to unite the company around a basic core
of shared beliefs, rooted in a clear appreciation of the distinctive skills
which the drinks business requires.
'If you look at P&amp;G or similar companies, one of their great strengths is a
system, a way of doing things which has proven successful over a long
period. We are starting - underlined - to get together a group of people who
are beginning to understand what it takes.'
Injecting so much new blood all at once is, he admits, a mixed blessing.
'While bringing all these guys in has been necessary and marvellous as a
stimulus, at some stage the process has to slow down a bit. You've got to
consolidate and say, that's great, but around here this is what works. So
forget your fancy ideas for marketing soap flakes, chocolate biscuits,
fragrances, or whatever.'
So what does work for Guinness? The starting point, says Greener, is that
all Scotch tastes much the same.
'We have massive amounts of research which show that people can't tell the
difference between one Scotch and another. Though they swear total
allegiance to one product and would never dream of drinking Brand X, in
blind tastings Brand X is more often than not what they select.'
The only real point of differentiation is image. In the spirits business,
says Greener, it is cultivated only incidentally through advertising. The
really vital brand-building is done in the 'on-trade' - the clubs, bars,
cafes and pubs where what people drink is often a signal about who they
think they are. 'Unless you've got that on-trade franchise, it's difficult
to build anything else.'
The second rule is to keep telling the same story. 'You're talking about the
presentation of a product, the outlets where you'll find it, pricing,
advertising, promotions - every single point of communication between an
individual and that brand. The whole marketing mix has to come together to
hit the target in a particular way.'
The central challenge Greener has set for Guinness is to develop a coherent,
company-wide, set of brand values and identities which is also flexible
enough to be adapted to local conditions in each of the 180 countries in
which its spirits are sold.
'If you think of the number of contact points and the number of times the
message has to be relayed to individuals around the world, it is an enormous
process - the time, the money involved and, above all, the consistency of
the message. There is no quick fix, no magic wand I can wave. The key words
really are consistency of message over a very long period of time.'

FT  18 MAR 93 / Marketing (Management and Advertising): A very spirited
affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky is Guinness's most valuable brand asset. It
accounts for an estimated third of the group's overall spirits profits and
sells more than the combined volume of its two closest rivals, Chivas Regal
and Remy Martin cognac, in the international duty-free market.
Johnnie Walker's recent development not only exemplifies the Guinness
group's shrewd marketing approach; it demonstrates how a good consumer brand
can be revived and then extended with a range of complementary products.
When Guinness's spirits subsidiary United Distillers acquired the brands in
the 1986 takeover of DCL, the old Distillers' company, they were showing
signs of neglect. DCL's marketing focus had become blurred in a drive for
volume sales. Many of its whisky brands competed against each other.
Positioning was confused. Red Label, the world's best-selling Scotch, was
supported in Europe by seven different advertising campaigns, each
delivering a different message.
Guinness restored order. Key brands were repackaged and repositioned to
cover different sectors of each geographical market. New advertising
campaigns presented a consistent image of high quality and matching
lifestyles. Prices reflected the up-market move.
The distilling company Johnnie Walker is named after the Kilmarnock
shopkeeper who founded the distillery in 1820. Johnnie Walker Red Label and
Black Label, a deluxe blend of whiskies up to 12-years-old, were launched in
1909. In 1932, the brand was extended with the launch of Swing, a blend
containing 17-year-old malts.
Guinness's brand building has been based round Red Label, which was
positioned as the leading international premium brand and given a
significant slice of the advertising budget. It is now among the three
leading brands in 16 of the world's top 20 markets. Priced at about Pounds
10 a bottle, it has sales of 6.5m cases a year.
Black Label, with annual sales of 3m cases, provides the first step for
aspirational consumers. It is also rewarding for Guinness. Selling one
bottle of Black Label instead of two bottles of Red Label gives the company
24 per cent more profit. In some growth markets, such as Thailand, Black
Label is the dominant member of the Johnnie Walker family.
Swing has found niches in the US, Asia/Pacific, Africa and South America.
During the past six years, Guinness has used the Johnnie Walker brand to
fill more high-priced and profitable gaps in international markets.
In 1987, it launched Johnnie Walker Oldest, since renamed Blue Label, in the
duty-free market. It is now available through a few UK outlets at about
Pounds 120 a bottle.
Gold Label, a 15-year-old blend priced at about Pounds 60, was produced
exclusively for the Japanese market in early 1990. It was followed the same
year by Johnnie Walker Premier, blended with 25-year-old malts. In Taiwan,
it sells for Pounds 400 a bottle. Last year, top-of-the-range Johnnie Walker
Honour, a blend of 40-year-old malts, was introduced in Taiwan at Pounds 525
a bottle.
Guinness is now test marketing a whisky-based liqueur under the Johnnie
Walker brand name in the US.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Accountancy Column: Clues in the Birt case point to wider
auditing issues - Andrew Jack says the row over the BBC chief's tax affairs
raises policy questions that demand attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS BRITISH politicians and commentators have pondered the level of violence
on television in the last few weeks, the British Broadcasting Corporation
has been obliging by providing more blood-letting off-screen than on.
The furore surrounding the tax affairs of Mr John Birt, its director
general, may in part have been fuelled by jealousy from rivals and other
journalists. But it has highlighted some policy questions that demand
attention. Tax is not paramount among them. The degree to which the
information in accounts is scrutinised most certainly is.
Accountancy firms and the Inland Revenue alike have been inundated with
probes from hacks on the story that will not die. Some of those fielding the
inquiries have remarked that the questions smack as much of personal
curiosity as they do of indignant inquisition. They ask 'How could I, er,
someone arrange their affairs in this way?' almost as frequently as 'How did
you slip up? What can be done about this scandal?'
Some journalists, at least, should already know. In common with others in
the entertainment industry, some journalists have long used companies as a
method of tax planning, and for perfectly legitimate reasons.
They may work part time for different organisations, or move between a
succession of them on short-term contracts. They may have left old company
structures in place even after they ceased to make much sense, because tax
planning is not in their every waking thought.
Part of the confusion has arisen because of a failure to distinguish
'self-employed' and 'self-incorporated'.
The latter arrangement - that adopted by Mr Birt - does not exempt those on
the payroll from National Insurance contributions. It does exclude them from
such things as sickness and other benefits provided by the employer. It also
requires them to pay for substantial accounting and auditing fees. It has,
in short, drawbacks as well as benefits.
There may be some concern about the level of discretion exercised by local
tax inspectors in examining the filed returns; and equally calls for
tightening by politicians of the rights of, and scope for, employees to be
self-incorporated.
But as one accountant said in astonishment last week: 'This is the most
monstrous storm in a tea cup.' Another lamented that after years persuading
clients that self-incorporation was a poor method of tax planning, there was
now a fresh run of interest in the approach.
However good a tax accountant Mr Michael Henshaw - Mr Birt's accountant -
was, he clearly has his limitations as an auditor. He would have saved his
client considerable embarrassment if he had taken advantage of the summary
accounts regulations. This would have allowed him to file little more than
the balance sheet on the public record.
That way, nobody would have discovered that Mr Birt's company spent Pounds
3,666 on 'wardrobe' in the 1991 financial year, Pounds 340 on 'theatre
visits &amp; research', and Pounds 2,366 on 'entertainment' (which the attached
tax computation shows as having been added back, revealing Mr Birt did not
claim any tax relief against this final item).
Fuelled, it would appear, by suggestions that Mr Henshaw is not registered
as an auditor, the Department of Trade and Industry admitted last week that
it was 'looking into' the accounts. It might do well to concentrate on the
violations of company legislation which they reveal.
It is true that Mr Henshaw does not appear to be a member of any
professional accountancy body. Nor is he or his firm, Henshaw &amp; Associates
of Camden Town, London, registered as an auditor with any of the regulatory
bodies.
An unregistered practitioner who accepted appointment as an auditor after
the new regulations came into force in October 1991 could face six months
imprisonment and a Pounds 5,000 fine. If such a person put up a plaque
outside his office claiming to be an auditor, he could be fined Pounds 5,000
for each day the sign was in place.
Mr Henshaw might well have had a lucky escape: the 1991 directors' report
shows him willing to stand for re-election in 1992. He was apparently
appointed before October 1991, and is now unlikely to be auditing the 1992
accounts.
But he has certainly breached a number of accounting and auditing
regulations.
'The accounts are appallingly badly drawn up,' said one accountant who has
examined them closely. 'It is a rank piece of bad accounting, especially on
behalf of a client who is somebody in the public eye.'
The auditor's report for John Birt Productions Limited for the year to
August 31 1991 is unsigned and makes no reference to Mr Henshaw's
qualifications as an accountant, so does not comply with auditing standards.
The wording refers to 'the Companies Act 1948 to 1985', though all the laws
before 1985 were repealed by the new act and are irrelevant. In the same
vein, the directors' report says Henshaw will be proposed for re-election as
auditor under the 1976 Companies Act. More importantly, the directors'
report has not been approved or dated by the directors, as required by the
1989 Companies Act.
The one aspect of compliance with the 1989 Companies Act is the relaxation
which allows a single director - rather than a minimum of two - to approve
and sign the accounts.
But legislative requirements are quickly forgotten in the accounts
themselves. The balance sheet is signed by the directors, but not dated as
stipulated by SSAP 17, the accounting standard on post-balance sheet events
introduced in 1980.
The auditor's fee is not separately disclosed as a line item in the profit
and loss account or its notes, a requirement at least since the 1948
Companies Act. There is simply a Pounds 3,100 'audit and accountancy'
figure.
If, as the Financial Times reported last week, the company employs Mr Birt's
wife as a secretary, then the secretary's Pounds 15,000 salary should not be
a separate line item as shown, but part of the Pounds 80,604 recorded for
directors' emoluments. Finally, the figures for depreciation for the year do
not tally with the rates shown.
Mr Henshaw may have lost Mr Birt's contract. But as a director, Mr Birt will
have to foot the bill if the DTI decides that he should have a second audit
conducted on the company.
One piece of good news to come out of this episode for Companies' House, the
government's corporate information depository, will be the money it has made
from requests for copies of the accounts. The bad news is that it failed to
pick up these basic errors. The worse news is that it is under no obligation
to identify most of them.
It is only required to make a series of elementary checks - one of which is
that the auditor's report should be signed.
Mr David Durham, chief executive, says: 'I regret that there must have been
an oversight. Normally my examiners are very good.'
The agency is not required to pick up any of the remaining issues. Should
blood always need to be spilt before problems with filed accounts are
unearthed?

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: ACT ruling may hit sales of Peps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERSONAL Equity Plan industry may be hit by changes to advance
corporation tax as returns on Peps will fall in relation to investments such
as building society deposits and gilts.
Income and capital gains within Peps are tax-free, so a Pep investor
receives the gross, and not the net, dividend yield on a share. The
difference between the net and the gross dividend yield is not paid by the
company, but reclaimed from the Inland Revenue in the form of a tax credit.
This credit was effectively cut by the chancellor in the Budget.
Under the present system a net dividend of 7.5p would become a gross
dividend of 10p to the Pep investor. After the Budget change the same net
dividend will translate into a gross dividend of only 9.375p.
Unless companies increase their dividends to compensate, the effect will be
to cut by 6.25 per cent the income payable to Pep investors. The yield on a
Pep currently paying 5 per cent would fall to 4.69 per cent.
The quirks of the tax system mean that this may make Peps particularly
unattractive to basic rate taxpayers. They will suffer a cut in income on
shares held within a Pep, but their income on shares held outside will be
unchanged.
Furthermore, many Pep managers impose charges which eat into the income from
the equities held in the fund. Mr Peter Smith of Equity &amp; Law pointed out
that basic rate taxpaying Pep holders might suffer a big percentage fall in
their income after charges. Many might find the charges outweighed the tax
benefits.
Higher rate taxpayers will be 6.25 per cent worse off whether they hold
their shares inside or outside a Pep. Since the tax benefits to them are
greater, however, the advantages of a Pep may still outweigh the charges.
Pep managers may offset part of this problem by offering combined
bond-equity funds. The chancellor's tax changes do not affect bond interest,
so the income on such funds will not be hit as hard as will the income on
pure equity funds.
Such combined funds will not, however, be able to have more than 49 per cent
of their portfolios in bonds. The chancellor did not, as some predicted,
allow 'gilt Peps' which could have invested solely in bonds.
Pep sales have rocketed in the last few months as base rates have fallen to
6 per cent, persuading investors to switch from deposits into equities.
However, even Pep managers were admitting yesterday that plans had, at the
margin, become less attractive.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Oil equities knocked by tax reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL COMPANY shares were hit yesterday as the City reacted to news of the
most significant overhaul to North Sea taxation in 10 years, an-nounced in
Tuesday's Budget.
The complexity of the tax changes means there will be substantial winners
and losers. British Petroleum is one of the main beneficiaries from the new
regime and its share price rose 6.5 per cent between the market close on
Monday and the close last night. But some of the smaller exploration
companies saw their shares fall - Clyde Petroleum and Hardy Oil and Gas were
down 11 per cent and 5 per cent respectively.
Mr David Simon, chief executive of BP, said the reduction in the rate of
petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent was 'a long-sought and
fundamental structural reform'.
City analysts estimate that BP will add between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m
to its profits from the tax change.
But Shell sounded a note of caution. Mr John Collins, chairman and chief
executive of Shell UK, said: 'The inability to charge exploration and
appraisal expenditure against income from PRT-paying fields puts a downward
pressure on exploration and appraisal activity.'
This is by far the most controversial part of Mr Norman Lamont's
announcement. It will mean oil companies paying 64p of every pound invested,
compared with 17p and could substantially reduce exploration activity,
hitting smaller companies hardest.
Mr John Walmesley, finance director of Enterprise Oil, said: 'The changes
have taken away a lot of the incentive to re-invest your earnings in new
projects in the North Sea.'
Although Enterprise stands to gain from the tax overhaul, Mr Walmesley said
the changes meant that oil operators, already suffering from low oil prices
and high costs will reduce their exploration work.
Mr Kenneth Waters, finance director of Goal Petroleum, one of the smaller
exploration and production companies, said: 'We have to review our whole
strategy as a result of these changes and we will look at putting more of
our money overseas.'
Mr Paul Zatz, finance director of Clyde Petroleum, said the company was
already directing much of its investment overseas, particularly to the
Netherlands. 'It will inevitably mean a drop-off in future activity in the
North Sea.'
The PRT rate reduction gives larger companies an incentive to extract more
barrels from existing oilfields - an important boost at a time when many
fields are nearing depletion. Mr Simon said this could raise the recoverable
reserves and extend the productive life of some oilfields.
Some industry analysts fear, however, that the government will kill off
exploration in new areas of the North Sea, such as the west of Shetland
region where it is costly to drill for oil. BP has just made a large
discovery west of Shetland which was hailed as opening up a completely new
offshore oil province.
Mr Simon said yesterday the tax changes would help develop the discovery,
where a higher rate of return was necessary. But analysts believe other
companies could be deterred from becoming involved.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: BES axe bites into current schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR'S decision to abolish expansion schemes connected to loans
from midnight before the budget has left the tax avoidance market in
turmoil.
At least two schemes, aimed at raising more than Pounds 23m for Bristol
University and for Oriel College, Oxford, had not allotted shares by the
deadline, and so the schemes will not be eligible for tax relief.
Decisions on other schemes will rest on the judgment of local tax
inspectors. Oriel Residences, which attempted to raise Pounds 13.75m for
Oriel College, Oxford with loans provided by the Co-operative Bank, allotted
shares to shareholders immediately before the budget speech on Tuesday
afternoon.
The scheme opened for subscriptions at 9.00am on Tuesday. Mr Nick Lewis, of
Downing Corporate Finance, which sponsored the issue, said that about Pounds
3m had been taken.
The directors of the companies said they were 'seeking to put into place
arrangements for the return to investors of 100 per cent of their
subscription monies'.
Downing Corporate Finance intends to launch a new BES issue immediately in
conjunction with Oriel College.
Downing is still taking legal advice on how the money can be repaid. This
new scheme would not involve loans. The administrative costs of returning
the shares will be paid by Downing.
Bristol Residences attempted to raise Pounds 9.6m for new buildings at
Bristol University, with the offer of a loan after six months from Barclays
Bank. Mr Allan Hodgson, a director of the company, said that 'some million'
had been collected, but that shares had never been allotted. All the money
would be returned 'shortly'.
Hodgson Martin, the sponsor of the issue, also intends to launch a new
company, without a loan, in time for the end of the tax year.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Caterer tastes what Lamont has served up -
Fleet expenses have soared for one company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN COMMON with businessmen across the country, Mr Jerry Brand was discussing
the Budget with his finance director yesterday. Mr Brand, managing director
and founder of Russell &amp; Brand, a five-year-old contract catering company,
was driving to his company's Leicester office as he spoke on his car phone
with Mr Simon Newth, the finance director. In Beckenham, south-east London,
Mr Newth was working out the detailed implications.
The most immediate impact of the chancellor's changes will be on the
company's car policy. The company, which turned over nearly Pounds 15m last
year, has a fleet of 65 cars, used mainly by its salesmen and contract
managers for visiting the schools, hospitals and businesses which are it
customers.
Mr Newth calculates that the increase of 12p a gallon on unleaded petrol
will cost the company just under Pounds 8,000 in 1993, while increased
employer's national insurance contributions on car and fuel benefits will
cost a further Pounds 4,000. A total increase of Pounds 12,000 represents a
sizeable chunk of the company's 1992 operating profit of Pounds 220,000, he
says.
There will have to be changes in our car policy, says Mr Brand, though his
options are limited. The company has considered the idea of giving employees
a cash benefit and allowing them to choose their own cars, but is worried
about the implications for the company image if they use unsuitable or
unreliable vehicles.
Staff could be given smaller cars, although many spend a great deal of time
in them on company business. There are limits to the discomfort they could
be expected to endure.
The second most significant issue to emerge from the Budget was the
announcement of plans to subsidise the return to work of up to 100,000 of
the long-term unemployed.
In a fast-growing industry with a shortage of skilled staff, Mr Brand
wonders whether he might take on employees under this scheme. He has his
reservations about the bureaucracy which might be involved, however, since a
proposal put to British Coal at the end of last year to retrain redundant
miners for catering work appears so far to have come to nothing.
'If the long-term unemployed fit in, then we are willing to have a look at
them,' says Mr Newth. At present, the company has a total workforce of about
1,250 people, most of them working in its kitchens. It has plans for rapid
expansion, however, and is projecting turnover this year of Pounds 21.5m.
Growth at this speed would mean taking on between 300 and 400 new people a
year.
Mr Newth welcomes the chancellor's decision to limit increases in business
rates to the rate of inflation. The company moved into a new head office in
Beckenham last December, doubling the size of space in use. This is expected
to lead to a sharp increase in its rate bill which will be about Pounds
31,000 this year.
But it is not only the direct impact of the chancellor's moves which will
affect the company. Mr Brand is also concerned about the impact of the
changes on its customers. If they decide to spend less of their incomes on a
hot midday meal, this may mean school and factory kitchens become less
viable.
Almost as important as the decisions taken by the chancellor in his Budget
were the changes he did not make. Mr Brand was looking closely at what the
chancellor would do to VAT. At present the Vatman regards catering companies
as agents providing labour to their customers and labour costs are not
therefore subject to VAT. The VAT authorities have, however, discussed
removing this concession although lobbying by the contract catering industry
has so far kept them at bay. 'If the VAT man taxed labour without letting
schools reclaim VAT, this would add enormously to their catering costs,'
says Mr Brand.
As Russell &amp; Brand has grown, the company has had to take more seriously the
implications of the annual Budget, says Mr Brand. The full implications of
Mr Lamont's decisions will become more apparent in the coming weeks.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Impact 'need not be regressive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN after VAT is imposed on domestic fuel and power at 17 1/2 per cent in
1995-96, to raise Pounds 2.3bn in that year, Mr Lamont's Budget measures
need not hurt poor households proportionately more than the better off, the
Institute of Fiscal Studies said yesterday.
The effect would depend on how far income-related benefits were uprated in
response to the measure. The institute said the restriction of the married
couple's allowance to 20 per cent and the 1 percentage point increase in the
National Insurance contributions of employees tended to limit the regressive
effects of VAT on domestic fuel and power.
Crucially, the institute assumed that all means-tested benefits, such as
income support, family credit and housing benefit, would be increased, over
and above normal uprating, by 2.4 per cent.
This assumption was based on its calculations that households in receipt of
these benefits spent one seventh of their incomes on fuel and power, whose
price was set to rise by 17 1/2 per cent.
A compensating increase in benefits of this magnitude was, it said, the most
reasonable interpretation of the chancellor's pledge that Mr Peter Lilley,
social security secretary, would 'take this (change in VAT) into account
when the income-related benefits are uprated next year'.
Were the measures the chancellor announced for 1995-96 to be imposed on
current incomes under these assumptions about benefits, they would cost the
average household Pounds 5.40 a week (Pounds 282 a year), the institute
said.
For households in the lowest decile (the bottom 10 per cent of income
distribution), the overall cost would average only Pounds 0.40 per week
(Pounds 21 a year), while for those in the top decile it would be Pounds
14.21 a week (Pounds 741 a year).
Similarly, the average unemployed couple with two children would lose only
Pounds 0.81 a week (Pounds 42 a year), while the average two-earner couple
with children would lose as much as Pounds 10.67 a week (Pounds 556 a year).
The proportionate reduction in household disposable income would, it said,
be 2.25 per cent overall. But the proportionate reduction increases from
0.54 per cent of the average household income of the bottom 10 per cent to
2.64 per cent for the seventh decile, before falling to 2.27 per cent for
the top 10 per cent.
This would make these proposals progressive for the bottom 70 per cent of
households, but then mildly regressive for the top 30 per cent.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Power shares up on VAT changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN regional electricity companies in England and Wales moved ahead
yesterday in spite of the chancellor's decision to levy value added tax on
power bills from next year.
Most shares reached their highest level since privatisation. Norweb finished
the day up 13p at 539p, against a previous high of 530p.
Shares in British Gas, whose customers will also see price rises because of
the VAT decision, fell yesterday. Analysts said this reflected institutional
sales for technical reasons rather than concern about the tax.
The electricity shares' buoyancy reflects a belief in the City that sale
volumes are unlikely to suffer significantly when VAT of 8 per cent is
levied in April next year and 17.5 per cent VAT comes in 12 months later.
This is because most people see fuel as a basic necessity.
There is a disadvantage for the companies though, because their bad debt
problems are likely to grow. Yorkshire Electricity expects the proportion of
its 2m customers that experience difficulties in paying bills to rise from
its present 15 per cent.
The company spends an average Pounds 130 a year on chasing each of the most
regular payment defaulters. This is sometimes more than the value of
electricity the defaulters have used.
On the positive side the regional electricity companies will see cashflow
benefits resulting from VAT receipts. In some cases those receipts will be
kept for three months before they are paid to the government.
The Budget also benefited utility companies' shares because of changes to
the tax credit system. From next month tax credits attached to dividends
will be reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.
Mr Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett, said pension funds would be
concerned about the resulting shortfalls in incomes from investments. Some
would be trying to increase their holding of gilts and of high yielding
shares such as utilities, he said.
Other analysts said electricity shares also benefited yesterday from
disclosures that the industry regulator was planning less rigid controls on
supply prices than some had feared.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After The Budget: TUC gives welcome to job subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADES Union Congress took the unusual step yesterday of welcoming some
employment measures in the Budget, including the use of job subsidies to
encourage employers to take on the long-term unemployed.
The TUC described as 'hopelessly inadequate', however, the larger package of
special employment measures which will provide 100,000 jobless people with
work experience or learning opportunities at a net cost of Pounds 125m.
Training and Enterprise Councils - which deliver government-funded training
schemes in England and Wales - will administer two of the four pilot job
subsidy programmes. They gave the government's move a guarded welcome.
Several Tecs already sponsor similar schemes and reward employers for
offering training and employment to the jobless.
One Tec chief executive said: 'If this initiative is developed and used more
widely we may find it more difficult to persuade employers to provide
training in return for a subsidy. If they get a subsidy for just giving a
person a job they may not be as eager to provide training.'
The Budget initiative that was given the warmest welcome was 'Tec
Challenge', a scheme in which Tecs are invited to come forward with new
ideas for tackling unemployment. Some Pounds 25m will be available for
projects.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, has asked a special
committee of Tecs to prepare ideas to tackle unemployment. It is expected to
report in June.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After The Budget: Company cars' change of direction likely
to pick up speed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPOSITION of UK car sales is expected to change following the
simplification of company car benefit tax, Britain's volume car makers said
yesterday.
Mr Tony Brigden, director of fleet sales for UK market leader Ford, said
company car users were likely to seek voluntary 'downsizing' of vehicles to
lower individual tax bills.
'But this trend was in progress anyway through a general desire for smaller
cars and environmental factors, so all that the new scheme will do is
maintain this pressure,' Mr Brigden said.
More important was the removal of the current regime's combination of engine
capacity and price bands. 'Manufacturers can plan without having to take
account of false restrictions, and product planning can be driven wholly by
market forces,' he said.
Company car tax is based wholly on a percentage of cars' retail list prices
plus 'extras'. Car manufacturers, however, expect little negative effect on
sales volumes.
Companies at the lower end of the luxury and specialist sports car sectors,
such as Jaguar and TVR , are likely to welcome the new structure, to be
introduced next year.
Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin, however, which both sell cars in the Pounds
100,000 plus category, stand to be badly affected by the fact that there is
no 'ceiling' on the new tax scheme. The user of a 'perk' Rolls-Royce Silver
Spur costing Pounds 115,000, and covering fewer than 2,500 business miles,
will pay tax of Pounds 16,100 for the private benefit of the car under the
new scheme. This is based on paying tax at the top marginal rate on 35 per
cent of the retail list price of the car.
Under the existing scale charge system, entering its final year next month,
the charge will be only Pounds 6,024 - the same as for private use of a
Jaguar, or any other car costing above Pounds 29,000. Under the new system
the owner of a Pounds 33,600 Jaguar XJS, for example, will see his tax bill
reduced from Pounds 6,024 to Pounds 4,704.
Rolls-Royce expressed its dismay at the absence of any 'cap' on the tax
scheme and said it was 'considering what action we might take' between now
and the scheme's introduction.
Jaguar, wholly owned by Ford, said that 'in overall business terms it will
be very helpful to us in the UK market'.
It has been disadvantaged by the sharp increases in taxation accompanying
the two price thresholds of the current system - at Pounds 19,250 and Pounds
29,000 - and has had to produce 'tax break specials' in a not very
successful effort to compensate. Now it, too, expects to be able to
rationalise its model range and production.
In particular, Jaguar expects an end to the practice of cars being ordered
without extras, even air conditioning, so that the list price can be brought
under the tax threshold.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After The Budget: Stamp duty move will aid most first-time
buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO THIRDS of first-time buyers are likely to benefit from the doubling of
the stamp duty threshold announced in the Budget, according to a study
published yesterday.
James R. Adams, research consultants, estimate that 45 per cent of
purchasers would gain from the decision to raise the threshold for stamp
duty from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000.
People would benefit most in regions where house prices were lowest. In
Yorkshire 55 per cent of all purchasers would gain from raising the
threshold but only 28 per cent of London house buyers.
Housebuilders, estate agents and building societies are pleased that
measures announced in the Budget have done nothing to impede the fragile
recovery in the housing market.
They say gains from raising the stamp duty threshold will more than offset
reductions in mortgage tax relief, also announced in the Budget, but which
will not take place until next year.
Government plans to raise private finance for three of the country's biggest
rail projects, Heathrow Express, the Channel Tunnel link and London's
Crossrail, have received a more muted response from the construction
industry.
Companies welcomed the government's renewed commitment to raising private
finance for infrastructure but were concerned that there was still a gap
between political rhetoric and schemes getting approved, and that a gulf
remained between the Treasury and private investors over what constituted a
reasonable balance between risk and reward.
The general feeling was that the three projects were a long way from
receiving final approval and involved complex financial and environmental
issues which could delay the start of construction until the next century in
some cases.
Civil engineers were also concerned that the Crossrail link between London's
Paddington and Liverpool Street stations was now expected to require private
finance.
Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping and hotels group which
built the privately financed Dartford road bridge across the River Thames,
said: 'The industry has been looking for this kind of commitment to joint
private/public sector projects. But this is only the beginning. It is
important that these projects go forward as quickly as possible for the sake
of the economy.'

FT  18 MAR 93 / Paler shade of green: The UK Budget adds obstacles to an EC
carbon tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does the UK Budget signal the end of a European-wide carbon and energy tax?
The answer is probably yes. The tax proposals, in their original form, were
already facing considerable obstacles. The chancellor's comments may well
have compounded their difficulties.
The Budget, which included the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and higher
petrol and car-licence taxes, made more claims to greenness than any of its
predecessors - even though the claims were immediately disputed by
environmentalists.
The chancellor argued that these measures would help reduce carbon dioxide
emissions and combat global warming. But while he agreed that 'there may be
a case for further co-ordinated international action on global warming', he
added: 'I remain unpersuaded of the need for a new European Community tax.
Tax policy should continue to be decided here in this House - not in
Brussels.'
The swipe at Brussels' influence is hardly unfamiliar, and the UK
government's resistance to the proposed EC energy-carbon tax began to
surface as long ago as last autumn. But given that a Community consensus is
needed on the issue, Tuesday's comments by Mr Norman Lamont caused a sharp
reaction in Brussels. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the environment commissioner,
insisted that negotiations towards the energy and carbon tax would continue.
'I don't see why we should withdraw the (energy tax) proposal.' However, he
welcomed the new green taxes 'as long as they are in the right direction -
and these ones seem to be in the right direction'.
The Budget has put the UK in an odd position - ahead of many Community
members on measures to restrain carbon emissions, but resistant, it appears,
to the Commission's proposals that could force others to follow suit.
Concerns about the UK's stance are likely to surface next Tuesday when
energy and environment ministers meet at a special 'jumbo' council.
That joint council, a rare occurrence, is a sign of new efforts to
resuscitate the proposals, which have made little progress since the Rio
Earth Summit last July. The EC committed itself to stabilising carbon
dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 on condition that its main
trading partners take similar steps. However, a recent internal Commission
report showed that, without a tax, EC emissions were set to miss that target
by a minimum of 4 per cent.
The original EC plan was to impose a combined carbon-energy tax, starting at
Dollars 3 a barrel of oil or oil-equivalent and amounting to Dollars 10 by
the end of the decade. Fuels would be taxed more heavily the higher their
carbon content - coal has more than gas, nuclear has almost none.
Discussions on the plan were given fresh vitality by the new US energy taxes
announced by the Clinton administration. But consensus between the Community
members remains difficult, according to Mr Paleokrassas.
The carbon part of the tax plan has proved the most controversial. France -
heavily committed to nuclear power - wants the carbon-energy tax to be
weighted more towards fuels with a high carbon element. The UK wants a
smaller carbon element, a position likely to be strengthened by the current
review of the coal industry which is likely to preserve some uneconomic
pits. As Mr Robert Jones, chairman of the UK parliamentary select committee
on the environment, argued, it hardly makes sense to subsidise a fuel
industry and at the same time introduce a financial incentive to switch away
from that fuel.
The energy part of the tax has also come under attack from poorer countries.
Spain in particular argues that the richer countries which emit most carbon
dioxide, and have most resources to spend on energy-saving technology,
should be set higher reduction targets.
Environmentalists and economists have also challenged the proposed tax's
environmental effectiveness, particularly on transport, the fastest growing
sector of carbon dioxide emissions in both the UK and Europe overall.
In its original form, the EC estimates that the tax would have raised the
price of petrol by only 6 per cent and diesel by only 10 per cent. Demand
for transport is unresponsive to changes in fuel price - transport
economists were sceptical yesterday that even the Budget's extensive package
of extra costs for UK motorists would have much impact on traffic levels.
One of the most effective deterrents, they argue, is poor roads and traffic
jams, but the UK, as well as much of Europe, is embarking on a heavy
road-building programme. On that argument, even if an EC tax were weighted
more heavily towards transport, as recent councils have begun to explore,
the environmental benefit could still be negligible.
These tensions suggest that if proposals for an EC tax survive, it may well
be in a looser form - an aggregation of each country's measures, some
perhaps taken for fiscal rather than environmental reasons. Next week's
council will help show whether the UK chancellor's comments have been truly
obstructive, or whether they are a sign that discussions are already moving
towards a modified tax.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Jobs and schemes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont's offering, for all his borrowing of the opposition's
slogans, cannot honestly be described as a Budget for jobs. How could it be,
with unemployment expected to pass the 3m mark in today's February figures,
and to carry on rising throughout this year and probably 1994 too? The
pertinent question is whether the combination of Mr Lamont's macroeconomic
helmsmanship and his Budget innovations will together deliver lower
unemployment than would otherwise be the case.
It may seem masochistic to lament an omission of detail from Mr Lamont's
performance. But the discussion of the likely course and importance of
economy-wide labour market trends, both in his speech and the Treasury's Red
Book, is inadequate. The developments in pay, productivity and the exchange
rate that are needed if unemployment is to fall fast are either too obscure,
or too painful, for the Treasury's economists to analyse.
Yet the implicit message is clear enough: massive unemployment is here to
stay. The Treasury's pessimistic growth projections imply unemployment above
3m throughout this parliament. This will be so unless there is a further
fall in the real cost of labour, either through a further sterling
depreciation or a sustained period in which real wages grow more slowly than
underlying productivity. But to mention the former would court disaster in
the markets, while the latter would not play well politically with voters
who are to be punished by higher taxes in the next two years.
High real wage growth, at the expense of permanently higher unemployment,
appears to be deeply ingrained in Britain. But it is difficult to understand
why the chancellor felt it necessary to compound the problem by a 1
percentage point increase in National Insurance employee contributions,
effectively a tax on lower-paid employment.
Yet the government also deserves modest praise. Its package of training and
employment schemes for the unemployed is an imaginative step in the right
direction.
Particularly encouraging are the four pilot Workstart schemes which will
enable the long-term unemployed to transfer their welfare benefits as a
subsidy to a private-sector employer. This is a more desirable way of
getting the unemployed back to work than poorly paid, temporary public or
voluntary sector jobs.
Regrettably, the whole employment package is much too small. Extra spending
of Pounds 125m, creating space for only 100,000 additional participants,
looks puny alongside long-term unemployment of more than 1m. The government
should plan for a significant increase in the 1,000 initial Workstart
places, if the trials are successful. The additional places should perhaps
be targeted at the 200,000 people aged between 18 and 24 out of work for
over a year. The demand for the government's new schemes will be rising for
a number of years. So must the supply.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Simple formula for friction: US drug companies are joining
battle against healthcare reform plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Battle-lines are being drawn between the Clinton administration and the US
pharmaceuticals industry over the president's determination to remake
America's healthcare system and put a cap on drug prices.
The idea of imposing price controls - hinted at this week by Mr Ira
Magaziner, a top White House adviser - is fuelling the already fiery debate.
The options range from placing ceilings on health insurance premiums to a
freeze on medical costs.
The controversy over Mr Clinton's healthcare thinking began even before he
was elected last November and was reignited last month when the president
said he was shocked at the behaviour of the drug industry. He claimed that
the sector's price rises had been unjustifiable, its profits excessive and
its investment on advertising and lobbying - Dollars 1bn more than its
spends on R&amp;D annually - unwarranted.
Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck, the world's largest drug company, who
supported Mr Clinton's presidential campaign, said he was disappointed and
pained by the attack. In an unprecedented step, he published an open letter
to the president in five US newspapers, defending the industry's position.
Mr Kirk Raab, president of Genentech, a leading US biotechnology company
which researches genetically engineered drugs, warned that 'if there are
price controls on new products it could stifle research and development'.
The war of words between drug industry executives and the White House has
caught the public's imagination, becoming a prime item on television news
and a subject for talk shows. A large part of the controversy revolves
around the role that Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton has been assigned as head of
the White House taskforce on healthcare reform.
Mrs Clinton is supposed to produce a comprehensive set of reforms by May 1.
Her role in devising a scheme to expand healthcare coverage to every
American while cutting costs has raised hackles among conservative
politicians uncomfortable with the idea of a first lady who makes policy.
Although the reforms have yet to be announced, concerns about their scope
and possible legislation to enforce them have hit pharmaceuticals stocks.
Since Mr Clinton's election in November, American drug shares have
underperformed the US market by 18 per cent. Shares in Merck and Pfizer have
fallen by 20 per cent and 27 per cent respectively.
At the root of the administration's determination to overhaul the healthcare
system has been a sharp increase in costs. Between 1980 and 1992, costs -
including prices charged by hospitals, doctors, laboratories, equipment
makers and drug companies - increased at more than double the rate of
inflation. Health expenditure as a proportion of GDP rose from 7 per cent in
1965 to 12 per cent in 1990. It is now Dollars 800bn a year.
'However you measure it, healthcare costs are killing America. US society
just cannot afford to keep spending this much on health. Medical inflation
is out of control and it is not even delivering better health. Just look at
the US's poor infant mortality rate,' says Mr Curtis Thorne, head of
pharmacy at Cigma, which manages healthcare programmes for US companies.
For politicians looking for a solution, the pharmaceuticals industry has
proved an easy target. Between 1980 and 1992 drug prices increased by 128
per cent - nearly six times the rate of inflation, according to the Bureau
of Labour Statistics. Prescription medicines are far more expensive in the
US than elsewhere: on average, a drug costing Dollars 1 in America costs 67
cents in Canada and 60 cents in Europe.
The industry's high profitability - conspicuous during the recessionary
early 1990s - has also made it vulnerable to complaints. Senator David
Pryor, a Democrat from Arkansas and a leading critic of the industry, says:
'Drug companies have been making returns on sales three times greater than
the average for the Fortune 500 companies, and twice the return on equity.
Whatever measure of profitability you take, pharmaceuticals companies come
out on top.'
Mr Bob Cawthorn, chairman and chief executive of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the
Franco-American drug company, admits: 'The pharmaceuticals industry has
become the whipping boy of politicians because its price rises and profits
have been so visible.'
Drug groups have argued they are not to blame for the healthcare spending
crisis. Only 7 per cent of US healthcare spending is on medicines, they
maintain.
'Cutting the drug sector's profits would not have that much of impact. If
you cut all the industry's profits and cut all its research that would only
reduce healthcare spending at most by 3 per cent,' says Mr Cawthorn. 'That
would not solve the problem for government, patients or the employers that
pay for insurance.'
The industry also says it needs high prices to fund the research and
development of new medicines. The drug companies say that society needs a
viable and innovative industry if it is to find a response to Aids, cancer,
Alzheimer's and other illnesses.
Such arguments have not impressed politicians who have been emboldened by
public support for aggressive measures. Some members of Congress are taking
advantage of the drug sector's poor public image to launch attacks both
inside Congress and in the media.
Indeed, the drug sector looks like replacing the chemical or oil sectors as
the industry held in least esteem by the public, says Mr Henry Wendt,
chairman of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group.
The sector's poor image stems partly from its bungled response to pressure
for price cuts. Last year, 10 leading pharmaceuticals groups, including
Merck and Pfizer of the US, Glaxo and ICI of the UK, and Roche of
Switzerland, pledged they would in future not increase prices by more than
the rate of inflation - on average.
Few consumers and politicians noticed the words 'on average'. Inevitably,
the prices of some drugs rose faster than the rate of inflation, even the if
the groups' average prices were within the set limit.
Moreover, prices offered to bulk buyers of drugs such as Medco, a company
that specialises in selling cheaply to company healthcare plans, are often
at a discount. That means there is an increasingly uneven price burden for
consumers. Many older Americans, whose insurance fails to cover the cost of
medicines, have been left shouldering large price rises. Senator Pryor
claims the drug groups broke their promises and should not be trusted.
'The announcements were ambiguous,' says Mr Wendt at SmithKline Beecham. He
says his group's price increases were limited to 1.6 per cent last year.
'The industry has reacted too slowly to concerns about pricing. . These find
it easiest to defend the status quo. Senior executives have not shown
sufficient leadership. We are at the 11th hour and the 59th minute,' says Mr
Wendt. He believes it may be too late for the industry to head off the
administration's reforms.
The exact nature of the measures being considered by the new administration
remain unclear. 'Nobody, probably not even Mrs Clinton's task force, yet
knows what will be proposed on May 1,' says Mr Cawthorn at Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer.
The industry, shocked by the relentless attacks by Democratic politicians
and facing reform measures from the White House, is launching a last-ditch
attempt to protect itself.
This month, Mr Wendt issued a rallying call for the sector to negotiate a
new social contract between the pharmaceuticals industry and society. 'We
must show our customers that medicines are good value,' he said. He called
for the industry to engage in price restraint and to invest in studies that
not only showed that drugs were safe and effective, but that they were
cost-effective as well.
But there is little time to get this message across. Almost daily assaults
by congressmen have started to take their toll, while a fresh attack by Mrs
Clinton is unlikely to leave the industry unscathed.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Betting on the Budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET delivered by Mr Norman Lamont on Tuesday afternoon was a huge
political gamble. The chancellor has rolled the dice on two propositions and
tempted fate on a third.
His first bet is that the Treasury's complicated collection of changes in
taxation will convince the markets, the Conservative party, and the public
that the government has regained the equilibrium it lost on Black Wednesday.
It is too soon to call this bet. The markets remained remarkably steady
yesterday, in spite of the realisation that Mr Lamont's medium-term strategy
for reducing the budget deficit is, to say the least, unambitious.
All talk of a balanced budget has been thrown overboard. Next year's public
sector borrowing requirement will rise to Pounds 50.1bn. If Tuesday's
forecasts are correct - a big 'if' - the proportion of gross national
product consumed by public spending will fall to 44 per cent by 1996 -
exactly where it stood in 1979. Yesterday's relative calm in the markets may
suggest that there is a willingness to give the government the benefit of
the doubt. The explanation may, however, be more mundane: an expected cut in
German interest rates today.
Mr Lamont's second bet is that accelerating economic growth will lead to
comfortable increases in real earnings in time for an election in 1996 or
1997. Extra cash in pockets would wash away the bitter taste of the
extension of value-added tax to domestic fuels, along with the pain of the
other salami slices of additional taxation announced on Tuesday. But the
chancellor cannot have it both ways. Too low an earnings increase would not
win the votes; too high would rekindle inflation and keep unemployment
rising.
The chancellor's third flirtation is with Lady Luck. The Conservatives
presumably base their hopes for a fifth election victory on the cynical
belief that voters will quickly forget that a campaign fought in April 1992
on the promise of no increase in taxes was followed by a Budget in March
1993 that put on more new taxation than Labour's Mr John Smith dared think
of. This is a dangerous assumption. Political memories are usually
mercifully short, even though some bad experiences enter the tribal
consciousness of the nation, as Labour found to its cost after 1978-79.
If there is discontent in Britain it will arise not only from the recession
but from the government's bits-and-bobs, unstrung-pearls method of
budgeting. Treasury-driven, it makes and cancels railway investments in
London with little thought for the transport needs of the capital, and
simplifies then complicates taxation with little evidence that it has a
clear structure in mind. This may be a government with a 'grip' on the
economy, but voters will have to pinch themselves to believe it.

immortalised by Tony Curtis when, impersonating an aqua-sporting millionaire
in Some like it Hot, he answered the question with: 'I should say so. Why,
the last time I played, I had three ponies drown right under me.'
The Red Stars water polo team from Yugoslavia have just been left high and

They did manage one game on Monday, but the rest of their programme has gone

Paul Keating's newly re-elected Australian government has decided to give a
rough ride not only to royalty, but to visiting VIPs of all kinds. It is
selling the fleet of plush cars used to chauffeur them, on grounds that they
are inadequately attack-proof as well as too costly to maintain, and buying
armoured Fords and Holdens instead.
The unwanted wheels include seven Rolls-Royces - three black 1958 Silver
Wraiths, two black 1965 Phantom Vs and, fittingly, two 'royal claret' 1964
Silver Cloud IIIs - besides two 1954 Land Rovers in mere ordinary claret
although specially built for conveying crowned heads. Offers direct to the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yet another rumpus has been stirred up by France's maverick minister of
health and humanitarian affairs Bernard Kouchner. The controversy that has
surrounded him ever since he entered politics is still clouding his plans to
depart after this month's elections.
The latest gaffe by the doctor who founded the dashing Medecins Sans
Frontieres team of flying medics in the 1970s comes on top of his affront to
the politically correct in publicly remarking that he'd occupy himself by
'thinking, writing and looking at women'.
To fill the rest of his time he intended not only to set up a new
humanitarian foundation, but to take an academic post. Alas, the one he'd
found - the honorary professorship of humanitarian medicine at the Cochin
university hospital in Paris - has hit trouble.
The glitch is that it would have been specially created for him, which has
so outraged conservatives in medical quarters that even the intrepid
Kouchner has bowed by renouncing the post.

There's often, if not usually, more interest in what a company chooses not
to say when publicly announcing the appointment of a new non-executive
director than in the facts it takes pains to make known.
Take for instance Malcolm Parkinson, at 45 the first Pro-Ned-sponsored
recruit to the board of builders' merchants James Latham. 'A marketing
specialist' who has 'forged a distinguished career', purrs the stock
exchange announcement, going on to recount how he built up the
do-it-yourself chain B &amp; Q, then moved on to help defeat Dixon's unwelcome
bid for Woolworth Holdings before becoming chief executive of the same. End
of official story.
But surely all that was more than five years ago. Is not this the same
Parkinson who quit Woolworths in November 1987 for a Pounds 150,000-
a-year job as a director of Benlox, the tiny engineering group which he and
merchant banker Peter Earl used to attempt a ludicrously ambitious takeover
of Storehouse?
After Benlox's Pounds 2bn bid flopped, Parkinson launched the Retail
Corporation, with Pounds 10m by way of backing, which aimed to set up a
nationwide chain of garden centres. That tumbled into receivership a year
ago.
So what might be the moral? Don't listen to professional publicists, for one
thing. And keep announcements of non-executive board appointments as brief
as possible - name, age and current occupation are all that's required.

THE BOARD of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency meets in
emergency session in Vienna today to decide what to do about North Korea.
That country has refused access to two liquid waste facilities, identified
by satellite reconnaissance, whose existence suggests a capacity for
reprocessing plutonium on a larger scale than it had admitted to possessing.
Meanwhile North Korea has announced its withdrawal from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty (NPT) - an unprecedented step, which however cannot
legally have immediate effect. Under the treaty, three months' notice must
be given to all other parties and to the UN Security Council, and must
include a 'statement of the extraordinary events' the withdrawing state
regards as having 'jeopardised its supreme interests'.
The Security Council could in theory order North Korea to remain an NPT
signatory and to comply with the IAEA's request, and impose sanctions if it
fails to do so. The question is whether sanctions aimed at further isolating
a state which has already so isolated itself would actually be effective in
altering its behaviour. The track record of economic sanctions without
military action is not impressive.
Military action is what North Korea claims to be afraid of. It has already
put itself on a 'semi-war' footing, in response to the joint US-South Korean
military exercise, 'Team Spirit', which it also cites as the 'extraordinary
event' justifying its withdrawal from the NPT. There is in fact nothing very
extraordinary about it - such exercises have been held regularly since 1976
 -but North Korea apparently regards it as a breach of an agreement reached
with the south in 1991, under which it agreed to accept IAEA inspections of
its nuclear facilities in return for the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons,
and nuclear-capable ships and aircraft, from South Korea. The US has
withdrawn them, but some of the ships and aircraft taking part in Team
Spirit are, or were, nuclear-capable.
How likely it is that North Korea is building a nuclear weapon, and how far
if so it might have got with it, are questions on which experts disagree.
Only full inspection by the IAEA can settle the matter. If North Korea has a
lot to hide it is hard to see why it agreed to IAEA inspections in the first
place; but many aspects of that state's behaviour defy conventional ideas of
reason.
What is clear is that neither South Korea nor any of North Korea's other
neighbours have any desire for military escalation. In 1991 and early 1992
conciliatory gestures by the US and South Korea produced the beginnings of a
thaw. It may be that by staging Team Spirit the US and South Korean
militaries have inadvertently upset their own governments' diplomatic
strategy. If so the Security Council, before it decides to assume the worst
and embark on the stony road of sanctions, should be looking for ways to get
that strategy back on track.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Effect on consumer spending uncertain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS ARE under the fiscal equivalent of the sword of Damocles. How much
heed people pay to the Pounds 16bn of tax increases over a two-year period
from April next year will make a big difference to the pace and timing of
any sustained recovery.
The balance of opinion among economists and experts in consumer behaviour
yesterday was that Mr Lamont's fiscal tightening would act to depress
consumer spending in the year ahead.
Professor Peter Abell, a sociologist at the London School of Economics,
said: 'From a psychological point of view, the prospect of tax rises is a
damper. It will reinforce the air of despondency that many people feel after
the economic shocks of the past two years.'
The chancellor is gambling that by choosing a range of methods to raise
extra revenue the effects will be little noticed. The measures include
imposition of VAT on domestic fuel, higher national insurance contributions
and a freeze on income tax allowances.
Mr Lamont hopes also that the economic forces already prodding Britain in
the direction of an upturn will have had their full effect by the time the
tax rises take place.
Whatever their impact, the rises will serve as a highly practical test of
economic theories about 'rational expectations' - the idea that people and
businesses will adjust their behaviour in the light of all available
information, including the prospect of extra strains on their finances.
One sceptic is Mr Dan Elliot, an economist at PA Cambridge Economic
Consultants, a consultancy specialising in consumer behaviour. He thinks
rational expectation does not stand up when the information presented to
consumers is relatively diffuse and technical. As a result, the announcement
will have little impact on consumer spending, which accounts for about two
thirds of total UK output.
'In a few weeks, people will have forgotten about the tax rises,' said Mr
Elliot.
Another apparent sceptic is Mr Lamont, who said yesterday he thought the tax
rises would have no lasting effect on consumer confidence ahead of their
implementation.
Even so, the Treasury's economic projections published with the Budget
statement indicate that consumer activity will remain extremely weak over
the next nine months.
The Treasury reckons consumers' real, inflation-adjusted disposable income
will grow by only 0.75 per cent this year, after a relatively high 2.3 per
cent last year.
On the Treasury view, consumers will be prepared to save less of their
incomes, as confidence grows. It reckons the savings ratio - personal
savings as a proportion of disposable income - will fall from 11.4 per cent
in the final quarter of last year to just under 11 per cent next year.
But even with this prospect, the Treasury thinks consumer spending will rise
only slowly. It is predicting growth in spending of a modest 1.25 per cent
this year, after a 0.25 per cent rise last year.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Export cover moves aim to hold up market
share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN NEEDS to double its capital goods exports to countries outside the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to Pounds 20bn a year
within a decade if it is to maintain its market share, according to
government estimates.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said yesterday there was 'every chance'
of Britain being able to achieve this rate of growth, in what he described
as the one area of world trade where Britain's percentage share had recently
contracted.
His comments came as he set out the detail behind the two-pronged Budget
announcement of fresh cuts in export insurance premium rates and Pounds
1.3bn of additional export credit cover in certain markets over the next
three years.
He said premiums had been re-evaluated to make sure Britain was competitive.
But he warned: 'Obviously we are not going to be the cheapest in every
market in the world.'
The biggest reductions - of up to 45 per cent - were being implemented for
Singapore and Taiwan. Cuts of up to 35 per cent will apply in Hong Kong,
South Korea and Malaysia.
Exporters to China, India, Indonesia and Oman will benefit from reductions
of up to 25 per cent. Mr Needham said he could see no evidence 'at the
moment' that Britain's commercial relationship with China was being damaged
by differences over Hong Kong.
Iran was one of a number of countries where premium rates were being
increased - in its case by up to 10 per cent. This was attributed to
problems regarding negotiations over sovereign loan guarantees.
China and Indonesia were named as beneficiaries of the Pounds 1.3bn in extra
export credit cover, of which Pounds 300m is to be available in the coming
financial year.
On the question of the lack of government arrangements for reinsurance
against political risks after 1994, Mr Needham said the government did not
want to be in the position of having 'inadequate' reinsurance cover,
although it believed this should be provided by the private sector if
possible.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Revenue probe led to closure of Pounds
150m-a-year loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX EXPERTS wince at the use of terms such as 'scam', but there was little
surprise that the Inland Revenue closed the loophole which allowed companies
to be sold solely because they could reduce the purchaser's liability to
advance corporation tax.
An unofficial but brisk market in subsidiaries, organised by tax
consultants, allowed companies with a subsidiary which had paid corporation
tax over the previous six years in excess of its own ACT requirements to
strip the subsidiary of trading activities and sell it.
Buyers with unrelieved ACT could then pass dividends through the subsidiary
and offset the ACT on those dividends against the corporation tax paid by
the former owners.
The chancellor stopped, with immediate effect, the 'carry-back' of ACT when
the ownership of a company changes and there is a significant change in the
nature or conduct of its trade or business.
Mr Chris Adams, a partner in the accountants Arthur Andersen, estimated that
there had been as many as 100 of these transactions recently, although most
involved ACT totalling only Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m. The Revenue said that
closing the loophole would yield about Pounds 150m a year, and prevent
further loss of tax from any increase in this activity.
Recent sellers include Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, which
sold four subsidiaries with net assets totalling Pounds 1.6m for up to
Pounds 11.3m. In May Farnell Electronics, the electrical components
distributor, sold a subsidiary with net assets of Pounds 6.2m for Pounds
12.7m.
The Revenue's special investigation division had focused on 'carry-back'
transactions and adopted an aggressive posture to companies buying
'cleaned-out shells'. It is also likely to continue challenging purchasers
who completed deals before the Budget under sections of the 1988 Income and
Corporation Taxes Act, which require that there is a genuine commercial
reason for the transaction.
Mr Adams said the change in law could also pose problems for companies which
made acquisitions for genuine commercial reasons. Such purchasers would have
to be Careful how they restructured the subsidiary.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Gambling to lose extra Pounds 15m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE

<TEXT>
THE TREASURY will get an extra Pounds 15m pay-out from gaming machines this
year as a result of the budget's 20 per cent increase in licence duty.
Licences for amusement-with-prizes (AWP) machines rise from Pounds 375 to
Pounds 450 a year - the fee for jackpot machines goes from Pounds 960 to
Pounds 1,150 a year.
The increases dented industry optimism, which was raised just a few weeks
ago by Home Office approval for higher prizes paid by one-arm bandits. Top
prize for the 190,000 AWP machines in operation, many in pubs, was lifted to
Pounds 3 cash or Pounds 6 in tokens. The jackpot limit for 35,000 machines
in private clubs was raised to Pounds 200.
Mr Paul Duckett, marketing manager for Associated Leisure, one of the
industry's big three suppliers, said: 'We had expected the higher prizes to
give the trade a useful fillip. The licence increase is a big
disappointment.'
The British Amusement and Catering Trade Association had urged the
chancellor not to increase the licence duty, saying that the industry had
absorbed the VAT increase two years ago and suffered from lower consumer
spending during the recession.
Mr Lamont's only concession was to abolish the duty from November 1 on
small-prize machines, which cost 5p to play. These account for about 5 per
cent of the total. The move is designed to help seasonal operators at
seaside sites.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Tax change puts pressure on dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES ARE likely to find themselves under pressure from shareholders to
reassess their dividend policies in the light of the changes in advance
corporation tax.
Mr Andrew Jones, senior tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, is
blunt about it: 'Companies will have to pay bigger dividends to keep their
share prices up.'
This could have implications for companies' decisions on where and how they
raise new finance.
Shareholders which do not pay tax, such as pension funds, will get a reduced
rate of tax credit on dividends paid out of UK profits. Dividends paid from
foreign earnings, under the proposed foreign income dividend scheme, will
not carry any tax credit. Thus such shareholders will be significantly worse
off unless dividends are increased.
In theory, since a company is owned by its shareholders, it should not
matter that a benefit is shifted from investors to companies. This will cut
little ice with investors, however.
On the positive side, if companies' tax bills are reduced by the ACT changes
then their earnings will increase, giving them scope to pay more in
dividends. Mr Jones said: 'If the rate of dividends rises to compensate
investors, the only help companies get is in shifting the burden of cost
from the tax line to the dividend line of the profit and loss account'.
Companies were yesterday looking at the implications of the ACT changes. Mr
Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive of T&amp;N, the motor components and
engineering group, agreed that 'there could be a problem from tax-exempt
shareholders pressing for higher dividends'.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate,
believed Hanson's tax charge could fall by as much as Pounds 35m. But he
said: 'I think it is too early to say whether that means we will pay
additional dividends.'
Mr Peter Clappison, finance director of BBA, the component maker for
automotive, aviation and industrial markets, said he would be taking
soundings from the group's tax-exempt shareholders. 'It is not clear they
will be pressing for higher dividends. We will make up our minds as to what
we do after we hear back from them.'
The ACT changes could also affect the timing of dividend payments in the
short term. The shift from a 25 per cent to 20 per cent rate of ACT will hit
higher rate taxpayers, who will be required to make up the difference
between the ACT rate and 40 per cent income tax. Mr Jones suggested that
private companies with higher-rate taxpayers as shareholders may pay
substantial dividends before the end of the tax year.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Institutions scramble to clarify ACT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR'S budget address on Tuesday has sent institutional investors
scrambling for copies of the Inland Revenue bulletins spelling out the fine
print of corporate tax changes.
The bulletins clarify questions about whether professional investors need to
re-think the way they have structured their portfolios, whether equity
weightings should be pared or increased, or whether overseas holdings look
more attractive.
Fund managers at Legal and General Asset Management, one of the UK's largest
life insurers, yesterday concluded that there was little in the budget to
suggest that restructuring was necessary.
Among the chief issues for Legal and General, and others managing pension
fund assets, is the effect on investment decisions of lowering the
percentage of advance corporation tax payable on corporate dividends that
pension funds can reclaim. From April 5, pension funds will only be able to
reclaim 20 per cent of ACT paid on UK corporate dividends, down from 25 per
cent.
Mr David Rough, investment director at Legal and General, noted that while
there would be a cut in cashflow to pension fund investors, corporations
might increase dividend payments to compensate for it.
The chancellor's Budget also exempted non-domestic profits from ACT, a bone
of contention among companies with export-driven earnings or overseas
operations.
The resulting cut in tax charges might be passed on to shareholders in the
form of higher dividends, Mr Rough said.
He added that when the rebateable ACT rate for pension schemes was cut from
30 per cent to 25 per cent during a period of several years beginning in
1984-85, several UK corporations did precisely that.
The effective cut in dividend yields for pension funds is too small to
justify a shift into UK gilts, Mr Rough added. The yield on the FT-A
All-Share Index had fallen marginally by about 0.25 per cent to just below 4
per cent but equities were still likely to out-perform gilts, albeit by a
smaller margin.
Mr Paul Whitney, chief executive at CIN Management, the in-house manager of
the Pounds 13.5bn British Coal pension schemes, said that institutions would
have to wait to see how corporations responded.
Mr Whitney noted dividend cover for many corporations had fallen below the
two-times cover considered prudent. Many would wish to rebuild that before
raising dividends.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Pension fund managers predict industry
upheaval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES TO advance corporation tax are likely to lead to a dramatic upheaval
in the pension industry, fund managers warned yesterday.
Managers assessing the impact of Tuesday's Budget said it would effectively
cut their income by up to 6.25 per cent.
Mr Michael Pomery, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said:
'Pension funds are stuffed.'
From April 5 pension funds will be able to claim back only 20 per cent of
ACT. With ACT at 33 per cent of every Pounds 100 of profits, pension funds
will be able to reclaim Pounds 16.70 from ACT instead of the Pounds 22.30
they could have reclaimed previously - in effect a 6.25 per cent cut in
cashflow.
Given the average UK pension fund's weighting of 58 per cent in UK equities,
total cashflow is likely to shrink by up to 3.5 per cent.
Mr Pomery warned that because actuaries valued pension fund assets on their
anticipated cashflows, a fund's UK equity assets would be at least 6.25 per
cent smaller on April 5 than they were on April 4.
The drop in asset base and cashflow will be significant for mature pension
schemes in declining industries whose plan sponsors have been making little
or no contribution.
Mr Andrew Wilson, research partner at consulting actuaries R Watson, said:
'This could mean either increases in contributions or cuts in benefits.'
According to figures from the National Association of Pension Funds, the
industry trade association, 38 per cent of all UK employers made no
contribution to their pension scheme last year, relying on investment income
and employee contributions to make up the bulk of payments to current
pensioners.
And schemes in 1992 were already hard hit by dividend cuts last year. For
the first time in 25 years, dividend growth shrank by 0.5 per cent, instead
of growing at the annualised five per cent rate assumed by scheme actuaries.
The full effect is not expected to be be evident for some time, actuaries
said. But glimpses of its potential impact are showing. Mr Pomery said that
on Wednesday, he had a call from a client with a small surplus it had
planned to distribute to members. 'Now that surplus is gone.'

How ACT works: Companies currently pay ACT on dividends at the rate of 25
per cent of the gross dividend, in future at 20 per cent. At the current
rate a Pounds 25m net dividend gives rise to Pounds 8.3m of ACT and a gross
dividend of Pounds 33.3m. When the move to the 20 per cent rate is complete,
a net dividend of Pounds 25m will give ACT of Pounds 6.3m and a gross
dividend of Pounds 31.3m. ACT is then offset against mainstream UK
corporation tax.
The first company, which earns all its profits in the UK, sees no change in
its total tax bill, but gets a cashflow benefit as Pounds 2m of tax switches
from payment in advance to arrears. However, a tax exempt investor will
receive a lower tax credit on its dividend.
The second company is unable fully to offset its ACT liability against its
UK corporation tax. Under the current system it takes Pounds 33 of
corporation tax to relieve Pounds 25 of ACT, leaving it with surplus ACT of
Pounds 3.3m. The change to the rate in the budget makes this worse, only
Pounds 20 of ACT can be offset against Pounds 33 of corporation tax.
However, the lower rate more than compensates and the surplus ACT reduces to
Pounds 2.3m.
If the foreign income dividend scheme is introduced, making dividends paid
from overseas profits free of ACT, the company's problem is solved. The
illustration assumes the company opts to pay 80 per cent of its dividend out
of foreigh profits. However, the tax-exempt investor is even worse off, as
it can only reclaim tax on the proportion of the dividend paid from UK
profits.
'I am pleased that the changes have come about, although the pension funds
are disadvantaged. I think they are strong enough to withstand the measures.
I think it is too early to say whether that means we will pay additional
dividends.'
Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, who believes the Anglo-US
conglomerate's tax charge will fall by about Pounds 35m
'The changes will unquestionably be of use to us over the next few years.
But they will be of less help than one might think. There could be a problem
from tax-exempt shareholders pressing for higher dividends. T&amp;N has a
surplus ACT of more than Pounds 5m.'
Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive of T&amp;N, the motor components and
engineering group
'It is not clear our tax-exempt shareholders will be pressing for higher
dividends. We will make up our minds as to what we do after we hear back
from them.'
Peter Clappison, finance director of BBA, the automotive, aviation and
industrial component maker, who expects his group to save around Pounds 1m
in tax.

FT  18 MAR 93 / After The Budget: Fears that self-assessment will hinder
small business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW PROPOSALS designed to allow the self-employed to assess their own tax
liabilities could make life more difficult for small businesses, it was said
yesterday.
Under the new arrangements the self-employed would calculate their own tax
liabilities on the basis of estimated profit made in their current trading
year, rather than the present system under which tax paid in the current
year reflects profits made in the previous year.
Mr Tony Miller of the Federation of Small Businesses said: 'Under the guise
of simplification, it is a way of transferring many Inland Revenue
responsibilities to taxpayers.'
He said the proposals would destroy the 'finality and certainty' of
taxpayers' affairs, since the Inland Revenue would be able to go back over
returns lodged in the previous four years in normal circumstances, or 20
years if the Revenue suspected negligence.
Mr Ian Luder, vice president of the Institute of Taxation, said: 'For the
self-employed, this will be a shifting of the administrative burden from the
revenue to the taxpayer.'
Far more self-employed people will be forced to employ accountants, although
other taxpayers affected by the new measures will find them simplified.
Reflecting scepticism among the accountancy profession, Mr Clive Mackintosh,
tax partner with Price Waterhouse, said: 'When it comes down to it, it won't
reduce your liabilities or simplify your affairs.
'I'm not a great enthusiast. I don't think the present system is too bad. It
enables you to draw up and agree an assessment with the Revenue before
paying tax.'
Mr Mackintosh warned that the new system could leave some small businesses
with cashflow problems and could lead to complicated negotiations to
reconcile estimated with actual profits. 'It is all very well as long as
your profits continue to rise. But if you are self-employed your profits can
go up and down and it may not be possible to make accurate estimates.'

FT  18 MAR 93 / After The Budget: Initial optimism turns into caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE dust began to settle yesterday on the changes to the advance
corporation tax regime experts started assessing the implications for UK
companies.
While the initial response to the Budget speech was enthusiastic, closer
investigation of the measures dampened the hopes raised.
According to tax experts at Ernst &amp; Young, the Inland Revenue is likely to
increase its tax take through ACT as a result of the changes.
Companies have been lobbying hard for measures to address the problem of
surplus ACT for many years. They were told before the Budget that any
solutions would have to be neutral in revenue terms, and had not hoped for
much.
In his speech Mr Lamont appeared to have given more than anyone expected.
And finance directors were yesterday still welcoming the changes he
proposed.
Companies stand to benefit in two ways.
First, the rate of ACT is being reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent over
two years. Then the idea of a 'foreign income dividend' scheme will be
discussed. A consultation document was issued on Tuesday and responses
invited by the end of May.
The reduction in the rate appears good news for companies, although not for
their tax-exempt investors or for higher-rate tax paying individuals.
Companies will get a cashflow benefit as ACT is payable in advance but
corporation tax is paid in arrears. The chancellor estimated that the net
benefit to companies would be Pounds 2bn over two years.
Mr Andrew Jones, the senior tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young pointed out,
however, that a large number of companies will be worse off.
Those which have suffered from surplus ACT in past years can set it off
against UK corporation tax once their profits recover sufficiently to pay
it. But, while they could offset Pounds 25 of ACT against Pounds 33 of
corporation tax, soon the amount will be only Pounds 20. As a result their
marginal tax rate will rise from 8 per cent to 13 per cent.
Lobbyists had been pressing for 'pound-for-pound' offset but this is a move
in the opposite direction.
Mr Jones said companies with a mountain of surplus ACT would only be able to
erode it at a much slower rate. He argued that the government should
consider allowinga pound-for-pound offset or companies would see their
marginal tax rates rise by 62 1/2 per cent.
There is some unhappiness that, while the rate payable by companies is to
come down in two stages to 20 per cent, shareholders' tax credits will
undergo one simple cut, giving the government the 2 1/2 per cent difference
for a year.
The second positive ACT provision relating to foreign income dividends, is
also not quite as helpful as it might seem. Companies will have the option
of paying them out of profits remitted from overseas.
They will have to pay ACT in the normal way but can then claim it back from
the revenue. This is of no use to tax-exempt shareholders, who will not be
able to claim a tax credit.
In theory foreign income dividends will evade the problem faced by companies
with a large proportion of overseas profits, but only a small amount of UK
corporation tax against which to offset the associated ACT.
In practice, aside from the likely complexity of claiming the tax back,
companies can only pay the dividends out of actual cash received from their
overseas subsidiaries.
Often countries demand a withholding tax when cash is remitted, and some
also impose foreign exchange controls limiting the remittances to a UK
parent. Companies could find that there is another cost involved if they try
to reduce their ACT bill.
Even so, Mr Ian Muir, head of the Scottish Institute of Chartered
Accountants tax committee, said yesterday that 'at least it is a step
forward, at long last they have accepted that something needed to be done'.
Overall the effects of the ACT changes will have widely varying effects for
different companies. 'It depends on the mix of income and the mix of
shareholders', Mr Muir said.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Summer start pledged for business
advice shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST of the govern-ment's new one-stop business advice centres will
open in the summer, with a fresh round of bids for contracts to run them to
be invited this autumn, MPs were told yesterday.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, made the announcement as
he praised Tuesday's Budget for being full of 'very considerable' good news
for business.
He clashed with Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, over the
leaked DTI report showing a depressing outlook for British manufacturing.
Calling for publication of the document Mr Cook said it represented 'an
appalling verdict' on 14 years of Conservative government.
Mr Heseltine retorted that the report revealed the 'devastating inheritance'
the Tories had taken on in 1979 'when this country's economy was perceived
as the sick man of Europe'.
The confidential report concludes that UK industry is beset by weak
management and products and under-investment in new technology.
In the first round of applications to run 15 pilot one-stop outlets which
the government hopes will start the process of revolutionising support for
British companies, the Department of Trade and Industry received 57 bids.
The 'shops', which will eventually number 200, will bring together the
business services of chambers of commerce, local authorities, local
enterprise agencies and the DTI.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs say Lamont should seek further
public spending cuts in November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fundamental review of public spending announced in February will be
essential in meeting the tough targets for reducing the proportion of
national income spent by the state, Mr Portillo said yesterday, Alison Smith
writes.
Some Tory MPs have already said they believe that Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, should have revised the spending plans downwards on Tuesday, or
should be seeking further public spending cuts in November.
Officials in the four departments making up the first stage of the
fundamental review - social security, health, education and the Home Office
 -are already working on areas where savings could be made. After initial
ministerial discussion preliminary results of that work will go to the
public-spending cabinet in June.
Mr Portillo warned there were 'hard decisions ahead'.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: BAe chief urges aerospace strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG plea for a 'national strategy' for the aerospace industry was made
yesterday by Mr Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace.
He told the Commons trade and industry committee that aerospace was one of
the few activities in which Britain was genuinely still a world leader. But
it was clear that France, and more recently Germany, had developed strategic
plans for their aerospace sectors.
'Unless we address the issue of investment in a much more specific way we
are in danger of losing the ground, or part of the ground, that we are
currently occupying,' he said.
He welcomed what he called a 'gratifying' improvement in the level of
dialogue between the industry and government. But Mr Evans said the industry
was relying on the Department of Trade and Industry to take the lead in
setting out a strategy.
With other companies, BAe is awaiting a response from ministers to proposals
for a national strategic technology acquisition plan, drawn up by a mixed
working group of civil servants and industry representatives.
Proposals include measures to fund work on different areas of aircraft
technology, including helicopters, and related activities such as air

Last year's US-European agreement limiting direct support for development of
new civil aircraft had halved the amount of launch aid that could be given.
Mr Evans described the accord as 'an extremely good agreement for the
Americans and an extremely poor agreement for the Europeans.'
Mr Mike Turner, BAe's regional aircraft chief, said the company would look
to the government to help with investment on the next regional jet and
turboprop aircraft projects.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: The price of fiscal prudence -
Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party at Westminster was braced for higher taxes. In the
FT's pre-Budget survey 56 per cent of Tory MPs had demanded additional
revenue to reduce the deficit. But that did not stop Mr Norman Lamont's
package from hurting.
The rumblings on the government back benches against the chancellor's
decision to extend valued added tax to domestic heating were symptomatic of
a broader anxiety.
Mr Lamont had been both brave and right to set out a tough strategy to
reduce the deficit. To re-coin a phrase, there was no alternative. Now, at
last, the government could claim that it had restored a grip on economic
policy.
But the pensioners, the low-paid and the skilled working classes - those
politically precious C2s - who bore the brunt of higher taxes will be less
impressed by the rediscovery of fiscal prudence.
The bitter wrangling over Maastricht threatens to sap the government's
authority still further. Civil war over Europe will be followed by a
spending round even tougher than last year's.
An increase in the Treasury's medium-term inflation assumptions means that
the new control total for public spending now implies a real cut of 0.25 per
cent in 1994-95 and a freeze in 1995-96 - the very years in which the tax
increases will bite. Teachers, police officers, nurses and doctors cannot
expect a relaxation of the present public-sector wage squeeze to meet their
higher tax bills.
Unemployment will keep on rising. If it is to stick to its spending targets,
the government may be forced to abandon manifesto pledges on welfare
benefits. Overall, this particular cocktail could make for what one Tory MP
called 'a truly bloody summer'.
Few on his own side questioned the political as well as economic strategy
underpinning Mr Lamont's Budget.
A Pounds 1bn-a-week borrowing requirement was unsustainable. If action were
not taken now - or at least next year and the year after - then the
government would have to put up taxes on the eve of the next election.
Mr Lamont, more relaxed than circumstances might have suggested, put the
case cogently in an intense selling exercise yesterday. To win the election
due by 1997 the government must deliver sustained economic recovery. Without
reductions in the deficit it would be impossible to sustain the recovery
which now seems in sight.
There was a more optimistic sub-text also. By putting in place now what he
termed a 'wedge' of revenue-raising measures Mr Lamont would leave himself -
or his successor - able to take advantage of more favourable circumstances
two or three years hence.
Progressive reductions in the PSBR between now and 1996 would allow room for
modest cuts in income tax in the approach to the election.
Last year the chancellor played a significant part in securing the
Conservative election victory by cutting taxes. Now he was saying he would
help win the next election by raising them in order to cut income tax again
in 1996.
Some Tory MPs hope the good news will come rather earlier than that. For all
the praise for Mr Lamont's fiscal virtue, there were already mutterings
yesterday that an upturn over the next few months might provide the basis
for a rather gentler phasing in of VAT on heating.
There were few signs of outright rebellion. An increase in benefits for the
elderly and the poor should take much of the political sting out of the new
tax. But the Treasury should take note. There are enough on the populist
right and the caring left of the Tory party to combine against the new tax
if the increase is insufficiently generous.
In the meantime Labour will make hay. No amount of sophisticated textual
analysis will persuade voters that the government has not reneged on the
prospectus it presented last year. Nor is there much chance of convincing
them that a 1-point rise in national insurance contributions is somehow
better than 1p on the basic rate of income tax.
Mr Lamont may be right to argue that sustained economic recovery will help
the voters to forget by 1997 the pain he inflicted in 1993. But the
Treasury's forecasts suggest the overall tax burden will rise in every
single year between now and the general election.
In 1992 the Conservatives used three weapons to win the election: the threat
of higher taxes, Mr Neil Kinnock's leadership of Labour, and the new
direction for Tory government offered by Mr John Major.
Now the Conservatives have raised taxes, Mr Kinnock has departed and Mr
Major is no longer a fresh face. It does not leave them much with which to
fight the next election.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTRODUCTION of new rules on waste disposal designed to curb cowboy
operators will be postponed for two months because of discussions with the
waste disposal industry, Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said
yesterday. New licensing arrangements will now come into force on June 1
instead of next month.
Under the scheme people or companies dealing in waste disposal or operating
waste dumps have to prove they are 'fit and proper persons'.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: SNP angered by remarks on Scots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTTISH National Party yesterday called on Mr John Major, the prime
minister, to disown comments it said were made by his press secretary, Mr
Gus O'Donnell, after Tuesday's Budget.
Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, said: 'Downing Street's message to the Scots
can best be summarised as 'let them drink whisky'.' The SNP says Mr
O'Donnell said Scotland should be grateful, especially for the measures on
whisky, training and petroleum revenue tax.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR LAST night launched a fresh attack on the handling of the liquidation
of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, urging the
government to take the process 'by the scruff of its neck' and ensure value
for money for interested parties.
Mr Stuart Bell, Labour's City spokesman, called on the government to use its
influence on the liquidators to reduce their costs - which he said worked
out at Pounds 640,000 a week since their appointment - to acceptable levels
and to speed up the pace at which the liquidation was proceeding.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unionists protest at slip by Major
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR sparked protests from Northern Ireland's Unionist MPs
yesterday after accidently suggesting that he would block the setting up of
an assembly in the province.
Downing Street moved to correct what it said were 'inaccurate
interpretations' of the prime minister's remarks in the Commons on Tuesday,
when he said he opposed 'extra assemblies . . . in any part of the UK'.
Britain remained committed to finding new arrangements for government in
Northern Ireland as part of a wider political settlement, it said.
But Mr Major's comments led to Unionist accusations that he was creating
confusion. They also betrayed tension between the Northern Ireland Office
and the Scottish Office, which last week published its paper opposing
devolution in Scotland.
The Northern Ireland Office has been worried about the impact of its 'taking
stock' on its attempts to balance Unionist and nationalist aspirations.
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, yesterday
wrote to Mr Major asking for clarification of his remarks which, Mr Paisley
said, had undermined the purpose of political talks on the province last
year.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory revolt looms over Budget VAT
move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faces an all-party Commons inquiry into the impact on the
poor of imposing value added tax on domestic fuel, amid signs that the
Budget change could trigger a backbench Tory revolt.
The social security committee is expected to launch next week an
investigation into whether extra payments promised by the Treasury will
cover the increased burden on low-income households.
Unease surfaced among MPs as Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief
secretary, refused to commit the government to compensate pensioners or
people on low incomes in full for the impact of VAT.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced on Tuesday that VAT will be
charged at 8 per cent on domestic fuel and power from April next year and at
17.5 per cent from April 1995.
Mr Portillo sought to rely on the pledge in the Budget statement that the
increase in bills would be taken into account when income-related benefits
were uprated in the autumn through a formula based on the retail prices
index. But, under pressure from Labour, the limits of that pledge became
more clear as Mr Portillo emphasised that in some instances people on
income-related benefits were over-compensated for price rises which in
practice affected them very little.
The Treasury estimates that the extension of VAT to domestic fuel will raise
the retail prices index by less than 1 percentage point.
A cross-party committee inquiry would heighten the political row over the
Budget. Mr David Shaw, the Tory social security committee member who
demanded the investigation, said: 'If something so sensitive comes up in the
Budget, we have got to look at it.'
Social security ministers believe that the Treasury will not agree to an
increase for all pensioners which fully reflects the impact of the VAT
change. Instead they are expecting some form of targeted payment which would
not apply to all the 9.9m who receive the basic retirement pension, but
would go to people on income support and on family credit.
Mr Andrew Bowden, Tory chairman of the all-party group of MPs campaigning
for pensioners, said on ITN yesterday that it was 'no use just increasing
the income support rate. There has got to be an increase in the basic
pension for all pensioners.'
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, last night wrote to Mr John Major
seeking confirmation that people on income support would be compensated in
full.
Downing Street was unworried yesterday by the Tory backbench reaction, but
the discontent could give the government cause for concern when the finance
bill implementing the Budget is considered in detail.

THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has supplied more than 10,000 pages of
documents to the judicial inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair, including
all those requested, MPs were told yesterday, David Owen writes.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, made the disclosure as
he sidestepped a question from Mr Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP, about the
extent of his knowledge of the affair.
He asked whether Mr Heseltine had admitted to Lord Justice Scott, who is
heading the inquiry, that he knew when he signed a public-interest immunity
certificate relating to Matrix Churchill, the machine-tool manufacturer,
that Mr Paul Henderson, a director, had been supplying intelligence
information.
Public hearings are expected to end before the summer recess.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Beckett's vote reform move is
disallowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S working party on electoral reform is edging closer to recommending
a change in the voting system in spite of a rearguard action by Mrs Margaret
Beckett.
A meeting of the group disallowed an attempt by Mrs Beckett, party deputy
leader, to revoke an earlier decision not to file a menu of options.
It reaffirmed the view of its chairman, Lord Plant, that it must deliver a
firm recommendation to the National Executive Committee when it meets next
month.
As Mrs Beckett, a passionate advocate of the present-first-past-the-post
voting system, cannot be seen to table a minority report, the odds seem now
tipped in favour of a recommendation for change.
Nonetheless, the committee is still divided over what system would be
appropriate, with its 16 members split into three groups. Probably the
largest of these - about six or seven-strong - supports a mixed-member
voting system.
This would reduce the total number of constituencies from 651 to 500, but
would further add 150 MPs selected by regions on the basis of candidates'
performances as 'best losers' in the election. The MPs would emerge as a
result of weighting the total number of MPs to reflect the parties' shares
of the vote.
The second grouping - somewhere between three and five-strong - supports
first-past-the-post. The last group favours a supplementary vote system that
ensures each MP is elected by an outright majority through a variation in
the alternative vote system.
The final decision of the committee, due at the end of the month, must be
passed for approval to the NEC before going out to consultation in the party
before the annual conference in September.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Cut-price route angers community groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HACKNEY COUNCIL in east London was quick to state its opposition yesterday,
after it became clear that the high-speed Channel rail link is likely to run
overground through the borough.
Councillors, officials and community groups collected about 11,000
signatures on a petition which will be delivered to the House of Commons
today. Traders from a 200-year-old market are threatening to deliver a load
of bananas with the petition.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in the Budget the government favoured
St Pancras station as the terminus for the link, implying a surface route
alongside the North London railway line. A detailed announcement on the
route of the link has been delayed until next week.
Traders at the Ridley Road fruit and vegetable market fear that widening the
North London line - which runs directly beneath the market - to accommodate
Continental trains would probably require the market's demolition.
Mr John Julian, whose great grandfather helped start the market and who has
dozens of cousins working there, said: 'It's terrible. If they take out this
market it will knock out this area.'
Mr John McCafferty, leader of the Labour-controlled Hackney council, said an
overground line 'would be a disaster for the population of Hackney. We will
certainly be taking every single step we can to block it'.
The council says widening the existing railway would affect a dozen schools
and hundreds of houses and shops. British Rail has told the council only 15
houses would be destroyed. The council says the figure is nearer 700.
The council also says that up to 500 extra vehicles an hour could be brought
on to Hackney's congested roads if Stratford in east London became, an
interchange for the new link.
The pressure groups affected by the St Pancras option say they would prefer
the Channel rail link to run underground to King's Cross - as originally
planned - or to end south of the river at Waterloo.
Islington council says the King's Cross project has already blighted the
area. Mr Gordon Arnot, planning worker at an Islington residents
association, said: 'The residents here have lived for five years with the
threat of the King's Cross low-level station. We feel we should get some
compensation for the economic blight.'
Mr Andrew Bosi, chairman of Islington's transport committee said: 'It is a
pity that the government's transport policy still changes from one month to
the next.'
BR said it could make no comment on the figures at issue until the decision
on the route was announced.

FT  18 MAR 93 / BP 'not defrauded by middlemen'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum was not defrauded by middlemen acting for engineering
companies bidding for lucrative North Sea contracts because it ultimately
received the best value for money, Southwark Crown Court heard yesterday.
The prosecution was misguided in suggesting that BP was a victim of fraud
because confidential information had been leaked regarding the tendering
processes for 11 contracts, Mr Paul Purnell QC, for Mr Josef Szrajber, said.
The trial continues today.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Sheffield sees rise in confidence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHEFFIELD chamber of commerce's quarterly survey shows a marked increase in
business confidence. Fifty per cent of companies expected better profits
this year, while 60 per cent forecast improved turnover.
The survey of 315 companies also suggests there is a reduction in
labour-shedding, with only 12 per cent saying they cut workforces between
April and June.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Car parts factory to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER

<TEXT>
CAMFORD Engineering, the German-owned automotive components group, is
closing one of its subsidiary's plants in Cambridgeshire with the loss of up
to 328 jobs.
The Pre-Star plant at Bourn is due to close by the end of September and
activities will be transferred to other UK plants in the group, principally
Pre-Star Bedford and Llanelli-based Camford Pressings.
Camford, based in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, said it is expected that some
employees will agree to move.
Mr Peter Paul, group managing director, said the board regretted the effects
on the employees and their families at Bourn. But he stressed that the move
had not been brought about by falling volumes due to the recession. 'The
closure more reflects the competitive nature of our industry, where the
surviving and successful companies will be those which can meet the
ever-increasing demands of our customers, particularly on costs.'
Mr Paul said the group had had surplus capacity for some time. Although new
contracts enabled it to predict significant growth in the years ahead, new
technology and lean manufacturing techniques meant it could now produce its
components in much less space.
Camford's sales, he said, had remained remarkably stable over the past three
years because its components were fitted to models which had been selling
relatively well.
Camford is a wholly owned subsidiary of the newly formed Krupp-Hoesch steel
group.
Short Brothers, the Belfast-based aerospace company, yesterday announced
that it is to shed 665 jobs. The move had been expected because of the
worldwide downturn in the aircraft industry.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Birt has reluctant support from BBC staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS DUNKLEY and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT may have won the support of the BBC's board of governors in the
controversy over his tax affairs and employment terms. But how the affair
will affect the director-general's relations with the corporation's staff,
many of whom have expressed deep distaste for his management style and
proposed reforms, remains to be seen.
Some of his critics have, inevitably, hoped that the incident would bring
about his downfall and replacement by 'somebody whom programme makers could
relate to and follow, so that perhaps we would actually understand what was
going on', as one documentary producer put it.
Yet to judge by conversations with staff across the organisation yesterday,
this may be a minority view. Although their personal sympathy for Mr Birt
and his methods is limited, many concede that the BBC's interests will be
best served by his remaining in office. To a large extent, this view
reflects the belief that any alternative would be even worse.
'He pretty well has to stay. He's the fountain head of the only plan we've
got,' said one radio producer. 'If he went and (chairman Marmaduke) Hussey
went too, the BBC would face its gravest crisis ever.'
He also dismissed as unworkable the idea favoured by some staff that Mr John
Tusa, popular head of the World Service, should be appointed
director-general, backed up by Mr Bob Phillis, recently recruited from ITN
as Mr Birt's deputy.
'The trouble is that Phillis has never worked for the BBC before, and
however popular Tusa would be with staff, you couldn't really expect him to
take over the Birt plans with much conviction,' he said.
None of Mr Birt's innovations has been more controversial than the
introduction of Producer Choice, a system of market discipline and
budgeting. Intended to improve efficiency, it is seen by critics as an
attack on the BBC's creative resources. Yet some BBC rank and file were
arguing yesterday that the system, which has been widely viewed as a way of
cutting the organisation down to size, might actually be one of the most
solid guarantees of independence. a member of the drama department at
Television Centre said: 'Whether or not even Birt believes in Producer
Choice, it seems to be effective in keeping the government off the BBC's
back.'
Although Mr Birt may be winning staff support by default, the BBC governors
have won no plaudits for their handling of the controversy.
There is a widespread belief in the organisation that someone should be made
to pay the price for the affair by resigning - and that that person should
be Mr Hussey.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Names reject 'success fees'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Lloyd's Names with heavy losses yesterday decisively rejected
proposals to award success fees to representatives organising legal action
on their behalf.
The Names, who are among more than 3,000 members of Gooda Walker syndicates,
also voted overwhelmingly to remove Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg and Mr Paul
Marland, the Conservative MP for West Gloucestershire, from the committee of
the Gooda Walker Action group.
Both Mr Marland and Mr Doll-Steinberg, the former chairman of the group, had
requisitioned a special general meeting of the action group in order to win
approval for the principle of success fees and to reduce the size of the
com-mittee.
At an occasionally stormy meeting more than 500 Gooda Names - individuals
whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's - offered support for Mr
Michael Deeny, the current chairman who is a rock concert promoter, and nine
other committee members including Mr Tom Benyon, the former Conservative MP.
Mr Raymond Nottage, deputy chairman, said that it was necessary to put the
issue of remuneration for committee members on to the 'back burner so that
we can concentrate on getting ahead with litigation'.
Mr Marland said success fees were necessary to attract well-qualified people
to join.
More than 2,000 Gooda Names are seeking to recover Pounds 394m in insurance
losses in the largest legal action at the Lloyd's insurance market.
Gooda Walker syndicates specialised in catastrophe reinsurance business  -
covering the losses of other Lloyd's syndicates and London companies. Its
losses between 1987 and 1990 are calculated at more than Pounds 900m.
On average Gooda Names face losses of more than Pounds 185,000.
Writs naming 67 Lloyd's members' agents were served earlier this month.
Mr Doll-Steinberg claimed that he had been 'ousted' as chairman and said the
committee would become 'immune from the concerns of the action group'.
He added: 'My main concern has nothing to with receiving remuneration. There
has been a serious breach between the committee and the group.'

FT  18 MAR 93 / Charity account changes are urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNIFICANT changes designed to make charities' accounts more intelligible
were published by a Charity Commission committee yesterday.
The new draft statement of recommended practice - called Sorp 2 - on which
the commission is conducting consultations until May 14, is likely to form
the basis of statutory accounting regulations under the 1992 Charities Act.
The committee concludes that assessing a charity's financial position is
'quite different' from doing the same with a profit-driven business venture.
It says: 'The key issue for the reader of charity accounts is to understand
how incoming resources have been applied and what changes have taken place
in the various funds of the charity during the year.'
It recommends amalgamating the conventional income and expenditure account
with a reconciliation and analysis of the movement of funds, to bring
together in a single statement 'a complete picture which gives a true and
fair view of the charity's activities'.
The committee's draft statement emphasises the need for accounts to address
the adequacy of a charity's resources to meet its commitments.
The draft proposes an expansion of the narrative section of trustees'
reports to ensure that accounts are correctly interpreted.
The statement also suggests changes to the way charities define fundraising,
administration and publicity costs.
Both the Charity Finance Directors' Group and the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations welcomed the draft. But the finance directors are
concerned that the new regulations will not be mandatory for charities that
are registered companies.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Sheffield companies forecast better profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST quarterly economic survey by a north of England chamber of
commerce this year shows a marked increase in business confidence, further
expansion of companies into export markets and a small increase in capital
investment.
Sheffield chamber's survey of 315 companies also suggests there is a
reduction in labour-shedding.
A quarter of companies cut their workforce in the first quarter, but only 12
per cent say they would do so between April and June.
There was also a rise in companies recruiting - 31 per cent compared with 28
per cent in the last quarter of 1992.
The chamber itself reported a 15 per cent rise in the volume of export
documentation processed for member companies last year, most of it for the
dollar-based markets of the US, Middle East and Pacific Rim.
The clearest sign of revival in confidence was that 50 per cent of companies
expected better profits this year, while 60 per cent forecast improved
turnover.
Only 17 per cent of companies expected profits to decline and only 11 per
cent predicted a fall in turnover.
A trend of falling domestic orders in recent quarters seems to have halted,
while one third reported improved sales in the first quarter.
There was also more confidence about making capital investments this year.
But companies are worried about financing recovery.
'Many have concern that some organisations will have problems in obtaining
credit to finance new output,' the chamber says.
'Slow payment is also adding pressure to cashflows, creating more reliance
on banks for funds.' the chamber said.

FT  18 MAR 93 / King's Cross development in turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE biggest inner-city redevelopment scheme in the UK has been thrown back
on the drawing board after Tuesday's announcement that St Pancras is
favoured as the London terminus of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.
The chancellor's announcement has undermined proposals for a Pounds 3bn,
5.25m sq ft office scheme, based on British Rail's proposed low-level
terminus at King's Cross. At the very least, the plans will now have to be
redrawn to take account of tracks that will cross the surface of the site
rather than go underneath it.
The developers are likely to try to salvage an amended scheme. They consider
that it would be a waste of the time and effort already expended to abandon
it completely.
'We are reviewing the position with Camden and British Rail,' said Mr Andrew
Gay, chief executive of London Regeneration Consortium, a joint venture
between NFC, the freight group, and Stanhope and Rosehaugh, a property
company that is in receivership.
However, Camden borough council, which gave qualified planning approval to
the scheme last summer on condition that the railway development went ahead,
is likely to insist that the scheme is fundamentally rethought.
Mr Brian Woodrow, chair of Camden's planning committee, said: 'The original
concept was a Canary Wharf type development which no one will finance.
'It is grossly out of scale with the area. There will be be considerable
support for something more in scale and appropriate in the future.'
Camden's reluctant approval was given in the first place on the grounds that
high-value property development was necessary to justify the cost of
building on top of railway lines; the development had to take place at the
same time as the railway works; and the scheme would bring the community
substantial benefits. These arguments have now been weakened by the change
of plan on the rail terminus.
The planning committee, which was due to meet last night, was expected to
agree to postpone further work on LRC's planning application.
The likely cancellation of the scheme was also welcomed by opponents of the
scheme. 'There is now a possibility of a very different type of
development,' said Mr Colin Macdonald, secretary of the Railway Lands Group,
which favours a community-led, housing-based development.
Many property experts are sceptical about the significance of the new
planning obstacle to the scheme. The huge oversupply of London office space
cast doubt over whether so much office space in a fringe location would ever
be viable.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Increased pollution fines urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAGISTRATES are taking environmental pollution more seriously than in the
past but fines need to be tougher , the pollution inspectorate said
yesterday.
The inspectorate announced in its fifth annual report, published yesterday,
that last year it prosecuted 18 companies, which were fined a total of
Pounds 103,405.
Mr David Slater, chief inspector, described the fine of Pounds 1,650 imposed
this week on Brookridge Timber, a Devon-based timber company, as 'about
right'.
The case was the inspectorate's first successful prosecution under the 1990
Environmental Protection Act. Mr Slater added: 'I would like to see fines
commensurate with the damage caused.'
The inspectorate is starting to implement the act's framework of integrated
pollution control for industry. Companies and environmentalists have
criticised the measures for being too unwieldy and the inspectorate for
being too small.
Mr Slater rejected suggestions that the inspectorate was 'holding up' the
authorisation of British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp nuclear
reprocessing plant at Sellafield.
But he said that the recent series of leaks from the Sellafield site had
been a strain on staff. 'I don't say (the leaks) are not causing us any
resource problems', he said.
Mr Slater plans to deliver the inspectorate's report to ministers in May or
June.
According to the report the inspectorate's income of Pounds 17.3m in the
year to March 1992 was Pounds 6.2m short of the level forecast.
Because of the recession, 'far fewer new (manufacturing) plants' had been
built, Mr Slater said. Applications for new pollution licences under the
act, which were expected to bring in Pounds 5.4m, generated only Pounds
937,000.
But an internal inspectorate report showed that companies often recouped the
costs of prevention equipment within six months.
The inspectorate, however, has not recouped its costs. After expenses of
Pounds 20.7m, it had a Pounds 3m deficit, and in the current year 'we will
still be slightly short of recovering costs', Mr Slater said. The timetable
for new rules on licensing waste management was pushed back by two months to
June, Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said yesterday.
The new rules that a licence holder had to be a 'fit and proper person'  -
part of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act - have been held up because of
'complex and detailed' consultations, he said.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Bid to sue Turkish bank rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 17-MONTH bid by Touche Ross, the administrators of Polly Peck
International, to sue the Central Bank of Turkish Cyprus for Pounds 45m was
rejected yesterday by the Court of Appeal, John Mason writes.
The claim was part of the administrators' attempt to recover between Pounds
400m and Pounds 500m allegedly misappropriated from the collapsed fruit and
electronics group.
Touche Ross had claimed that the bank had knowingly assisted Mr Asil Nadir,
the former Polly Peck chairman, in committing an alleged fraud or had
received the Pounds 45m knowing it was being paid in breach of Mr Nadir's
fiduciary duty to PPI.
Touche Ross had been given permission by the High Court to issue a writ
against the bank in northern Cyprus, outside the jurisdiction of the UK
courts.
However, the appeal court judges ruled that the case was not strong enough
to justify allowing the writ to be served in a foreign country. Touche Ross
said it would seek leave to appeal in the Lords.

FT  18 MAR 93 / OFT hits at error on travel insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday criticised holiday companies for
incorrectly telling customers that the law required them to buy travel
insurance.
The OFT said it had come across several instances of travel agents telling
customers that package holiday regulations which came into force at the
beginning of the year made the purchase of travel insurance compulsory.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said: 'This is not the
case. Although the regulations state that holiday package organisers should
provide information on any optional travel insurance available to their
customers, the regulations do not oblige customers to accept.'
Sir Bryan said that while it was advisable to buy travel insurance,
holidaymakers should shop around, looking at insurance brokers, other travel
agents, or other intermediaries.
However the OFT also said that while holidaymakers had no legal obligation
to buy travel insurance, tour operators were entitled to make it a condition
of their contracts that customers were adequately insured.
The OFT said it was legal for travel companies to insist that customers who
wanted to buy a holiday from them should also buy insurance from them. It is
common for travel companies to insist that customers buy the company's
insurance when offering large discounts on holidays.

FT  18 MAR 93 / 3i to back buy-out of Daf unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's largest venture capital group, 3i, plans to provide financial
backing for a management buy-out of the Leyland Daf van operations in
Birmingham.
The vans plant, which still employs 1,200, is being operated as a going
concern by administrative receivers.
The 3i move was being hailed last night as a significant breakthrough by the
buy-out team, which is being led by managing director Mr Allan Amey.
3i gave no indication of either the form its support is to take, or the size
of the funding likely to be involved.
However, its Birmingham director, Mr Chris Rowlands, said: 'We have
evaluated very closely the plans which the management team has developed and
we are satisfied, subject to further due diligence, that they represent a
viable basis for a successful future.
'We are delighted to commit a substantial package of support alongside other
institutions to help the management team deliver their plans as quickly as
possible.'
There was no immediate indication of which other financial institutions
might be involved, or the terms under which they might participate.
Mr Amey and several fellow directors taking part in the buy-out attempt have
stressed that their business plan requires a long-term commitment from
financial backers, and that they are not interested in surrendering equity
control which could lead to an early sale of the business.
Mr Amey said he was 'confident' that the balance of finance would be in
place to meet a target date in the second half of April for a buy-out to be
completed.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, the Arthur Andersen joint administrative receiver,
yesterday finished setting up the Birmingham operation - which also provides
vehicle body pressings to the Land Rover group and other industry users - as
a distinct, stand-alone business from the Leyland trucks plant and other
activities also in receivership as a result of parent Daf group's collapse.
As part of these arrangements, new franchise agreements have been concluded
with dealers.
Mr David Duggins, Arthur Andersen's partner responsible for the Birmingham
facilities, described the arrangements as 'an important milestone'.
The receivers still regard further job cuts at the plant as inevitable,
however. 'This review is designed to establish the business on a viable
long-term footing. Regrettably, it is likely to result in some further
redundancies,' a spokesman said.
There are still considerable stocks in the system and production will be cut
from about 230 a week to 200. Precisely how many jobs are to go is expected
to be known within the next fortnight.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Firefighters threaten to strike on 1 1/2 % pay limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S 49,000 firefighters yesterday threatened to strike if the
government refuses to fund a pay award calculated under a formula which has
been in force since 1979.
The warning came from Fire Brigades Union leaders after a meeting with Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. Mr Clarke insisted that no exceptions
could be made to the 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit introduced by the
government last November.
Mr Ken Cameron, general secretary of the union, said that if the pay formula
was not honoured then a strike 'looks inevitable'.
The firefighters' pay formula - introduced to settle a damaging nine-week
national strike - works retrospectively each November, linking earnings to
the upper quartile of full-time male manual workers' pay in the government's
annual New Earnings Survey. This year's survey is expected to be published
by early summer.
Mr Clarke told the union that no decision had been taken to do away with the
formula. He emphasised, however, that the government was not a party to it,
as firefighters are employed by local authorities, and the government was
not involved in pay negotiations.
But he added that he could not accept that firefighters should be treated as
an exception to the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit for public-sector
workers.
Mr Charles Nolda, the employers' leading negotiator, said yesterday that
talk of possible strike action by firefighters seven months before their pay
came under review was 'more than a little premature'. He added: 'The fact is
no one will know for many months what the firefighters' pay formula is
likely to show this year.'
Shortly before the introduction of the 1.5 per cent pay limit the
firefighters received a 4.9 per cent wage increase which was calculated
under the formula.

FT  18 MAR 93 / When hacking turns into an obsession: John Mason and Alan
Cane report on the consequences of a teenager's acquittal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IT WOULD be any parent's nightmare
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
an awkward and withdrawn adolescent, unable to form normal friendships,
retreats almost totally into the world of the personal computer.
Instead of carrying on as teenagers usually do, he spends all night in his
bedroom poring over his computer screen, running up enormous telephone bills
 -and hacking into computers run by institutions throughout Europe.
The trial of Paul Bedworth, 19, which ended yesterday with his acquittal on
three charges under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, attracted considerable
public attention for two reasons - the apparent ease with which he bypassed
the security walls built into computer systems containing confidential
material, and because it was the first prosecution under the act.
Using his Pounds 200 BBC computer he set up random dialling programmes to
search out weak spots in computer security systems. Once inside a computer
he used its telephone account to repeat the operation and attempt to breach
another computer system.
The challenge was an intellectual one, confined to the satisfaction of
testing and beating the system. Although he caused problems by overloading
the systems he entered, Paul Bedworth did little actual damage beyond
running up large telephone bills at other people's expense.
He will have embarrassed those institutions whose computers proved fallible,
however. In breaching the security of the Financial Times he obtained entry
to the computer containing all statistical data and share price indices.
Other institutions whose computers he hacked into included the headquarters
of the European Community and the Brussels-based European Organisation for
the Research and Treatment of Cancer.
His prosecution was regarded as a test of the new legislation, brought in
specifically to outlaw hacking. Before the act, prosecutions in hacking
cases meant bringing charges of criminal damage or the theft of electricity.
But the nature of his defence means that questions about the effectiveness
of the new law remain unanswered.
The law requires proof of an intent to modify the system being entered. Mr
Bedworth's defence, supported by expert psychiatric evidence, was that he
had become so obsessed by hacking that it would be impossible to reach any
judgment about his intentions.
In the view of one lawyer the case did not expose any serious hole in the
law. But it did raise questions about how widely such a defence based upon
an obsession could be used successfully against a wide range of other
criminal charges.
Suggestions that Mr Bedworth's acquittal was akin to a 'hackers' charter'
were dismissed by his barristers, Mr Ian Macdonald and Mr Alistair Kelman.
Speaking after the case, Mr Kelman, one of the UK's few barristers with a
profound understanding of computers, said the circumstances were unusual.
Mr Bedworth was a 'second-generation hacker', he said, someone who had grown
up with computers and been damaged by them. 'When a kid's best friend
becomes a computer rather than a member of their family then you are
courting trouble,' he said.
'This law should never be invoked against the most vulnerable members of
society. Mr Bedworth had no option but to follow the dictates of his
illness.'
Computer industry and business leaders were yesterday divided over whether
the Computer Misuse Act was in need of reform.
Mr Gavin Kirkpatrick, chief executive of the British Computer Society, the
organisation for professional computer specialists, said there was a case
for the operation of the Act to be reviewed.
Ms Judith Vincent, head of commercial law at the Confederation of British
Industry, said there was no immediate need to change the law.
The amount of hacking fell each time a case came to court. The act had
raised awareness that hacking was against the law and that hackers could be
prosecuted.
Mr Alan Stanley of the European Security Forum, which includes some of
Europe's largest companies among its members, said it would serve to remind
managers what harm could be done by someone using an inexpensive computer
system.
'I hope this does not become a green light for hacking,' he said. 'It is
possible to do great damage inside a computer system without meaning to.'

FT  18 MAR 93 / Britons' foreign holidays surge to record level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent and ROLAND
ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH took a record number of foreign holidays but fewer vacations
within the UK last year, in spite of the recession and a campaign by the
English Tourist Board to promote seaside resorts.
The number of foreign holidays of four nights or more taken by UK residents
rose by 9 per cent to 21.75m, a survey published yesterday by the British
Tourist Authority shows.
This is the highest number recorded, and compares with the figures of 14.25m
in 1982 and 8.5m in 1972.
The number of UK holidays of four nights or more fell 6 per cent to 32m.
This compares with more than 40m in the mid 1970s.
Holidays in the UK represented 60 per cent of all holidays taken by British
residents last year, compared with 70 per cent in 1982 and 82 per cent in
1972.
The survey found that holidaymakers aged 25-34 and 55-64 are taking fewer
holidays at home. The authority said that 50 per cent of all British
holidays were spent at the seaside.
The average expenditure on a holiday abroad last year was Pounds 547. The
average expenditure on a British holiday was Pounds 140.
The West Country was the most popular UK destination for British tourists,
accounting for 23 per cent of all holidays taken, compared with 24 per cent
in 1991. Scotland accounted for 11 per cent, down 2 percentage points on
1991.
Wales was also the destination of 11 per cent of British holidaymakers, the
same percentage as in 1991.
Fears of a disastrous season last summer in Devon were not borne out by a
review there, Roland Adburgham writes.
Visitor numbers to the county - in terms of tourist nights - fell by more
than 3m (or 5.4 per cent) to 30.4m last year compared with 1991.
The review, which will be submitted tonight to the county council's economy
and employment committee, says the further fall last year reflected a
nationwide decline in the industry brought about by the recession, fear of
unemployment and discounting on foreign holidays.
The worst-hit sector in Devon last year was self-catering, with the
exception of tented camping, which benefited from trading down to cheap
holidays. The review says: 'Surprisingly, the serviced sector in hotels and
guest houses held up well with only a 1.7 per cent decline, although this
has to be considered in relation to a worse performance in 1991.' Hotels
suffered badly in 1991 and the review suggests they did better last year
because rationalisation led to higher occupancy rates for those remaining in
business.
It says there is an urgent need for research, improved training, raising
standards and developing new products.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Hopes boosted by retail sales rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES IN high streets and shopping centres rose marginally last month,
adding to evidence of a cautious recovery in consumer spending.
Official figures issued yesterday showed that retail sales volumes rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent in February compared with January.
The rise was slightly higher than expected and took the year-on-year rate of
increase to 2.4 per cent. There was also an encouraging upward revision to
January's sales. They rose by 2.2 per cent month-on-month compared with a
provisional 1.6 per cent increase.
Since July last year retail sales volumes have risen in every month except
December.
The Central Statistical Office said sales hit an all-time high in the three
months to the end of February.
The improvement in the past three months has not been spread evenly across
the retail sector. While food retailers' sales rose by 3.3 per cent compared
with the same period a year ago, non-food retailers' sales fell by 1.1 per
cent. This was mainly due to a sharp fall in the 'other non-food' category
of retail sales, which includes confectioners, newsagents, off-licences,
booksellers, and toy and sports shops. Sales volumes fell by 6 per cent
compared with the three months to February last year.
Sales of clothing and footwear - which were particularly strong in February
 -and household goods rose 1 per cent and 2 per cent respectively over the
same period.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Firefighters threaten pay strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NATIONAL strike by Britain's 49,000 firefighters was threatened yesterday
if the government refuses to fund a pay award calculated under a formula
which has been in force since 1979.
The warning came from Fire Brigades Union leaders after a meeting with Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. Mr Clarke insisted that no exceptions
could be made to the 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit introduced by the
government last November.
Mr Ken Cameron, general secretary of the FBU, said that if the government
did not honour the pay formula a strike 'looks inevitable'.
The firefighters' pay formula - introduced to settle a damaging nine-week
national strike - works retrospectively each November, linking earnings to
the upper quartile of full-time male manual workers' pay in the government's
annual New Earnings Survey. This year's survey is expected to be published
by early summer.
Mr Clarke told FBU officials that no decision had been taken to do away with
the pay formula.
He emphasised, however, that the government was not a party to it, as
firefighters are employed by local authorities, and the government was not
involved in pay negotiat-ions.
But he said he could not accept that firefighters should be treated as an
exception to the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit for public-sector
workers in the current wage round.
Shortly before the introduction of the pay limit the firefighters received a
4.9 per cent wage increase under the pay formula.
Mr Clarke said any rise for firefighters was a question for the local
authorities, whose funding in the 1993-94 financial year had been calculated
on the assumption that wage increases would not exceed 1.5 per cent.
He said that the employers' side of the national joint council for the fire
service had said it was too early to decide what pay level the formula might
produce in November 1993 and they did not intend to negotiate in advance.
'Funding for local authorities for 1994-95 will clearly need to be
determined in the light of economic circumstances later in the year,' Mr
Clarke said.
'The firefighters will not know whether or not they have a dispute until
November 1994, when the pay settlement for that year is decided. We cannot
have a dispute now about what might or might not happen then.'
Mr Cameron said 28 resolutions on pay had been sent in for debate at the
FBU's annual conference, which is to be held in May.
He said he believed that a resolution threatening strike action over pay
would be carried unless the government intervened.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Delors takes a gamble in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, has taken a gamble in
pressing for a meeting with President Bill Clinton in Washington today.
The Frenchman's feelings about America have always been ambiguous, a mixture
of envy and admiration. With trade disputes simmering on aviation and steel
subsidies, and now on Buy America/Buy European legislation in government
procurement and telecommunications, some of Mr Delors' fears about Big
Brother appear to be coming true.
If the US carries out its threat to block European companies from certain
federal contracts next Monday, it will look like a calculated snub.
In Brussels yesterday, EC officials remained unsure if Mr Delors, 67,
intends to show the charm which at times wrong-footed Mrs Margaret Thatcher,
the former UK prime minister, or whether he might repeat his recent remark
about Mr Clinton's 'need to preen in front of the mirror to make sure that
his muscles are still firm'.
The White House meeting was long planned, although at one stage a miffed Mr
Delors was told he could have only 15 minutes, according to one EC official.
Delicate negotiations have apparently succeeded in extending the session to
90 minutes, offering him a chance to present his most important message to
Washington: whatever its present economic and political difficulties, the
European Community must be treated as an equal.
Mr Delors never quite managed to persuade the Bush administration of this,
even at the high point of his powers in the late 1980s, when he pushed
through the single European market and laid the groundwork on European
monetary and political union in the Maastricht treaty. Although the US
briefly treated Maastricht with a reverence extended to the Philadelphia
convention, the Bush administration soon realised that talk of an emerging
European superstate was premature.
In Brussels, all talk now is of a fresh start in transatlantic relations
built on the two leaders' common political outlook, which ranges from
environmental and industrial policy to a mistrust of the free-market
deregulation of the 1980s.
More tentatively, EC officials mention common humble roots: Mr Delors rose
from peasant stock to become mayor of the Parisian suburb of Clichy and
finance minister in the first Mitterrand government, while Mr Clinton's
escape from Hope, Arkansas, is already the stuff of American folklore.
Yet differences remain. Despite his intellectual prowess, Mr Delors remains
instinctively suspicious of the US. His behaviour in the Gatt trade talks is
characteristic: even if charges that he is a surrogate of a protectionist
French government are wide of the mark, the man known as Mr Europe still
explodes at what he sees as the US tendency to bully, notably on farm trade.
Last October, at the height of the Gatt negotiations, Mr Delors did a
passable imitation of Charles de Gaulle when he declared: 'If Europe is to
become adult, it must be able to say No to Big Brother.'
It is fashionable to speak of him as a spent force at the European
Commission, where his mandate runs out next year. But General Jacques
believes there may be life after Brussels, and is quietly plotting a
re-entry into French politics, where some think he is the likeliest man of
the left to beat a right-winger in a presidential election.
That would be in 1995. If Mr Delors were to achieve the improbable, he would
be seeing a lot more of Mr Clinton. Perhaps that is why insiders say they
would dearly like Mr Delors to drop his less than perfect English and let
rip en francais through an interpreter; but so far they are too afraid to
ask.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Boston reels at papal posting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE city of Boston was thoroughly flabbergasted on Tuesday night when Mr
Raymond Flynn, its mayor for the past 10 years, announced he was to be the
next US ambassador to the Vatican.
There had been no hint in the days before St Patrick's Day that the popular
Mr Flynn - Boston-Irish, liberal, Catholic and an opponent of abortion -
would be so honoured or was thinking of leaving in the middle of his third
term.
Most local speculation had centred naturally enough on who was to become the
next ambassador to Dublin, a nomination long expected to mark the visit to
the White House yesterday of Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister.
Another woman with impeccable political credentials, though no formal career
in politics, is also widely expected to get the plum embassy in Paris: Mrs
Pamela Harriman, English-born widow of the US statesman Averell Harriman,
former wife of Mr Randolph Churchill, and mother of Mr Winston Churchill,
the Conservative member of parliament.
The London embassy, like Paris, is normally reserved for political
patronage. But it is widely believed Mr Raymond Seitz, the first
professional US ambassador to the Court of St James, has been asked to stay
on for at least another year.
Another important embassy, Tokyo, also seems to have been earmarked: for Mr
Richard Holbrooke, an Asian expert in President Jimmy Carter's State
Department.

FT  18 MAR 93 / US envoy to step up pressure on Haiti leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is increasing the pressure on Haiti by sending an
envoy to tell the army leaders, who took power in a coup 18 months ago, that
his patience with them is running out.
The president fears a flood of Haitians seeking asylum unless the political
crisis in Haiti is resolved and Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president who
was overthrown and sent into exile by the army, returns to office.
Mr Clinton's decision was announced after a meeting on Tuesday with Mr
Aristide. But the US president refused to announce a deadline for his return
to office.
Diplomats in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, yesterday said the military
leaders, and the small but affluent elite which backs them, were unlikely to
be moved either by a message from Mr Clinton or by Mr Aristide's moderation
of his conditions for a return to office.
The intervention by Mr Clinton is the strongest statement yet by a US
president in support of efforts to end the political crisis in the Caribbean
state of 7m people.
Earlier efforts to reinstall Mr Aristide, including an economic blockade of
Haiti, have failed, and Mr Aristide has questioned the willingness of the US
and other countries to press the coup leaders out of office.
Envoys in Port-au-Prince say, however, that the country's rulers have
established sufficient economic supply lines to allow them to continue
defying efforts to have Mr Aristide returned. They expect little change
after the visit by Mr Clinton's envoy.
But Mr Clinton is backing his initiative with support for a proposed Dollars
1bn (Pounds 700m) development fund for Haiti from international financial
institutions, to be spread over five years after the elected government is
restored. This promise of significant aid for the economically distressed
country could bring increased popular pressure on the military rulers, who
have traditionally reacted ruthlessly and violently to dissent.
The renewed pressure against the army leaders also coincides with the return
to the country this week of Mr Dante Caputo, a former foreign minister of
Argentina and now a special UN envoy who has been trying to broker a
resolution of the political crisis.

FT  18 MAR 93 / US industrial production up by 4.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INDUSTRIAL activity continued to grow at a strong pace last month as
inflation remained steady, feeding hopes of a sustained economic recovery.
The US Federal Reserve Board said industrial production rose by 0.4 per cent
in February, the fifth month in succession in which it has increased. Output
showed a 4.3 per cent gain over the past 12 months, the Fed reported.
Despite a dip in output of motor vehicles, production of consumer goods rose
0.6 per cent in the month to a level 5.3 per cent higher than a year ago,
while a 0.3 per cent monthly gain left production of business equipment 8.2
per cent up over the past 12 months.
Excluding motor vehicles and parts, output of consumer goods rose 0.8 per
cent in February and output of business equipment 0.5 per cent.
Factories and plants operated at 79.9 per cent of capacity in February, the
highest rate for 18 months, the Fed said.
At the same time, the Commerce Department said the consumer price index
climbed by 0.3 per cent in February, taking the year-on-year inflation rate
a notch lower to 3.2 per cent.
Excluding volatile energy and food prices, prices increased by 0.5 per cent,
taking this core rate of inflation higher to 3.6 per cent year-on-year and
prompting some concern about a revival of inflationary pressures.
But economists said much of the rise was attributable to a predictable
increase after seasonal adjustment in clothes prices, caused by retailers
starting their sales much earlier than usual and having little room left to
offer further discounts, as they would usually do in February.
'We believe overall material costs remain moderate. Overall, we expect
inflation to average just 2.8 per cent in 1993 compared to 3.0 per cent in
1992,' said Wall Street brokerage company Merrill Lynch.
The twin towers of the World Trade Centre, shut by a bomb that destroyed
communications and safety systems, will start to reopen today ahead of
schedule, officials announced yesterday, Reuter reports from New York.
New York state Governor Mario Cuomo, who has an office in the building, will
today be the first tenant to return. Others will return tomorrow, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages the complex, said. The
Authority had previously set an April 1 target for reopening the towers. The
bomb blast in a car park on February 26 killed six people.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Salvador amnesty for war criminals
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EL SALVADOR'S congress is set to amnesty all those named by a special United
Nations commission as responsible for war crimes and other human rights
abuses during the country's decade-long civil war. The commission said the
vast majority of abuses were committed by the army, or death squads linked
to it.
An ally of the right-wing Arena party is expected to introduce the
legislation today. Arena and its allies control the congress.
Opposition parties are linking support for the amnesty to implementation of
the main UN recommendations, such as dismissal of the Supreme Court, and
removal of military officers responsible for abuses.
In Washington, Congressman Robert Torricelli, chairman of the sub-committee
on the western hemisphere, accused the Reagan administration of lying about
the role of the Salvadoran army in the atrocities, and he would consider
whether Reagan officials committed perjury in testimony on El Salvador
before the US Congress. El Salvador's government received Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 4.2bn) in US aid in the 1980s.
The UN Commission catalogued numerous crimes committed by the army,
including that there was substantial proof that General Emilio Ponce, the
defence minister who resigned on Friday, and other senior officers planned
the murder of six Jesuit priests in 1989.

THE city of Boston was thoroughly gobsmacked on Tuesday night when Mr
Raymond Flynn, its mayor for the past 10 years, announced he was to be the
next US ambassador to the Vatican.
There had been no hint in the days before St Patrick's Day that the popular
Mr Flynn - Boston-Irish, liberal, Catholic and an opponent of abortion -
would be so honoured or was thinking of leaving in the middle of his third
term.
Most local speculation had centred naturally enough on who was to become the
next ambassador to Dublin, a nomination long expected to mark the visit to
the White House yesterday of Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister.
President Bill Clinton confirmed most rumours by announcing he had chosen
Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of Senator Edward Kennedy.
Another woman with impeccable political credentials, though no formal career
in politics, is also widely expected to get the plum embassy in Paris. This
is Mrs Pamela Harriman, English-born widow of the US statesman Averell
Harriman, former wife of Mr Randolph Churchill, and mother of Mr Winston
Churchill, the Conservative member of parliament.
Mrs Harriman is a great Washington and international socialite, long a
prominent Democratic party fundraiser and an early supporter of Mr Clinton.
She speaks French and is widely reckoned to possess a political acumen to
match her considerable charm.
The Paris embassy, like London's, is normally reserved for political
patronage and Mrs Harriman was rumoured at one stage to be in line to be
ambassador in the country of her birth. She always denied this, expressing a
preference to stay in Washington.
It is also now widely believed that Mr Raymond Seitz, the first professional
ever to be US ambassador to the Court of St James, has been asked to stay on
in his present post for at least another year.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Democrat leaders defend budget plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress began debating President Bill Clinton's budget proposals
yesterday amid a last-minute struggle by Democratic leaders to preserve the
plan against pressure for more cuts in spending.
The leadership appeared confident of winning passage, in votes expected
today, of a budget resolution that would cut the deficit by a total of
Dollars 510bn (Pounds 359bn) over the next five years through a combination
of spending cuts and tax rises.
'There is a substantial majority within the caucus to enact the package,'
said Mr Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Some party leaders were concerned, however, about pressure from conservative
Democrats, especially in the Senate, for cuts in the Dollars 16.3bn
short-term stimulus package that Mr Clinton proposes as an accompanying
measure.
The budget resolution, which does not get into the details of which
programmes would be cut, has already been considerably modified from the
initial plan laid out last month.
Echoing public enthusiasm for a serious attempt to tackle the federal budget
deficit, members insisted on Dollars 63bn of additional spending cuts over
five years. The resulting plan is expected to cut the budget deficit to
Dollars 183.6bn in 1997, compared with a target of Dollars 206bn in the
Clinton plan and a forecast of Dollars 322bn if policies remained unchanged.
But details of the spending cuts would have to be debated in a later budget
reconciliation bill, when support might start to coalesce behind individual
spending programmes now pencilled in for cuts.
The House is expected to debate one or two substitute budget resolutions
offered by the Republican minority, as well as an alternative proposed by
the congressional Black Caucus, which would make deeper cuts in defence to
pay for increased spending in areas such as education.
It remained unclear yesterday morning, however, how many amendments the
powerful rules committee would allow to be brought up.

<TEXT>
MR DEREK KEYS, the South African finance minister, yesterday presented a
tough budget aimed at restoring fiscal discipline while boosting economic
growth.
Presenting his first budget, Mr Keys sharply cut the corporate tax rate,
from 48 to 40 per cent, in an attempt to promote investment and spur growth
after four years of recession. He clawed back part of the concession by
imposing a 15 per cent tax on distributed profits.
However, the net effect will be sharply to cut the effective tax rate for
most companies, a key element of the economic restructuring plan published
by Mr Keys last week. Companies which reinvest a large proportion of profits
will enjoy a substantial tax incentive.
Business leaders welcomed the attempt by Mr Keys, former chairman of the
mining house Gencor, to balance the need for fiscal discipline with the
imperative of promoting growth. Government current spending is to be cut
substantially in real terms - another important element of the restructuring
 -with the spending increase held to 6.5 per cent against projected
inflation of 10 per cent. Defence spending is to fall by some 14 per cent in
real terms, its fourth successive sharp annual decline.
Total spending will rise to R114bn, an increase of 8.8 per cent on 1992-93,
with revenue rising 16.5 per cent to R89bn, leaving a deficit equivalent to
6.8 per cent of gross domestic product. This remains high, but represents a
substantial drop from last year's 8.6 per cent deficit.
Consumers will suffer under the budget, which was delivered against a
difficult political background as the transition to democracy fuels popular
demands. VAT was increased from 10 to 14 per cent, which drew immediate
criticism from the African National Congress, despite the fact that certain
basic foodstuffs were zero-rated in an attempt to mitigate its impact on the
poor.
Dr Conrad Strauss, chairman of the Standard Bank group, commended the
company tax initiative as 'very pyschologically important' and the curb
placed on state spending.
Retailers, however, expressed concern. Mr Raymond Ackerman, chairman of Pick
'n Pay, the country's largest supermarket group, said the consumer would be
'hit between the eyes', business confidence damaged and economic recovery
delayed.

South Korea's new government is delaying plans to deregulate most interest
rates until the second half of the year, writes John Burton in Seoul.
Mr Hong Jae-hyong, finance minister, said this was because deregulation
could increase interest rates and further slow economic growth.
He said the government might instead cut the central bank's key lending
rates for the second time in three months to stimulate the economy.
It will decide whether to deregulate interest rates after reviewing economic
growth during the second quarter.

FT  18 MAR 93 / North Korea's sabre in danger of becoming blunt: John Burton
reports on Pyongyang's fear of losing its military advantage as Seoul
increases defence spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE North Korean guards at the truce village of Panmunjom are wearing steel
helmets rather than their normal military caps. The country has sealed its
borders to foreign visitors, while a dusk-to-dawn blackout has been declared
for the capital Pyongyang.
Even as North Korea goes on a 'semi-war' footing in response to military
exercises in South Korea, the sabre it is rattling is large but in danger of
becoming blunt.
Although North Korea outnumbers South Korea in troops and weapons, its
advantage is being eroded as more and better weapons are acquired by the
South, which has doubled defence spending since 1986 as its economy rapidly
expands.
The military balance between the two Koreas has reached the point where
neither side could gain a decisive victory on its own, although South Korea
has the advantage of being able to call on the support of the US military if
war should ever break out.
North Korea is believed to be developing a nuclear weapon as a relatively
cheap alternative to counter the South's growing military ability.
Less publicised have been claims that North Korea is also developing an
extensive arsenal of biological and chemical weapons, which Seoul believes
Pyongyang wants to use as a strategic bargaining chip in negotiations with
the South.
North Korea has the fourth largest armed forces in the world, with 1.3m men
under arms, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
With a population of 22m, this makes North Korea the most militarised
country in the world.
The South Korean military is almost half its size with 633,000 soldiers out
of a population of 43m.
North Korea also enjoys a clear quantitative advantage in weaponry against
the South, with a two-to-one ratio in tanks, artillery, and combat aircraft
and the exclusive possession of attack submarines, the third largest fleet
in Asia.
North Korea has built up an extensive arms industry in the past 20 years. It
can produce most of its armoured equipment, naval surface vessels and
submarines, while it has developed an indigenous version of the medium-range
Scud missile.
Weapons have become one of North Korea's main exports, particularly Scuds to
Syria and Iran, although it is estimated that Pyongyang suffers an overall
arms trade deficit. But its greatest weakness lies in its combat aircraft
and other sophisticated military equipment. Two-thirds of its jet fighters
date from the Korean War era and it depended on the former Soviet Union for
the supply of high-performance fighters.
But relations have cooled between Pyongyang and Moscow in the post-Cold War
period. Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced last November that Moscow
would halt arms shipments to North Korea, shutting off the supply of
advanced MiG-29 fighters that Pyongyang was just beginning to acquire.
North Korea's pursuit of a self-sufficient defence structure has placed an
enormous burden on the economy. As much as 30 per cent of gross national
product is devoted to defence against 5 per cent in South Korea.
Growing economic problems, including difficulties in importing oil due to a
lack of hard currency, are also believed to be affecting North
Korea'smilitary readiness.
The US estimates that training time for North Korean pilots is decreasing
because of the fuel shortage. There are also eyewitness reports that North
Korea is using soldiers and military vehicles for civil construction
projects due to economic problems.
A lack of hard currency will severely curb the purchase of military
equipment and even spare parts from abroad, although North Korea might be
able to get some supplies from the Middle East in exchange for Scud
missiles.
Nonetheless, North Korea remains a serious threat to the South. The US
estimates that 65 per cent of North Korean forces are stationed along the
demilitarised zone (DMZ) and could launch an attack without much warning.
Although the US has based its military planning on the premise that North
Korea can support a war using its own resources for up to three months,
independent analysts believe that Pyongyang could face difficulties much
earlier due to its inefficient industrial base and poor transport
infrastructure.
North Korea would probably follow the strategy it used in 1950, when it last
attacked South Korea, by initially aiming to capture Seoul, just 35 miles
from the DMZ, according to the US Defense Department.
But in most other respects, circumstances have changed greatly since 1950.
North Korea then was tempted to invade because the South was suffering from
domestic political turmoil, its army was weak and inexperienced, and the US
had no troops in the country. Moreover, North Korea has the support of the
Soviet Union and China. None of those conditions exist today.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Japanese unearth perils of G7 summit: Domestic politicking
and the Russian question are upsetting Tokyo's plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN IS desperately trying to defend the centrepiece of its political year,
the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations due to
be held in July.
The summit is supposed to be a meticulously planned display of Japan's
ability to command a larger role in international affairs. In the absence of
a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, the G7 is Japan's
best hope of acquiring such a role.
But Japanese diplomacy will be tested to the full if the summit is to mark a
smooth beginning for Japan's wider role.
A complicating factor is Japanese domestic politics. Mr Michio Watanabe, the
foreign minister, is in failing health and had to go into hospital after a
recent trip to the US. Mr Watanabe wants to use a carefully managed summit
as a launch pad for his last attempt to become prime minister, replacing Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa in Liberal Democratic party leadership elections in the
autumn.
The summit was always likely to be tricky because Japan is renegotiating its
relationship with the US, which has guided its foreign policy for four
decades.
Japan's growing trade surplus will provoke further calls from the Clinton
administration for a stimulus to the Japanese economy to boost demand for
imports as well as measures to open up Japanese markets.
Mr Miyazawa will visit Washington next month to mollify the Clinton team
with an outline economic package. But that will be just the start of
potentially fractious trade negotiations which could cast a shadow over the
summit. As a senior diplomat put it: 'There is a crunch coming with the US
on trade and we better wake up to that fact.'
However, in the past two weeks the mounting Russian political crisis has
threatened to wreck all of Tokyo's carefully laid summit plans.
Tokyo's deeply ingrained sense of protocol has been offended by European
calls, led by the French, for an emergency summit on the Russian crisis. Mr
Yohei Kono, the cabinet secretary, yesterday bluntly told Paris to stop
trying to hijack the summit. It was Tokyo's job to issue invitations, he
said.
Even if Japan's summit partners accept that an April meeting of foreign and
finance ministers will suffice, it still risks becoming isolated if the
Russian crisis gathers momentum.
Japan has conspicuously failed to echo German and US messages of support for
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The unresolved dispute with Russia over the
four islands off the northern tip of Japan, known as the Kuriles or Northern
Territories, is only one factor behind Japan's reluctance.
Japanese officials argue that the Russian economy is in such a dire state
that further aid would be like pouring money down the drain. They say half
the aid Japan has so far provided has not been disbursed, largely because of
Russian bureaucratic chaos. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for
international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry,
remarked: 'We should fully disburse the Dollars 24bn aid agreed by the G7
last year before we agree more aid.'
Japan's Export-Import Bank said yesterday it was disbursing a Dollars 100m
(Pounds 70.4m) soft loan to help Russia buy food and medicines from Japanese
companies, fulfilling a pledge made in December 1990, after receiving
letters of guarantee from Moscow.
Mr Yeltsin's sudden decision to cancel a trip to Japan last autumn, but then
to visit South Korea and India, has merely hardened opposition to further
help to him among the elderly upper echelons of the LDP.
But even younger officials believe Japan should avoid taking sides in
political disputes in other countries.
As an international official in the Finance Ministry put it: 'A message of
support for Mr Yeltsin would not be welcomed by Mr Khasbulatov.' Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, the speaker of the Russian parliament, is Mr Yeltsin's rival
for power.
Japan's diplomats, led by the highly skilled Mr Hisashi Owada, the head of
the Foreign Ministry, who is in Washington for talks, are trying to paper
over the emerging cracks. But if they fail Japan faces the prospect of
hosting a summit at which it appears to be isolated. At the least, Japan's
stance on Russia may further distance it from Europe at a time when trade
tensions with the EC are rising.
At the worst, Japan may be accused of fumbling during a crucial phase of the
Russian crisis, mishandling a golden opportunity to take an international
initiative on Russia which would be widely welcomed, and once again showing
that it often only acts when foreign pressure on it becomes irresistible.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Hong Kong greets Patten with a very Asian smile: Simon
Holberton samples views on UK row with China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, was laying down
the law about Hong Kong in Beijing yesterday afternoon, Mr Chris Patten, the
colony's governor, was out and about indulging in what he likes to call 'a
little retail therapy'.
In the streets of Hong Kong's central business district and the neighbouring
Western district of Hong Kong island Mr Patten was greeted by hundreds of
Hong Kong citizens.
'Hello, how are you?' he called out. They cheered, laughed and smiled.
But the Asian smile is a deceptive thing. To many ordinary Hong Kong
citizens the developments of the past few days are perplexing and troubling.
Happy as they were to see their governor, many have found his behaviour
toward China baffling at best, and unwise at worst.
Reaction to Mr Patten's decision last Friday to publish his legislation for
more democracy in Hong Kong may have been more than a little conditioned by
China's adverse reaction. But then it is Hong Kong which will have to live
with its northern neighbour in four year's time.
As the owner of a trading firm in Western said yesterday: 'Democracy is an
empty word. The British will go after 1997; Mr Patten is just giving Hong
Kong people a cheque that will bounce.'
His view was echoed by a businessman who had earlier stopped on Hollywood
Road, in Central, to catch a glimpse of the governor. 'The British have been
sleeping for more than 100 years. Why democracy now? The row is hurting Hong
Kong, but what does he have to lose? He will leave.'
On Queen's Road Central, Mr Patten found himself accosted by a group of
democrats holding a banner proclaiming 'Hear the voice of Hong Kong
democracy' and chanting: 'Submit the bill to the Legislative Council; Resume
Sino-British Talks; Hear the voice of Hong Kong.'
Their chanting, however, summed up the central dilemma for British policy
makers and Chinese ones too. Hong Kong wants a number of mutually exclusive
things. It wants more democracy, but it wants Britain and China to work it
out together; in its almost deferential way it wants to be heard by both,
and it wants a quiet life.
A lot of middle-class people in Hong Kong have decided that China will not
listen and that the colony is not a place where they can enjoy a quiet life.
Last year 66,000 of them emigrated, mostly to the US, Canada and Australia,
up from 60,000 in 1991.
The row is also sapping the optimism of many who thought they had made their
peace with China and 1997. The finance director of a large Chinese company,
aged in his mid-40s, explained the reaction of many of his friends.
'Over the past couple of years we had all decided to stay. China was moving
in the right direction; the Basic Law (the mini-constitution, published in
1990 by Beijing, for Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese sovereignty)
wasn't perfect but it was OK. Now, with the way China has reacted to Patten,
a lot of my friends are saying they can't take four more years of this. They
would rather take their families elsewhere and live a quiet life.'
A Hong Kong Chinese lawyer, who had emigrated to Canada but was thinking of
returning to live in Hong Kong said: 'Maybe Patten has done us all a favour.
He has made China show its true face.'
The tone and substance of Mr Lu's remarks in Beijing yesterday make it
unlikely that Britain and China will be able to discuss the arrangements for
Hong Kong's 1995 elections. That being so, Mr Patten is likely to table his
legislation before LegCo's Easter recess or soon thereafter.
The betting in Hong Kong's political circles last night was that LegCo will
do its best to give China what Beijing failed to extract from the British in
negotiations, in short make the legislation less democratic than Mr Patten
has proposed. The majority in LegCo for Mr Patten is getting slimmer and the
group which wants to hasten slowly to more democracy is getting larger.
Britain is prepared to accept LegCo's verdict, but how China would respond
is unclear. Beijing has always said it will not accept a 'made in LegCo'
compromise to its dispute with Britain. It has maintained that LegCo is
simply an 'advisory body' of little consequence and that the 1995 polls are
a matter for the current and future sovereign powers.
In the meantime, Hong Kong's HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 16bn) airport, the
development of its container port, and many other business franchises will
be put on hold.
As Mr Ronald Arculli, a leading member of Hong Kong's conservative
politicians, noted last night: 'Maybe they will agree to disagree on
politics and continue talks about economic issues, but I think the chances
are pretty slim.'

<TEXT>
JAPANESE manufacturers' capital investment will fall by 12.9 per cent in the
year to March 1994, after a drop of 15.5 per cent in the 12 months to the
end of this month, according to a wide-ranging survey published yesterday by
the Japan Development Bank.
This will the first time since 1971-72 that manufacturing investment has
fallen by more than 2 per cent in two consecutive years. Non-manufacturing
capital expenditure, excluding the electricity utilities, will fall by 3.4
per cent next year, the first drop since 1975, according to the survey of
2,343 large companies.
The JDB survey underlines the scale of the cuts in investment being planned
by companies, especially in manufacturing, as they attempt to slash costs to
raise profitability.
The survey found capital in-vestment in all industries will fall by about
4.7 per cent in the year to the end of this month and by 5.6 per cent next
year.

EFFORTS TO persuade North Korea to allow further nuclear inspections will be
stepped up today at a special board meeting of the International Atomic
Energy Agency in Vienna, writes David White, Defence Correspondent.
The meeting of the agency's 35 governors follows North Korea's announcement
last week of withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and
tension over the Team Spirit US-South Korean military exercises.
Mr Hans Blix, IAEA director-general, will report on North Korea's refusal
last month to allow inspection of two sites near its Yongbyon nuclear
complex. Evidence from earlier inspections raised suspicions that the
country might have separated more plutonium, usable for nuclear weapons,
than the tiny amount it has declared.
An IAEA official said a North Korean representative might attend the
meeting.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Beijing's sound and fury may well signify something

<TEXT>
IT IS perhaps the beleaguered Mr Chris Patten's misfortune that the unseemly
row that has erupted over his plans for democratic reforms in Hong Kong came
on the eve of an important session of the National People's Congress,
China's rubber-stamp parliament.
In this hothouse atmosphere, Chinese leaders appear to have sought to outbid
each other in their criticism of the colony's governor, and in the process a
good deal of sound and fury has been heard, signifying less perhaps than
assails the senses; although there is no question that the diplomatic row is
beginning to assume worrying proportions.
Among slightly ominous developments was the revival yesterday by China's
senior official responsible for Hong Kong affairs, Mr Lu Ping, of proposals
for a 'new kitchen' to deal with Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule in
1997. This was interpreted by some as indicating that Beijing was
considering a shadow authority to co-ordinate steps towards China's takeover
of the colony, although another and perhaps more plausible explanation was
that he was merely talking about a 'fresh start' after Britain's withdrawal.
'When we say we will start a new kitchen we only mean that we will construct
a new kitchen in accordance with the design of the Basic Law,' the urbane Mr
Lu told several hundred reporters.
The Basic Law, approved by China's parliament in April 1990, is in effect a
blueprint for the constitution of the Hong Kong 'Special Administrative
Region' after 1997. It deals specifically with such issues as the shape of
government and legislature, and complements a Joint Declaration signed by
London and Beijing in 1984 that covers the transfer of sovereignty over Hong
Kong.
China's claim that Mr Patten's plans for relatively broad-based democratic
elections in 1994 and 1995 contradict understandings reached with London is
hotly contested by British officials. But there is no doubt that Beijing
fears that these elections will yield a rump of bothersome representatives
who would be sitting in Hong Kong's Legislative Council after 1997.
This is not the well-equipped 'kitchen' Beijing had in mind when it drafted
the Basic Law, hence Mr Lu's threat to construct a new one. Chinese
officials have been insisting that their argument with Mr Patten is not over
an extension of democracy, but one of principle. Cynics might observe: the
Chinese would say that, wouldn't they?
But it is also true that once Beijing takes a stand on principle, even if,
in the view of some, these principles may have peculiarly Chinese
characteristics, resolution of the dispute becomes much trickier. The fact
that this week two of China's most senior leaders have joined very publicly
and vehemently in the argument will also not make things easier to unravel.
In Beijing, British officials seem at a loss to predict where the issue may
go from here. No early diplomatic contacts are scheduled, and with each
passing day circumstances appear to become more complex. There is little
sign of China easing up in its criticism of Mr Patten, and Chinese anger is
likely to intensify if and when he introduces his democracy-extending
legislation to the Legislative Council for debate.
British officials are drawing some comfort from the fact that Mr Lu repeated
China's wish to co-operate over the transition to Chinese rule and his
insistence that Beijing would continue to honour agreements over Hong Kong.
They expressed the hope that Beijing and London could sit down and resolve
their differences, but the chances of this happening while Mr Patten's
reform bill remains on the table are slim. The sound and fury seem unlikely
to abate for the time being.

reshuffle in which 20 of the 35 ministers were removed from office,
including the three main economic ministers.
Mr Saleh Afiff, former head of the National Development Planning Agency
(Bappenas), has been appointed co-ordinating minister for the economy,
replacing Mr Radius Prawiro. Also removed from office were Mr J B Sumarlin,
finance minister, and Dr Adrianus Mooy, governor of Bank Indonesia.
All three were western educated, on good terms with donors such as the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and Christian, notable in a country
with an 87 per cent Moslem population.
The new finance minister is Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, former director general of
tax, while Mr J. Sudradjat Djiwandono, previously the junior minister of
trade, has been named central bank governor.

CHINA'S attempt to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade made
little headway during three days of talks with trading partners ending
yesterday, Frances Williams writes from Geneva. More talks are scheduled for
the end of May but early resumption of membership now looks improbable.
'There's no great enthusiasm to work rapidly' towards Chinese membership,
said one European official. Beijing appeared to have hardened its opposition
to a special safeguards clause in its membership terms which would protect
trading partners from sudden import surges.

FT  18 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Combatants square up over chips deal -
Whether it is a deal is itself in question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US and Japanese trade officials and industry executives meet in Hawaii on
Sunday to review progress on semiconductor trade. Tensions are high on both
sides.
The talks could be a watershed in a dispute that has tarnished US-Japan
trade relations for the past decade. They are the first formal meetings
between US and Japanese trade officials since President Bill Clinton took
office.
At issue is foreign access to the Dollars 20bn Japanese market for these
crucial components - sometimes known as 'chips' - in modern electronic
circuits. After long and heated negotiations, the US and Japan drew up a
bilateral 'arrangement' on semiconductor trade in 1986. With no substantive
changes on the market access issue, the pact was renewed for five years in
1991, giving Japan more time to achieve increased imports.
A deadline was set for the end of 1992, by which time the Japanese
government agreed that 'the expectation of the US semiconductor industry
that the foreign market share will grow to more than 20 per cent of the
Japanese market' should be achieved. Japan 'considers that this can be
realised,' the agreement stated.
The market share data for the final quarter of 1992 are due to be released
in the next two days. They will set the tone for the trade talks.
Already, industry and government officials in both countries have
acknowledged that it is unlikely that the 20 per cent 'expectation' will be
met. In the third quarter of 1992 the foreign market share reached 15.9 per
cent, its highest level since the signing of the 1986 agreement, when it
stood at 8 per cent.
Another increase of one or two percentage points is expected in the
fourth-quarter data. It might even be higher, some suggest, because the size
of the Japanese market declined last year as sales of consumer electronics
products slowed.
However, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said last week that
he would regard anything less than 20 per cent market share as 'serious, a
commitment not kept'.
'And we would begin our discussions from that point. A deal is a deal,' he
said.
Japanese government and industry officials argue that they have kept their
side of the bargain. The Electronics Industry Association of Japan (EIAJ)
notes that since 1986 foreign market share has doubled and that sales of
foreign-made semiconductors in Japan more than tripled to over Dollars 3bn
in 1991.
There has also been a significant increase in the establishment of long-term
relationships between US chip suppliers and Japanese customers and in the
number of 'design-ins' - when US chips are designed into prototype Japanese
products.
'We believe that in view of the increase in imports and the number of
alliances and design-ins, the US-Japan semiconductor co-operation effort has
got to be one of the most successful trade agreements the US has,' says Mr
Koji Matsui, deputy director of the industrial electronics division of the
ministry of trade and industry (Miti).
There is rising resentment in Japan over what is seen as abuse by the US of
the market share issue. The US industry has used market data to distort the
true meaning of the trade agreement, Japanese industry officials contend.
The 1991 agreement clearly states that 'the two governments agree that (the
20 per cent expectation) constitutes neither a guarantee, a ceiling nor a
floor on the foreign market share', the Japanese point out.
US officials maintain, however, that market share numbers provide a measure
of progress that has been invaluable in maintaining pressure on Japan to
keep up its efforts to increase market access. The Clinton administration
plans to include similar 'temporary quantitative indicators' in future trade
pacts.
At the talks in Hawaii, the US is expected to propose a market share target
beyond 1992. 'We are not going away until that number is achieved,' says Mr
Andrew Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the
US industry trade group. 'Our goal is to achieve a minimum of 20 per cent of
the Japanese market on an ongoing basis.'
The Japanese, however, will strongly resist any new market share goals, says
Mr Stan Anderson, Washington lobbyist for the EIAJ. 'It would be very, very
difficult for the Japanese side to ever accept another numerical goal of any
kind because the SIA has misused the clear language of the arrangement so
often,' he says.
'The Japanese delegation will go to Hawaii with the objective of trying to
convince the US that it remains committed to implementing all aspects of the
agreement,' Mr Anderson says.
'We are going to Hawaii to hear what the number is,' responds Mr Procassini,
'to see what response the US government will have and, if asked, to discuss
it with the US government. We are only concerned about a measure of openness
of the Japanese market, and that is 20 per cent market share.'
It is clear that the US semiconductor industry has the sympathies of the
Clinton administration. 'We must be prepared to act,' Mr Ron Brown, the
commerce secretary told a meeting of the SIA in Washington last month. 'We
must see to it that agreements are kept, even if it takes hard-nosed
head-knocking on our part.'

JAPAN will vigorously resist any pressure to accept further market share
targets or any other numerical measure of market openness, a senior official
at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said yesterday.
Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, director general of Miti's international trade policy
bureau, said Japan was not in a position to accept proposals from the US to
grant a specific market share for a product because Japan was 'not a
state-planned economy'.
Mr Okamatsu's remarks come as the US and Japan prepared for government-level
talks in Hawaii to assess the progress made by the US-Japan semiconductor
arrangement, which the US industry has interpreted as a commitment to raise
the foreign market share of the Japanese chip market to 20 per cent by the
end of 1992.
Japan is facing calls from the US for greater access to its paper, vehicle,
car-parts and construction markets.
Lack of progress in an agreement made by the five largest Japanese car
manufacturers to make efforts to buy Dollars 19bn (Pounds 13.3bn) of US car
parts and import 20,700 US cars was criticised on Tuesday by House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt.
The US and Japan are also conducting this week a review of a bilateral
construction market access accord which Washington claims Japan has not
complied with so far.
Tokyo says it has never accepted it is committed to granting a specific 20
per cent foreign share of its chip market and is committed to heading off
any attempt to introduce further such targets.
'We are a market-oriented economy so we cannot promise any market share to
be taken by foreign products,' Mr Okamatsu stressed.
'The EC is also taking a keen interest in our bilateral talks with the US.
If Japan promised market share in specific sectors to the US, the EC will
also want the same thing. We cannot agree to it,' he said.

John Burton writes from Seoul.
The industry said the duties, averaging 3.19 per cent, would have a minimal
impact on sales of dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chips in the US,
their biggest foreign market.
The US on Tuesday drastically lowered preliminary dumping duties imposed
last October on Korea's three main semiconductor companies for unfair
pricing of D-Ram chips.

Strong safeguards provisions are seen as essential by the US, the European
Community and other industrialised countries which fear a flood of cheap
imports once trade barriers come down. Even without Gatt membership, China
is expected to enter the ranks of the world's top 10 trading nations this
year.
Supported by some third world countries, Beijing is pressing for standard
membership terms as a developing country. However, trading partners argue
that, despite substantial liberalisation, China's economy is not fully
compatible with Gatt's market-based fair trade rules and requires special
treatment, not least because of its size.
China, a founder member of Gatt, left in 1950 after the Communists took
power in Beijing.

Calls have also been growing in the US to adopt specific market share
targets to measure progress made in opening foreign markets, particularly in
Japan.
The US advisory committee on trade policy and negotiations, a trade advisory
panel chaired by Mr James D Robinson, outgoing chairman of American Express,
has submitted a recommendation to President Bill Clinton calling for the use
of quantitative indicators which would estimate the dollar value of various
formal and informal trade barriers.
The US insistence on a 20 per cent market share in chips reflects its
long-held frustration in trying to open the Japanese market as well as the
belief that a clear, measurable target is necessary to achieve results.
Japan says it has never accepted that it is committed to granting a 20 per

attempt to introduce further such targets.
'We are a market-oriented economy so we cannot promise any market share to

The US Commerce Department on Tuesday drastically lowered preliminary

The duty for Samsung Electronics, South Korea's biggest semiconductor

Goldstar Electron fell from 52.41 per cent to 4.97 per cent.
However, Hyundai Electronics faces a higher penalty of 7.19 per cent (5.99
per cent).
Exports to the US totalled Dollars 854m (Pounds 601m) last year and the
Korean producers had expected penalties of at least 10 per cent. They and
their US computer industry customers argued high dumping duties would drive
up semiconductor prices and harm ailing US computer makers.
Semiconductor prices in the US have already risen 20 per cent since the
preliminary duties against the Korean chip makers were announced.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Yeltsin seeks stronger CIS ties
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday laid out proposals for the closer
'integration' of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
claiming that the 15-month-old organisation had so far been ineffective.
Mr Yeltsin, in a declaration read out by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign
minister, described the association of former Soviet republics as amorphous
and 'unable to fulfil the hopes invested in it'.
'While not aspiring to any 'leading role', we are conscious of our
responsibility to co-operate closely with all independent states,' the
declaration said. Mr Kozyrev continually stressed that the initiative was
not designed to reassert the 'big brother' role of Russia. 'I don't think
any magnifying glass will help you find any neo-imperialist designs in
this,' he said.
He said the move was primarily intended both to address the burgeoning
conflicts on Russia's borders and to establish some financial discipline
over those states which remain in the rouble zone and are thus bankrolled by
the Russian central bank.
Mr Kozyrev said the initiative was designed to increase economic
co-operation, in particular through the creation of 'modern market
techniques of integration' - the setting up of multinational companies and
the encouragement of investment in each other's projects. This line has been
foreshadowed by a gathering of CIS heads of state in Russia's oil region of
Tyumen, where they were encouraged to invest in production.
The declaration follows a speech last month by Mr Yeltsin asking for
'understanding' from the United Nations and the international community for
Russia's intention to intervene in conflicts in the former Soviet Union, and
to remain the hegemonic power in the area. That speech was denounced by the
leadership of Ukraine - the most reluctant of the CIS members with Moldova
and Turkmenistan.
It is unlikely that the present initiative will fare much better, despite
agreements said to be in the offing between Ukraine and Russia on gas prices
and on the sharing of the former Soviet debt.
His move came as he held meetings of the Security Council and his
Presidential Council of advisers to address the political and economic
crisis - though his advisers said the declaration on the CIS and the crisis
were not to be linked.
Many members of the Presidential Council told Mr Yeltsin that the
introduction of presidential rule at the expense of the Russian parliament
would be fully justified, according to Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the
presidential spokesman. 'Many (members) say the president has all the moral
and constitutional rights to introduce presidential rule.'
Gen Pavel Grachev, defence minister, told Itar-Tass news agency that the
army was under control and would abide by the constitution - though what the
constitution prescribes for different levels of the Russian power structure
is a big point at issue.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Speculation grows of further Bundesbank interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>

THE solidarity pact concluded last weekend between the German federal and
state governments and the opposition ought to provide a fillip to the German
economy and help prevent a spiral of decline, Prof Reimut Jochimsen, a
member of the Bundesbank policy-making council, said yesterday.
Mr Jochimsen, president of the central bank for the state of North-Rhine
Westphalia, told an investment symposium in Dusseldorf he was relieved that
policy-makers had at last taken important decisions as to how the country
should proceed.
Consensus had been renewed despite a 'confrontation of interests' which
posed 'unprecedented challenges' to the German democratic system.
His remarks will fuel speculation that the Bundesbank will cut its official
short-term interest rates after the council meeting today. Mr Theo Waigel,
Germany's finance minister, said this week the prospect for rate cuts had
improved since the pact was concluded.
Mr Jochimsen would not comment in detail on today's meeting. He qualified
his favourable assessment of the pact by saying the agreement left many
important details unresolved. He said the pact took 'the path of least
resistance', meaning higher taxation and no substantial cuts in state
spending.
He said it was easier to agree what expenditure should be continued and on
new sources of revenue than on cuts.
He added: 'The government has moved decisively, though not yet
sufficiently.'
Summing up the Bundesbank's position on interest rates, he said the council
found itself walking a tightrope between pressure to ease monetary policy
and the need to safeguard the value of the D-Mark.
He said the scale of Germany's economic downturn combined with international
exchange rate pressures called for interest rates to be cut as soon and as
much as possible.
But the risks to price stability had yet to be dispelled, he said.
His views are more favourable to a rate cut than those of Mr Otmar Issing,
another member of the Bundesbank's policy-making directorate. Mr Issing said
on Tuesday that monetary developments remained the main basis for decisions
on interest rates.
Despite inflation running at 4.2 per cent in February, many economists hope
the Bundesbank will today cut at least 0.25 percentage points off the
Lombard and discount rates, now 9 and 8 per cent.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Heavier pensions burden looms over taxpayers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN taxpayers are likely to face a new increase of at least 8 per cent in
their pensions contributions next year, putting them top of the league of
big industrialised states for direct payments to the public purse.
The warning on a probable pensions increase came as the Bundesbank published
a new survey, showing that France and Germany are now equally the
highest-taxed countries in the Group of Seven industrialised states. The
latest agreement on a solidarity pact to pay for German unification, with
the re-introduction of a 7.5 per cent surcharge on income tax from January 1
1995, will push the country further out in front.
The Bundesbank report warns that the tax and social insurance burden on both
individuals and employers in Germany stood at 43.7 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1992, its highest level since the war. It has risen
sharply since unification, including increases in unemployment insurance,
statutory health insurance and income taxes.
The latest warning on increased pensions contributions came from Mr Herbert
Rische, president of the federal insurance bureau for white-collar workers,
who said the current rate of 17.5 per cent on basic wages would have to rise
to between 18.9 and 19.1 per cent next year. A key reason was the decision
to keep rates down in the past in spite of rising pensions payments to a
steadily ageing population.
The demographic change is also a factor behind the government's announcement
that it will press ahead with legislation to finance a statutory residential
care programme before the summer break, despite strong business resistance.
The scheme is likely to add about 1.7 per cent to social insurance
contributions, but the employers' share is supposed to be compensated for:
one proposal is to cancel one statutory holiday; another is to reduce by one
day the number of days for which sick workers can claim wages.
Social insurance contributions currently add up to 38.8 per cent of monthly
wages, with employers making matching contributions.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Experts examine Hoechst plant after toxic claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT experts were sent into the Hoechst chemical group's plant
outside Frankfurt yesterday following claims that highly-toxic dioxins were
released in an explosion there on Monday, writes Christopher Parkes.
Scientists from the Fresenius Institute collected samples for analysis at
the request of the regional environment ministry, after Greenpeace members
blockaded part of the works on Tuesday. Results of the analysis will be
published.
Greenpeace had suggested that dioxins would have been released in the
explosion and fire which killed one worker and burned PVC cladding on part
of the building involved.
Hoechst said temperatures in the fire seemed not to have been high enough to
release any dioxins.

FT  18 MAR 93 / EC seeks liability code for environmental damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday started a new drive to establish an
enforceable code of civil liability for damage to the environment.
It adopted a green paper which highlights mechanisms which would ensure
environmental damage is repaired, even in cases where precise legal blame
for pollution is difficult to establish.
The Commission is inviting written submissions on its 'communication' to the
Council of Ministers (of the 12) by October, after which it will hold public
hearings before framing any legislation.
The Commission aim is to reinforce the principle that the 'polluter pays' -
with the prospect of substantial financial damages acting as a disincentive
to pollute - yet ensure that the costs will be manageable for industry.
The paper underlines that the most prevalent system of 'fault-based
liability' - requiring proven negligence of a liable party - is far from
adequate. A causal link is difficult to establish; redress may be unfairly
sought against the richest target under the most advantageous national legal
system.
The plethora of differing legal approaches among EC member states, moreover,
threatens to fracture the single market; greater or lesser risk of liability
for pollution under different regimes could come to constitute a distorting
comparative advantage.
The Commission would like to complement fault-based liability with so-called
'strict' liability, where no fault need be established.
Officials say they now want to remedy a situation where much environmental
risk will be impossible to insure against, and also avoid the pitfalls of
the US Superfund for environmental damage, which they say has encouraged a
litigation industry.
Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner, would not be drawn on
whether he would seek eventually to legislate at EC level, or create a
framework for roughly analogous liability norms. 'We want a comparable set
of instruments in all member states,' he said, but 'at this moment the
Commission is not looking at anything; it is opening a debate.'

FT  18 MAR 93 / German recycling group gets green light to expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE organisation at the centre of Germany's controversial national recycling
system was yesterday given approval to expand its activities from the
household sector to industry.
The Federal Cartel Office in Berlin said Duales System Deutschland, which
runs the Grune Punkt (green dot) system that collects for recycling 80 per
cent of consumer packaging in Germany, can collect industrial packaging in
the business sector.
Consumers pay higher prices for the products bearing the green dot. The
money then finances the activities of DSD which collects the packaging.
The move had been fiercely attacked by independent waste collectors who
claim that the cost-advantageous nationwide system prevented competition.
Following the investigation by the Federal Cartel Office, DSD has offered to
compensate independent waste collectors for the higher costs they incur.
'With this new system, small waste collectors will no longer be at a
disadvantage and need not fear that they are being pushed away from the
market,' Mr Jurgen Kiecker, spokesman for the Cartel Office, said.
DSD was set up by 600 enterprises as a response to a law which said that
industry must ensure the collecting and recycling of the packaging they
produce.
Today, DSD collects nearly all recyclable household waste and has been asked
by the Lander to extend its operations to collecting industrial packaging.
Thousands of shipyard engineering workers rallied in northern Germany
yesterday to protest against job cuts and contract disputes, Reuter reports.
The powerful IG Metall engineering union called simultaneous protest rallies
across northern Germany, where shipyards face declining orders.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Engineering companies expect further decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MECHANICAL engineering companies, western Germany's leading export earners,
believe output and employment will fall further this year before recovery
starts in 1994.
Production, which fell 6 per cent in 1992, will decline by another 5 per
cent, and around 80,000 jobs will be lost, according to the VDMA industry
association.
Some specialist sectors, such as textile machinery and construction
equipment, have started to recover from the international recession, Mr Jan
Kleinewerfers, association president, said yesterday.
However, much of the industry will have to wait for signs of recovery - at
least in exports - until the second half of this year, he said.
Mr Kleinewerfers found grounds for optimism in the falling trend in
long-term interest rates, appreciation of the dollar and the yen against the
D-Mark, revival in the US economy, and continuing growth in Latin America
and Asia.
As the worldwide 'investment recession' came to an end, the industry would
exercise its growth potential, he said. Despite the slowdown, western German
engineering is well-equipped for recovery after an extraordinary burst of
capital investment before and during the unification boom.
Meanwhile, orders have continued to fall and the number of employees working
short-time, which doubled to 112,000 last year, reached 180,000 last month.
The sector shed 5.5 per cent of its workers last year, bringing the number
of jobs lost since the onset of the economic decline in early 1990 to
90,000. Capacity utilisation fell from 85.4 per cent to 78.7 per cent in the
course of the year. Industry turnover fell 4.6 per cent to DM220.5bn (Pounds
93.4bn) while exports slipped 3.4 per cent to DM113.9bn.
At the same time, unit labour costs increased 7.5 per cent and average
return on sales fell by a third to 1.2 per cent. This was 0.4 per cent down
on the previous post-war low of 1.6 per cent recorded in 1980 and 1981, and
less than half the 1989 peak of 2.7 per cent.
Worst-hit branches included machine tools, the single biggest engineering
sector, which last year saw new orders tumble by 23 per cent to around half
the level booked in 1989.
Manufacturers, which export 58 per cent of output - 70 per cent to Europe -
were particularly affected by the D-Mark's appreciation against other
European currencies.

FT  18 MAR 93 / 'Franc fort' set to survive French poll: But EMS key rests
with Bundesbank, not with new government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALL the currency markets' oft-repeated forecasts of a fresh assault on
the franc, France's elections on Sunday are not likely to set fire to the
tinder of the European Monetary System.
Yet after the exchange rate flare-ups of the last six months, the EMS
remains in a state of potential self-combustion, according to many European
economists.
And the key to the question whether it will eventually go up in flames
appears to rest with the German Bundesbank, whose policy-making council
meets today to deliberate its next interest rate moves.
The right-wing French opposition parties likely to form the next government
in Paris are widely expected to maintain the franc fort policy of the
Socialist administration.
'The French people do not like devaluations,' says one top French official.
He says France wants to bring both long-term and short-term interest rates
down to German levels - an objective which should be secured once the future
Paris government makes clear it will stick to the franc's present parity
against the D-Mark.
In particular, the 3.5 percentage point risk premium between short-term
German and French rates should fall substantially once the exchange markets
stop speculating on a franc devaluation, he says.
France also has strong political reasons for keeping within the EMS at
present rates, the official says. If the franc left the exchange rate
mechanism and floated, as Britain and Italy did in September, 'this would
mean the end of the EMS, of the Maastricht treaty, of the single market and
the Treaty of Rome itself', he says.
Over the medium term, France hopes to emulate the Netherlands, which has
succeeded in bringing both short and long term interest rates below German
levels during the past few months.
Interest rates in many EC countries stopped converging with D-Mark rates
after last summer after uncertainties intensified about the future stability
of European exchange rates.
But the Dutch central bank - thanks to a stern no-devaluation policy since
1983 - has managed to convince the markets that the guilder is at least as
hard as the D-Mark. 'It can be done, but it takes time,' says a Dutch
monetary official.
Mr Jean-Michel Charpin, chief economist at Banque Nationale de Paris, says
he is 'certain' that France's new prime minister will keep the franc's
parity unchanged. If exchange market confidence returns, France will reap a
two-fold bonus. It will profit both from further expected reductions in the
basic level of German interest rates, and from a fall in the franc's
interest rate differential, he says.
One month interest rates in France are around 11.7 per cent against 8.3 per
cent in Germany. Big French banks, under government orders, have kept their
base rates unchanged at 10 per cent for several months. But the high cost of
credit - at a time when French inflation is just over 2 per cent - has had a
debilitating effect on the French economy.
Mr Charpin says he is not excluding a revival of currency tensions, either
in the autumn or next year, as the new government's difficulties in dealing
with the French recession become apparent.
According to Mr Heiner Flassbeck, chief economist of the Berlin-based DIW
economic research institute, these problems could intensify unless the
Bundesbank accelerates the interest rate cuts started last autumn.
Mr Flassbeck in recent months has strongly criticised the slow pace of the
Bundesbank's monetary relaxation. He believes that, at most, the Bundesbank
will announce today merely a 'small step' towards further easing.
However, unless the Bundesbank by the end of the year reduces short-term
rates to around 4 to 5 per cent - compared with the present discount and
Lombard rates of 8 and 9 per cent respectively, 'the EMS will not survive',
Mr Flassbeck says.
Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, European economist at Salomon Bros in London,
believes the weekend 'solidarity pact' between the German government and
Lander has lessened the likelihood of speedy Bundesbank rate reductions.
By agreeing tax increases only for 1995, and ruling out deep spending cuts,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has sought to lower the danger that the German
recession will last into 1994.
But the likelihood of a slight improvement in shorter term economic
prospects has exacerbated the risks of higher debts and deficits in the
longer term.
This will increase the risk that Germany itself will not be able to meet the
fiscal targets set as conditions for countries' participation in economic
and monetary union (Emu) by the end of the century, Mr Mercier says.
If Mr Kohl had switched resolutely to a tighter fiscal policy, this would
have paved the way for a looser Bundesbank monetary policy, Mr Mercier says.
However, he describes the deal as 'more spending, more taxes, more
deficits'.
'It doesn't help at all - either France or the Maastricht process.'
An even more gloomy assessment comes from Mr Brendan Brown, chief economist
at Mitsubishi Finance in London, a long-time sceptic about France's ability
to keep its currency pegged to the D-Mark.
Mr Brown believes the inadequacy of the 'solidarity pact' deal will prolong
the French recession since the Bundesbank will be more reluctant to ease
policy.
The pain would be worthwhile if France's 'gold at the end of the rainbow' -
the aim, through Emu, of replacing the D-Mark by a European currency -
remained alive, Mr Brown says.
But, if France's goal of Emu becomes, for political and economic reasons,
increasingly remote, the sceptical Mr Brown asks: 'How long will France act
as a monetary satellite of Germany?'

FT  18 MAR 93 / Heseltine delays coal white paper: Decision heightens
concern over government policy to reprieve threatened pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S coal review approached stalemate yesterday as Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told MPs he would not publish the
promised white paper until after new contracts between British Coal and
electricity companies in England and Wales had been signed.
Mr Heseltine's remarks astonished senior electricity industry executives who
have indicated previously they would not sign agreements until they had
assessed the white paper.
The chief executive of one regional company said Mr Heseltine's remarks were
'a bolt from the blue. I am very surprised he has taken this line'. Another
said he found Mr Heseltine's comments extraordinary. 'We have every
confidence the deals can be signed - and soon - but the trade secretary's
comments make us suspicious about what is in the white paper,' he said.
Separately, British Coal said that redundancy terms which allow miners up to
Pounds 37,000 are to be extended for a further nine months from March 31.
Some 8,094 miners have left the industry since October, 400 in the past week
alone.
Yesterday's developments heighten fears of further delay before the
government decides on a policy to save some of the 31 threatened pits.
British Coal's existing contracts with electricity generators expire at the
end of the month, raising the possibility that it will be mining coal for
its own stockpiles without receiving money from the electricity industry.
The contracts are worth Pounds 120m a month to British Coal.
In addition, talks with the government and the generators on tonnages above
the contracts referred to yesterday by Mr Heseltine are making only limited
progress. What discussion there is envisages additional tonnages of between
40m and 50m tonnes over five years, less than the government originally
wanted and enough to save just a handful of the threatened pits.
However, there was more encouraging news for the coal industry when DTI
officials said that France might, after all, agree to import small
quantities of British electricity through the cross-channel interconnector,
potentially increasing the market for deep-mined British coal.
Mr Heseltine has consistently stressed that seeking to increase the market
for domestic coal by raising British electricity sales to France or cutting
French exports to the UK was fraught with legal difficulties. In his
comments to MPs yesterday, he spoke of a 'small but positive' step since he
had last addressed the matter in the Commons.
Fears of delay were reinforced last night when Downing Street said the coal
review, originally promised as soon as possible in February, would not be
discussed in cabinet today and may not be next week either.
However, DTI officials said the white paper could be published quite quickly
after British Coal's deals with the generators and regional companies were
signed.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Squeeze on public pay likely for further year: Budget wins
mixed reception in parliament and markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government signalled yesterday that the harsh squeeze on public sector
pay would be extended to next year as Mr Norman Lamont insisted that fiscal
austerity offered the only route to an eventual recovery in its political
fortunes.
The warning came amid growing demands from backbench Conservative MPs that
the elderly and the low-paid be given higher benefits to offset the
chancellor's Budget decision to extend value added tax to domestic fuel and
power.
But during fierce exchanges with opposition parties at Westminster, Mr
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury, refused to guarantee that
those on low incomes would be fully compensated for the cost of the extended
VAT.
As the row over VAT and a fierce Labour attack on the government's 'broken
promises' overshadowed an otherwise supportive reaction for the Budget from
Tory MPs, senior ministers warned of the fresh battle over public sector
pay.
They said a new ceiling on all public sector awards would have to be imposed
in 1994-95 if Whitehall departments were to meet Treasury spending targets.
The ceiling would have to be 'very close to', if not below, the 1.5 per cent
limit already applied to 1993-94.
Nurses, teachers, police officers, and other public sector workers would
then face a further real cut in incomes just as the chancellor's deferred
tax increases - including higher national insurance contributions - began to
bite in 1994.
The political risks for the government were underlined last night by the
decision of the Fire Brigades Union to press for strike action in protest
against the present pay ceiling.
The public spending squeeze has been tightened by sterling's sharp
devaluation since leaving the European exchange rate mechanism, which has
forced the Treasury to raise its medium-term inflation forecasts.
That in turn means that small real increases in the so-called control totals
for Whitehall spending planned in 1994-95 and 1995-96 have been replaced by
a 0.25 per cent cut in the first year and a freeze in the second.
But in an upbeat assessment of the medium-term impact of his austerity
Budget, Mr Lamont said the squeeze on public borrowing through tight control
of spending and increased tax revenues would lay the foundations for a
strong recovery in the government's political fortunes.
Mr Lamont said that taken with last November's autumn statement the budget
had re-established the government's firm grip on economic policy. He denied
that the Conservatives had broken firm pledges given during last year's
election campaign.
Mr Lamont strongly defended the extension of VAT to domestic fuel as
essential to meet Britain's international obligations to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions.
But as the Commons social security committee prepared to investigate the
measure's effect on low income households, some Tory MPs warned they would
fight for a clear Treasury commitment to compensate fully those reliant on
state pensions and welfare benefits.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Lamont leaves room for wider tax measures: Budget wins mixed
reception in parliament and markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, warned yesterday that the government would
take additional fiscal measures if it thought these were necessary to reduce
the UK's public sector deficit.
He said his Budget announcement of plans to increase taxation by a net
Pounds 6.7bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96 was 'a bold step'
towards removing the threat posed by excessive borrowing to economic
recovery.
But at a post-Budget press briefing, he declined to rule out a further
extension of value added tax in addition to his decision to levy VAT on
domestic fuel and power from April next year.
The chancellor said he regarded the Pounds 243.8bn 'control total' set in
November for government spending in 1993-94 as a ceiling, not to be breached
in negotiations between the Treasury and government departments ahead of the
unified Budget in November.
He said the next spending round would be influenced by the long-term review
of all aspects of government spending being carried out by Mr Michael
Portillo, chief secretary. Treasury officials confirmed that if this yielded
savings, the chancellor would use them to cut the deficit further.
Mr Lamont said he wanted the UK budget to move towards balance around the
top of the economic cycle. But he also said the Maastricht criterion
limiting the budget deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product was a
'good objective'.
The Budget predicts that the PSBR will increase to Pounds 50.1bn in 1993-94,
or 8 per cent of GDP, from Pounds 35.1bn in the current financial year,
about 5.75 per cent of GDP. It forecasts only a gradual decline to Pounds
30bn, or 3.75 per cent of GDP, by 1997-98.
Mr Lamont said he expected that most of the cyclical influences that had
contributed to the UK's large deficits would have worked through the economy
by the end of 1997. But he denied that this meant a large part of the
deficit was structural.
He said the 'vast majority' of the present PSBR was cyclical, reflecting the
effects of the recession such as high unemployment and reduced tax revenues
on the government's finances. He underlined that the PSBR projections were
subject to uncertainty and said they could prove pessimistic if tax revenues
were more buoyant than expected.
The chancellor said he had not wanted to lessen the prospects for economic
recovery this year in the Budget. However, he believed the main threat to
sustained recovery was excessive borrowing.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Equities slip back but sterling gains: Budget wins mixed
reception in parliament and markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL markets continued to treat the Budget warily yesterday as traders
and investors struggled to digest its many complex elements.
Sterling again made modest gains against the D-Mark and the dollar as
currency investors were reassured by the chancellor's statement that the
level of UK base rates was appropriate to current economic conditions.
UK government bond prices also bounced back from the lows reached on Tuesday
as markets re-assessed the impact of the Budget and shrugged off the
chancellor's announcement that the public sector borrowing requirement for
next year would be around Pounds 50bn.
However, Mr Norman Lamont's decision to leave interest rate policy unchanged
triggered a small setback for share prices. Equities were unsettled as the
market tried to assess the impact of the government's planned changes to
advance corporation tax.
The share prices of many overseas-earning companies were particularly
depressed as their income may be affected by foreign income dividend
proposals. On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 Index closed 29.4 down
at 2,889.9, although trading in shares was not heavy.
There had been some speculation before the Budget that Mr Lamont would
announce another cut in UK base rates to help stimulate economic recovery.
However, the pound's strength in recent days has also been triggered by a
growing belief in financial markets that the Bundesbank will ease its
important Lombard and discount rates at a council meeting today.
Sterling gained 1 1/4 pfennigs in London to DM2.4150, but eased in New York
to DM2.4136. Longer-dated gilts advanced as dealers expressed relief that Mr
Lamont had relaxed the full-funding rule to allow purchases of gilts by
banks and building societies to count towards the PSBR.

FT  18 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The utilities areas of the market were given a thorough mauling by
marketmakers at the outset of trading, with share prices commonly marked
down by around 2 per cent after the Budget moves to introduce VAT on
domestic fuel and power from April 1994. The reduction in advance
corporation tax was seen as a small plus for the water stocks.
But early losses in the utilities were quickly regained and replaced by
large-scale rises as dealers reported a sudden burst of buying interest,
apparently from institutions seeking high yields and top quality dividend
potential.
Southern Electric, the only regional electricity stock in the FT-SE 100,
fell to 471p but rebounded to end a net 7 up at 487p. The power generators
were virtually unchanged on balance but water shares finished a busy day
with good rises. Of the Footsie stocks, Anglian gained a net 7 at 529p,
after 518p, as did North West, at 517p, after 507p.
The banks sector was one of the few areas of the market to attract any
sustained buying interest. Barclays was the pick of the banks, closing a net
5 higher at 405p after heavy turnover of 8m shares, with US investors said
to have been keen supporters of the stock, in spite of the recent halved
dividend and the Pounds 2.5bn worth of provisions against bad debts. A round
of visits to UK institutions by Mr Andrew Buxton, Barclays' chairman, is
also said to have gone down well.
Details of the January retail sales, which accompanied the February headline
figure, helped several stores stocks. The statistics showed footwear sales
up 23 per cent and womenswear ahead 22 per cent. Among those benefiting,
Stylo was steady at 126p and Storehouse up a penny at 198p, as was Sears, at
96p. Burton rose 1 1/2 to 78p in 9.4m turnover.
Talk that Dixons had hit a patch of dull trading, together with a downgrade,
knocked the shares, which tumbled 10 to 223p. Analysts who had recently met
the high street electrical retailer said its US business was thought to be
continuing flat and that the UK recovery had slowed. Morgan Stanley was said
to have downgraded its current year forecast by around 15 per cent.
Higher costs at Boots were said to be behind a downgrade from Nomura, but
the house stressed that they were one-off and did not affect the
fundamentals. The shares dropped 11 to 506p.
Relief that VAT had not been levied on books and newspapers lifted the
tightly held John Menzies 20 to 471p and WH Smith 3 to 450p.
EMAP, up 16 at 348p, Telegraph, ahead 7 at 337p, Trinity International, 9
higher at 323p, and United Newspapers, 12 to the good at 547p, were also
beneficiaries.
VAT relief was shortlived among the food retail issues, where an initial
rise was quickly wiped out as sellers moved into the market. Argyll Group
tumbled 9 to 375p with 5.1m traded, J. Sainsbury eased a penny to 518p, and
Tesco lost 8 to 252p in turnover of 10m.
Asda, said to be giving out bullish sales talk in meetings with analysts,
appreciated 1 1/4 to 73 3/4 p. Takeover talk was again heard around Nurdin &amp;
Peacock as the shares surged 16 to 218p.
Firm sugar prices and a determined buyer were said to be behind a rise of 3
to 432p for Tate &amp; Lyle, while United Biscuits was firm ahead of today's
results, for which a confident statement is being predicted. The shares put
on 2 at 388p.
A gloomy leisure sector was enlivened by talk of possible advance
corporation tax benefits to selected leisure stocks, although analysts
remained both frustrated by lack of detailed information and divided over
the exact amounts. The sentiment helped Rank Organisation, which improved
from early weakness to close 6 off at 666p, Ladbroke, finally only 2 easier
at 195p, and Forte, 4 off at 197p.
Hi-Tec shares reacted badly to news of the departure on Tuesday of
non-executive directors Sir Michael Edwardes and Mr Richard Fenhalls. The
stock touched 35p before recovering to 40p for a fall of 9 on the day. They
had been with the board less than two weeks.
Investors continued to hunt for yield attractions in the property sector.
Frogmore Estates jumped 20 to 391p, Greycoat added 1 1/2 at 15 1/2 p,
Hammerson 'A', where bid speculation continues, climbed 9 to 375p, and Land
Securities rose a penny to 506p on 5.2m traded.
Bargain hunters in Gestetner, together with suggestions that the full year's
dividend may be maintained, helped the stock brush aside a warning from the
chairman at the annual meeting that profits will be hit in the short term by
falling sales, redundancy and property-letting costs.
Having retreated over the last two sessions following a sell recommendation
from NatWest Securities, the shares closed 7 better at 123p. However, the
securities house maintained that it still expected a 'hard landing' for the
stock due to continued weakness in its European markets.
News of the appointment of a new finance director at TI Group cheered the
market, sending the shares forward 6 to 325p in trade of 3m. Yield buyers
for APV ahead of figures expected next week helped the shares advance 5 1/2
to 120 1/2 p.
Among transport stocks, the UK chancellor's commitment to a high speed rail
link between London and the Channel tunnel boosted tunnel operator
Eurotunnel and the shares improved 4 to 489p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil sector remained very much in the front line as the market reassessed
the implications of changes in petroleum revenue tax and the proposed
changes in advance corporation tax.
The market quickly made up its mind that the biggest winner from the Budget
moves was British Petroleum, whose shares followed Tuesday's 9 gain with a
further rise of 9 1/2 to 304 1/2 p, the stock's highest closing level since
November 1991. Turnover was a hefty 22m shares. Shell Transport, however,
settled 2 off at 578p. Enterprise Oil jumped 13 to 505p and Lasmo edged
forward 3 to 189p.
One sector specialist said: 'The simple conclusion has to be that the moves
favour the big companies at the expense of the so-called tiddlers; the
companies paying high levels of petroleum revenue tax, for example BP and
Enterprise Oil, as well as Lasmo, are the major beneficiaries. The small
companies who have organised their assets in a tax efficient manner are
having the rug pulled from beneath them.'
The smaller stocks edged higher at the outset but quickly came under severe
pressure. Clyde Petroleum settled 7 1/2 down at 52 1/2 p, Goal dropped 4 1/2
to 61p and Aran dipped 2 1/4 to 25 1/4 p.

FT  18 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Mauling for drug shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BEARISH story on the drug stocks in the US press, together with profits
warnings from two leading US groups, brought renewed pressure on a
thoroughly depressed pharmaceuticals sector.
Marion Merrell Dow shocked Wall Street by announcing that its first-quarter
numbers would be substantially lower than those of the same period last
year, while Eli Lilley plunged more than 5 per cent after a similar warning.
A story in the Washington Post, warning of a possible freeze on drug prices,
set the seal on what was always going to be a difficult day for one of the
UK market's biggest sectors and an area that has endured unpleasant shocks
in recent weeks.
Glaxo, badly mauled by the market after criticisms from the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) recently over claims for its Zantic anti-ulcer drug,
and still reeling from the resignation of Mr Ernest Mario, its former chief
executive and deputy chairman, dropped 14 to 633p on a large turnover of
5.8m shares.
SmithKline Beecham shares, heavily sold in London after the FDA rejected
approval of its much-vaunted anti-nausea drug Kytril, ran back 15 1/2 to 447
1/2 p with 2m shares changing hands. Wellcome finished 23 down at 902p and
ICI 14 cheaper at 1208p.

FT  18 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading

<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY over the full effects of changes in advance corporation tax
following the Budget, along with fading hopes of a cut in interest rates in
both the UK and Germany, led to a nervous trading session in the derivatives
market, writes Joel Kibazo.
In the futures, initial selling of the March contract on the FT-SE 100
Index, which opened at 2,887, saw it dip to 2,874 by 9am. This turned out to
be the low of the day, for good healthy buying soon brought about a recovery
in the contract, sending it forward to trade at 2,897 by 10am.
March then drifted back to the 2,885 level, where it hovered for the next
few hours as strong two-way business was conducted. With a dull Wall Street
having no significant effect during the afternoon, March closed at 2,886, a
3-point discount to the underlying cash market. Turnover was good and it had
reached 14,214 lots by the close.
In traded options, volume improved to 35,367 contracts. The Euro FT-SE 100
option was particularly busy after a leading securities house was reported
to have sold the April 2,875 straddle. It saw a total of 6,890 lots, while
11,506 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.
Lasmo was the most active stock option, with 2,001 trades registered,
followed by J. Sainsbury with 1,956 lots and Barclays with 1,082 contracts.

FT  18 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: No Budget joy for the equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LAMONT'S Budget proved no favourite of the UK stock market yesterday and,
although selling pressure was not heavy, share prices gave ground steadily.
Uncertainty over the implications of some corporate tax changes was
reflected in 'the quietest post-Budget trading session recorded', said a
senior trader at one of the largest integrated houses.
The chief objections were the chancellor's apparent coolness towards hopes
for another base rate cut and his changes to ACT (Advance Corporation Tax),
and to foreign income dividends by UK companies. NatWest Securities warned
that the new levels of ACT implied a drop on the gross yield on the equity
market on April 6.
The stock market was saved from the worst by a steadier performance by
government bonds and by stock index futures. But the FT-SE 100 Index closed
29.4 down at 2,889.9. Although generally negative on the Budget, most London
securities houses kept year-end Footsie forecasts unchanged  - at 2,850 at
Strauss Turnbull and 3,000 at Nikko; Hoare Govett trimmed its 1993 forecast
to 3,150 from 3,200.
While there were sharp falls in many overseas-earning companies, which could
be affected by the foreign income dividend proposals, few recorded
significant trading volume. Analysts struggled to comprehend and assess the
new proposals, at least one leading house promising clients a 'consultative
document'. The dividend tax change has significant implications for UK
pension funds.
The stock market opened nervously lower following a round of generally
bearish morning meetings at most trading firms. There was little selling,
however, and the loss on the Footsie was held to around 16 points until
stock index futures opened lower and at a discount, when the loss on the
index was extended to 36.2.
But this level of 2,883.1 proved to be the low of the day. Two US sellers of
the Footsie future late on Tuesday stood on the sidelines yesterday and both
the future contract and the FT-SE 100 Index itself steadied. For the rest of
the session, the market traded quietly, with both buyers and sellers
evident, but not on any great scale.
Not all market strategists were prepared to abandon expectations of a base
rate cut because of the chancellor's apparently negative stance. Attention
now focuses on today's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council, where the
chances of a reduction in the Lombard rate appear high.
However, a good performance from store and retail shares was ascribed not to
base rate optimism but to the latest UK retail sales figures, showing a
modest gain for last month but an upward revision of the January data.
Oil issues provided the firmest spots in the market as investors continued
to respond to the Budget news of lower Petroleum Revenue Tax on existing oil
fields. US buyers were active here but their efforts were counterbalanced by
US selling of the pharmaceutical stocks.
The activity in these two prominent market sectors boosted Seaq volume to
671.7m shares from the 492m of the previous day, when retail business was
worth Pounds 1.30bn. Non-Footsie trade fell back to a more normal 57 per
cent of the total yesterday.

FT  18 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Shares stage late fall amid
inflation concern
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
PROFIT-TAKING hit US equity prices yesterday afternoon, sending stocks
broadly lower in late trading, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally down 16.21 at 3,426.74. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 3.06 at 448.31 and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.07
to 687.40. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 241.3m shares, and
declines led rises by 1,161 to 719.
Late profit-taking contributed to the broadly based decline, but there was
an underlying softness to the market reflecting some concern about
inflation, following reports that the core consumer price index rose by 0.5
per cent in February, above the anticipated 0.3 per cent. Including the
mercurial food and energy components, the index was 0.3 per cent higher for
February.
Micron Technologies plunged Dollars 4 to Dollars 23 7/8 after the Commerce
Department said it would subject South Korean competitors to surprisingly
light tariffs. Dynamic random access memory chips, known as D-RAMs, made by
South Korean companies, will be subject to duties of 0.74 per cent to 7.19
per cent. The industry had expected duties of at least 10 per cent.
The ruling also hurt shares in Texas Instruments, which dropped Dollars 2
3/4 to Dollars 59 5/8 .
The drug sector continued to reflect investor concern about government
controls on pharmaceuticals prices, and drug company stocks were among the
most active in NYSE trading. Merck fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 ,
Glaxo Holdings lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 18 1/4 , Johnson &amp; Johnson
tumbled Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 40 3/8 and Pfizer shed Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 58 3/8 .
Marion Merrell Dow, which plummeted Dollars 4 on Tuesday after the company
warned of a substantial drop in first-quarter sales, ended Dollars  3/8
cheaper at a 52-week low of Dollars 18 1/2 .
Merrry-Go-Round, a specialty fashion stores group, climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 17 after signing an agreement to buy Melville's Chess King division.
A bout of profit-taking pushed down casino and gambling-related issues after
strong gains in recent weeks. The sector was also hurt by vague speculation
that congress might try to propose a moratorium on Native American gambling
compacts with states. Arizona, and some other states, have recently tried to
restrict gambling. President Riverboat Casinos fell Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars
52 7/8 and Promus Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 68 5/8 .
Carnival Cruise firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 38 1/4 after stating that it
had agreed to sell one of its cruise ships to a new company to be formed by
three companies, including Carnival. Each of the three cruise lines, which
include Miami-based Dolphin Cruise Line and Epirotiki Lines, will have an
equal stake in the new company.
In Nasdaq trading, technology stocks saw heavy trading. Intel fell Dollars 5
to Dollars 114 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO closed lower after heavy trading, mirroring the decline by New York
stocks.
The TSE 300 index retreated 15.8 to 3,541.0 and falls outscored advances by
353 to 288 after volume of 48.2m shares.
Calgary-based Ranger Oil ended CDollars  3/8 off at CDollars 6 1/4 on some
568,000 shares traded after announcing that it would not receive about
USDollars 33m in petroleum revenue tax repayments under proposed changes to
Britain's oil revenue tax.
Magna International class 'A' shares rose CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 40 1/8 .
Merrill Lynch named Magna its 'Focus 1 stock of the week' and raised its
intermediate-term rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'.

FT  18 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei climbs to year's
high on economic hopes

<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average closed at the year's high after senior Liberal Democratic
party members called for a stimulus package larger than last August's
emergency measures, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 205.07 at 18,173.37, helped by a rise in the
futures market. The index fell to the day's low of 17,953.45 in the morning
and hit the day's peak of 18,242.70 just before the close.
Volume was almost unchanged at 350m shares, against 345m, and advancing
stocks led losers by 757 to 257, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks climbed 20.94 to 1,365.65, reflecting
broad-based buying, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 3.72 at
1,094.42.
Institutional investors bought large-capital shares which had lost ground on
profit-taking on Tuesday. Traders said the yen's rise against the dollar had
also encouraged buying in shipbuilding issues, steels and power utilities.
An improvement in the futures market also brought in arbitrage buying, while
individual investors traded speculative stocks.
Nippon Steel was the day's most active issue, rising Y7 to Y320, while Tokyo
Electric Power moved ahead Y70 to Y2,800.
Reports that leading brokers will see better profits for the current year to
March, boosted by the recent market rally, left securities houses up 4.3 per
cent on the day. Nomura Securities was the second most active stock,
appreciating Y90 to Y1,740, while Nikko Securities advanced Y76 to Y790 and
Wako Securities Y54 to Y494.
Telecom-related issues continued to rise on strength in Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, which finished Y10,000 higher at Y812,000. Nippon Comsys, a
telecom engineering company, was Y36 stronger at Y913.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical gained Y27 at Y958 on buying by short term
speculators. The stock has risen by 21 per cent since the start of the month
on an approval recommendation for its immuno-suppressant drug by a Health
Ministry committee.
Sugar refiners were firmer on a rise in domestic and overseas sugar futures
markets following reports of damaged crops in Cuba, the world's largest
sugar exporter. Mitsui Sugar put on Y4 at Y432 and Nippon Beet Sugar Y6 at
Y548.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 127.40 to 19,119.83 in volume of 46.3m
shares. Roundup
MARKETS IN the region were generally stronger, while Hong Kong remained
resilient.
HONG KONG recovered most of the day's losses after shedding some 219 points
initially as investors reacted to comments from Beijing, further attacking
the democratic reform proposals of Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor.
The Hang Seng index finished a net 21.71 down at 5,958.33 in turnover of
HKDollars 4.1bn.
Some observers commented that certain proposals put forward by the Chinese
authorities were not as worrying as had been expected.
Jardine Matheson group subsidiaries began to report, with Jardine
International Motor Holdings showing a sharp rise in earnings, although the
latter slipped 25 cents to HKDollars 6.55.
AUSTRALIA ended at a nine-month high as investors remained optimistic that
there would be a cut in interest rates. The All Ordinaries index added 16.3
at 1,675.6, its best close since June 4 last year. Volume came to 238.1m
shares worth ADollars 499.6m, with rises exceeding falls by five-to-three.
Among the banks, Commonwealth rose 7 cents to ADollars 7.95, NAB moved
forward 17 cents to ADollars 8.78 and ANZ climbed 10 cents to ADollars 3.44.
NEW ZEALAND continued to feature Telecom, which closed at another record
high, up a cent at NZDollars 2.86, as the NZSE-40 index advanced 5.79 to
1,590.48 in turnover of NZDollars 30m.
SEOUL more than regained Tuesday's losses, responding to an improvement in
relations between North and South Korea. The composite index rebounded 25.18
to 663.05, while volume was 37.35m shares valued at Won483.2bn.
SINGAPORE was stronger but lost some of its gain late in the session on
profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index put on 13.28 at 1,662.63
in volume of 127m shares.

FT  18 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Bombs rock Bombay in budget aftermath -
RC Murthy on a market which has seen speculation, and savage disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, was rocked
by two powerful bombs last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured. The
market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal.
It has had to compromise - trading has been restricted to an hour a day, and
dealing has moved back to the traditional ring, where it stopped a year ago.
Dealers seemed to like this, the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent on Monday
and Tuesday. But another bomb blast in Calcutta triggered nervous selling
yesterday, and the index came back by 50.62, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,409.23.
All this has taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity
market, over the past six weeks or so, has had to contend first with
unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27,
and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment.
Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed traders in the
budget at the end of last month. He postponed corporate tax reforms by a
year, denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group. He did
reduce excise and import duties on a broad front, but left out the cement
and steel sectors, where share prices had been boosted by pre-budget
speculation.
To top it all, Dr Singh refused to equate domestic investors with their
overseas counterparts in taxing short-term capital gains. He lowered the tax
to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors
but for local investors it remained at 44.5 per cent.
Taking the tax concessions for granted, traders had driven up share prices
in February to make a kill later. Instead, the budget turned out to be a
nightmare. While industry and business welcomed the statement which, for
once, did not propose any new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, the stock
market theorist and academic, said a reduction in import duties would leave
corporate profits ex-growth this year.
The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders
sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless
as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low. Overseas investors fuelled the
downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of Reliance Industries,
arbitraging between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the
market price of its Euro-issue of global depository receipts (GDRs).
The opportunity arose after a change in Indian regulations which allows
international investors to convert GDRs into the underlying stock. At the
current conversion rate of Rs31 per US dollar, the Reliance GDR fetched
Rs170 per share against the BSE quotation of Rs210.
The BSE 30-share index plunged by more than one-fifth to 2,287 on March 10,
from 2,893 at the post-budget trading session on February 27. Share prices
rebounded last week, taking the index to 2,361 and the uptrend, on balance,
has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on Friday.
Whether or not the surge will turn into a strong rally will depend on the
ability of bulls to maintain their momentum. They are hoping that foreign
portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after
'Black Friday', and the successful sale of Reliance stock on the BSE by
international investors.
The Indian stock markets have been passing through a series of crises since
December, when activists of the Bhartiya Janta party pulled down the Babri
mosque at Ayodhya, sparking off communal riots.
Mr Mark Bulloch of Jardine Fleming takes the domestic political situation in
his stride. 'Nothing dramatic has happened as far as foreign investors are
concerned,' he says. 'They are appraising the political situation.'
In the meantime, there is no compulsion for local investors to sell. In
this, they are more fortunate than they were in previous years, when they
were under pressure to take advantage of a long-term capital gains tax
exemption before the financial year ended in March. The exemption has been
replaced by a flat 20 per cent tax this year which, according to dealers,
puts bulls and bears on an even footing.

FT  18 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Buba still keeps the Continent
guessing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff

<TEXT>
BOURSES seemed slightly worried about the absence of a Bundesbank news
conference today, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT approached the interest rate prospect with something less than
enthusiasm, the DAX index falling 12.75 to 1,685.08, its fourth consecutive
decline.
Turnover fell slightly from DM6.1bn to DM6.0bn.
Carmakers fell after a bearish review of the industry from Merck Finck in
Dusseldorf, BMW leading the rout with a fall of DM9 to DM478. Otherwise,
shares which moved appreciably on the day were mostly speculative.
Asko, the retailer, up from DM604 at the end of February, apparently on
hopes that the Christmas quarter will produce good figures, fell DM50, or
6.8 per cent to DM685; and Deutsche Babcock, the engineer which indicated
good orders, but poor profits prospects earlier this week, dropped another
DM9.20, or 5.9 per cent to DM147.
Among utilities, VEW put on another DM3.50 to DM245.50 for a gain of 11 per
cent this month. Mr Patrick Shields at NatWest Securities said that there
had been a story that VEW, which has the greatest dependence in the industry
on gas for the production of electricity, could be in the market for
Hoesch's 8 per cent stake in Ruhrgas, Germany's largest gas supplier.
PARIS lost its way late in the day after the CAC-40 index had risen to a
high of 1,980, falling back to close 7.97 lower at 1,967.28. Turnover was a
modest FFr2.4bn. The decline was partly attributed to a feeling that the
Bundesbank might not cut interest rates at its regular meeting today.
LVMH advanced FFr78 to FFr3,369 ahead of today's results. Analysts are
particularly interested in the group's expectations of 1993 performance,
given the depressed state of some of its interests, such as champagne.
However, since the shares having underperformed the market by some 16 per
cent over the last three months, some analysts believe that there is room
for a technical rally.
Eurotunnel rose FFr1.05 to FFr41.00 following the UK government's
reaffirmation yesterday of its commitment to a high speed rail link between
London and the channel tunnel.
MILAN saw some heavy selling by foreign institutions in early trading but
there was a slight recovery in the after market. The Comit index finished
down 9.68 at 492.74.
The market was not moved by Tuesday's good results from Banco Ambrosiano
Veneto. The shares fell L50 to L4,190 although the bank announced a 31 per
cent increase in net profit, this in spite of doubling its reserves for bad
debts.
Olivetti continued to be the focus of investors' attention, but the shares
managed a modest upturn: after fixing down L44 to L1,781 they rose to L1,845
on the kerb.
Doubts over the future of the country's privatisation programme increased
after Monday's announcement that Iri, the state holding group, was to take a
loan from Stet in exchange for granting the latter the dividend rights in
Banco Commerciale. Stet fixed down L62 at L2,083 while Commerciale was L49
weaker at L4,670.
AMSTERDAM moved higher on better than expected results from the steel group,
Hoogovens. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.7 to 106.2.
Hoogovens reported a 1992 loss of Fl 595m but forecast a turnround in the
first half of 1993 on improved demand for its products. The shares picked up
Fl 2.30 to Fl 27.30.
In contrast, Grolsch, the brewer, lost Fl 5.40 to Fl 204.50 on slightly
disappointing results and plans for a five-for-one share split. Elsevier was
Fl 1.30 down at Fl 126.50 ahead of today's results.
ZURICH looked apprehensively at the Bundesbank, at other equity markets and,
again, at plans for US healthcare reform. The SMI index fell 11.3 to 2,138.5
with chemicals particularly weak, Roche certificates falling SFr60 to
SFr4,020.
HELSINKI rallied on strong demand for industrial shares, local hopes of a
German interest rate cut and by a rebound from recent losses. The Hex index
rose 2.4 per cent to 985.0 in turnover of FM72.1m. ISTANBUL dropped 1.7 per
cent for an aggregate fall of 3 per cent over the past two days, cautious
ahead of a six-day holiday starting next Tuesday. The market index closed
96.45 lower at 5,620.37.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Money Markets: German futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED D-Mark fut-ures fell back sharply yesterday after a Bundesbank
council member was reported to have said that the time was not ripe for cuts
in official German interest rates, writes James Blitz.
Money market dealers were clearly expecting today's Bundesbank council
meeting to reduce the Lombard and discount rates, which currently stand at
9.00 and 8.00 per cent respectively, by 50 basis points.
Three-month German cash continued to hover at around 7.75 per cent, a good
1/2 percentage point below the level at which the Bundesbank offers cash to
commercial banks in its weekly securities repurchase tender.
However, Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a Bundesbank council member, was reported to
have told a financial news agency that the Bundesbank should not lower rates
while inflation remains stubbornly high.
His comment spoiled the generally optimistic mood in Germany, and the June
Euromark contract retreated 6 basis points to close at 93.18.
The mood in the German money market in the run-up to today's council meeting
has certainly not been promising. Money market conditions remain tight
because of the introduction of minimum reserve requirements.
German call money yest-erday came down to 8.50 per cent, from 8.60 per cent
earlier in the day, after the Bundesbank injected a net DM16.4bn into the
market.
The allocation was described by some dealers as generous, but others pointed
out that it was rather meagre when other factors were taken into account.
The recent issue of short-term bills - or Bulis - and the tax collection
season have removed a lot of liquidity from the market.
In sterling markets, the June futures contract remained under strong
pressure following the UK chancellor's indication in the Budget that the
level of British base rates was consistent with economic recovery.
The June contract ended at 94.29, some 6 basis points down from its previous
finish. At this level it is pricing three-month money in the summer at 5.71
per cent. Three-month cash closed yesterday at 5 15/16 per cent, unchanged
on the day.
Tight liquidity conditions in the discount market pushed the overnight rate
as high as 30 per cent at one stage.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Market expects rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR failed to break through the DM1.6670 barrier yesterday, even
though dealers continued to assume that the Bundesbank would cut its
officially posted interest rates at its council meeting today, writes James
Blitz.
The US currency operated in a tight range between DM1.6615 and DM1.6670
throughout European trading, continuing the pattern of recent days. It
closed at DM1.6640, virtually unchanged on the day. In New York it slipped
to end at DM1.6616.
Economic indicators in the US continued to emerge in the dollar's favour. US
consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in February, raising suggestions that the
Federal Reserve might contemplate tightening policy as the country climbs
out of recession.
Perceptions about the Bundesbank's monetary policy also continued to be
'dollar-positive'. The German money market is clearly expecting a 50
basis-point cut in the discount rate when the Bundesbank's policy-making
central council meets today. A reduction in short-term German rates would
further narrow the gains that investors receive for holding D-Marks.
The conclusion of a Solidarity Pact between the German government and
opposition at the weekend was seen as one reason why the Bundesbank might
ease policy today.
A dealer also suggested that the Bundesbank would be under strong pressure
to widen the difference between the discount rate floor and the rate at
which funds are offered to commercial banks on a weekly basis. That
differential is currently only 25 basis points, and this provides the
central bank with insufficient flexibility in its weekly operations.
There are reasons, too, to be cautious about a cut today. The terms of the
Solidarity Pact do not legislate for a reduction in the German budget
deficit over the next two years, and some dealers suggested yesterday that
the Bundesbank had been trying to play down the implications of the
agreement.
The Bundesbank's announcement that it would not be holding a press
conference after its meeting also caused a few jitters, as this is thought
to indicate that nothing of significance will be forthcoming. However, the
timetable and decisions of recent meetings have had a highly flexible air.
Perceptions of an easing in German rates helped sterling to make new gains
against the D-Mark, although the main impetus here was Tuesday's UK Budget
statement. Mr Norman Lamont's claim that the current level of interest rates
was compatible with the government's objectives for inflation and growth has
given a firm underpinning to the pound, which finished at DM2.4150, up 1 1/4
pfennigs.
Sterling briefly traded above the DM2.42 level. However, a London based
analyst claimed that the pound was being bought in short term speculative
trading rather than longer term institutional activity.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nymex vote goes against Guttman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Z LOU Guttman, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange since 1988,
lost his bid for re-election on Tuesday to Mr Daniel Rappaport, a
39-year-old independent floor trader who is also an attorney. The defeat
came after a stormy year in which Mr Guttman was accused by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission of violating trading rules.
Known for his brash style and his ability to get things done, Mr Guttman
helped build the Nymex into one of the most successful futures markets in
the world. The exchange had pre-tax earnings of Dollars 27m last year, and
about Dollars 100m cash in reserve.
Unlike some of its New York neighbours Nymex's volume is booming and seat
prices have doubled during Mr Guttman's term in office. The exchange has the
largest crude oil market in the world and has successfully diversified its
energy lines into natural gas and other products.
Despite the successes, Mr Guttman's legal problems were feared to reflect
unfavourably on the exchange and its customers. The CFTC delivered its civil
charges against Mr. Guttman less than a month ago, after warning him in July
of a pending case.
The Nymex Board immediately asked Mr Guttman to step down, but - true to his
style - he refused, saying he would defend himself against the charges, and
that the membership should have the right to choose its leadership.
Some Nymex members thought Mr Guttman's efforts to keep New York's futures
exchanges in business after the February 26 bomb blast at the World Trade
Center would help his re-election effort. He is credited with convincing
police and fire officials that the markets should open, despite impaired
ventilation and fire protection systems at the WTC trading facility.
Mr Rappaport defeated Mr Guttman by 386 votes to 213. The new chairman
strongly supports the Nymex's move to a new trading facility in mid-1994 and
he sees potential in the exchange's Access electronic trading system.
Mr Rappaport also would like to see more co-operation between New York
exchanges. His election could pave the way for another Nymex bid for the
ailing New York Commodity Exchange. The Comex is currently entertaining
takeover offers from the Chicago Board of Trade and a smaller New York
market, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP-Gatt compatibility 'totally
illusory'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission's claims that the Community-US agreement on the farm
chapter of the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation negotiations is
compatible with last May's reform of the common agricultural policy are
'totally illusory', France claimed yesterday.
The new French attack on the accord, reached last November in Washington,
came as EC farm ministers examined the report prepared by senior officials
of the 12, aimed at measuring its 'compatibility' with the new CAP - which
all member states have agreed needs to be established before it can go
ahead.
It also comes as France's socialist government faces overwhelming defeat in
Sunday's parliamentary elections.
Mr Jean Pierre Soisson, French agriculture minister, said the commission's
claims that the reformed CAP fits into the undertakings Brussels has
negotiated with the US under the Uruguay Round was based on 'chancy
techniques, optimistic interpretations, and arguable assertions'.
'I don't believe in miracles,' Mr Soisson said.
The current French government has threatened to veto the Washington
agreement, even though it is not clear whether it can do so under EC law -
unless it gets sufficient support from other member states. Leading members
of the centre-right opposition, who look poised for a landslide in the
elections, have spoken while on the stump of renegotiating both the
Washington agreement and CAP reform, and even of boycotting the EC if the
accord goes through.
Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, said last night that the
'compatibility' discussion was none the less 'very muted'. He said: 'It was
left in a very general haze. . . as is suitable for the next two weeks.'
By then the French elections will be over, and on April 5 EC foreign
ministers are expected to endorse the oilseeds part of the Washington
agreement. This is separate from the Uruguay Round proper. But Mr Rene
Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, believes a US on the trade offensive
against the EC might seek further concessions from the European agriculture
unless it is quickly 'banked'.
Mr Ray MacSharry, the agriculture commissioner who negotiated the Washington
accord, secured a deal allowing the EC to plant the same area of oilseeds as
envisaged under CAP reform, an outcome better than the 'bottom line' France
drew at the time.
France's main disagreement is on the commission's projections for cereals,
and in particular permitted levels of subsidised grains exports under the
Uruguay Round arrangements. It claims increases in productivity will push EC
output over the allowed limits by 1999.
But, as one senior UK official put it, 'the instruments are there under the
reformed CAP to allow for further adjustments. It's a little bit bogus to
sit down now and discuss cereals yields in 1999.'
Mr Gummer summed up the situation: 'everybody accepted that if you accepted
the (commission's) assumptions, then it was compatible; if you didn't, it
wasn't'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian wool market is continuing to ease steadily. Individual
woolgrowers are again attempting to stand out for more economic prices by
withdrawing wool either before or during each sale, but even with offerings
down by a third from amounts originally scheduled, prices are still drifting
to new low points for the season. The downward price trend itself helps to
check buying confidence which is already widely affected by recession in
major wool using countries, more particularly on the continent of Europe
during recent months.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: France seeks higher fish price
floor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE WILL today ask the European Commission's fisheries council meeting in
Brussels for a 30 per cent increase in the minimum prices imposed on fish
imports and for the suspension of imports of Russian cod.
Mr Charles Josselin, the French secretary of state for fish, announced these
proposals at yesterday morning's cabinet meeting in Paris. He said he also
planned to press the fisheries council to extend the minimum pricing system
to cover more types of fish.
However, Mr David Curry, UK fisheries minister, said that what was needed
was to ensure that the current minimum import price regime was enforced
properly.
Meanwhile French fishermen, who have for the past few weeks staged stormy
demonstrations against the increase in imports, stepped up the pressure on
the government on the eve of the Brussels meeting with a series of violent
protests throughout France.
More than 10,000 fishermen and their families marched in silence through the
streets of Quimper in Brittany carrying banners emblazoned with the slogans
'Do something. We're dying' and 'Fish in Distress'. The march ended with a
rowdy demonstration outside police headquarters when fishermen pelted the
building with missiles and rotting fish.
Riot police fired tear gas pellets at more than 800 militant fishermen in
Nantes following a violent scuffle, in which protesters bombarded the police
with stones, bottles and other makeshift missiles. Seven policemen were
injured in the violence.
There were also clashes in southern France. Riot police used tear gas to try
to calm a crowd of angry fishermen demonstrating in the old port of
Marseilles. A policemen was seriously injured in a clash with fishermen at
Bayonne when he was hit on the head by a missile.
Protest marches in Nimes and Montpellier ended with fishermen unleashing
cargoes of fish outside the town halls. In Bourdeaux fishermen handed out
free fish to passers-by during a peaceful demonstration.
The import problem is imposing intense financial pressure on the French
fishing industry. Credit Maritime Mutuel, the bank specialising in the fish
trade, yesterday called on the government to take action to alleviate the
financial problems now hitting many businesses.
Mr Curry, who met fishermen from Humberside in Brussels yesterday, said
Russian white fish imports were still coming into the Community via Denmark
and Germany.
He ruled out the possibility of a total ban on Russian fish. 'We've got to
be realistic,' he said. 'There's not going to be a majority in the Council
to impose a flat import ban.'
Instead he proposed:
Effective policing of the minimum import prices set last month by the
European Commission;
Enforcement of hygiene rules;
A re-examination of the tariffs and quotas agreed with the contries like
Norway and Iceland, members of the European Free Trade Association;
And a unilateral UK ban on British fishermen landing haddock and ungutted
white fish, to discourage the current glut of small fish that is pulling
down market prices.
Last October the UK set minimum landing sizes for whiting above EC sizes,
and is shortly expected to do the same with lobster.

London's May robusta COFFEE contract fell through support at Dollars 900 a
tonne to close at Dollars 882, down Dollars 27. Traders said the market was
now out of its trading range, and had a very bearish overtone. 'There are no
good signs in the market except for some fresh longs in New York,' said one.
Chicago WHEAT prices were sharply higher at midday on short covering by the
funds. The USDA targeted several African and Baltic countries for the sale
of 1.5m tonnes of EEP wheat, which must be registered before June 30.
SOYABEANS jumped higher on stop-loss buying as the market shed some
discontent regarding Russia's financial and political situation. New York
raw SUGAR futures were modestly higher at midday after choppy morning
trading that saw players unsure which side of the market they should be on.
Analysts said that after this week's volatile trading, a further corrective
fall to Friday's high of 10.67 cents a lb might be needed before the recent
upswing could resume.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME pre-market trading
prosposal raises storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STORM of protest has been raised by the London Metal Exchange Board's
decision to have a pre-market trading session on the market floor to mop up
the early morning business at present conducted via telephone links between
traders' offices.
One prominent LME trader, who asked not to be identified, described the
suggested move as 'a pointless exercise. I don't think there is any LME
ring-dealing member who sees any sense in it at all'. He said it was
'astounding' that the Board could have reached such a decision without first
fully consulting all members.
Mr Hans Murmann, managing director of Metallgesellschaft's London metals
trading subsidiary, said his company had previously studied the concept and
'we are not at all sure it is a good idea'.
He said it would take the LME closer to becoming a floor market or a
computerised market, both unsuitable ways for the exchange to operate. It
might also keep traders at the exchange for most of the day so that they
would miss the essential rapport with colleagues responsible for customer
liaison.
The LME Board said it hoped to have the new system operating before the end
of this year. It would bring more business to the exchange and would better
serve Far Eastern and Australasian clients.
Mr Murmann said it would be better for the LME to keep to two trading
sessions a day but to have the first earlier in the morning make life easier
for Far Eastern clients.
The Board acted after seeing a study by an LME external director into the
membership structure. This study followed complaints by ring-dealing members
that they were carrying a greater share of the burden of running the
exchange and facing more risks than non-ring dealing members, but not
getting commensurate returns.
Mr Raj Bagri, the LME's chairman, said yesterday that moving pre-market
trading to the floor of the exchange would switch business back from
non-ring to ring traders. Also, 'it will bring more transparency and
openness, which will be to the benefit of users of the exchange'.
He pointed out that more than half the LME ring-dealing organisations were
represented on the Board which had reached a unanimous decision to make the
change.
Mr Bagri said LME members would be consulted about the details of the
change. 'It is the very strong wish of the Board to implement this
proposal,' he added.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Debts force closure of
Dominican unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROSARIO DOMINICANA, the Dominican Republic's state-owned gold miner, has
been forced to close because of increasing debts and mounting production
costs. The company says its operations, centred on the Pueblo Viejo mine
near the city of Cotui, have been adversely affected by falling prices for
gold since 1985, and by steadily falling production.
The closure has angered the company's workers and their unions, and
paramilitary units have been posted at the mines as sacked employees plan
protests against the closure.
Rosario Dominicana says its best years were between 1980 and 1985. In 1980
it produced 370.94 troy ounces of gold and sold it at Dollars 612 an ounce.
In that year it also produced 1.6m ounces of silver, which was sold at
Dollars 19.59 an ounce.
Its gold production rose to 412.99 ounces in 1981, but that the price had
fallen to Dollars 460 an ounce. A significant decline in the company's
fortunes began after 1985 and in 1987 gold production of only 246.39 ounces
fetched Dollars 384 per ounce. Last year the average price it received for
gold was down to Dollars 343 an ounce and on March 10 this year it averaged
Dollars 326.3 an ounce.
The company says the fall in prices coincided with an accumulation of debts
that could not be serviced. The debt to foreign and local banks is Dollars
52.8m, while it owes the equivalent of Dollars 2.88m in production incentive
payments and bonuses to its workers for 1991 and 1992, and Dollars 36m to
its foreign and local contractors.
Operations have also been affected by increasing production costs. In the
past two years it cost the company an average of Dollars 535 to produce an
ounce of gold, with the average selling price being Dollars 352.
In closing its mines at Pueblo Viejo, the company is suspending 70 per cent
of its workforce and reducing the wages of those being kept on for routine
maintenance.
Senior government officials said yesterday that they were uncertain about
the duration of the closure of the company's mining operations. They said
the first priority would be studying the company's financial situation to
determine how its obligations to all its creditors could be met.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PLACER DOME, Canada's biggest gold producer, will almost certainly withdraw
from the Leonor copper project in Chile, according to Mr Peter McAleer,
chief executive of Equatorial Gold, the small Australian company that owns
the project.
Placer has until April 2 to decide whether to take up an option to earn 70
per cent of Leonor by spending USDollars 80m to bring the project into
production. Leonor, which is midway between Chuquicamata, the biggest copper
mine in the world, and Escondida, the third largest, is scheduled to produce
about 30,000 tonnes of copper in cathodes annually for 10 years.
Mr McAleer says he is 'very unhappy' with the lack of progress Placer has
made in assessing the project. 'Placer has not done the ground work
necessary to make a decision in April. In any case, I do not believe Placer
will want to focus on what for them is a relatively small operation.'
Since taking up its option on Leonor, Mr McAleer points out, Placer has
acquired a 50 per cent interest in the nearby Zaldivar copper project for
Dollars 100m and has committed itself to finding another Dollars 400m of
project finance to bring a mine into production. Zaldivar, in which Placer's
partner is Outokumpu of Finland, is forecast to produce more than 100,000
tonnes of copper a year at about 50 cents a lb for at least 20 years.
A Placer official yesterday denied that his company had not done enough work
to assess Leonor. However, he said that, while he could not anticipate
Placer's final decision, the future of Leonor depended on it being developed
with an adjoining property. 'Leonor on its own is not so attractive.'
Mr McAleer says talks have been held in the past with Antofagasta, the
mining, railways and water group, which owns the neighbouring Sorpresa
copper deposit. Both parties agreed that it made sense to combine Leonor and
Sorpresa into an operation that would produce 50,000 tonnes of copper a year
for 13 years. However, Antofagasta has withdrawn from negotiations and no
longer seems interested in the proposition.
Rather than delay the project for another year, which would probably be
necessary if Equatorial sought another big partner, his company will raise
equity and debt finance for the project in Chile and possibly from potential
Japanese customers.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG gold mine dispute settled

A DISPUTE over shareholdings in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea
ended yesterday when the government agreed to pay Kina 138.75m (Pounds 98m)
to increase its stake from 10 per cent to 25 per cent.
The deal will reduce the equity of the three Australian-controlled joint
venture partners - Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields and Highlands Gold, a
subsidiary of MIM Holdings - from 30 per cent each to 25 per cent each.
However, the government dropped claims that it had been misled by the joint
venturers about the potential profitability of Porgera, the biggest gold
mine outside South Africa.
Mr Masket Iangalio, mining minister, said the government accepted that the
joint venture partners did not withhold technical information before the
granting of mining approval in 1989. He said the government's decision to
seek further equity was taken to meet national priorities and ensure the
long-term stability of the project. 'No-one could argue that this is not a
good deal for PNG, he said.'
The government will pay for the additional 15 per cent stake from its share
of profits from the mine, probably over about 15 years.
The transaction will be free of tax, and the joint venture partners will be
allowed depreciation benefits until the shares are fully paid for. The
government will pay interest on the outstanding balance at 5 per cent a
year.
It has also agreed to resolve separate disputes about town site development,
access to the mine and security from attacks by local landowners.
The joint venture companies said they had agreed to pay for 75 per cent of a
K50m spending package over 10 years to improve infrastructure in Enga
province, the isolated region which surrounds the mine.
Joint venture officials said that the deal was 'pretty good, under the
circumstances'. The sale price of the shares is believed to be close to book
value after including the beneficial taxation effects.
Porgera, which began production in 1990, is expected to produce 1.4m troy
ounces of gold this year, and at least 900,000 ounces a year in the next
three years.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts stage rally as investors reassess
impact of Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices bounced back yesterday from Tuesday's losses as
investors reassessed the impact of the UK Budget. Longer-dated gilts, which
had lost more than a point the day before, gained most, leading to a further
flattening of the UK yield curve.
Helped by a firmer pound, the market shrugged off the unexpectedly large
public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn for next year, content
that at least the full-funding rule had been relaxed in order to allow
purchases of gilts by banks and building societies to count towards the
PSBR.
In addition, the Budget did not fuel fears of rising UK inflation, which
helped to keep a firm tone to the gilt market.
Longer-dated gilts gained most, with the yield on the 9 per cent stock due
2011 falling to 8.30 per cent from 8.33 per cent at the opening.
Shorter-dated stock, meanwhile, remained virtually unchanged. This was in
spite of a widespread belief that a steeper slope will need to be engineered
at the shorter end of the yield curve in order to persuade banks to buy more
gilts.
During the day, the Bank of England put more index-linked tap stocks on
sale. These were Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent stock due 2003 and and Pounds
100m of 2 1/2 per cent gilts due 2016.
CONTINENTAL European government bond markets eased in cautious trading
yesterday following the latest developments in the former Soviet republic of
Georgia and ahead of the Bundesbank's council meeting today. The German
central bank does not plan to hold a news conference after the meeting, but
traders still expect a half-point cut in its leading interest rates.
German government bonds fell on remarks by a member of the Bundesbank's
policy-making board that German inflation remained high, which dampened the
hopes of some traders for an interest rate cut today.
The fall in bund prices was steeper at the long end, which saw a drop of
just over  1/4 point, but the drop in the five-year area was limited to
around  1/8 point, traders said. The June bund future on Liffe fell to 95.88
from Tuesday's close of 96.13.
DUTCH government bond prices followed their German counterparts lower. The 7
per cent bond due 2003 fell 35 basis points to 103.18 to yield 6.55 per
cent, narrowing the yield gap below 10-year German paper to four from seven
basis points. After the close, the finance ministry said that sales of the
new Dutch state 10-year bond reached Fl 5.9bn at the end of its third day on
offer, putting the amount raised yesterday at Fl 4.5bn. Dealers expect tap
sales to reach Fl 10bn by the end of the week.
ITALIAN government bonds showed surprising resilience in the face of
weakness in other European bond markets. The price of the March BTP due 2003
rose marginally to 94.97 from 94.85. Traders said the market was underpinned
by news that wage inflation rose by an annual 2.8 per cent in January after
a 2.2 per cent rise in December. This compared with an annual growth of 4.3
per cent in consumer prices in January.
US TREASURY prices turned broadly higher yesterday afternoon, recovering
from their morning dive, which was triggered by news of unexpectedly high
inflation figures for February. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year
government bond was  1/8 higher at 103 5/32 , yielding 6.860 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also up  1/32 , to
yield 3.927 per cent.
The afternoon revival was prompted by the Treasury's announcement that it
will sell Dollars 15.25bn in two-year and Dollars 11bn in five-year notes
next week, which sparked retail buying.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Bonds: AfDB issue reflects demand for
long-dated paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW issues were concentrated in the Eurodollar sector yesterday, with other
areas of the international bond market quiet ahead of the Bundesbank's
council meeting today.
The triple A-rated African Development Bank (AfDB) launched its
widely-expected Dollars 500m Eurobond issue, though the choice of a 30-year
maturity surprised the market. The joint lead-manager, Goldman Sachs, said
the issue was the AfDB's largest and longest public deal to date.
The bonds were priced at 98.56 to yield 48 basis points over comparable US
Treasuries, at the lower end of the indicated range of 48 to 50 basis
points.
When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened slightly,
reflecting good investor demand for long-dated paper. Goldman Sachs reported
widespread demand for the bonds, from south-east Asia to Europe.
Mr Kofi Bucknor, the AfDB's treasurer, said that the longer-dated maturity
suited the bank's funding requirements, since it was essentially a long-term
lender. The 30-year life of the bonds reduced the bank's exposure to
interest rate volatility and enabled the bank to lock into historically low
interest rates, he said.
Mr Bucknor added that the AfDB planned a Y40bn 'samurai' issue in the
domestic Japanese bond market for foreign borrowers by mid-April.
A strong performance in the Tokyo stock market recently, and positive
sentiment towards the Japanese railway sector in particular, prompted
investors to snap up Keisei Electric Railway's Dollars 200m worth of
four-year warrant bonds. The bonds were priced at par, but immediately
jumped to 105 1/4 bid when they were freed to trade.
An official at the lead-manager, Nomura, said that the rise in the price of
the bonds reflected a lack of supply of this sort of instrument which is
geared to the Japanese equity market. The Nikkei average closed at the
year's high of 18,173.37 yesterday, up 205.07 on the day.
BAT Capital Corp, the US financing arm of BAT Industries, raised Dollars
400m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds which were priced at 99.57 to
yield 75 basis points over the comparable US Treasury.
Lead-manager CSFB said that the spread tightened to 73 basis points shortly
after the bonds were freed to trade.
Mr Richard Desmond, BAT's group treasurer, said that yesterday's transaction
was part of the company's strategy of issuing longer-term debt and retiring
commercial paper.
Mr Desmond added that the proceeds would be kept in dollars and that there
was no interest-rate swap associated with the bonds.
Elsewhere, HSBC Holdings raised Pounds 200m worth of subordinated Eurobonds
due 2018, which the lead manager, Samuel Montagu, said was the largest
long-dated subordinated issue to date in the Eurosterling sector.
HSBC Holdings, which announced its 1992 results earlier this week, went
ahead with its issue yesterday, encouraged by strong investor demand for
high-yielding, long-dated paper and the UK government bond market's recovery
from its initial nervous reaction to Tuesday's Budget. The bonds, which are
callable in 2013, were priced at 98.692 to yield 150 basis points above the
9 per cent UK gilt due 2012. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread
tightened slightly.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: CME chief in call for trading
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACK Sandner, head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, yesterday proposed
that the maze of agencies that oversee US securities trading be streamlined
into one body with cabinet-level status.
'Regulatory reform is necessary if the US is going to stay competitive in
the global market,' Mr Sandner said. Financial regulation costs the US
Dollars 80bn a year, including the cost of insuring bank deposits. He
claimed his plan could save Dollars 300m a year in administrative costs
alone.
Mr Sandner's proposal, outlined at the annual Futures Industry Association
conference in Boca Raton, Florida, would create a new 'super' department for
financial services regulation.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees exchange-traded
derivatives, the Securities and Exchange Commission governs equities and
other securities, while bank regulators account for over-the-counter swaps
and derivatives.
'This sounds like a pretty significant proposal,' said Mr Marc Lackritz,
president of the Securities Industry Association, the group that led the SEC
attack on the CFTC a few years ago.
Mr Sandner proposed to consolidate seven Washington agencies into a
cabinet-level department. The agencies include the CFTC, the SEC, the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (which insures brokerage house investors) and the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
He suggested the department be governed by a nine-member board and operate
in eight functional divisions. The divisions would address banking and
insurance, risk management, securities markets, and operational aspects such
as customer protection, customer insurance, disclosure and reporting and
prudential and systemic risk management.
The divisions would share legal, accounting and other administrative staffs,
and would have a separate administrative court to hear enforcement cases.
The plan will be presented to vice-president Al Gore, who heads the
'National Performance Review' that has been charged with reducing
duplication and waste in federal regulation.
The Clinton administration has not yet made appointments to head either the
CFTC or the SEC. The former CFTC chairwoman, Ms Wendy Gramm, stepped down in
January, and SEC chairman Mr Richard Breeden plans to leave his post next
month.
By April, both agencies, which usually have a four-person board plus a
commissioner, will be down to just three board members, with one acting as
commissioner.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: NEC heads for red but its mood
stays bright - Michiyo Nakamoto analyses problems facing Japan's leading
semiconductor producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a businessman who has just struggled through one of the worst years for
Japan's microchip industry, Mr Hajime Sasaki, NEC's vice-president in charge
of semiconductors, appears surprisingly relaxed about the company's
prospects.
Earlier this month, NEC forecast it would plunge into the red in the year to
March 31. Due to a downturn in demand for its products, including
semiconductors, NEC said it would incur consolidated pre-tax losses of Y40bn
(Dollars 338m). As recently as last November, it forecast profits of Y10bn.
During the year, NEC lost its ranking as the company with the largest share
of the world semiconductor market to Intel, the US company, according to
Dataquest, the market research and consultancy group.
In fact, NEC's plight contrasts sharply with the improving fortunes of
Intel, which last year increased sales by more than Dollars 1bn to Dollars
5.84bn and pre-tax profits by 31 per cent to Dollars 1.07bn. Motorola,
another US company, also had a strong year, increasing semiconductor revenue
by 22 per cent to Dollars 4.64bn.
The main reason for the hardship faced by Japanese semiconductor companies
is the steep fall in demand from the domestic market.
The Japanese market for semiconductor integrated circuits fell by nearly 12
per cent in 1992. In contrast, the US and Asia-Pacific semiconductor markets
grew by about 20 per cent. 'There has never before been such a regional gap
in consumption growth,' Mr Sasaki says.
NEC depends on its home market for 75 per cent of its sales. 'So, even if
exports grow, their impact is limited,' Mr Sasaki says.
Demand for semiconductors in Japan plunged as the main purchasers - the
consumer electronics, vehicle and personal computer (PC) industries  - saw
sales evaporate with the local economic slowdown.
PC sales fell by 10 per cent in 1992, while television and video tape
recorder sales shrank by 8 per cent and 12 per cent respectively, according
to the Electronics Industries Association of Japan. Demand for cars has been
so weak that Nissan, Japan's second-largest car producer, has been forced to
close one of its main plants.
Moreover, the US is expected to increase pressure on Japan to ensure foreign
semiconductor manufacturers get a larger share of the Japanese market when
market share figures for the fourth quarter of 1992 are announced this
month.
The outlook for Japanese semiconductors remains bleak, due to the continuing
slump in the consumer electronics industry and in capital investment by
domestic corporations.
However, Mr Sasaki is optimistic about NEC's prospects. 'We expect a 10 per
cent increase in worldwide demand for semiconductors.' Demand has picked up
strongly for dynamic random access memory chips (D-Rams), in particular,
where NEC has an advantage over other companies.
As research and development costs are large, it pays to be in the D-Ram
market only if a company can produce in large volumes. NEC is one of perhaps
five Japanese companies that does.
Mr Sasaki is also optimistic that the US will not impose sanctions, even if
foreign manufacturers fail to attain the 20 per cent market share targeted
by the US.
The US and Japanese semiconductor industries have become so closely
intertwined that imposing sanctions on Japan would impact on US companies as
well, he says.
For example, NEC has a design and manufacturing agreement with MIPS, the US
company, on reduced instruction set computing (Risc) chips, a deal with
Micron Semiconductor to sell each others' memory products, and is talking to
American Tele-phone &amp; Telegraph about developing quarter-micron technology
for future generation 256-megabit memory chips.
NEC announced this month it would drastically reduce production of its own
1Mbit D-Ram and compensate for this by increasing imports from Micron
Technology of the US. The move not only helps NEC open up plant space for
4Mbit D-Ram production, which is expected to peak next year, but is also
aimed at defusing trade friction with the US.
Meanwhile, further alliances are likely between Japanese semiconductor
makers as a way of sharing research and development costs.
NEC is also carrying out a programme to halve costs in its semiconductor
operations by 1994. This includes designing products requiring fewer steps
in the manufacturing process, to allow a reduction in factory space and
equipment.
However, analysts are asking whether these moves are sufficient. Mr Shigeru
Yoshinaka, semiconductor analyst at BZW, points out that NEC has invested
heavily in D-Ram production but, ironically, its relatively lower dependence
on D-Ram revenue means it is unable to benefit from demand for memory chips
to the same extent as its competitors,
NEC, meanwhile, depends for about one-third of its semiconductor business on
the audio-visual market, which is unlikely to pick up in the near future.
While NEC's large size may give it advantages in good times, it also means
that, in an economic slowdown, the impact is larger. 'Being a giant, it
needs very big customer bases' to use up its capacity, says Mr Mike Jeremy,
analyst at Baring Securities in Japan.
It is not easy for a generalist company like NEC merely to withdraw from
semiconductor products that do not bring high rewards and to focus on where
the profits are, Mr Jeremy points out. If the Japanese economy fails to pick
up, NEC may find that darker days are yet to come.

COMPTOIRS Modernes, one of France's larger food retailing groups, last year
bucked the trend in the French retail sector to increase net consolidated
profits by 9.6 per cent to FFr335m in 1992, from FFr306m in 1991
The group, which owns the Stoc supermarket chain and Commod food stores, saw
sales rise by 6.8 per cent to FFr22.6bn in 1992, from FFr21.2bn in 1991, and
operating profits increase by 20.6 per cent to FFr623m, from FFr516m over
the same period.
Mr Jean-Claude Plassart, chairman, said he was confident about the group's
prospects for 1993, despite the difficult economic environment. Comptoirs
Modernes plans to continue its strategy of opening new stores and
modernising old outlets. It plans to invest in its distribution system.
It is also developing the Merca Plus hypermarket chain in Spain, where it
opened three new stores last year.
The latest candidate in French retailing for acquisition is Prisunic, a
large chain of supermarkets owned by the Pinault-Printemps retail group.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Minorco shake-up continues as
another chief resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER SENIOR executive has suddenly quit Minorco, the Luxembourg-based
overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa.
Mr Geoff Mortimer, 49, was recruited two years ago as managing director of
Minorco's industrial minerals division after the company paid Dollars 108m
for the Elbekies sand and gravel business near Berlin in former east
Germany.
His departure follows Minorco's top-level shake-up in December. Then, Mr
Roger Phillimore, a joint managing director, left, having lost a contest for
the chief executive's role to Mr Hank Slack.
Minorco made no mention of the departure of Mr Mortimer, formerly managing
director of ARC's UK aggregates operations, when it released its half-year
results yesterday.
These revealed a sharp jump in operating earnings from the industrial
minerals business - from Dollars 0.3m to Dollars 23m in the six months to
December 31.
Minorco said Mr Mortimer had 'gone back to consulting. We are very sad to
see him go.' He will be replaced by another former ARC executive, Mr John
Draper.
Minorco reported that its financial income, plus earnings from
equity-accounted investments, more than offset its operating losses in the
half-year to December 31.
Earnings before extraordinary items were USDollars 101.4m, or 60 cents a
share, 3 per cent ahead of the Dollars 98m, or 58 cents, in the first-half.
This was in line with many analysts' expectations.
The interim dividend is boosted by 6 per cent, from 18 cents to 19 cents a
share.
After spending more than Dollars 1bn in the past five years, Minorco still
has net cash and short-term investments of just over Dollars 1bn. Interest
from this, less corporate and exploration expenses, contributed Dollars
59.6m in the half-year, down from Dollars 65.5m, and Minorco's share of
equity-accounted investments brought in Dollars 52.6m, up from Dollars 44m.
Minorco's gold operations, mainly Independence Mining in Nevada, suffered an
operating loss of Dollars 13.1m, compared with a profit of Dollars 4.2m, and
the operating loss at the Terra fertiliser business in the US rose to
Dollars 23.2m, from Dollars 11.5m. The Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting base
metals subsidiary increased operating profits from Dollars 3.1m to Dollars
10.4m.
During the half-year, Minorco spent Dollars 104m to take an interest in the
Collahausi copper project in Chile, and Dollars 127m went to develop
existing businesses.

<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S pulp and paper companies had a mixed 1992, with two of the top
three reporting sharply lower-than-anticipated net profits as they finalised
plans to raise new finance.
Although no figures have officially been released, executives of Indah Kiat,
the largest integrated pulp and paper producer in south-east Asia, say the
company made a net profit last year of Rp121bn (Dollars 58.6m), down from
Rp159.9bn in 1991.
Tjiwi Kimia, the country's leading paper manufacturer, has indicated a net
profit in 1992 of Rp60bn, down from Rp81.7bn in 1991 and below broker's
forecasts.
The best results come from Indorayon, the country's second-largest pulp
producer, which has told brokers it made a net profit of Rp92bn last year,
up from Rp69.9bn in 1991. The company plans to increase pulp production 41
per cent this year to 240,000 tonnes and to bring on stream a 30,000 tonne a
year rayon plant.
Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia, both majority-owned by the Sinar Mas
conglomerate, plan a financial restructuring.
Tjiwi Kimia is close to securing a Dollars 110m syndicated loan, led by the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank's private sector
arm. The loan should ease the company's debt burden - last September, it had
bank loans and long-term debt of Rp822bn and a 218 per cent debt to equity
gearing - by replacing high-interest Indonesian rupiah loans with
lower-interest foreign loans. Brokers say a rights issue to provide the IFC
with an equity stake is also being considered.
Indah Kiat, which last June had bank loans and long-term debt of Rp691bn and
gearing of 48 per cent, intends to raise up to Dollars 100m through a
private offshore placement of bonds with institutional investors, brokers
say.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MAHMOUD al-Nouri, chief executive of Grupo Torras, the Kuwait Investment
Office's troubled holding company in Spain, has resigned as chairman of the
group's paper unit, Torras Papel. His surprise move underlines the
increasing uncertainty that surrounds the KIO's Spanish business operations.
Torras Papel, the leading domestic newsprint and writing paper producer, is
under severe pressure from two of its main creditors, Lloyds Bank and Bank
of America, the UK and US banks. It is also facing legal proceedings by
Sarrio, the Italian-owned cardboard producer, over outstanding debts
totalling Pta8.6bn (Dollars 72m).
Quelling rumours that Torras Papel might be forced into receivership, Mr
al-Nouri said that the paper producer was 'on the right track' to financial
recovery and that he had left the company in order to 'concentrate on the
overall strategy of Grupo Torras.'
However, Lloyds and Bank of America are insisting on the rapid payment of
overdue interest and Lloyds, which is owed Pta250m on a Pta2.5bn loan, has
already obtained a court order in Spain embargoing Torras Papel assets.
Payment of the interest is understood to be dependent on the sale of Grupo
Torras' insurance unit, Amaya, but this unit has, in turn, been embargoed by
the regional government of Catalonia, which is claiming unpaid back taxes.
Lloyds and Bank of America have part of their loans to Torras Papel secured
by shares in the Kuwaiti group's food company Ebro Agricolas, but plans for
the latter's sale appear to have stalled.
Sarrio's lawsuit centres on two outstanding instalments owed by the Kuwaiti
group following the purchase by Torras Papel of Sarrio's paper assets in
February 1991.

JARDINE International Motor, the car distribution arm of the Jardine group,
yesterday surprised the Hong Kong market with a 145.5 per cent rise in net
1992 earnings to USDollars 59.4m, from USDollars 24.2m in 1991.
Turnover advanced 44 per cent to USDollars 910.9m.
The directors recommended a final dividend of 4.95 cents per share, making
6.01 cents for the year - nearly 52 per cent up on 1991.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said the record profits resulted from 'excellent
sales' of Mercedes-Benz passenger cars in Hong Kong and China.
The results for these markets reached record levels, led by outstanding
sales of the new Mercedes-Benz 'S' class models.

after financial items in 1992, writes Christopher Brown-Humes
The result was also blighted by floating exchange rates, a Finnish travel

The group is scrapping its dividend, after paying FM1.20 a share in 1991

AGA, the Swedish industrial gas group, saw profits after financial items
rise 3 per cent in 1992 to SKr1.48bn (Dollars 189m), and predicted a further
improvement in its performance this year.
The dividend is being increased to SKr9 per share from SKr8.50.
Turnover fell to SKr11.9bn from SKr12.7bn, despite improved sales from both
its core gas operations and Frigoscandia, its cold storage and food
processing business.
The drop reflected the group's 1992 merger of its Uddeholm energy unit,
which contributed SKr1.37bn to 1991 sales, with Swedish power group
Gullspangs Kraft. Aga has 34 per cent of the capital of the merged group,
which it reports as an associate company.
Group operating income fell to SKr1.29bn from SKr1.46bn in 1991 when the
group's energy operations made a SKr118m contribution. However, financial
income amounted to SKr188m, compared with SKr27m in costs last year.
Despite recession in many markets, and particularly in the Nordic countries,
gas sales rose 5 per cent to SKr8.97bn and operating income was up 2 per
cent at SKr1.16bn.
Frigoscandia saw sales climb 3 per cent to SKr2.91bn, but operating income
dropped 35 per cent to SKr130m. This reflected fierce competition and
reduced margins within the group's food process systems unit.
The group's confidence for 1993 is based on its rationalisation programme,
the weakness of the Swedish krona, and the development of new areas of
application for its products.

EARNINGS of Thomson Corp, the Canadian-owned travel and publishing group,
rose by 15 per cent last year before taking into account
previously-announced charges against its UK and North Amer-ican newspaper
opera-tions.
The charges, totalling USDollars 170m, pulled net earnings down to Dollars
166m, or 30 cents a share, from Dollars 292m, or 53 cents, in 1991, but
dividends remained unchanged.
Revenues rose to Dollars 5.98bn from Dollars 5.59bn.
The main boost to last year's earnings came from the information and
publishing division, whose operating profit climbed by 10 per cent to
Dollars 401m, equal to 56 per cent of the total.
New acquisitions contributed a 3.6 per cent increase, with the rest coming
from growth of existing businesses. The company said overall opera-ting
margins were maintain-ed.
The information and publishing business accounted for the entire Dollars
336m spent by Thomson on acquisitions last year, which was double the 1991
acquisition budget.
The company said that the results of its two biggest purchases, Institute
for Scientific Information and Micromedex, both exceeded expectations.
UK regional newspapers achieved 'substantial growth' in profits and margins.
But the UK-based free newspapers incurred significantly higher operating
losses. Thomson is planning to sell or close a number of its free sheets,
and Dollars 60m of the special impairment charge relates to these titles.
Thomson Travel, the UK's biggest tour operator, reported an increase in
operating income to Dollars 115m from Dollars 101m. The figures include
profits of Dollars 12m and Dollars 5m respectively from the sale of aircraft
by Britannia Airways.
Thomson Tour Operations sold 3.3m holidays in 1992, up 10 per cent from
1991. But fierce discounting last summer pushed down profits
'substantially'.
The company said the market for summer 1993 holidays remains 'as competitive
as that experienced last year'. TTO said it expected to sell a similar
number of holidays as last year, with market share remaining about the same.
In the light of the recent hostile takeover bid for Owners Abroad, the
second-biggest tour operator, Thomson Travel affirmed its policy of
remaining the leader 'whether measured by size, quality or profitability' in
all markets in which it operates. 'We will not allow our competitive
position to be eroded,' the company said.
Owners Abroad this week succeeded in staving off the protracted Pounds 290m
(Dollars 412m) bid by Airtours. The travel industry had predicted that
Thomson would launch a ferocious price war had the Airtours bid succeeded.

CARNIVAL Cruise Lines, the Miami-based company which claims to be the
world's largest cruise ship operator in terms of passengers carried, said
yesterday that it was considering a 'strategic alliance' with Epirotiki
Lines and Dolphin Cruise Line.
Epirotiki operates 11 ships, primarily in the Mediterranean and around the
Aegean. Dolphin is a smaller, Florida-based operator, with three vessels.
The three businesses have already agreed to form a new company, in which
each will hold a one-third interest. Carnival will sell its Mardi Gras
cruise ship to the venture. The ship, renamed the Olympic, will be deployed
in the eastern Mediterranean and operated by Epirotiki.
Carnival, quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, operates 19 ships, and is
biased towards the Caribbean, although it also offers packages to Alaska and
other parts of the world. It has been a leading force in the trend towards
'mega-ships,' capable of carrying more than 2,000 passengers.

It has set aside IKr5.8bn provisions for credit losses, and its

NATIONSBANK, the large US regional banking group formed in 1991 by the
merger of C &amp; S Sovran and NCNB, yesterday announced a move into the booming
financial derivatives market.
NationsBank, the fourth-largest US banking group, said it had acquired - for
Dollars 225m in cash - Chicago Research &amp; Trading Group, one of the biggest
proprietary options market-making and trading firms.
Mr Hugh McColl, chairman of NationsBank, said the deal would significantly
enhance the bank's ability to serve its corporate and institutional
customers.
The bank said the acquisition would enable it to offer a broad array of
risk-management products.
CRT, founded in 1977, has 750 employees and Dollars 250m in capital. It owns
more than 150 memberships on 19 futures and options exchanges around the
world and trades about 75 different options and futures contracts, and needs
to bolster its capital base.
The purchase allows CRT to compete directly with the investments banks that
dominate over-the-counter trading of derivative products such as interest
rate and currency swaps. CRT will also benefit from NationsBank's client
list.
Mr Philip Hubbard, who runs CRT, said an increasing portion of derivatives
trading was now taking place away from exchange trading floors.
In 1992 NationsBank recorded Dollars 1.15bn of net earnings, more than five
times the previous year's level.
The bank's earnings had been held back in 1991 by heavy merger-related
restructuring charges and provisions for bad and doubtful debts.

ARACRUZ Celulose, Brazil's leading pulp producer, recorded profits last year
of Dollars 18m - taking the company back into the black after heavy losses
in 1991 - in spite of the country's continuing economic difficulties.
Much of the turnround was due to a large increase in sales from 763,000 to
977,000 tonnes, bringing in Dollars 460m and representing 23 per cent of
world production in bleached eucalyptus pulp. More than 80 per cent of
output was export-ed.
Mr Mauro Molchansky, finance director, said the company was helped by an
average 7 per cent increase in world prices and a reduction of financial
costs through an injection of capital of Dollars 270m, half raised on the
Brazilian stock market and half through ADRs in New York.
Sadia, a leading Brazilian agribusiness concern, suffered a decline profits
to Dollars 28.3m, down by about 40 per cent on the 1991 figure of Dollars
45.8m, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.
Sadia is Brazil's leading producer of poultry, beef, and industrialised meat
and pork products and second in soya output.
