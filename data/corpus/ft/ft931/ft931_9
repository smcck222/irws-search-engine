FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Effjohn sinks to FM261m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTENSE competition on its key Baltic sailing routes sent Effjohn, the
Helsinki-based shipping group, plunging to a FM261m (Dollars 43.21m) loss
after financial items in 1992.
The result was also blighted by floating exchange rates, a Finnish travel
tax, and heavy interest payments following extensive investments in new
tonnage.
The group is scrapping its dividend, after paying FM1.20 a share in 1991
when it made FM4m profit after financial items.
Turnover rose 10 per cent to FM3.73bn, due to increased passenger traffic.
The group's main operation, Silja Line, suffered a loss because of severe
competition on its passenger routes between Finland and Sweden.

<TEXT>
USG, the parent company of US Gypsum, North America's largest gypsum
producer, filed a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganisation plan
yesterday which it said would cut its debt obligations by about Dollars
1.4bn and reduce annual interest requirements by about Dollars 200m, Reuter
reports from Wilmington.
It said the ownership interests of current stockholders would be diluted
significantly. The plan also calls for a restructuring of bank debt.
Under a pre-packaged scheme, a company reaches agreement on a restructuring
with its creditors before filing for bankruptcy, minimising the time it
spends under the authority of the court.
'USG has solicited and received sufficient acceptances to confirm the
pre-packaged plan, one of the largest pre-packaged reorganisations to date,'
said Mr Richard Fleming, USG vice-president and treasurer.
He added that 'USG's primary goal is to emerge from Chapter 11 as quickly as
possible and to minimise the impact on our employees, our unimpaired
creditors and our operating subsidiaries.'
USG listed assets of Dollars 1.8bn and liabilities of Dollars 3.1bn,
including Dollars 1.7bn in unsecured debt.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bayer warns on prices as sales
slide

WORLDWIDE sales of Bayer, the German chemicals giant, fell by 11 per cent in
the first two months of this year, the company said yesterday.
Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman, said there was no prospect of a recovery in
Europe during 1993. He warned that prices worldwide might fall by 1.5 per
cent during the year.
Sales in Germany were down 8 per cent so far this year. In the last quarter
of 1992, pre-tax profits in Bayer's German subsidiary halved.
Worldwide pretax profits for the fourth quarter fell 17 per cent to DM469m,
on sales down 4.4 per cent at DM9.45bn. For the year, group profits fell 16
per cent to DM2.7bn, on turnover down 2.8 per cent. The dividend was cut
from DM13 to DM11 a share.
Bayer's German pre-tax profits for the year were down 27.6 per cent at
DM1.33bn on sales down 3.2 per cent at DM17.5bn.
The decline in turnover was accentuated by the strength of the D-Mark, which
reduced sales by 3 per cent, Mr Schneider said.
Volume growth last year of 1.9 per cent - equivalent to DM800m - was offset
by price falls of nearly 2 per cent. Polymers, organic chemicals and
industrial chemicals registered the largest drop in prices.
Healthcare, which includes pharmaceuticals, non-prescription medicines and
diagnostics, generated operating profits of DM1.82bn. It was the only
division to report an increase in sales - up 1.4 per cent at DM9bn.
Agrochemicals results fell 21 per cent to DM378m, on sales down 3.5 per cent
at DM5.15bn. The polymers division posted a trading loss of DM37m, on
turnover down 7.5 per cent at DM7.2bn.
Industrial products which include polyurethanes and pigments, generated an
operating profit down 34.7 per cent at DM275m on sales down 2.6 per cent at
DM7.6bn. The organic products division reported operating profits down 14.8
per cent at DM121m on sales down 5.1 per cent at DM5.4bn. The sector
suffered from a downturn in the textile sector and increased competition
from Asian groups.
The company is cutting 230 jobs at its Dralon plants at Dormagen, Germany.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa's marketing director
quits suddenly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA'S passenger marketing and sales director resigned abruptly
yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes.
Mr Ernst-Adrian von Dornberg, 40, and a full board member for just over two
years, quit during a meeting of the state-controlled airline's supervisory
board in Cologne.
No reason was given. 'The meeting is still going on,' a spokesman said last
night. No successor was named.
Mr von Dornberg may have fallen victim to in-fighting which is believed to
have broken out in the wake of a critical study of Lufthansa carried out by
the McKinsey management consultancy.
In contrast to the management's forecasts that its current cost-cutting and
reorganisation programme would bring the airline back into profit by 1994,
the report said it was doomed to making heavy operating losses until at
least 1996.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Removing catastrophe from crisis
 -Paul Abrahams examines attempts to stave off the gloom at Bayer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAYER, the first of the German chemicals giants to report full-year results
for 1992, yesterday painted a gloomy picture of the European economy's
outlook.
Mr Manfred Schneider, the chairman said: 'The start of the year has been
anything but satisfactory. Crisis is a productive state. We just have to
remove the sense of catastrophe that goes with it.'
Preliminary figures for the first half of March suggested that
month-on-month sales figures had stabilised, however. Over the year, Bayer
expected a fall of German sales of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent.
Worldwide sales for the year would improve on the 11 per cent fall during
the first two months, he said. But he cautioned that only last autumn the
Bayer board had expected 3 per cent growth in group sales for 1993.
Bayer announced a reduced working schedule for 3,000 employees following a
collapse in demand for dyes, coating raw materials and polyurethanes.
Chemicals plant operating rates fell below 70 per cent during February, the
first time they had done so since the early 1980s.
The company is looking for the first time at possible swaps or joint
ventures with other companies, said Mr Schneider. Candidates included
polyurethanes, polymers, titanium dioxide, chromium, dyestuffs and organic
chemicals.
'This is a change of mentality. In the past, we have been reserved about
such options, but we are now open to this type of deal - they are a good
method for dealing with structural problems,' said Mr Schneider.
At the same time, he said, the group intends to increase its capital
investment in Asia, particularly China, Taiwan and Indonesia.
The company's position had been exacerbated by the German health reforms,
introduced in January. Their effects had been far worse than expected.
He warned: 'If Germany really does become a country of generic drugs and
cut-price medicines, there is no real future for research-based healthcare
companies in this country.'
Deteriorating conditions in Germany could force Bayer to concentrate abroad,
he said, primarily the US and Japan. Drug sales in Germany had fallen by
between 20 per cent and 40 per cent during January and February, clipping
DM35m off operating profits.
Mr Schneider said he expected the healthcare division to report static
profits during 1993 because of the reforms. The company will be cutting
expenditure on drugs marketing.

FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Grolsch climbs 3.6% over year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROLSCH, the Dutch brewery group, posted a 3.6 per cent rise in net profit
in 1992, with the recession in the UK and the economic slowdown in Germany
overshadowing more buoyant results in the Netherlands and on other export
markets.
Net profit increased to Fl 43.4m (Dollars 23.2m) from Fl 41.9m in 1991, when
the rate of profit growth had totalled 10.6 per cent. Volume sales expanded
domestically, in the US and in other export markets.
But in the UK, where it acquired Ruddles, the brewer, in early 1992, the
company faced reduced beer volumes and adverse currency movements caused by
sterling's autumn devaluation. In Germany sales volume also fell under the
combined influence of the economic downturn and the winding down of the 'B'
brands of the Wickuler group, acquired by Grolsch in 1991.
The annual dividend is to be raised by 3.8 per cent to Fl 5.40, which
compares with the previous year's 10.6 per cent rise.
The company also announced plans for a five-for-one share split.
Group operating profit rose by 15.3 per cent to Fl 64.3m. But the
acquisitions of Ruddles and investments in Wickuler added a net Fl 8.9m to
interest charges. Overall, Grolsch incurred net financial expenses of Fl
3.6m, a reversal of the previous year when it had posted net financial
income of Fl 5.2m.
Results in 1993 are expected to match those for 1992, provided that there is
no deepening of the recession or adverse movement in exchange rates, Grolsch
said.

THE EAST Asiatic Company, the shipping and international trading group,

according to Mr Michael Fiorini, the chief executive, writes Hilary Barnes
in Copenhagen.
The company fell into the red last year with a loss of DKr1.18bn (Dollars
184m), compared with a profit of DKr245m in the previous 12 months. The loss
cuts EAC's equity capital from DKr3.14bn in 1991 to DKr1.75bn last year. EAC
will not pay a dividend this year after a 9 per cent pay-out in 1991.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: GPG ready to bid for Brown Shipley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle for New Zealand entrepreneur
Sir Ron Brierley, said last night it was considering a full cash bid for
Brown Shipley Holdings, the investment and broking business, which would top
by 5p the 30p per share offer from Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise.
GPG has built up a large shareholding in BSH since KBL made its offer, which
valued BSH at Pounds 4.8m, last month. The KBL bid came after it emerged
that the Luxembourg bank had potential claims of Pounds 2.4m over BSH
arising from its purchase last year of Brown Shipley and Co, the merchant
bank.
GPG said it now held 29.98 per cent of BSH following a further purchase
yesterday. It said it proposed to make a full bid, valuing BSH at Pounds
5.6m, subject to the condition that it received all information on BSH which
KBL had received and that 'this information is satisfactory to GPG'.
Mr William Dacombe, chairman of BSH, said his board, which has already
recommended the KBL bid, would consider the GPG offer very seriously if and
when it was made. He said the board's response would depend on KBL's
reaction.
KBL had extended the deadline for its original bid until today. Last week it
said it had added acceptances of 1.4 per cent of BSH shares to its earlier
holding of 29.8 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chieftain Group, the USM-quoted supplier of specialist insulation and
fireproofing services, blamed recession in the building and construction
sectors for a 42 per cent decline in profits for 1992.
The fall, from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 613,000 pre-tax - in line with the
company's forecast - came on turnover ahead at Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 14.4m).
The position was exacerbated by delays in completion of a number of sizeable
contracts.
Pressure on margins and reduced demand have led to the closure of the
group's loss-making outlets in Watford and Port Talbot.
Chieftain ended the year with 'minimal gearing' and a firm order book
according to Mr Peter Wardle, chairman.
Earnings per share fell to 4.63p (8.27p) but the proposed final dividend is
maintained at 3p, lifting the total to 5.1p (4.9p).

Earnings per share dropped from 7.2p to 3.8p. The final dividend is halved

Property provisions of Pounds 250,000 pushed Dunton Group, the brick
manufacturer and civil engineer, deeper into the red with a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 852,000 for the six months to November 30, against Pounds 252,000
last time.
Mr Clive Travers, chairman, said the board considered it prudent to make the
provisions in the light of the continuing weak demand for commercial
property.
The outcome was also affected by infrastructure costs at the joint venture
at Barton-Le-Clay, and the cost of relocating its storage business to larger
premises, neither of which will be repeated in the current year.
Interest charges took Pounds 694,000 (Pounds 751,000) and with no tax (same)
losses per share increased from 0.54p to 1.73p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Molynx Holdings shares fell by 24 per cent, from 25p to 19p, yesterday, as
the closed circuit television and computerised environmental control systems
maker warned of an expected pre-tax loss of about Pounds 500,000 for 1992.
It does not expect to recommend payment of a final dividend.
Contrary to its earlier expectations, trading in the second half of 1992 had
been severely affected by a disappointing performance from its US and German
subsidiaries, the company said.
A rationalisation programme had been implemented to bring costs at those
companies in line with the reduced trading levels.
Trading in the UK, Belgium and Norway had been satisfactory.
In the first half of 1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 45,000 were reported and
in 1991 the company made Pounds 1.92m.
Molynx's results are expected at the end of April.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: S Daniels improves in second half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved trading in the second six months at S Daniels, an importer and
distributor for the food industry, resulted in a reduced pre-tax loss of
Pounds 64,000 for 1992, compared with Pounds 105,000 in the first six months
and Pounds 158,000 in 1991.
The results have been prepared under the FRS 3 accounting principles.
Turnover of continuing operations increased from Pounds 29.8m to Pounds
32.3m.
The loss was struck after a Pounds 101,000 deficit on disposal of
discontinued operations, less a 1991 provision of Pounds 110,000.
The dividend is held at 0.25p. Losses per share were halved to 1p.

James Fisher, the Cumbria-based shipping group, yesterday accompanied
sharply reduced annual profit and dividend with a gloomy statement on
current trading.
Despite a reduced deficit of Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.99m) from port operations,
a lower contribution from the shipping side of Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 3.8m)
and interest payable of Pounds 1.06m (Pounds 674,251) left the pre-tax line
for the 12 months to end-December at Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 2.11m).
The outcome was struck after exceptional credits of Pounds 194,140 (Pounds
603,104) and came on overall turnover of Pounds 31.1m (Pounds 30.1m).
The final dividend is just 0.5p for a total of 1p (5.5p), payable from
earnings of 2.66p (6.84p) per share.

Platon International, the USM-quoted instrumentation group fighting a

suitor yesterday after Wills again urged shareholders to support its
all-paper offer which closes tomorrow.
Wills, an industrial, electronic and automotive products company, wrote to
shareholders yesterday urging them to ignore the 'weak arguments' contained
in Platon's defence document, which was issued at the weekend.
In response Mr Robin Meyer, Platon's chairman, defended the document which
he said had 'delivered a powerful and stinging response to Wills
opportunistic and derisory offer.'

A setback in its textile activities was behind a 20 per cent annual profits
contraction at British Mohair Holdings.
On turnover ahead from Pounds 36.5m to Pounds 39.2m, pre-tax profits in 1992
amounted to Pounds 2.1m, down from Pounds 2.62m last time.
Mr Charles Fenton, chairman, said that both British Mohair Spinners and Geo
Ackroyd had suffered from reduced activity. Any improvement in profit was
unlikely until trading levels increased.

SHARES IN Campari Inter-national plunged 61p to 230p yesterday after the
sporting leisurewear group warned that its 1992 profits would be below
market expectations, with a fall from Pounds 5.27m to 'not less than Pounds
1m'.
The company said that trading conditions had been particularly difficult
towards the end of 1992, while in addition, a decision to change the basis
of stock provisioning would give rise to a charge of some Pounds 1.5m in
excess of the previous year.
Despite the expected profits shortfall, Campari said it intended to maintain
the total dividend at 12p.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Building and Engin-eering Appliances, the enlarged building related
equipment and services group, returned to the black and to the dividend list
in the six months to December 31.
With turnover up from Pounds 1.68m to Pounds 21m, reflecting the
acquisitions under the new management which took over in June 1992, the
group turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.41m for the period compared with
Pounds 397,000 losses last time.
Mr Graham Brealey, chairman, announced that in difficult trading conditions
the group achieved all its targets in the period - accordingly, it is paying
an interim dividend of 2.5p (nil).
Earnings per share were 8.4p (22p losses).
Mr Brealey said that enquiry levels for the second quarter showed a
considerable upturn and if the rate of conversion to orders remained at
present levels, then the second six months should see an upturn in the level
of work achieved.
Interim results were after a bad debt write-off of Pounds 234,000 which
arose from one of the group's customers being forced into receivership.
Net assets at end-December were Pounds 26m with cash balances of Pounds
500,000. Total borrowings were Pounds 2.9m - including finance leases -
giving gearing of 11 per cent.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec shares near low point after
resignations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Hi-Tec Sports, the sports and leisure wear company, yesterday
headed back towards their all time low - touched in January - as the market
reflected on Tuesday's resignation of the company's two newly appointed
non-executive directors.
Sir Michael Edwardes, former chairman of British Leyland, and Mr Richard
Fenhalls, chief executive of Henry Ansbacher, joined the Hi-Tec board in
January and their sudden departure was largely overlooked by the stock
market, which was concentrating on the Budget.
Yesterday the shares fell 5p to 40p, after touching 35p, just 5p above their
all time low of 30p. Analysts said the departure of the two non-executives
had raised worries about how Hi-Tec was managed and its trading outlook.
'When non-executives of this calibre resign simultaneously, one obviously
draws a negative conclusion,' one analyst said. Hi-Tec's position was not
helped by the refusal of both sides to comment on the resignations.
Sir Michael and Mr Fenhalls were appointed by Hi-Tec chairman and 54 per
cent shareholder Mr Frank van Wezel. Mr van Wezel last year came under
pressure from institutional shareholders who feared he had too much control
over the company.
But his choice of such high profile non-executives looks strange, as does
their agreement to work under a man with a reputation for getting his own
way. 'Both sides could be accused of naivety,' one observer said. 'It seems
they were unable to work together from the start and had different opinions
of each others' roles,' another said.
Hi-Tec's advisers stressed the company's trading situation had not declined
in recent months. The company's broker Hoare Govett expects a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 3m for the year just ended, but said the US market has started to
improve and 1994 is forecast to see Hi-Tec return to a profit of about
Pounds 4m.

<TEXT>
PREMIER Consolidated Oilfields lifted pre-tax profits for the 12 months to
December 31 to Pounds 16.8m.
The outcome fell at the top end of analysts' expectations and the share
price firmed 1p to 30 1/2 p.
The result compared with Pounds 9.64m for the previous nine months period.
The company's oil production reached a peak of 13,888 barrels a day as
increased output at the Wytch Farm onshore oilfield and the Angus field in
the North Sea came on stream.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 56m, including Pounds 53.2m from the UK; the
comparative figure was Pounds 32m, of which Pounds 29.9m was in the UK.
Earnings per share were 2.9p against 1.72p. There is again no dividend but a
1-for-20 scrip issue is proposed.
'Our cash flow is quite robust,' said Mr Charles Jamieson, chief executive,
but he added that the company had decided not to pay a cash dividend for two
reasons: the penalty it could incur on advance corporation tax, which it
doesn't pay, and the need to fund future exploration.
He pointed to three developments that will add 45m barrels of oil equivalent
(which includes gas) to the company's reserves over the next three years:
the development of offshore drilling at Wytch Farm, the Fife oilfield in the
North Sea and the Qadirpur field in Pakistan.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe's advance helped by acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWTHORPE, the international electronic and electrical components group,
increased pre-tax profits by 5.8 per cent last year, helped by acquisitions
and strong operating profits from its UK and US-based operations.
The group lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 40.3m to Pounds 42.7m over 1992
on turnover ahead 20 per cent to Pounds 265.4m (Pounds 220.5m).
Mr Colin McCarthy, finance director, said that about 9 percentage points of
the turnover advance came from acquisitions, about the same proportion was
attributable to organic growth and 2 percentage points reflected foreign
exchange translation gains.
Overall, he said, translation gains resulting from sterling's devaluation
added about Pounds 900,000 to trading profits and would add about Pounds 5m
in 1993 if currencies remain at current levels.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 42.3m (Pounds 38.5m) while interest
receipts fell to Pounds 381,000 (Pounds 1.8m). Operating profits jumped 36
per cent in the UK, were up 22 per cent in the US but fell 4 per cent in
continental Europe mainly due to the German recession.
Earnings per share increased to 15.36p (14.04p); a final dividend of 4.57p
brings the total to 6.36p (6.04p).
Commenting on the results, Mr Anthony Vice, chairman, said performance
improved in the UK as a result of acquisitions and internal reorganisation,
while in the US, higher profits reflected the beginnings of economic
recovery.
However, he noted that in Germany the growing impact of recession led to a
slowing down of sales growth and lower margins in the second half, while the
group's associate in Japan reported lower profits 'reflecting the general
setback in that economy.'
Among recent developments Bowthorpe has been building its specialist data
acquisition and environmental sector business which now includes Penny &amp;
Giles, the aircraft black box manufacturer, acquired for Pounds 30m last
May, and Odessa Engineering which was acquired for Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m).
Mr John Westhead, chief executive, said the group continues to search for
new acquisitions.
Although profits reported by Penny &amp; Giles were somewhat lower than the
company had budgeted, Mr Westhead emphasised that short term economies from
integration of the company proved greater than expected, and said the
potential longer term benefits 'remain considerable.'

Spandex, which distributes and supplies signmaking computers and materials,
raised pre-tax profits by 6 per cent from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 4.46m in
1992, on sales also 6 per cent higher at Pounds 55m.
Earnings per share rose from 20.4p to 22.5p, while a final dividend of 4.6p
makes a total for the year of 6.5p (6p).
Mr Charles Dobson, chairman of the USM-traded group, said net debt had been
reduced from Pounds 7.2m at the end of 1991 to Pounds 4.3m at December 31
1992, thereby reducing gearing from 56 per cent to 29 per cent.
Sales of signmaking materials continued to grow in the year, increasing from
Pounds 30.7m to Pounds 34.6m. Sales of Gerber computerised signmaking
systems declined however, from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 15m.
Ultramark, the self-adhesive materials manufacturing side, recorded a 20 per
cent sales increase from Pounds 4.58m to Pounds 5.48m.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Support for Control refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Control Securities, the property and leisure group in
refinancing talks with its banks, creditors and bondholders, yesterday gave
the board unanimous support to continue negotiations.
At a special meeting called to consider what steps to take to rectify a fall
in net assets, Mr Sydney Robin, chairman, told shareholders that if they did
not support the board the company's creditors and lenders were unlikely to
continue to do so.
Asked what the group's chances of survival were, Mr Robin said that a few
weeks ago he had thought them to be 60:40 against but now felt they had
swung to 60:40 in favour. Mr John Kerslake, finance director, said 'it is
evenly balanced but we remain cautiously optimistic'.
Mr Robin told shareholders that the group was looking carefully at its
public house estate and planned to sell those which were 'not relevant to
the company's future'. The Belhaven Brewery could also be sold if an offer
in the best interests of shareholders was received. Mr Kerslake said that
sale memoranda were being prepared on a number of the assets.
The timetable for completion of the refinancing was still unclear. However,
Mr Robin said that the property valuation carried out as at December 31 1992
had been prepared for the purposes of producing listing particulars for a
relisting of the shares, which have been suspended since October 1991.
This valuation would only be good for that purpose until June 30, so the
company aimed to complete the restructuring before then.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The salary and benefits of the chairman of Abbey National rose 33 per cent
last year, it was disclosed yesterday.
The annual accounts said that Sir Christopher Tugendhat received Pounds
211,575 last year after being paid Pounds 95,156 in 1991. Abbey this month
announced a 9 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 564m for 1992 after
doubling bad debt provisions.
Sir Christopher was paid only part of the 1991 total of Pounds 159,525 after
becoming chairman in July that year.
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, received Pounds 257,566 in pay and
benefits, but no performance bonus. In 1991, he was paid Pounds 216,756 in
salary and benefits, and a further Pounds 45,150 in performance bonuses.
Abbey paid Pounds 266,000 compensation to Mr Richard Baglin, former managing
director for new business, who retired early in August. It paid Pounds 1.6bn
in directors' fees, salaries and benefits.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Try rises 43% but warns of below-cost
tendering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRY GROUP, the contractor and housebuilder, yesterday warned against what it
called an alarming trend of below-cost tendering in the industry.
At the same time, it reported net attributable losses reduced from a
restated Pounds 3m to Pounds 1.93m. However, the dividend for the year was
cut from 6p to 1p, with a 0.5p final, as earnings per share tumbled from
7.4p to 3.4p.
The group again included heavy provisions of Pounds 2.85m (Pounds 3.23m)
below the line as it moved to get out of the commercial and industrial
property sector. Under FRS 3 accounting rules, these will in future have be
shown as a profit and loss item.
Turnover rose from Pounds 114.3m to Pounds 117.9m and pre-tax profits by 43
per cent to Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 961,000). This was achieved in large
measure through acquiring construction contracts from builders in
receivership.
Contracting turnover was up to Pounds 103.2m (Pounds 100.1m), while profits
were flat at Pounds 2.3m. Mr Hugh Try, chairman, said there was still
significant excess capacity in the contracting industry.
Mr Peter Howell, managing director, described as 'extremely dangerous' moves
by many companies to chase turnover by bidding for tenders on negative
margins.
Pre-tax profit growth came after rationalisation costs of Pounds 432,000 and
a write-down on residential developments of Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 1.15m).
Housebuilding turnover grew from Pounds 14m to Pounds 14.6m and losses in
the sector were cut to Pounds 436,000 (Pounds 955,000).
Mr Try said the company had looked forward to 1997 in assessing its
provisions for the shortfall of rental income against interest. 'We honestly
believe that is it,' he said.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ex-Harland Simon chief faces charge - DTI
appoints inspectors to investigate company's collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has issued a summons against Mr Roy
Ashman, former chairman of Harland Simon, the control systems company which
went into receivership last year.
Mr Ashman is due to appear at Milton Keynes Magistrates Court on April 2 to
face one charge of acting contrary to section 47(1)b of the Financial
Services Act 1986.
The charge alleges that on February 10 last year Mr Ashman made a statement
or forecast to Mr Nigel Stephen Savage, an employee of John Govett, which
was 'misleading, false or deceptive' and designed to induce him or any other
person to enter into an investment agreement.
It is understood that Mr Ashman met with Mr Savage on the day before Harland
issued a profits warning. After the meeting, Govett bought 170,000 Harland
shares for more than Pounds 700,000.
The DTI has also appointed inspectors under section 447 of the Companies Act
to look into the collapse of Harland Simon.
The inspectors, from accountancy firm Robson Rhodes, are thought to be
looking into a number of questions, first raised by the Financial Times,
concerning the way Harland was run. Harland's relationship with its one-time
subsidiary, Perfect Information Limited, is also under scrut-iny.
A team of accountants from Robson Rhodes has been interviewing individuals
involved in the collapse, and has taken away a number of sets of documents
and transcripts of telephone conversations from the offices of PIL, which no
longer has any relation to Harland.
Section 447 inquiries are confidential and neither the DTI nor Robson Rhodes
was able to comment.
This type of inquiry is designed to be a fast track assessment of events. If
sufficient evidence of wrongdoing is uncovered, the DTI can decide to
proceed with a wider ranging inquiry, usually under section 432.
Harland went into receivership in October following a collapse in profits
and the withdrawal of part of the company's working capital by its main
banker, Barclays. However, most of its operating subsidiaries were saved,
and sold off by receiver Touche Ross.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Surprise and relief follows failed bid -
Michael Skapinker on reaction to Airtours' unsuccessful offer for Owners
Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER YEARS of dealing with upheavals ranging from hurricanes to corporate
collapse, the holiday business should have learned to shrug off surprises.
Many in the industry have, however, observed Airtours' proposed takeover of
Owners Abroad, which finally failed last Tuesday, with a mixture of wonder
and dread. The wonder was that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, last month casually shrugged aside the Office of Fair Trading's
recommendation that the bid be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. Many were surprised, too, at the market's rejection of a bid
that was widely expected to succeed.
The dread was that Airtours' success might lead to a price war with Thomson,
the market leader, which could have ruined smaller companies. Many were
apprehensive, too, that Thomson and the enlarged Airtours would have used
their own travel agents, Lunn Poly and Pickfords Travel, to exclude small
operators and agencies from the market.
Some believe Airtours' failure means that life will return to what it was
before. Mr Paul Brett, chairman of the Thomson Travel Group, the parent
company of Thomson Tour Operations, Lunn Poly and Britannia Airways, said:
'They tried something, they failed, it's back to square one.'
Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour
Operators and an outspoken opponent of the takeover, said: 'Hopefully, this
will now mean stability for all of us.'
Others argue that factors ranging from high unemployment to a devalued pound
mean that the travel business has changed anyway and that medium-sized and
smaller companies will find it difficult to compete.
The three leading companies have all made it clear that they will not be
loosening their grip on the industry. Mr David Crossland, Airtours'
chairman, said yesterday that he was now examining other options. He would
not be drawn on what they were, but competitors believe they could include a
rapid expansion of Pickfords or the purchase of a medium-sized tour
operator. Either option would give Airtours greater control of the market
and increase the pressure on smaller competitors.
Mr Roger Allard, Owners Abroad managing director, accepted that his group
was now under greater pressure than before. He said: 'We'll take on board
what the City and institutions have said to us. We have to deliver the right
profits for our shareholders.'
Mr Brett reaffirmed Thomson's determination to continue to be the biggest
tour operator, travel agent and charter airline operator. He said Lunn Poly
opened 68 new outlets last year, bringing the total to 578, and would add
another 100 this year.
Few expect the market to grow significantly this year, despite widespread
discounting and television advertising earlier in the year.
Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, Lunn Poly's marketing director, said sales of
summer 1993 holidays rose 10 per cent in January compared with last year,
but then fell 5 per cent in February. 'On the most optimistic view, the
summer market is flat,' he said.
Although lower interest rates usually result in a rise in bookings, Mr Chris
Parker, chairman of Unijet Travel, a medium-sized tour operator, said
customers were postponing their holiday decisions because of fear of
unemployment. Late booking, a growing trend even before the rise in
unemployment, is particularly damaging to small companies with less cash to
cushion them.
The drop in the value of the pound has also been easier for the large
companies to bear because they buy all of their foreign currency forward,
something many smaller companies cannot do.
Mr Tim Cocking, president of the National Association of Independent Travel
Agents, says that while he heaved a sigh of relief at Airtours' failure, the
bid confirmed the trend towards vertical integration in the travel business.
The Thomas Cook travel agency chain's decisive backing of Owners Abroad has
convinced the industry of the genuine nature of the two companies'
previously announced intention to establish closer links.
Although there are still 5,000 independent travel agents, the large chains
are able to command a market share out of all proportion to the number of
outlets they control. Although Lunn Poly accounts for only 7 per cent of the
total number of UK retail outlets, it has a 22 per cent share of the market
for summer package holidays.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Utd Newspapers settles dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Newspapers, publisher of the Express and Star national newspapers,
said it had settled its legal dispute over distribution with Northern and
Shell, publisher of Penthouse and Forum magazines.
The row was over the termination of magazine distribution agreements.
Under the agreement, Northern and Shell will pay Pounds 17m it owes to
United.
In return, United will pay Pounds 17m for 10 magazine titles serving the
cycling and music sectors.
The magazines have net assets of Pounds 96,000 and are expected to make a
gross contribution of Pounds 1.7m in the next 12 months.
The two sides have also agreed to drop their competing litigation actions
over distribution agreements.
United said its annual results to be published later this month would show
an exceptional provision of up to Pounds 12m to reflect the costs of
dissolving the 'uneconomic' distribution agreements and a 'more
conservative' valuation of the magazines acquired.
The provision will, however, be offset by an exceptional gain of about
Pounds 23m following a controversial decision to dispose of some shares in
Reuters Holdings.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: A change of heart on the way to the party -
Gartmore's controversial decision was crucial to the bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER 30 years, Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, has probably
forgotten more about the holiday business than many travel executives would
ever hope to know.
But the City was new ground and in three bruising months pursuing rival
Owners Abroad in a fiercely contested takeover battle, he had a crash course
on how it works. It has been an altogether less rewarding experience and one
he will not forget.
Not only was the Pounds 290m bid notable for the close finish; when Airtours
lapsed its offer on Tuesday, it had the support of investors representing 43
per cent of Owners' shareholders and was only one institutional investor
away from victory.
Airtours also found itself in a rare three-cornered contest with Thomas
Cook, the German-controlled travel agency which was proposing a commercial
tie-up with Owners Abroad. When Thomas Cook last week offered to tender for
12.5 per cent of the Owners shares if the bid failed, Airtours faced a
competing proposal that was not a competing bid.
In the end, Airtours returned empty handed to its Lancashire base because of
one controversial institutional decision and because Thomas Cook became a
substantial buyer in the market.
The crucial decision was that of Gartmore, a 7.8 per cent shareholder in
Owners Abroad which eventually sold a third of its stake to Thomas Cook and
then refused to assent the rest.
By the end of last week, with the largest shareholder, Mercury Asset
Management, supporting Airtours and the second largest, Philips &amp; Drew Fund
Management, supporting Owners Abroad, this decision proved crucial and a
significant blow to Airtours.
What was surprising to all sides was that when Thomas Cook first announced
its decision to tie-up with Owners Abroad, Gartmore was vehemently opposed.
The institution did not like the fact that Owners would issue new shares to
Thomas Cook or that it would, in turn, be investing in low yielding fixed
rate Thomas Cook paper.
The institution was thought to be lukewarm about the benefits of the
transaction and wary about the probable savings.
Nor was Gartmore believed to be a great fan of the entire Owners Abroad
board, following the share price performance and various share sales -
totally legitimate though they were - by Mr Howard Klein, the Owners
chairman.
Such was the disenchantment that a Gartmore fund manager left Airtours with
a strong impression that if it should bid for Owners Abroad, Gartmore would
lend its support.
Something clearly changed on the way to the party. Late in the day, Gartmore
is believed to have been impressed by Owners' presentations of the benefits
that the Thomas Cook deal would bring. And in common with a number of other
institutions, there were doubts whether Airtours could handle nearly
doubling its share of holiday market through acquisition after a period of
such rapid organic growth.
The outcome is a salutary reminder to potential bidders who think they have
institutional support but have not received irrevocable support.
Ultimately the institutions dance to their own tune, acting in the interests
of their clients. Support at one price and in one set of circumstances is no
guarantee of support throughout.
The other issue was Thomas Cook's purchase of Owners shares early this week,
the final blow that toppled Airtours' bid. When Thomas Cook bought its 8.9
per cent stake in Owners Abroad, it attempted to buy from shareholders who
were expected to accept the Airtours offer. Such directed purchases are
totally within Takeover Panel guidelines which say anyone can buy shares
from anyone at any time.
So where does the outcome leave the protagonists? Owners Abroad has set
itself a tough task to live up to the expectations it created throughout the
bid. And having made a serious investment, Thomas Cook now has an even
greater incentive to make the commercial tie-up work.
Also it would be surprising if Owners Abroad does not appoint new
non-executive directors - in addition to Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief
executive of Thomas Cook - to look after the interests of minority
shareholders.
And Airtours? It is likely it will sell its stake in Owners - the stake is a
relatively low yielding asset in an industry that has high returns on
capital. This could mean more losses to add to the Pounds 8m, or so, cost of
the bid.
Mr Crossland could well see his next challenge as trying to prove to the
City that they had backed the wrong horse. Owners Abroad might expect a
rather focused attack on its market share.

advance to Pounds 19.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDONNELL Douglas Information Systems, the UK-owned computing services
company formed earlier this year through a buy-out from the US aerospace
group, lifted operating profits 23 per cent in the year to December 31
despite a 9 per cent fall in worldwide turnover.
Operating profits were Pounds 19.4m compared with Pounds 15.8m. Turnover
fell from Pounds 175.2m to Pounds 159.7m. Net assets, however, rose by 31
per cent to Pounds 77.9m compared with Pounds 59.4m.
Mr Jeremy Causley, chief executive, said the outcome resulted from retaining
market share in a tough year and keeping a tight rein on costs. Software and
services now accounted for 58 per cent of revenues and the company intended
to invest further in the development of application software in 1993.
Overseas operations accounted for almost 30 per cent of revenues, he said.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Plantsbrook improves to Pounds 9m after
halved interest charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANTSBROOK Group, the funeral services provider, raised pre-tax profits by
38 per cent from Pounds 6.55m to Pounds 9.05m in the year to December 31.
Gearing fell from 75 per cent at the half year to 54 per cent, mainly
because of a Pounds 10.5m rights issue and a private placing of more than
Pounds 2m in December. Borrowings were Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 29m) giving
halved interest payments of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 3.7m).
A maintained final dividend of 2p gives a same-again total of 3p, payable
from basic earnings of 6.78p (5.51p). Plantsbrook disposed of a memorial
maker and six memorial retailers. It closed 52 small branches and reduced
staff by 17 per cent. The group is looking for suitable acquisitions.
Group turnover declined to Pounds 49.8m (Pounds 53.5m), operating profits
rose to Pounds 11m (Pounds 10.2m) and margins rose to 22 per cent (19 per
cent).
The previously loss-making Dignity pre-paid funerals division broke even.
The group's corpse rescue and repatriation business, Kenyon Emergency
Services and Kenyon Air Transportation, contributed Pounds 1.5m to turnover
and Pounds 500,000 to pre-tax profits. Its work included two air crashes in
Katmandu and a helicopter crash in Scotland.
Mr Peter Hindley, Plantsbrook's chief executive, said: 'Two years ago
gearing was 400 per cent and market share was declining. We have reduced
gearing and our market share is stable at about 9 per cent.'
Mr Geoff Douglas, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'Mortality rates
for 1993 are so far down 6 per cent but hopefully the shortfall will be
clawed back.' He expects profits to reach Pounds 10m next time mainly from
reduced interest charges.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Dutch problems cut Expamet Intl by 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPAMET International, the building products and security group, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits down almost 40 per cent from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds
4.4m for the year ended December 1992.
The group has been hit by problems at what was its Dutch duct making
subsidiary. Last June a profit warning followed the discovery of inflated
profit figures at Brema-Air.
The group took an extraordinary charge of Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 1.3m)
consisting of losses on disposal or closure of businesses and the
elimination of Pounds 17.7m of related purchased goodwill.
More than Pounds 10m related to the disposal of the Dutch ducting business
and APT Controls.
The balance relates to three further anticipated disposals.
Borrowings at the year end were Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 9.8m). Again, the
increase was caused mainly by the Dutch losses but were also boosted about
Pounds 3m by currency fluctuations.
Borrowings in the middle of 1992 were Pounds 22.9m.
Net assets at the year end were Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 21.6m).
The tax charge dropped to Pounds 1.2m, compared with Pounds 2m. The figure
includes an overseas element of Pounds 202,000 (Pounds 884,000). The final
dividend is 1.16p giving a total of 3.25p (10.38p) payable from earnings per
share down from 9.06p to 5.08p.

FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Portals says signs of pick-up continuing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTALS Group, the specialist paper and environmental protection and control
products company, reported a 9 per cent rise in 1992 operating profits from
continuing operations and said the pick-up in activity seen in the fourth
quarter 'has generally been sustained into 1993.'
Pre-tax profits, after exceptional items, were little changed at Pounds
25.5m from a restated Pounds 25.2m in 1991. The 1991 figure was originally
reported as Pounds 27.6m, but has been restated to comply with the recent
FRS 3 reporting standard.
Exceptional items under FRS 3 amounted to a net Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 885,000)
charge in 1992. The mainly item related to the group's loss-making
Airoil-Flaregas subsidiary which was sold in January.
Fully diluted earnings per share slipped to 26.74p (28.04p). But an
increased final dividend of 9.5p (8.8p) raised the total for the year to
14.5p (13.8p).
Despite tough trading conditions operating profits from continuing
operations increased to Pounds 28.5m (Pounds 26.3m). Mr Michael Morley,
chief executive, said the results were somewhat better than expected because
of 'distinct pick-up in the final quarter.'
The core security and specialist papermaking division boosted operating
profit to Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 19.3m) on sales of Pounds 101m (Pounds
98.2m).
The protection and control division increased operating profit by almost 22
per cent to Pounds 8.43m (Pounds 6.93m) on flat turnover of Pounds 77.7m.
The sale of the loss-making Airoil-Flaregas subsidiary leaves two core
businesses, the Houseman air and water hygiene business, and Computer
Technology. Both hold strong positions in their respective key markets.
Net borrowings fell by another Pounds 3m last year, despite capital
expenditure of Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 12.9m). Year-end borrowings of Pounds
2.8m (Pounds 5.8m) represent gearing of 2 per cent. Since the year end the
group has eliminated all of its debt following the Airoil-Flaregas disposal.
COMMENT
The sale of Airoil-Flaregas means the protection and control division's new
management can now focus on building the core businesses. In contrast,
growth in the papermaking division is likely to come through acquisition
sometime this year. The management has looked at three possibilities in the
last 6 months and is sizing-up another two. The key requirements are that
the target should be a speciality, high quality niche papermaker in a
business where Portals can add value. With no debt a price tag of up to
Pounds 50m would not strain the balance sheet unduly. Pre-tax profits this
year could reach Pounds 30m, producing earnings of about 31.5p. The
prospective p/e of 16.2 reflects growth and takeover potential.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Exposure to Latin America comes full circle: US bankers
licked their wounds and looked south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade after they began a retreat from the region, the New York banks are
again marching into Latin America. This time, they insist, things will be
different.
The banks say they are out of the business of making medium-term dollar
loans to Latin governments. If Latin America's economic renaissance goes
wrong again, the New York banks will face disappointment but not disaster.
A region-wide shift in economic policy has brought the banks back.
Governments have opened economies to outside competition, brought budget
deficits more in check and placed more reliance on the market. Lower
inflation and a resumption of economic growth have followed in most
countries. Debt burdens have eased following sharp falls in US interest
rates and the Brady initiative launched by the US government in March 1989.
The Brady debt reduction plan marked the psychological turning point for
banks in Latin America. Until this point, says Mr David Berry, director of
research at bank analysts Keefe Bruyette and Woods in New York, 'the correct
approach was to continue to reduce exposure to Latin America'. After five
years of almost unremitting decline, the secondary market price of the old
debt began to rise.
In the end, says Mr Berry, the banks probably took excessive write-downs on
their old debt. Citicorp, the bank with biggest exposure, has moved Dollars
400m (Pounds 280m) out of its third world debt reserve into its commercial
reserves in the last five quarters.
For Citicorp, 'Latin America is the largest single contributor as a region
to this bank's earnings', says vice-chairman Mr William Rhodes. Last year,
pre-tax profits from Latin America reached Dollars 1.35bn, compared with
Dollars 475m from Europe, Middle East and Africa, Dollars 605m from
Asia-Pacific and a loss of Dollars 1.01bn for North America.
This has vindicated, he says, the decision not to sell its Latin American
loans into the secondary market. Instead, the bank sought to 'work out' the
loans, for example, convert them into equity.
Citicorp is unusual in having a large retail banking and local currency
lending business in the region. In some countries, it is the only foreign
bank with such a franchise. Only one other east coast bank - Bank of Boston
 -has a traditional local currency business in the region, and that is much
smaller.
According to Citibank officials, its proximity to potential clients in the
region gives the bank a competitive edge in other areas: corporate finance,
capital market activities and project finance. The bank has, for example, a
mandate to raise Dollars 1.8bn in project finance for British Petroleum's
Cusiana development in Colombia.
In delivering these services, the bank is hampered by a low debt rating: its
A-minus senior debt rating from Standard &amp; Poor's compares with JP Morgan's
AAA and Bankers Trust's AA. The ambitions of these two banks lie explicitly
with 'investment banking', which means they have no interest in lending
money from their own balance sheets.
Morgan has about 100 professionals involved in corporate finance and mergers
and acquisitions in Latin America, not including those working in trading
and sales. Another 20 work on research. In the 1980s, 'we decided that the
new business would not be to loan money but to help our government and
private sector clients in other ways,' says one Morgan official.
The strategy lays emphasis on industry specialisation of its bankers.
Observers reckon it has been successful in cultivating contacts among
investment institutions, which commercial banks traditionally lack.
At Bankers Trust, Mr Neil Allen, managing director in charge of global
emerging markets, outlines some similar objectives. 'Our focus is on capital
markets, mergers and acquisitions, local trading, special situations and
we'll also look at equity investment for our own account.'
The bank is positioning itself for growth in domestic capital markets. It
owns a brokerage house in Argentina and has plans to own one in Chile; it
has already underwritten domestic equity issues. It is willing to make
equity investments itself, in publicly-traded or private companies and it is
offering risk management advisory services and mergers and acquisitions
advice.
However, bankers admit that offering advice is often labour-intensive and
expensive; the real advantage it gives is often a privileged position in the
underwriting of securities.
The banks have moved into the underwriting business as a natural extension
of the secondary-market trading activity in old bank loans. Chase
Manhattan's renewed interest in Latin America has been based on a strong
debt trading operation; Chemical, having taken over Manufacturers Hanover,
is also a strong trading house.
There have been questions over the longer-term sustainability of an approach
that relies on trading and underwriting Latin bonds. Mr Stephen Dizard,
managing director at Salomon Brothers, calculates that total underwriting
fees on Dollars 20bn of new Latin bond issues a year amounts to Dollars
200m-Dollars 300m. With no house having more than a 10 per cent market
share, this suggests gross underwriting revenues for the market leader of
Dollars 25m. As a series of poorly-received Latin bond issues last year
showed, underwriters can lose money as well as gain.
Some believe the market is in transformation. Mr Larry Brainard, an
economist at Goldman Sachs, says: 'The business is changing in a fairly
fundamental way and it's moving away from trading and commercial bank
structured finance deals and more to a market oriented towards institutional
investors.' This would give Wall Street firms an advantage over the banks,
most of which lack strong links with investment institutions.
Others disagree. Ms Kathy Galbraith, a senior vice-president at Chase,
believes debt trading will continue as an important source of income for
banks: 'I don't see it as a market beginning to decline. Volume will
continue to increase.' Ms Galbraith admits though that Chase, a prominent
underwriter of Latin bonds, and others with no broad equity business face an
uphill fight in underwriting share issues.
Ms Diane Glossman, a bank analyst at Salomon Brothers, believes the balance
of power lies for now with the commercial banks. 'Commercial banks have the
relationships with issuers and relationships matters a lot, more perhaps
than price. When issuers get more confident, companies can afford to be much
pickier about price and then that picture could change.'

FT  18 MAR 93 / 'Ethical' stance helps Co-op Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Co-operative Bank's marketing campaign to brand itself as an 'ethical'
bank helped raise its retail deposits by 13 per cent last year, and return a
profit after two years of losses.
The bank, which has 2.3m customers, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 9.8m in
the year ending January 1993 against a Pounds 5.9m loss the previous year.
The value of customer deposits rose above the value of loans for the first
time in 20 years.
The bank announced in May that it would not become involved with tobacco
companies, or those that pollute the environment. It has also taken a stand
against blood sports, factory farming and the testing of cosmetics on
animals.
Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, said it had appealed to some of the most
potentially profitable bank customers. These were white-collar and
managerial employees aged between 25 and 40 who were classified in the
social classes ABC1. 'We know the question of ethics has a ring to them
because they are concerned about issues like protecting the environment,' he
said.
Half of the Co-op's new customers since May mentioned the ethical stance as
a motive for opening an account.
The bank, which is wholly owned by the Co-operative Wholesale Society, has
now issued 173,000 of the gold credit cards which it launched in September
1991. Mr Thomas said he thought it was now the largest UK issuer of such
cards.
The month before sterling left the exchange rate mechanism last October, the
bank announced it would not speculate against sterling. Mr Thomas said
foreign exchange profits of Pounds 450,000 for the year reflected this
policy.
Retail deposits rose to Pounds 1.24bn from Pounds 1.09bn the previous year.
The bank cut provisions for bad debts by 10 per cent to Pounds 42m, against
Pounds 47m, and its ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 11.8
per cent, against 11.6 per cent.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Deutsche Bank signals rethink of 28% stake in Daimler-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUSSELDORF
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RONALDO Schmitz, a Deutsche Bank director responsible for corporate
finance, yesterday said that Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Bank had decided it
was inappropriate for the bank's stake to stay at 28 per cent.
However, Mr Schmitz told a conference of international investment managers
in Dusseldorf there were no immediate plans to reduce the holding.
'There are those in the bank (Deutsche Bank) who may feel sorry not to have
got out (of Daimler-Benz) when the price was better,' said Mr Schmitz.
The Deutsche Bank, as Germany's biggest bank, is at the centre of the German
system of corporate governance. Its board directors have more than 100 seats
on supervisory boards and its influence is consolidated by a network of
industrial holdings.
While making one of the most outspoken contributions to the debate over
German corporate governance to have come from a senior member of the German
corporate establishment, Mr Schmitz said German companies should transform
their approach to shareholders.
If they did not take greater account of shareholders' interests, German
industry could face dire consequences in the 1990s as it stood on the brink
of 'the most significant industrial reconstruction since the second world
war'. This restructuring can only be achieved with the help of foreign
capital, he warned.
Mr Schmitz, a former finance director of BASF, the large German chemicals
company, said German companies traditionally put the interests of
shareholders low on the list of management priorities.
This was perhaps understandable in the 1980s, when German companies
generated so much cash that they could finance all their investments from
internal resources.
But the era of 'over-capitalised' companies was over and German companies
would now have to compete more aggressively on international capital markets
to finance the reconstruction ahead.
Mr Schmitz said companies should not pay lip service to the idea of
shareholder value, they should take a more hard-nosed attitude to the way
they managed their assets.
He made a call for foreign institutional investors to gain representation on
supervisory boards.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Spring Ram asks for its shares to be suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS about the 1992 results of Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms
company, surfaced yesterday as the group asked for its shares to be
suspended ahead of Monday's scheduled announcement. The fast-growing
company, which seemed to defy the recession, said it would release further
information soon about the 1992 results.
Attention focused on a possible disagreement with the auditors, Arthur
Andersen. The group has in the past brought out its audited annual report on
the same day as the results announcement.
The audit was expected to be particularly thorough after revelations of
false accounting at Spring Ram's Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary last
November. Profits at Balterley had been overstated by Pounds 5.6m mainly
through the inflation of stock values and sales.
The company has since gone to some lengths to reassure them that Balterley
was an isolated incident.
The share price, which had sunk to 89p after the Balterley debacle, was
suspended yesterday at 129p - catching shareholders and analysts by
surprise.
After the suspension, analysts were raising all the questions that were
asked at the time of the Balterley debacle.
The questions include ones about stock valuations and high stock levels, the
timing of sales, depreciation, and the treatment of government grants.
The group's financial and management controls have also been called into
question. There are no non-executive directors.
The Balterley issue was dealt with mainly by finance director Mr Stuart
Greenwood, with chairman and co-founder Mr Bill Rooney coming to London to
reassure institutions.
Until yesterday, analysts were forecasting 1992 pre-tax profits at Pounds
37m-Pounds 40m.
Spring Ram, founded in 1979, became a glamour stock as it built sales to
Pounds 194m and pre-tax profit to Pounds 37.6m in 1991. After flotation in
1983, its market value grew from Pounds 11m to a peak of Pounds 651m last
May.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Marley declines 67% to Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVIVAL in the UK housing market is starting to boost sales of some
building materials according to Marley, the UK construction products group
which yesterday announced a 67 per cent fall last year in pre-tax profits.
Profits after exceptional provisions of Pounds 10.4m slumped from Pounds 25m
to Pounds 8.1m reflecting the deep recession in the UK construction industry
last year.
UK profits fell from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 1.2m after a Pounds 2.3m
second-half loss. Up to a third of group sales are generated from the UK
housing market, according to Mr David Trapnell, chief executive.
US profits by comparison almost doubled from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 7.7m. The
German residential market continues to show little sign of flagging as far
as Marley's products were concerned, said Mr Trapnell. The DIY market in
eastern Germany remained particularly strong and profits in western Europe
rose from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 12.9m last year.
The group, as forecast, paid a final dividend of 2.1p making a total of 4.2p
for the year compared with 6.35p in 1991. Earnings per share after
exceptional provisions, mostly to cover closure costs and redundancies in
the UK, fell from 6p to 0.7p.
Net borrowings as a percentage of shareholders' funds, following write-downs
and currency movements, rose from 41 per cent to 57 per cent. Marley, in
spite of increased gearing, generated a positive operational cashflow last
year. About 80 per cent of worldwide turnover was from the building
industry, according to Mr Trapnell.
He had been encouraged by an increase in UK sales of plumbing and drainage
products and thermalite blocks during the past four to six weeks. 'I believe
we have seen the bottom of the cycle. Much now will depend upon how UK
housing starts respond to increased demand seen recently from house
purchasers,' he said.
Sales of roof tiles however, remained depressed. Prices of building
materials, where supply was continuing to outrun demand, were likely to
remain under pressure said the Marley chief executive. The group reiterated
its intention to sell its UK brick businesses, where it holds a 2 per cent
market share, should a buyer 'at the right price' be found.

FT  18 MAR 93 / China threatens to ignore HK poll in new attack on Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG, BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA stepped up the war of words over the future of Hong Kong yesterday,
threatening to ignore the results of democratic elections proposed by Mr
Chris Patten, the colony's governor, once it assumes control in 1997.
It also accused him of slamming the door on further talks.
Mr Lu Ping, China's senior official for Hong Kong affairs, said that if Mr
Patten pressed ahead with his democratic reforms Beijing would start a 'new
kitchen' in 1997 - a Chinese expression which means making a fresh start.
Mr Lu also added his voice to personal criticism of the governor, saying
that he would be condemned by history over his handling of the Hong Kong
issue.
Speaking at a Beijing press conference, he left the door open, however, for
further contacts with Britain, saying that China 'always stands for
co-operation, and not confrontation'.
In London, the Foreign Office stressed that it was still offering 'talks at
any time'. An official added: 'The only sensible way forward is for the two
sides to sit down and discuss without preconditions the points of difference
between us.'
The remarks by Mr Lu, head of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office,
were greeted with relief by the Hong Kong stock market, which had been
bracing itself for a more uncompromising stand.
The Hang Seng index was some 200 points down before Mr Lu's press
conference, but recovered most of its losses to close at 5,958.33, down 21.7
on the day.
Mr Lu said: 'We will construct a kitchen in accordance with the design in
the Basic Law. We have to do this because the kitchen started by Mr Chris
Patten before 1997 will not converge with the stipulations of the Basic Law
after 1997.'
The Basic Law is a mini-constitution for Hong Kong after 1997 which was
approved by China's parliament in 1990.
Mr Lu said China would have to make preparations ahead of 1997 for the
cancellation of Mr Patten's proposed democratic reforms; but he stopped
short of saying China would set up an alternative administration in Hong
Kong before the end of British rule.
He also refrained from repeating economic threats made by China last year,
although it seems unlikely that Britain will win China's agreement to
complete Hong Kong's Dollars 175bn (Pounds 123bn) airport project, or
further develop the colony's container port.
In Beijing, Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador, regretted the
continuing personal attacks on Mr Patten. He said that decisions over Hong
Kong were 'taken by the British government as a whole'.
In Hong Kong, Mr Patten reiterated his preparedness to hold talks with China
about his proposed 1994-95 elections. But in spite of the governor's
attempts to calm growing concerns over the row with Beijing, local
politicians were pessimistic about an early solution.

FT  18 MAR 93 / Call for Hussey to quit BBC by advisory council members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of members on the BBC's general advisory council are understood
to have called on Mr Marmaduke Hussey to resign as chairman of the
corporation's governors.
The council, which includes MPs, academics and other public figures, held a
vociferous private meeting in London yesterday att-ended by most of its 41
members.
Half of the 2 1/2 -hour meeting was dedicated to discussing demands for Mr
Hussey and Mr John Birt, the director-general, to quit. The demands follow
the recent disclosure that Mr Birt, who took up his post on January 1, had
not been a BBC employee but had his salary paid into his private company.
According to those present at yesterday's meeting, the balance of opinion
was in favour of the resignation of Mr Hussey, who agreed Mr Birt's
freelance arrangement. This, it was felt, would make plain that the episode
had been seriously damaging for the BBC. It is understood that only Mr Roger
Gale, the Conservative MP for North Thanet, publicly defended both Mr Hussey
and Mr Birt during the meeting.
Last night, the BBC said the council had discussed the 'issue of the terms
of appointment of the director-general' and concluded that 'the manner and
terms of the appointment were incompatible with the standards expected of a
public broadcasting organisation and involved errors of judgment by those
concerned'.
Both Mr Hussey and Mr Birt were present at the meeting, though they and all
the governors who attended left the room while the council discussed the
resignation issue.
Mr Hussey told the council that the board of governors would today be given
a complete explanation of the background to Mr Birt's freelance status.
Considerable confusion now surrounds how far the governors have been kept
informed by Mr Hussey about the deal.
On March 2, Mr Birt stated that when he joined the BBC six years ago as
deputy director-general, he asked to continue the tax arrangements he had
with his previous employer, London Weekend Television, and that the BBC
agreed.
However, Mr Hussey yesterday told the advisory council it had always been
the intention of the BBC that Mr Birt would eventually join the staff, but
pressure of business had delayed the move.
One of the coucil members who called for Mr Hussey's resignation said the
mood of the meeting was one of dismay and anger. 'I am sure Mr Birt will try
to tough it out. The best we can hope for Mr Hussey is that he will go after
a few more months. I can't see him doing the decent thing.'

FT  18 MAR 93 / Brittan warns of US trade curbs in row over contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community yesterday ruled out concessions in the escalating
dispute with the US over government procurement practices and predicted that
the Clinton administration would impose sanctions from Monday.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, said he
was 'certain' the US would bar European companies from certain federal
contracts, in spite of today's meeting in Washington between President Bill
Clinton and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission.
The long-planned White House meeting between Mr Clinton and Mr Delors has
taken on sharper focus because of trade tensions between the US and EC, but
Sir Leon said only 'a big deal' be-tween the two leaders would de-flect
sanctions. The prospects for such a deal were remote, he said.
Senior EC officials said the Community had drawn up retaliatory measures,
but would wait until after a meeting in Brussels between Sir Leon and Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Brussels in 10 days' time.
The Brussels talks would give Mr Kantor a chance to explain US trade policy
in the light of recent inflammatory rhetoric and an apparent preference for
unilateral action, the EC official said.
Mr Kantor surprised EC and his own officials on Friday by cancelling two
days of talks in Brussels on the procurement dispute. The decision was
apparently made after the EC refused to suspend article 29 of its new
Utilities Directive which gives a 3 per cent price preference to European
companies bidding for government contracts in telecommunications, energy and
water.
Sir Leon this week sought to defuse the row by offering to sponsor jointly
with the US an independent report into the facts of the dispute. Asked
yesterday if he would waive article 29 while such a study was under way, Sir
Leon replied: 'No way.'
The EC directive came into effect at the beginning of the year. In the first
10 weeks of the directive's life, 1,000 contracts have been notified that
previously would not have been open for international tender, worth about
Ecu15bn (Pounds 12.39bn), according to an EC official.
The US has indicated that it intends to bar European companies from about
Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) of federal contracts. The sum is small in
comparison to the vast government procurement market, but it has taken on
added significance because of parallel disputes over aviation and steel
subsidies, and the continuing impasse in the Gatt Uruguay Round trade talks.
Sir Leon expressed some frustration at the 'muscle flexing' the US was doing
at the expense of the EC, but insisted that he remained confident that 'on
the big picture, the US still says it wants to reach an agreement'.

FT  18 MAR 93 / 'Obsessive' hacker cleared of computer misuse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHOOLBOY whose obsession with computer hacking led him to break into
computers operated by the Financial Times and other institutions was
acquitted yesterday of three charges brought under the Computer Misuse Act.
Mr Paul Bedworth, aged 19, had become so addicted to hacking that he became
ill and no longer knew why he did it, according to expert psychiatric
evidence given at his trial.
In the first prosecution brought under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, Mr
Bedworth denied charges of conspiracy to obtain telecommunications services
dishonestly, conspiracy to cause unauthorised modification in computer
material and conspiracy to secure unauthorised access to computer material.
The prosecution was regarded as a test of the new law, which was brought in
specifically to outlaw hacking, but the nature of Mr Bedworth's defence
means that questions about the effectiveness of the law remain unanswered.
Mr Bedworth, from Ilkley, Yorkshire, began hacking when he was 14, using a
Pounds 200 BBC microcomputer given to him as a Christmas present, the court
had been told. From his bedroom, he gained entry into computers run by large
organisations and then used their telephone accounts to fund other hacking.
His activities cost The Financial Times more than Pounds 20,000 and the
Brussels-based European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of
Cancer Pounds 10,000 in telephone bills.
However, at his trial at Southwark Crown Court, Professor James Griffith
Edwards, an expert on addictive behaviour, had said Mr Bedworth's obsession
had become so strong that it was impossible to judge what his intentions had
been.
Mr Karl Strickland, 22, from Liverpool, and Mr Neil Woods, 26, from Oldham,
admitted similar conspiracy charges under the Computer Misuse Act before the
trial.

dishonestly, conspiracy to cause unauthorised modification in computer

The prosecution was regarded as a test of the new law, which was brought in
specifically to outlaw hacking. Before the act, prosecutions in hacking
cases meant bringing charges of criminal damage or the theft of electricity.
But the nature of Mr Bedworth's defence means that questions about the
effectiveness of the law remain unanswered.
Mr Bedworth, from Ilkley, Yorkshire, began hacking when he was 14, using a
Pounds 200 BBC microcomputer given to him as a Christmas present, the court

However, at his trial at Southwark Crown Court, Professor James Griffith
Edwards, an expert on addictive behaviour, had said Mr Bedworth's obsession
had become so strong that it was impossible to judge what his intentions had
been.
His solicitor, Ms Deborah Tripley, said afterwards that Mr Bedworth had
started hacking before the Computer Misuse Act came into force.
'As an unusually bright boy, his computer presented the ideal intellectual
challenge. It began to absorb all his free time. His behaviour was obsessive
and compulsive. He thought he was harmless but he found he couldn't draw
himself away from his computer activities. He was addicted.'
Mr Karl Strickland, 22, from Liverpool, and Mr Neil Woods, 26, from Oldham,
admitted similar conspiracy charges under the Computer Misuse Act before the
trial.

FT  18 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The suspension of Spring Ram's shares, for an unspecified reason, five days
before its annual results raises some frightening spectres. The most benign
possibility is it is having lively discussions about its ACT position after
the Budget changes. The alternatives scarcely bear thinking about, coming
just four months after revelations about 'serious misrepresentation and
false accounting' at one of its subsidiaries. Spring Ram's directors did a
good job in reassuring institutional investors that the problem at Balterley
Bathrooms was a one-off lapse. The share price showed surprising resilience
after the initial fall. But any further misfortune, whatever its nature,
would send infuriated investors scurrying for the door.
There have long been niggles about Spring Ram's depreciation policy and the
accounting treatment of stocks and government grants. The fast-growing
company's highly-charged culture and continued failure to appoint
non-executive directors only heighten the sense of unease. At the same time
Spring Ram has raised expectations to inordinate heights. If it is now about
to disappoint, the recriminations will prove bitter.

FT  18 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After Friday's disappointing US producer price figures, yesterday's
underlying rise of 0.5 per cent in February consumer prices is somewhat
unnerving. But it would be premature to conclude that inflation is gathering
strength again. The consumer price figure was boosted by an unusually large
but probably one-off rise in clothing prices. Producer prices reflected the
higher cost of lumber as sawing restrictions were imposed to protect the
spotted owl.
That could be a sign that regulatory actions by an interventionist Clinton
administration could push up the overall price level in the US. Otherwise
there is little obvious inflationary pressure building up in the system.
Broad money growth and credit demand remain weak. Productivity gains should
restrain prices, and, though capacity use is at its highest for 18 months,
it is still not stretched. There may be room for long bond yields to plumb
new lows around 6.5 per cent in the next few months. That would be all the
more likely if, as some expect, the rapid recovery established around the
turn of the year slows in the second quarter.
For the time being the global bond market environment should thus not hinder
the UK chancellor's efforts to finance the Pounds 50bn public sector deficit
announced on Tuesday. Disinflationary pressures still seem strong enough to
offset growing calls by governments on bond markets around the world. That
feeling could grow when continental European interest rates turn decisively
and inverted yield curves become positive again.

FT  18 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The reduction of pension funds' tax credit on UK dividends could hardly come
at a worse time for the industry. The credit was sliced from 35 per cent to
25 per cent in the 1980s, but dividends were then growing faster than
liabilities. Yesterday's cut to 20 per cent comes in a period of anaemic
dividend growth. It may be the final blow for pension fund surpluses that
are already shrinking.
Domestic equities remain the best match for most pension liabilities. But
actuaries rolling a reduced yield on equities forward through the life of a
fund might conclude that uncovered liabilities have increased substantially.
Perhaps Pounds 20bn may have to be found over time to make up for lost
investment returns. Higher contributions from employers - and an early end
to contribution holidays - are the obvious places to look. That will drain
company profits once the gap shows up in pension funds valuations.
Whether this is only the thin end of the wedge remains an open question. For
the first time the chancellor has uncoupled the tax credit from the basic
rate of tax, which remains at 25 per cent. The innocent interpretation is
that he is simply looking forward to the day when the basic rate is set at
20 per cent. But with the fiscal position so tight, he may be tempted to
come back for more. Taking the credit away altogether would yield a further
Pounds 4bn a year.

FT  18 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Getting in on the ACT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 30-point fall in the London equity market and a  1/2 -point rise in long
gilts seems a proportionate response to the chancellor's advance corporation
tax surprise. For tax-exempt institutions the reduction in ACT rate from 25
to 20 per cent marginally improves the attraction of gilts over equities.
But that is unlikely to provoke much widespread switching. A fall in
equities of around 2.5 per cent would restore gross yields to the level
before the chancellor stood up. Yet given a number of offsetting factors,
that would be excessive. Companies will receive a cash flow boost. Some may
even increase dividends to compensate institutions for their lost income.
Such institutional pressure for higher payments would be rather rum. They
would be unlikely to respond sympathetically if their employees demanded
higher pay to offset personal tax rises. The chancellor has transferred
resources from institutions to companies, and he has effectively encouraged
retained earnings over distributions to pension funds. Such a bias towards
corporate investment may even have been deliberate.
These changes will produce some mixed results among high-yielding shares.
Those such as ICI with low - or no - dividend cover may suffer, since they
clearly cannot increase payments to compensate for the sharp drop in gross
yield. Others, such as Redland, which will benefit from improved cash flow,
might do well if their dividends become more secure. And high yielding
shares with good cover may be bought to replace lost yield - hence the
demand for utility stocks yesterday.
Proposals for foreign income dividends are further away and more opaque,
although there is a clear conflict between companies wishing to cut their
unrelieved ACT by issuing such dividends and institutions demanding UK
payments with tax credits. Perhaps the chancellor will permit pension funds
to take the UK dividend and taxpayers to take the overseas one. Such tax
efficiency, though, was probably not what he had in mind.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Dow warns on first-quarter
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOW Chemical said yesterday its first-quarter earnings would be lower than
expected due to reduced earnings at Marion Merrell Dow, its prescription
drugs subsidiary, agencies report. Dow has a 71 per cent stake in Marion
Merrell.
The US chemical company said its first-quarter per-share net income could be
about 25 cents below the 62 cents of a year ago. That figure was reached
before one-time retiree healthcare charges. Including the charges, Dow lost
Dollars 2.17 a share in the period.
Marion Merrell said its first-quarter earnings could be as much as 60 to 70
per cent below average analysts' expectations of 62 cents a share. For the
first quarter ended March 31 1992, Marion Merrell reported net income of 60
cents a share.
Marion Merrell said the expected first-quarter decline was mainly due to
sharply lower US sales of its major prescription products, compared with a
the same period in the previous year.

stakes

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOX television broad-casting subsidiary of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation is one of two US media groups that have held exploratory talks
about participating in the privatisation of Mexican state television.
Capital Cities/ABC, the media group that owns ABC Television, is the other
US company understood to be interested in taking an equity stake in a
privatised Mexican television network.
Industry sources say Mr Murdoch visited Mexico City a few months ago to
examine the possibility of becoming involved in the planned privatisation of
two state-owned Mexican networks.
Although Fox declined to comment yesterday, company executives are believed
to have held preliminary talks with private-sector Mexican media companies,
including a consortium led by Multivision, a Mexican cable television
company.
However, a decision by Fox is not imminent, according to executives familiar
with the talks.
Capital Cities/ABC also declined to comment yesterday. However, it is
understood the company has also held exploratory talks in Mexico City,
having sent one of its top executives recently to discuss a possible joint
venture with a private investment group being formed to participate in the
privatisation bidding.
Industry sources say Mexican television would offer a series of natural
tie-ins for US broadcasters.

FT  17 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) The Budget (What It Means To You): Hardship
fears for pensioners - How VAT on fuel affects low-income families
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and DENNIS KNOWLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 18th March 1993) appended to this article.
THE chancellor's an-nouncement yesterday that domestic fuel and power will
be subject to VAT, at 8 per cent in 1994-95 and and 17.5 per cent in
1995-96, is a bitter blow for low-income families.
With gas and electricity representing about an eighth of the weekly
household expenditure of low-income groups, charities such as Age Concern
warned that the increases would hit these groups particularly hard.
'This could lead to a lot of discomfort for pensioners - and ultimately a
lot more cold-related illnesses,' a spokeswoman said. She pointed out that
the proportion of the weekly bill spent by pensioners on fuel and
electricity is twice that of the average family.
Pensioners warned that rising fuel and power costs could lead to them
cutting back on both food and heating.
Mr Bill Jones, a Merseyside pensioner, who is living a few pence above the
official poverty line said: 'This is going to cost us about a quid extra a
week next year. Quite simply that's a quid less a week to eat with.'
He spends about a sixth of his and his wife's weekly household income on gas
and electricity bills.
Although the chancellor promised that the increased cost would be partly met
by extra benefits, Age Concern fears this will do little to soften the blow
for about 2m pensioners who would qualify for income support.
As Mr Jones points out, under current benefit regulations, any rise in
benefits is offset by a reduction in housing aid to him and his wife. 'If
they were to give us a Pounds 20 increase in benefit that wouldn't make a
damned bit of difference because it would be cancelled out by what they
would take from us on the housing benefit,' he said. The rent for their
housing association house represents more than a quarter of their weekly
expenditure.
Meanwhile, families with children pointed out that children's health could
also be particularly hard hit.
'This is going to hurt us even harder than if he'd put VAT on kid's
clothes,' said Ms Val Roberts, a single mother, who is struggling to find
work as a textile designer.
Her last electricity bill for the last quarter alone was about Pounds 250 -
a sum she finds difficult to meet out of the Pounds 70 she receives weekly
from income support and family credit benefits. 'This news is just terrible.
If you've got children you do need the heat on.'
Dennis Knowles is a principal at Coopers &amp; Lybrand
CORRECTION
IN ONE edition of yesterday's FT, we referred to Bill and Margi Jones,
pensioners in Merseyside, as having an income of Pounds 190 a week. This
should have read slightly less than Pounds 130 a week.

Surprisingly bullish figures from the US music industry for last year
brought a couple of strong buy reiterations on Thorn EMI, the shares
bounding ahead 13 to 872p in chunky turnover of 1.2m. According to US
industry figures published yesterday, the value of music sales grew 15 per

NatWest Securities and Hoare Govett both renewed their buy stances on the

recovery potential of the music industry, and the value inherent in Thorn
shares.'
Utilities specialists were not taken unawares by the proposal to end
zero-rating for VAT on domestic fuel and power, which will be raised in two
stages, to 8 per cent from April 1, 1994 and to 17.5 per cent from 1995.
Power generators were seen by marketmakers as vulnerable to the news, as
were the regional electricity stocks.
But analysts said the domestic customers' initial reaction to the imposition
of VAT would be to save fuel. 'It is not good but it is manageable,' said
one utilities analyst, who added that the market had already braced itself
to expect some form of windfall profits imposition.
National Power dipped 4 to 335p, as did PowerGen, to 336p, while the 'recs'
showed Eastern 9 1/2 off at 468p and Southern, the only 'rec' in the FT-SE
100 Index, 10 cheaper at 480p.
Water issues were lower across the board but falls were restricted to 5p at
the worst. Thames declined that amount to 535p, as did Anglian, to 522p,
while Severn Trent eased 2 to 506p.
Several drinks stocks responded well to the chancellor's decision not to
increase whisky duty. Analysts said Highland Distilleries would be the best
beneficiary as it derives a large proportion of its revenue from the UK. The
shares jumped 16 to 286p. Invergordon added 9 at 275p, Guinness 10 at 490p
and Allied-Lyons 5 at 573p.
Cider shares reacted with relief that a rumoured tax on the product was not
to be levied. Taunton Cider rose 13 to 195p, Merrydown 3 to 273p and Bulmer
10 to 404p.
A couple of large sellers in Whitbread 'A' held back the stock and it fell 8
to 484p.
There was further speculative buying of Hammerson and the 'A' shares
advanced 5 to 366p and the ordinary 15 to 402p. British Land, up 7 at 267p,
was again being mentioned as a possible predator.
A sell recommendation issued by Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL) hit Willis
Corroon shares, which dropped 8 to 200p. Mr Charles Coyne, CLL's insurance
broking specialist, said he expected further losses from the troubled
Sovereign business as more data on reinsurance recoveries becomes available,
and that negative cash flow and a stretched balance sheet mean the shares
should be sold. Monday's excellent figures continued to boost Jardine
Insurance Brokers, which rose 4 to 188p.
Life assurance stocks were said to have been given a push by one of the
market's leading securities houses, with Legal &amp; General, expected to report
sharply higher preliminary profits tomorrow, 4 firmer at 480p. Composites,
where the market adopted a much more relaxed view of potential losses
arising from the latest storms affecting the east coast of the US, had
General Accident 14 higher at 618p and Commercial Union 12 better at 619p.
The chancellor's moves on stamp duty and his proposal to lower the rate of
mortgage tax relief failed to disturb a very strong building materials and
construction arena.
George Wimpey shares were up and running from the outset, eventually closing
10 higher at 136p after the group revealed a very heavy Pounds 113m
write-down, losses of Pounds 112.4m and a halved dividend, but accompanied
the news with a bullish view of house sales in the current year. Elsewhere
in the sector, Wolseley rose 13 to 597p, Tarmac 6 to 118p and Amec 10 to
91p.
BAT Industries climbed 17 to 973p as the market continued to be cheered by
Monday's news of a joint venture in the Ukraine.
UK airports operator BAA was in demand, appreciating 11 to 807p amid
speculation, later confirmed, that the UK chancellor would approve the
Pounds 300m Heathrow Airport rail link project in his Budget speech.
Shares in Simon Engineering had a volatile session as the company announced
a steep fall in full-year figures. The shares ended a penny firmer on the
day at 114p.
Automotive and engineering products manufacturer BBA Group moved ahead 7 to
171p after announcing the disposal of its 57 per cent stake in Pacific BBA
for Pounds 59m.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Engineers' bodies tighten links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the UK's largest engineering institutions yesterday signed a
collaboration agreement intended to improve service to members and help
bring unity to the profession.
The move by the Institutions of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers is an
important step in the long and often painful process of forging closer links
between the UK's 44 professional engineering institutions.
It comes shortly before Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering
Council - an umbrella body - unveils final proposals for a reformed
structure for the profession.
In the summer of 1991, the Electricals and Mechanicals deferred plans for a
merger after internal opposition, but they have been collaborating
informally over the past two years at local, national and international
levels.
The signing yesterday of a memorandum of understanding between the two
institutions formalises collaboration, improving their efficiency and
effectiveness.
It is understood that the institutions also want something to build on if
Sir John's plans fall through. These have generated considerable debate in
the engineering profession, with criticism both by individual members and by
the larger institutions.
The agreement outlines new areas of co-operation between the two bodies,
accreditation of engineering courses, and planning and management of
conferences.

WOLTERS Kluwer, the Dutch legal, tax and education publisher, yesterday
reported a 21 per cent increase in 1992 net profit and announced a 14 per
cent rise in its annual dividend.
Net profit rose to Fl 258m (Dollars 139m) from Fl 214m the year before, in
spite of a slight decline in turnover to Fl 2.36bn from Fl 2.38bn.
Operating profit was up nearly 12 per cent at Fl 404m. Wolters Kluwer, which
attributed the gain to its low sensitivity to the business cycle and the
geographic spread of its activities in the US and Europe, said it planned to
raise its dividend to Fl 1.32 fro Fl 1.16 in 1991.
However, the company also made unspecified provisions in its 1992 accounts
for additional restructuring in the Netherlands and the UK.
For 1993, Wolters Kluwer is forecasting further rises in sales and profits.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Tungsram fails to shine for GE -
Nicholas Denton finds the US investment has yet to produce results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric of the US paved the way for western investors in eastern
Europe when it took over Hungary's Tungsram lighting maker in 1990.
Relishing its coup at taking over one of the region's few industrial stars,
GE ran advertisements boasting of being part of a 'brilliant future.'
Three years later, the brilliance remains a distant prospect. It is obscured
by three annual losses at the Hungarian venture which have wiped out
Tungsram's equity and prompted yesterday's announcement of a further Ft17bn
(Dollars 195m) capital injection.
The infusion will take GE's investment in Hungary over Dollars 500m - far
more than the US company envisaged when, in 1990, it broke the path for
western investors in eastern Europe by paying Dollars 150m for an initial 50
per cent stake in Tungsram.
Tungsram's losses jumped 70 per cent to Ft9bn in 1992, on an unaudited
international accounting basis, the largest in Hungarian corporate history.
There is little prospect of a swift improvement. Fresh capital will allow
Tungsram to ease its international borrowings of Dollars 200m and interest
burden. But GE forecast the unit would remain in the red this year.
GE says the 1994 target is to match the operating margins of Philips and
Osram, the market leaders in European lighting. But the company refuses to
make a forecast about a return to overall profitability for Tungsram.
'We've got a hill to climb here,' admits Mr Charles Pieper, chief executive
of GE Lighting Europe.
So what has gone wrong? GE said restructuring was to blame for the
deterioration in the results. Cost inflation cancelled out the benefit of
productivity growth of 14 per cent in 1992 which saved Ft3.5bn.
Tungsram took in roughly equal measure charges from its withdrawal from
non-core businesses outside lightmaking, accelerated layoffs, a write-off of
old, bad Russian debts and increased borrowing costs because of the build-up
of losses and debt.
Tungsram has also been caught up in the economic crisis in eastern Europe.
Its regional market has shrunk by 90 per cent with the disintegration of
Comecon, the communist trading bloc, while the recession in Hungary has left
domestic demand stagnant.
But, most painfully for an exporter like Tungsram, the Hungarian government
has encouraged the Forint to appreciate in real terms to tame inflation.
Tungsram has been a prime mover within the Hungarian Association of
International Companies, the multinational investors' lobby group, for
accelerated devaluation. But no other western investor is as dependent on
exports as GE is with Tungsram, and so it is difficult to mobilise support.
To cap it all, prices for lighting products in Tungsram's main market of
western Europe, where it has a 6 per cent to 7 per cent share, have until
recently been falling, depressed by recession and fierce competition from
rivals Philips and Siemens's Osram.
The gloomy environment makes GE's move to recapitalise Tungsram, which will
take the US company's investment from Dollars 350m to over Dollars 500m, all
the more striking.
The infusion is a token of GE's commitment to Tungsram, say executives. GE
points to its achievements of the last three years at Tungsram as the
reasons for its continuing faith in the company's future.
Productivity has improved dramatically since GE took over. Sales have risen
by half since 1989 to Ft31bn in 1992, while the number of employees has
fallen 18,000 to 10,200. GE forecasts further improvement in productivity of
20 per cent in 1993 after 14 per cent growth last year.
GE has also hived off peripheral businesses, halved the number of levels in
the hierarchy, and halved the turnround time between order and delivery. The
new owners have also taken investment from 1 to 2 per cent of sales to over
5 per cent. GE has built a Dollars 30m greenfield plant in Nagykanizsa in
western Hungary to concentrate worldwide production of compact fluorescent
lamps.
Impressed with researchers at Tungsram, GE Lighting has established in
Hungary four of the division's nine technology centres around the world.
GE has even overcome the initial cultural gap within the management, most
notably appointing Hungarian Mr Miklos Csapody to head technology for the
whole of GE Lighting Europe, which includes Thorn of the UK as well as
Tungsram.
What could have been done better? 'We could have gone faster,' admits Mr
Charles Pieper, chief executive officer of GE Lighting Europe. Now GE has
pressed the accelerator pedal.
The company has put Mr Pieper in direct control of Tungsram and sidelined
the former chief executive officer. He recently announced 900 additional job
losses and a drive to reduce prices charged by suppliers.
Mr Pieper characterises as 'aggressive patience' the attitude of Mr Jack
Welch, the GE group's chief executive. GE can only hope that Tungsram's
future is brilliant enough to be worth the wait.

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: African sales surge behind rise at Paterson
Zochonis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in Africa, which outstripped adverse currency movements, drove
up pre-tax profits at Paterson Zochonis, the soap and detergents group, by
11.3 per cent from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 12.9m in the six months to
November 30.
Associates'contributions increased by 68 per cent to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds
1.21m) thanks to a surge in sales in Nigeria - the group's biggest African
market - and in Kenya and Ghana. Core operating profits were ahead slightly
at Pounds 6.36m (Pounds 6.03m).
Mr Alan Whittaker, finance director, said the African growth was strong
enough to offset the effect of a decline in the value of the Nigerian naira
which has repeatedly held back group profits in recent years.
The weakness of sterling actually yielded a rare exchange rate benefit in
the latter part of last year, Mr Whittaker said, but this had since been
reversed by a 20 per cent tumble in the naira's value against the pound in
the last two months.
He expected full year profits to be slightly ahead of last year's Pounds
26.6m.
Paterson - best known for its Cussons range of soap and toiletries - said
there was no recurrence of the boost it received in the second half of last
year when the Nigerian authorities settled Pounds 7.3m in outstanding debts
to the company.
Nor did it anticipate any further settlement in the second half this year.
Paterson originally set aside Pounds 10m to cover unpaid debts.
First half turnover rose 7 per cent to Pounds 121.8m (Pounds 113.8m). Mr
Whittaker said Paterson retained its 20 per cent UK soap market share.
Investment income was up from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 7.87m, reflecting
Paterson's continued accumulation of a large cash hoard, which Mr Whittaker
said stood at Pounds 160m.
Earnings per share increased from 14.22p to 16.24p. The interim dividend is
raised to 2.35p (2.25p).

FT  17 MAR 93 / GE to recapitalise Hungarian group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL ELECTRIC of the US yesterday moved to inject Ft17bn (Pounds 130m) of
fresh capital into Tungsram, its troubled Hungarian lighting joint venture,
in the wake of losses which wiped out the company's equity.
The infusion will take GE's investment in Hungary over Dollars 500m (Pounds
352m) - far more than the US company envisaged when in 1990 it paid Dollars
150m for an initial 50 per cent stake in Tungsram.
The decision on recapitalisation was taken at an extraordinary general
meeting of the company yesterday.
GE, which owns 75 per cent of the group, forced through the recapitalisation
against the objections of Hungarian Credit Bank, a state-owned bank, which
controls 24.4 per cent of Tungsram's capital.
The recapitalisation comes a week after Tungsram announced losses of Ft9bn
in 1992, 70 per cent more than the year before. Mr Charles Pieper, chief
executive of GE Lighting Europe and Tungsram itself, blamed cost inflation,
the strength of the Hungarian currency and restructuring charges.
But Hungarian Credit Bank said yesterday that it could not understand the
extent of the losses. The bank has hired Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
international accountants, to conduct an independent audit of Tungsram's
results. The bank said that it had voted against the GE proposals because it
was 'absolutely unhappy' with the value given to its shares in Tungsram. An
executive said that the interests of minority shareholders had been
neglected. GE for its part described the restatement of Tungsram's capital
as 'realistic'. GE said: 'We have lost the equity value of the company.'
But both sides agreed that some kind of recapitalisation was essential. GE
said that it was necessary to pay down external debts of Dollars 200m and
make new investments.
Hungarian Credit Bank retains the option of maintaining its shareholding by
taking up part of the capital increase. GE said it hoped that the minority
shareholders would participate.
But Hungarian Credit Bank, which has been hit by large bad loans and is in
the process of being privatised, is unlikely to commit further funds to
Tungsram, a government official said.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Call by Yeltsin for immediate western support: Warning of
'serious threat' to democracy; Mitterrand seeks G7 meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday called for immediate and
substantial western aid to stave off what he called 'the serious danger of
reaction' in Russia.
Mr Yeltsin, speaking at a joint news conference with French president
Francois Mitterrand, said 'there is a very, very serious threat hanging over
democracy and reforms'.
He said last week's session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the
country's top legislature, showed that communist forces were intent to
avenge their defeat in the 1991 coup. 'I believe the western world and
western countries did not understand the reality of revanchism before the
eighth Congress,' Mr Yeltsin said in calling urgently for aid. 'We cannot
wait for Tokyo in June or July. It may prove too late,' he added.
Mr Mitterrand suggested Group of Seven leaders meet as soon as possible
after Mr Yeltsin's summit with President Bill Clinton in Vancouver on April
4 to discuss Russia's problems.
When asked if the west would continue its support for Mr Yeltsin if he
introduced authoritarian measures, Mr Mitterrand said: 'If we must choose
between camps in the country then we will choose the camp which continues
democratic and economic reform.'
He added, however, that Mr Yeltsin had 'proposals to make to the Russian
people and I am certain he will do so in a democratic way'.
Mr Yeltsin has said he will continue to hold a plebiscite next month, after
the Congress denied him the right to hold a referendum. In doing so, he will
directly challenge the parliament, which has ruled such a move
unconstitutional and has voted itself the powers to strip him of office.
Mr Yeltsin said he would not make 'rash decisions' but would resolve what to
do in the near future. He and Mr Mitterrand said the crisis would have to be
settled in the next few weeks.
The French president made clear there were sharply differing views among the
Group of Seven industrialised countries on the urgency of aid to Russia.
France and Germany were leading those who believed in the need for urgent
action.
Japan by contrast had so far refused to take part in a high-level G7 meeting
before the scheduled heads of state conference in Tokyo in July.
Mr Mitterrand suggested that if Japan continued to refuse to take part, the
meeting should go ahead outside the formal boundaries of the G7 process.
Mr Yeltsin meanwhile signed a decree expanding his cabinet to include
central bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko, who has been accused of undermining
economic reform attempts with easy credits.
His advisers have pressed him to make a move towards the centrists,
represented by the Civic Union bloc, by offering seats to their
representatives as a way of broadening his political base before holding a
plebiscite.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced it had signed
a Dollars 43.8m technical co-operation loan to aid privatisation in Russia.

SIEMENS, the German electrical engineering group, claimed yesterday that its
share in a US order for 350 diesel-electric locomotives provided a firm base
for further expansion in the American railways market.
The DM1bn (Dollars 600m) order from Burlington Northern Railroad, one of the
biggest rail freight carriers in the US, was the largest single investment
in the history of US railways, Siemens said.
The lead contractor will be General Motors' locomotive division, EMD, which
will build the engines in factories in Illinois and Ontario, Canada. The
Stuttgart-based group will earn around DM170m, excluding income from
licences granted to EMD, from the supply of three-phase alternating current
motors.
The first eight 4,500 horsepower locomotives will be delivered this year and
the rest of the order will be completed by the end of 1997.
Compared with the direct current diesel-electric motors commonly used in the
US, Siemens said its power units were cheaper to run and maintain.
General Motors is recalling 1.8m pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles,
equivalent to about 50 per cent of the vehicles' production, to correct a
transmission fluid problem, Reuter reports from Detroit.

OMAN and India have reached preliminary agreement to build an undersea gas
pipeline capable of delivering 50m cubic metres of Omani gas a day to
industries on India's west coast. Gulf oil executives say the deal will be
worth around Dollars 4.5bn and could be completed within four years.
The two states have also agreed to build two 120,000 b/d oil refineries in
India, with the Omani government partnering India's Hindustan Petroleum and
Baharat Oil.
The Oman Oil Company, an arm of the country's oil and finance ministries, is
to conduct a feasibility study on the 900km pipeline, which would have to
pass over the continental shelf off Iran and Pakistan.
Oil industry officials said a substantial part of the deal was likely to be
financed by export credits. Oman has reportedly proposed a 40-year gas
supply contract.
The Oman Oil Company has also signed a deal to link Kazakhstan's biggest
oilfield with a coastal terminal. Both deals are part of Oman's attempts to
diversify and broaden its hydrocarbons industry.
The deal with India would give Oman a reliable local market for its gas,
proven reserves of which have doubled in two years to 490bn cubic metres.
'If you look at the delivery costs to India, by ship or pipeline, the
pipeline comes out favourably,' says one industry official.
Oman will also supply crude oil for the two refineries to be built in India,
under the memo of understanding signed at the weekend. Oman's national news
agency said one would be built in central and one in western India.
Industry officials said the two deals offered a natural match between
India's growing appetite for imported fuels and Oman's desire to exploit
both its natural hydrocarbon reserves and its already strong diplomatic ties
with the sub-continent.

<TEXT>
AN ADVISORY body to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has
accused European and US companies of violating restrictions on the export of
sensitive technologies to China.
The Centre for Information on Strategic Technology, comprising industry
representatives, said investigations of Chinese factories had identified a
range of sophisticated machine tools, exports of which were prohibited by
the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom).
In recent years, Japanese technology producers have admitted exporting
equipment illegally to the former Soviet Union and Iran, but the industry is
angry that Japanese companies should be thought less ready than others to
respect Cocom regulations.
The confidential Cistec report describes the results of visits to factories
in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities by member companies, which claim to
have found a range of banned equipment apparently provided by US and
European producers.
Delivery of the confidential report to Miti coincides with a debate within
the Japanese government over exports of sensitive technologies to China.
Miti has supported an easing of technology export restrictions, but
officials in Japan's Foreign Ministry are concerned that some equipment
could be used to help the Chinese army in its ambitious plans to develop
high-tech weaponry.
The ministry's concerns are shared by Washington. A Pentagon official said
the US was concerned that China would use sophisticated technology to
upgrade advanced military aircraft and other hardware acquired from Russia.
A Japanese ministry official said the government was torn between wanting to
cultivate ties with Beijing by providing sophisticated technology and
longer-term fears that political instability in China could make the
People's Liberation Army a volatile force in the region.
The US and European technology identified by Cistec members included a
sophisticated machining centre, laser equipment, and advanced numerically
controlled machinery, all of which could be applied to the manufacture of
military hardware.

<TEXT>
A PROMINENT figure in the Iranian exiled opposition, Mr Mohammed Hussein
Nagdi, was shot dead in Rome yesterday by two unidentified gunmen, writes
Robert Graham.
The killing was denounced by the Iranian opposition as the work of agents of
the Tehran government. The murder was condemned by the Italian Foreign
Ministry and members of parliament, who pointed out the Iranian opposition
was not as active in Italy as in France, the UK and Germany.
Mr Nagdi was killed as he went to work yesterday morning at the offices of
the Iranian opposition in Rome. Two youths on a scooter opened fire
seriously wounding him but leaving his chauffeur unharmed. Mr Nagdi was dead
on arrival at hospital.
Before the Iranian revolution, Mr Nagdi had worked in the Rome embassy and
stayed on after siding with anti-Khomeini movement. According to Italian
security forces, he was considered a person at risk and was granted a
part-time escort.
Mr Abolhassan Bani Sadr, the former Iranian president now in exile in Paris,
claimed yesterday that Tehran regime was preparing a series of attempts on
the lives of opposition figures in Europe. He said German police had
recently discovered a list of suspected targets - 11 in Germany, 12 in
France, three in the UK and one in Britain.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREAN defence officials said yesterday they had not detected any
unusual military activity in North Korea in spite of the country being
placed on a 'semi-war' footing last week.
Pyongyang took the step in response to the large US-South Korean Team Spirit
military exercise, while also withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty.
The Seoul officials said current military movements in North Korea were
consistent with battle mobilisation measures taken in reaction to previous
Team Spirit exercises, which have been held since 1976.
Mr Kwon Young-hae, South Korean defence minister, told the National Assembly
that Seoul had consulted Washington on the possibility of some of the US
troops taking part in Team Spirit staying in South Korea after the exercise
ends tomorrow.
But defence officials said if North Korean military activity remained
normal, this request was unlikely to be made.
The US military command in South Korea said there was no change so far in
plans to take the 55,000 US troops mobilised for Team Spirit from the
country.
The exercise tests US ability to reinforce its 38,000 troops in South Korea
in the case of war.
North Korea has routinely condemned such exercises as a threat to its
security and by putting troops on increased alert. Pyongyang has also used
the exercises as a pretext to break off previous negotiations with Seoul
about nuclear inspections.
The Team Spirit exercise this year coincided with the International Atomic
Energy Agency's demand that North Korea let it inspect two suspected nuclear
facilities by March 25 or face possible economic sanctions by the UN
Security Council.
The decision to place North Korea on a 'semi-war' footing on March 9, the
day Team Spirit began, was made by Mr Kim Jong-il, son of President Kim
Il-sung and his designated successor, according to Naewoe, the South Korean
agency that monitors North Korean news.
Mr Li Chol, North Korean ambassador at the UN in Geneva, said his country
might reverse its decision on withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty if the US permanently suspended Team Spirit, according to Japan's
Kyodo News Service.
He also said the IAEA should 'stop obeying the only superpower', meaning the
US, and that it should operate in an impartial manner.
He suggested that the IAEA had made its demand for a special inspection of
the North Korean nuclear facilities on US orders.

A FORMER minister was shot dead as he left his home in suburban Algiers
yesterday, AP reports.
The official Algerian news agency APS said Mr Djilali Liabes, 45, was shot
at his home in Ben Omar by three gunmen who fled. The gunmen shot him three
times in the head, witnesses said. Ben Omar is in south-east Algiers near
Kouba, a stronghold of Moslem militants, who have faced a tough government
crackdown for more than a year.
Mr Liabes left government last July to head the National Institute of
Strategic Global Studies. He was numbered among intellectuals known to be
sympathetic with the army-backed committee running the country and against
the Islamic extremists.
He was a former professor of sociology and had directed several political
research studies before joining the government in June 1991.
Mr Liabes was recently named head of the 'Group of Experts 2015', to draw up
a study on Algeria's future.
The murder was the second attack on a politically prominent intellectual in
three days. On Sunday Mr Hafid Senhadri, chief of staff at the Ministry of
Vocational Training, was seriously wounded by gunmen in a stairwell of the
building where he lived. He remains in a coma.

<TEXT>
A BOMB explosion damaged seven empty tour buses parked yards away from the
Egyptian Museum in Cairo's busiest square yesterday, one of a series of
attacks a week after Egyptian security forces launched a tough crackdown on
suspected Islamic militants.
Tourists had left the buses for the Egyptian Museum, one of Cairo's most
popular attractions, just 100 yards away. No one claimed responsibility. But
it appeared a defiant gesture from Islamic militants who have waged sporadic
attacks on tourist targets for much of the past year - considerably hurting
Egypt's precious tourism earnings.
The explosion took place during the midday rush in Tahrir Square, scene last
month of a coffee-shop bombing which killed three.
It came in the teeth of tightened security at all Egypt's tourist centres
and intensified operations against suspected members of the Gama'a
al-Islamiyya, the underground Islamic group behind most recent attacks.
Bus drivers in Tahrir Square said their vehicles had been searched for bombs
just 30 minutes before the blast.
An explosive device was also found and defused in a building housing
'foreign experts' in a central Cairo suburb, according to the semi-official
al-Ahram news agency.
Meanwhile, militants launched three bomb attacks on police in Aswan, the
tourist centre in Upper Egypt where police last week stormed a mosque and
shot dead nine alleged members of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya.
The clashes follow a week of incidents as Egyptian security forces have
followed up the Aswan raid and simultaneous dawn raids last week on eight
alleged militant hideouts in Cairo in which a total of 23 people died.
A total of 35 thirty-five alleged militants were arrested and one policeman
killed during a security sweep in Assiut, Upper Egypt, on Monday, the same
day security forces were reported to have rounded up 424 people in
Alexandria.
The US embassy on Monday called in around 40 members of the US business
community to discuss security, following a threat earlier this month by
Gama'a al-Islamiyya to attack foreign investments.
The embassy stressed only that businesses should step up routine
precautions.
'There was no recommendation to leave Egypt or take any drastic measures,'
said one businessman present.

ONE Palestinian was killed and more than 60 suffered bullet wounds in Gaza
yesterday, as intensified violence in the occupied territories cast a deeper
shadow over the prospects for a resumption of Middle East peace
negotiations.
The mood in the occupied territories and Israel itself contrasts strongly
with the upbeat assessment of the peace process provided by President Bill
Clinton and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, after more than three
hours of talks at the White House on Monday.
A spokesman for Mr Rabin said he would be returning three days earlier than
expected from the US in order to address the problem of worsening violence.
The clashes yesterday between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops
at the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza were said to be the worst since the
outbursts which followed the deportation of 415 Palestinians by Israel to
southern Lebanon in December.
Palestinian negotiators insist they will not resume peace talks until Israel
makes a public commitment not to resort to mass deportations in future.
Mr Clinton said on Monday that the deportation issue had already been dealt
with and had not featured in his talks with Mr Rabin. This further angered
the Palestinians and Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman for the negotiating
team, said it was a mistake for the US and Israel to think they could just
push the issue to one side.
In Gaza, doctors said that a 17-year-old boy died after being shot in the
chest and they had treated many more with bullet wounds, four of whom were
in a serious condition.
Israeli troops opened fire several times on stone-throwing Palestinians who
had taken to the streets after the lifting of a curfew on the Khan Younis
camp.
The latest clashes come against deepening concern in Israel over attacks on
Jewish civilians by individual Palestinians.
Mr Moshe Shalal, the police minister, responded to rising demands for
official action by promising 'not to allow the Palestinians, the Arabs and
the terrorists to defeat us'. Police leave has been cancelled and
recruitment is to be stepped up.
At least 10 Israelis and 58 Palestinians have been killed since the upsurge
in violence provoked by the expulsion of the 415 Palestinians.
Further Israeli action can be expected after Mr Rabin returns from the US,
with growing calls for the physical isolation of the Gaza strip from Israel
if there is no reduction in the level of violence.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S Interior Ministry yesterday said Romanians were beginning to
renounce their citizenship to avoid repatriation once measures aimed at
tightening the country's asylum laws were approved by parliament next month.
But the ministry warned Romania that it would be required to take back
stateless citizens under international law, which states that people should
be accepted by their last country of citizenship.
The announcement has fuelled fears that the country may be inundated with
tens of thousands of would-be asylum seekers before the new measures are
introduced.
The proposed constitutional amendments, among other things, will allow
authorities on the borders to return to a third, 'safe country' through
which they entered Germany, refugees who cannot prove they are fleeing
persecution.
More than 38,000 asylum-seekers arrived in Germany last month, and 20 per
cent in the first two months of this year more than the same period in 1992.
More than 7,800 came from Romania in January alone.
Meanwhile ministers from central and eastern European countries meeting in
Prague yesterday failed to agree on a framework for a multilateral solution
to deal with the expected flow of refugees likely to result from the
tightening of the asylum law changes.
Ministers and deputy ministers from Austria, the Czech republic, Hungary,
Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia agreed instead to speed bilateral agreements
with individual states from which immigrants come.
A final communique said ministers would intensify their efforts to establish
standardised agreements on the return of refugees.
The countries represented at the meeting are nevertheless expected to agree
to measures to strengthen their borders against the flow of thousands of
would-be immigrants making their way westward in search of a better life.
Czech officials sought to put a brave face on disappointing results for a
conference which it was hoped would help soothe German concern at lax border
controls in central and eastern Europe and lay the ground for a broader
solution to deal with the thousands of immigrants who might be expelled from
Germany.
The Bonn government, whose decision to tighten its asylum laws followed a
wave of violent anti-immigrant protests, was not invited to the meeting. But
officials said the meeting did not aim to confront Germany but to find ways
to improve co-operation on resolving the issue.
Several hundred thousand immigrants, many of whom travelled through Poland
and the Czech republic, may be forced to leave Germany once the new asylum
laws are enforced. Prague and Warsaw want to ensure immigrants are not
dumped on their doorstep.

SPAIN'S year-on-year inflation rate has fallen to 4.7 per cent, its lowest
level since June 1988, the consumer price index for January published
yesterday showed.
The January statistics, which were held over for a month while the index's
weighting was overhauled, showed a CPI rise of just 0.9 per cent. Figures
for February, which will be published midway through next week, are expected
to bring the 12-month inflation rate down to below 4.5 per cent.
Domestic inflation began to peak in the third quarter of last year: Spain's
GDP registered a negative growth over the last three months of 1992, - 0.2
per cent, and the CPI ended last year with a rise of 5.4 per cent that was
marginally down on the December 1991 figure. The markets had expected the
recession to be reflected by a fast fall in the inflation rate at the start
of this year.
Underlying inflation, which does not include the more volatile prices of
non-processed foods and energy, fell by slightly less than the headline
rate, to come down from 6.9 per cent at the end of December to 6.5 per cent
in January.
The lower inflation rate, which is a direct result of the slump in domestic
demand, has fuelled hopes for a cut in the official intervention rate early
next week at the Bank of Spain's routine repurchase tender for its
certificates of deposit.
Such expectations will be all the higher should the Bundesbank ease interest
rates tomorrow.

SENIOR Russian officials have cautioned east European countries not to form
closer political and military ties with Ukraine, according to officials in
Kiev and western diplomats.
A senior official in the Ukrainian foreign ministry warned that in the past
few weeks conservatives had taken over Russian foreign policy making, and
had now launched a concerted campaign to bring Ukraine back under Russian
hegemony.
The change in Russian attitudes towards Ukraine comes at a time when
hardliners in Moscow have been winning a series of political showdowns with
President Boris Yeltsin, forcing him to take a less conciliatory line to
neighbouring states than he might otherwise adopt.
This month, for example, Mr Yeltsin called on the United Nations to give
Russia special authority to police disputes in the former Soviet Union,
eliciting protests from independent-minded republics such as Ukraine and
Moldova.
'Russia's attitude toward its neighbours can now be compared to Germany's in
1939,' the Ukrainian official said. 'This is a crucial moment when the west
must realise that the consequences of a policy of appeasement are as
dangerous as they were in 1939.'
Western diplomats in Ukraine say they are concerned about the new trend. One
said Russian officials were warning east European countries 'not to bother
building large embassies in Kiev because within 18 months they will be
downgraded to consular sections'.
Mr Sergei Stankevich, a political adviser to Mr Yeltsin, recently warned
Poland to limit growing political and military ties with Ukraine.
Speaking in Warsaw last month, Mr Stankevich said Ukraine and Belarus fell
within Russia's sphere of influence and Russia was opposed to the
increasingly cosy relationship between Ukraine and Poland in foreign and
military policy.
In the past three months four Polish ministers, including the prime minister
and minister of defence, have visited Ukraine and the Ukrainian minister of
defence has recently been to Warsaw. Poland, which just over a year ago was
the first country to recognise Ukraine, has signed a number of military and
political agreements with its neighbour.
Ties are also growing between Ukraine and Hungary, where Ukrainian president
Leonid Kravchuk travelled this month.
Mr Leonid Smoliakov, the Russian ambassador to Ukraine, has also recently
been taking a tougher stance. He recently said that if the people of Crimea,
the contested peninsula which is currently part of Ukraine, express a desire
for self-determination, Russia would support their choice.
Western diplomats say Mr Smoliakov privately describes Ukrainian
independence as a 'transitional' phenomenon.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Italian Liberal leader steps down: Party chief accused of
receiving illicit funds denies any wrongdoing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LEADER of Italy's Liberal party resigned yesterday. He is the third
party head in a month forced to step down as a result of being implicated in
the corruption scandals that have rocked the country.
Mr Renato Altissimo's move came after he was warned on Monday he was under
investigation by Milan magistrates for allegedly receiving L50m (Dollars
32,000) in illicit funds from Enel, the national electricity authority. Mr
Altissimo, who denied any wrongdoing, was one of 10 parliamentarians advised
this week they were under investigation over Enel payments.
The small Liberal party is a partner in the four-party government coalition
led by prime minister Giuliano Amato, but Mr Altissimo's decision is not
expected to affect its stability.
Nevertheless, it underlines again the extent to which the corruption scandal
is eroding the credibility of the traditional parties and removing
well-known figures from public life. Already Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist
leader, and Mr Giorgio La Malfa of the Republicans have had to step down
after being accused of accepting illegal payments.
Mr Amato again came under fierce attack in parliament yesterday. In chaotic
scenes in the Chamber of Deputies, Mr Amato was frequently interrupted by
members from the neo-fascist MSI party and Lombard League as he concluded
the debate on how to confront the crisis caused by the corruption
allegations.
He urged parliament to adopt a bipartisan approach to dealing with
corruption. But it was still unclear how the parties would agree on
legislation to achieve a political solution to the corruption scandals.
In another development Milan magistrates began yesterday to leak excerpts of
a confession by Mr Gabriele Cagliari, head of Eni, the state energy and
chemical company, arrested a week ago.
He is said to have confirmed that Eni made illicit payments to political
parties before he took over in 1990 and during his period as chairman. The
magistrates have long regarded Eni as the heart of the system of illicit
party funding.
The scale of parliamentary involvement in the scandal has also been
underlined this week by action by other magistrates in Naples and Reggio
Calabria.
In Naples three deputies are now under investigation in a new scandal over
the privatisation of rubbish collection. The deputies include Mr Giulio Di
Donato, the leading Socialist in Naples, and Mr Raffaele Mastrantuono, a
Socialist and a member of the parliamentary commission charged with
assessing whether to waive the immunity of members implicated in the
scandals.
At the same time Mr Riccardo Misasi, a deputy and key figure in the
Christian Democrat power structure of southern Italy, has been accused of
corruption and links with the Mafia over contracts in Reggio Calabria.
Another new investigation has been opened with potentially far-reaching
consequences - this time into the affairs of the agricultural finance
consortium, Federconsorzi, which collapsed with huge debts in 1991.

RAUTARUUKKI, the Finnish steel group, cut pre-tax losses to FM524m (Dollars
86.46m) in 1992 from FM926m a year earlier, but for the second year running
it will pay no dividend.
The group said a FM568m foreign exchange loss, following the markka
devaluation, was the main reason it stayed in the red, but it also blamed
higher interest payments and difficulties at its Transtech rolling stock
subsidiary.
Operating profit before depreciation nearly doubled to FM1.06bn from FM541m,
amounting to 16 per cent of turnover which eased to FM6.51bn from FM6.85bn.

M0, the narrow measure of money supply targeted by the government, has been
growing more slowly on a seasonally adjusted basis than thought, the Bank of

coins in circulation - grew by 4.5 per cent in the 12 months to February
compared with 4.8 per cent announced previously. Year-on-year growth did not
breach the government's 0 per cent to 4 per cent target range in January.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue wrote off nearly Pounds 900m in unpaid taxes in 1991  -
an increase of 55 per cent on 1990.
The disclosure, covering the latest year for which figures are available,
came in a written Commons answer from Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial
secretary to the Treasury.
The sum written off in 1990 totalled nearly Pounds 569m, he indicated in a
reply to Mr Archie Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat MP for Roxburgh and
Berwickshire.
In a separate answer, Mr Dorrell disclosed that an independent survey in
June 1992 suggested that one in three employed taxpayers were dissatisfied
with service from the Inland Revenue.
Research International, a market research group, found that only 65 per cent
of employed and self-employed taxpayers were satisfied.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Group debates life after Taurus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 60 represent-atives of custody and registration companies met
yesterday at the offices of Royal Bank of Scotland in the City in an attempt
to agree a joint approach on a successor to the Taurus settlement system.
Some large institutional investors were also present, and the meeting marked
the start of concerted lobbying on the issue.
Custodians and registrars, who provide securities services to large
investors and listed companies, potentially have the most to lose from the
stock-market settlement system chosen in place of Taurus.
The representatives at the meeting agreed to submit a joint proposal to the
Bank of England task force on settlement, under associate director Mr Pen
Kent, by the end of this week. This will recommend that the Bank pushes
ahead with developing an automated settlement system for large institutional
investors.
Also, it will recommend setting up a clearing house to take over the running
of settlement from the Stock Exchange, said Mr Pearson.
A further recommendation will be for a quick move to rolling settlement,
under which all share bargains are settled after a set number of days.
Mr Terry Pearson, head of global custody at Royal Bank of Scotland, said
yesterday's meeting had shown a positive reaction to the Bank of England's
push to find a quick replacement for Taurus. He said the initiative did not
represent an attempt by particular vested interests in the City to protect
their position. Registrars derailed the original Taurus proposal in the late
1980s by opposing the setting up of a central database to hold all records
of shareholdings. It was also considered technically difficult and expensive
to build such a large database, although computing costs have fallen since
then.
Yesterday Mr Pearson said the idea of a central share depository and
registration service remained technically difficult. 'That was kicked into
touch before,' he said. 'It was an impossible task.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission and the US Commerce Department both acted yesterday
to prevent dumping of South Korean-built semiconductor memory chips.
In both cases, Korean chip manufacturers were found to have sold Dynamic
Random Access Memory (Dram) chips below fair value. In the US, dumping
duties were set at 0.74 per cent to 7.19 per cent with Hyundai facing the
highest duties.
The EC, however, has secured an agreement on minimum prices from the three
leading Korean manufacturers of Dram chips, heading off the threat of
extended anti-dumping duties. Goldstar, Hyundai and Samsung have offered
undertakings on future minimum prices as part of a new self-policing Korean
producers' regime on memory chips, similar to an EC arrangement with
Japanese producers. Other Korean producers face anti-dumping duties of 24.7
per cent.
Korean industry and trade officials had tried to secure a similar
arrangement with the US but were rebuffed. However, the final dumping duties
determined by the Commerce Department are far lower than its original
estimates, which had ranged from 6 to 87 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Explosion kills 45 in Calcutta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroyed
two blocks of flats in the centre of the city of Calcutta, killing at least
45 people and injuring scores of others.
Police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of
Bowbazaar shortly after midnight, causing two blocks of flats to collapse
and trapping up to 70 people in the rubble.
The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five
days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a
series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of
Bombay.
A militant Sikh group fighting for independence for the Indian state of
Punjab has claimed responsibility for the Bombay blasts, but police are
unconvinced, saying they were carried out by a foreign group in connivance
with 'local criminals'.
In what many interpreted as a reference to Pakistan, with whom India has
fought three wars, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home
(interior) minister, told parliament in New Delhi that he suspected 'an
international conspiracy.'
Most of the estimated 125 people living in the Calcutta flats were in their
beds when the blast occurred, setting fire to both buildings, according to
officials in the city's central control room. At least 45 people were dead
on arrival at hospital, they said.
Last Friday a series of car bombs exploded in Bombay in what the government
described as a systematic attack on India's commercial heart. Among the
targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a
shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
The attacks in Calcutta and Bombay are a severe setback to attempts to heal
the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep
shock throughout India.
More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after
the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on
December 6.
Some fear the wave of bomb attacks is designed to stir a renewal of communal
strife and undermine efforts by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao to
open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.
Last night national and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt
to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence. Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore
rumours after the 'inhuman and criminal blast'.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Tory jury still out over delicate balancing act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS designed as the Budget which would demonstrate that the government
had restored its grip on economic policy.
Last night the government's supporters at Westminster suspended judgment on
whether it would succeed. They knew Mr Norman Lamont had faced unpalatable
choices. They were unsure if he had made the right ones.
The toughest Budget for more than a decade - albeit with most of the pain
deferred - was greeted publicly by Conservative MPs with a mixture of weary
resignation and dutiful applause.
Privately, their thoughts mirrored the behind-the-scenes debate between and
Mr Lamont and Mr John Major which produced the final delicate balancing act
between nurturing economic recovery and tackling the budget deficit.
There was general relief that Mr Major had prevailed in insisting that the
inevitable tax increases should bite only a year from now. There was
agreement that Mr Lamont had been right to insist that the financial markets
would not be satisfied with vague promises - that the increases had to be
spelt out and in large part legislated for now.
Some wanted more pain now. Others would have preferred less overall. But
most thought that the balance had been struck as skilfully as possible in
such difficult times.
Yet few were confident that the foreign exchange dealers or the voters would
agree with them. This, in the words of one member of the cabinet, was a
'time-will-tell-Budget'.
Over the next few days Mr Lamont will sell the Budget for all he is worth.
He is fighting for his political life.
Last night the telephone lines between 11 Downing Street and the offices of
leading newspaper editors were humming. The chancellor may have bracketed
newspapers and sewage together in his Budget speech but he knows he needs
support.
He has probably enhanced his chances of holding on to the chancellorship.
Most of November's decisions have been pre-empted. Few missed his deliberate
decision to flaunt his Euro-sceptic credentials in the Budget speech.
The 'soft' rebels against the Maastricht treaty who Mr Major needs to win
back are in his chancellor's constituency. The prime minister's associates
say he will wait until July before making any decision on cabinet
reshuffles.
Cabinet colleagues were supportive if grim-faced about Mr Lamont's efforts.
They too believe that the government's first objective must be to show it is
no longer simply a victim of events.
But a scathing Commons attack by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, dispelled
any illusions that it would bring short-term popularity.
Mr Smith's comment that it was a 'shameful Budget from a cynical party' was
followed by the private admission of one minister that Mr Lamont had offered
no more or less than an 'acknowledgment of the depressing reality'.
Underlying the concern was the realisation that the government has reneged
on the spirit, if not the letter, of its general election pledges. Back in
1981, when similar decisions had been made, the government could blame it on
Labour's mismanagement during the 1970s. Now Lord Lawson - a Conservative
former chancellor - is the only scapegoat.
So general enthusiasm (some thought Mr Lamont should be tougher sooner) for
the decision to defer the extension of valued added tax, the increase in
National Insurance contributions and the reduction in mortgage interest
relief was tempered by concern over the medium-term outlook.
As ministers and Tory MPs studied the fine print they were hit by the
realisation that two years of substantial tax increases will still leave a
budget deficit of Pounds 30bn by the time of the next general election in
1997.
There was no despair on the Tory back benches last night. The measures to
help small businesses and exporters won genuine acclaim. But the party
signalled that it would applaud Mr Lamont with conviction only when economic
recovery became a reality. If the Budget heralds another false dawn, the
fate of the chancellor - and of the government - will be altogether more
precarious.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Voluntary sector disappointed by the
give and take - Charities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX RELIEF on two of the government's main vehicles for trying to stimulate
charitable support - Payroll Giving and Gift Aid - will be extended under
measures announced yesterday.
But in spite of these welcome boosts, voluntary sector leaders were last
night disappointed about the wider effects of the budget.
Both the imposition of VAT on fuel and power and proposed reductions in tax
credits on dividends will have a serious impact.
The annual tax relief limit for employees' donations to charity under
payroll deduction schemes will rise from Pounds 600 to Pounds 900 from next
month. At the same time, the Chancellor announced that single gifts of
Pounds 250 or more will in future qualify for tax relief under Gift Aid -
the current minimum is Pounds 400.
Mr Lamont estimated that the changes would increase tax relief on donations
to charity by around Pounds 30m in a full year. Even if this proves correct,
however, Britain's big charities stand to lose a similar amount as a result
of the decision to impose VAT on fuel and power.
The Charities Tax Reform Group, which represents many of the larger
charities, calculates that its 300 affiliated organisations will lose Pounds
27m a year as a result of the decision. Mr Adrian Randall, the group's
chairman, contrasted the government's failure to exempt charities from VAT
on fuel and power with its proposed VAT support to the racehorse industry.
'What is more important - horses or people?' he asked.
The reform group fears that the tax credit reduction will eventually have an
even more severe effect.
Although it will be phased in over four years for charities, it says the
change will eventually cost the sector an annual Pounds 100m.
Mr Lamont announced yesterday that tickets in the forthcoming National
Lottery will be taxed at 12 per cent in the first year of operationr.
However, the chancellor said the tax rate would be kept under review.
The National Council for Voluntary Organisations had campaigned for a 5 per
cent tax rate, and many charity managers fear the lottery will divert money
that might otherwise have gone into direct charitable support.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Distillers avoid added burden -
Drinks and Tobacco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET brought relief to the Scotch whisky industry but disappointment
to brewers and drinks retailers.
After long and intensive lobbying by the Scotch whisky industry, the
chancellor was finally persuaded not to add to the tax burden on spirits.
'This is very good news for one of Britain's most successful exports and we
appreciate the consideration,' Mr Tony Greener, chairman and chief executive
of Guinness, said yesterday. 'Clearly the chancellor has listened to the
industry and we hope he will do the same next year.'
The Scotch Whisky Association also made it clear that the narrowing of the
tax differential with beer and wine was only 'a move in the right
direction'.
The industry, faced with a 10 per cent decline in scotch sales and the
closure of distilleries, had argued strongly that any tax increases would
lead to further job losses. It also warned that excessive taxation of
spirits in the UK encouraged similar taxation policies in other European
Community states, endangering exports.
The chancellor acknowledged these arguments - but the clinching argument may
have been the fall in tax revenue from spirits.
In 1991-92, the government's tax receipts of Pounds 2.6bn from spirits were
2.3 per cent lower in real terms than in the previous year. Falling sales
since then are estimated to have cost the chancellor a further Pounds
50m-Pounds 60m.
The chancellor also recognised the drinks industry's concern about the
impact of cross-Channel shopping - encouraged by lower Continental taxes -
on the brewers and drinks retailers.
Even though estimates suggest the chancellor may lose up to Pounds 200m in
revenue this year from duty-paid drinks imports, he did nothing to avert the
danger. The increase of 5 per cent in duties on beer and wine adds 1.5p to a
pint of beer and 5.5p to a bottle of wine.
The Brewers' Society condemned the duty increase as a further incentive to
duty-paid imports of beer, which already accounted for nearly one pint in 10
drunk at home. 'It will have serious consequences for UK business and jobs,'
said the society's director, Mr Robin Simpson. 'French retailers will be
laughing all the way to the bank. It is also a wide-boys' charter which will
mean an increasing black market in beer.'
Mr Alistair Eadie, of the Wine and Spirits Association, said the
chancellor's move would cause 'further damage to the retail sector and
jobs'. He added: 'We hope the autumn Budget will do more to align UK rates
of excise duties with those of out European partners.'
The tobacco industry also protested about the effects of the 'damaging and
unfair' tax increase on tobacco - adding 10p to a packet of 20 cigarettes
and 4.5p to a packet of five small cigars.
Mr Christopher Bullock, director of the Tobacco Advisory Council, said that
the tax hike would not stop people smoking; it would only encourage more
duty-paid imports and smuggling of cigarettes across the Channel.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: City lukewarm on gilts funding move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LAMONT yesterday announced a move to allow purchases of government bonds
by banks and building societies to count towards the public sector borrowing
requirement. However, the City warned that further significant changes would
be needed to the way the PSBR is funded to relieve pressures in the gilts
market.
The extent of the government's borrowing needs in the coming financial year
became clear as the chancellor announced an expected PSBR of Pounds 50bn.
This topped most City expectations by at least Pounds 5bn and led to a fall
in gilts prices by one percentage point.
The move away from the so-called 'full-funding' rule to one of
'underfunding' had been urged on the chancellor by the City. By reducing the
amount of gilts that need to be sold to other investors, the intention is to
ease pressure on gilts and prevent long-term interest rates from rising.
Banks and building societies have bought Pounds 5.5bn of gilts in the first
11 months of the current financial year, up from less than Pounds 1bn in the
whole of 1991-92. However, most said yesterday that they would be unlikely
to increase their holdings unless the Bank of England designed some of its
gilt sales to suit the particular needs of credit institutions.
A change in policy to issuing more shorter-dated gilts, with maturities of
less than five years, would encourage more buying, a number of them said.
This is because banks prefer to hold short-dated bonds for liquidity
purposes, and because longer-dated gilts are more vulnerable to changes in
inflation and other factors.
Mr Peter Wood, finance director of Barclays Bank, said he anticipated
discussions among banks and the Bank of England to ensure the issue of more
short-term gilts such as one-year notes.
Banks also said that the difference between money market interest rates and
short-dated gilt yields would have to widen to make it more attractive for
them to buy gilts.
Money market rates are now just below 6 per cent, while five-year gilts
yield only around half a percentage point more. This difference would need
to rise to encourage banks to buy more gilts, said Mr Philip Guy, treasurer
of Hill Samuel.
The City reacted with disappointment to the announcement that stamp duty on
share transactions would stay for at least another year. The tax was
scheduled to be abolished with the introduction of Taurus, the Stock
Exchange's planned paperless settlement system which was scrapped last week.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Confusion over changes to BES
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE abolition of Business Expansion Schemes involving loans threw the tax
shelter market into confusion.
Loan-backed schemes were introduced for the first time last September, and
since then have raised Pounds 568m, according to the BES Association.
However, they came in for strong criticism because their structure allowed
hefty profits for top-rate taxpayers without allowing basic rate taxpayers
to make any return at all. As one accountant put it, they allowed top-rate
taxpayers to convert themselves into basic rate payers.
Demand for the schemes was exceptional - Mr Charles Fry, chairman of Johnson
Fry, the largest BES sponsor, claims to have received Pounds 84m for the
schemes since last Friday.
Around Pounds 850m has been raised by all BES companies so far this tax
year, according to the Allenbridge Group, a BES intermediary, compared to
Pounds 407m in 1991-92.
The Building Societies Association said that schemes without loans 'may
still have a contribution to make', although removing loans makes the
schemes less attractive for lenders.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Promises betrayed, says Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We have no plans and no need to raise extra resources from value added tax'
John Major, March 1992
'We do not see any need to increase the tax burden'
John Major, March 1992
'We will maintain martgage tax relief'
Conservative party general election manifesto
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday accused the government of having
'cynically and ruthlessly betrayed' its election pledges not to raise tax or
VAT.
In a vigorous first reaction to the chancellor's speech, he personally
targetted Mr John Major by repeating a number of statements made by the
prime minister in the run-up to last year's election.
To angry shouts of 'cheats' from the Labour benches and silence from the
Tories, Mr Smith quoted Mr Major's insistence that the Conservatives would
not raise or extend the range of value added tax.
'I don't know how the prime minister can sit there as leader of a government
capable of deceit on such a scale,' he said to roars of approval. 'These
people make pledges as if they matter not a whit.'
Mr Smith went on to single out the increase in national insurance
contributions as particularly iniquitous, claiming it was worse than a rise
in income tax 'as it affects the people further down the scale'.
And he went on to point out that the imposition of VAT on domestic energy
bills would hit millions of badly-off people who would not qualify for the
exemptions offered to those on income support.
The extension of the 20p tax band by a further Pounds 500 would have little
impact, Mr Smith claimed, while part of it was already lost by the decision
not to raise tax allowances in line with inflation.
The measures to tackle unemployment were grossly inadequate and would help
just a third of the 300,000 who had lost their jobs since the election, he
said.
Later, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, described the Budget as
amounting to a Pounds 17.5bn tax increase over the next three years and 'the
biggest tax rise in history'.
Mr Brown said that the average family's tax bill would go up by Pounds 8 a
week when fuel costs, national insurance contributions, married couples'
allowances and excise duties were taken into account. He went on to promise
that Labour would campaign against the Budget across the country on the
theme of 'The Betrayal of Britain'.
Mr Smith's attack was echoed by other opposition parties. Mr Malcolm Bruce,
the Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, described the Budget was
one of of 'despair - even a Budget of desperation'.
He criticised the 'totally appalling' phasing-in of the full rate of VAT on
domestic fuel, and said it was also a 'desperately disappointing' Budget for
the unemployed.
Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish National party leader, said it was a 'bankrupt
Budget from a bankrupt chancellor . . . the myth of the low-tax Tories has
finally been destroyed.'
Even on the Tory benches, there was an early display of unease. Mr John
Biffen, MP for Shropshire north, a former Treasury minister, questioned
whether the whether proposed tax increases were adequate to deal with a
public sector borrowing requirement expected to reach Pounds 50bn in
1993-94.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Horse traders clear a hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that leading racehorse owners and premier bloodstock auctions would
leave the UK, jeopardising the industry, have been lifted by VAT changes.
Allowing racehorse owners to claim back the VAT they pay on buying and
running their horses will remove the disadvantage of operating in the UK,
compared with the Repubic of Ireland with its 2.5 per cent rate and France
with 5.5 per cent.
Owners considering moving their strings abroad included the Maktoum family
of Dubai and the American Mr Paul Mellon. They and about 8,000 others will
be able to reclaim VAT on the Pounds 12,000-plus annual expense of running a
racehorse as well as on purchase prices.
Tattersalls, the leading auction house, yesterday indicated it would reverse
the switching of activities to Ireland. Average selling price at its premier
yearling sale is 35,000 to 50,000 guineas.
The industry had estimated that 30,000 jobs were at risk at racing yards and
studs and among vets, blacksmiths and horse transporters.
Mr Gerald Leigh, a Northamptonshire breeder, said he had been selling his
yearlings abroad and would have considered running down his establishment
from 10 staff to three.
Mr Peter Walwyn, a trainer at Lambourn, said he had lost clients to overseas
trainers. Custom had also been reduced by the weight of VAT. 'We will now
keep the clients we have and get more in.'
To enable the changes to go ahead, the Jockey Club will remove barriers to
horse sponsorship and appearance money.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Many changes for small business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR yesterday announced the most wide-ranging package of measures
in recent memory with the aim of helping small businesses lead the UK
economic recovery.
He unveiled an ambitious programme of changes intended to simplify the tax
system, remove the burden of red tape and increase the effectiveness of a
number of small-business programmes.
The overall effect of these measures will be to reduce the burden on small
businesses by Pounds 1bn.
Small-business organisations, accountants and the banks welcomed the
measures in what several described as 'a clever Budget'. The Forum of
Private Business said it had obtained five of the top six measures demanded
by its 20,000 members, while the Federation of Small Businesses, with 58,000
members, described it as 'clever and fair in difficult circumstances'.
The breadth of the measures announced could be assessed from the fact that
some business groups complained that the self-employed and very small
businesses had done particularly well while another lobby group said that
medium-sized companies had reaped the most benefit.
The main measures were:
A simplification of income tax returns intended to allow 8m people, many
self-employed, retired or living on investment income, to make their own
assessment of their tax liability;
An easing of the tough penalty regime which applies to business owners who
make mistakes in filing their VAT returns. The serious misdeclaration
penalty, the most draconian of sanctions, is only to apply to the larger
cases and to persistent offenders;
The cost of the government loan guarantee scheme is to be reduced and its
scope will be broadened. The premium charged to small businesses will be cut
from 2 1/2 per cent to  1/2 per cent for fixed-term loans and cover extended
from 70 to 85 per cent of the loan;
Capital gains tax rollover relief will be made available to entrepreneurs
who sell one business and invest the proceeds in another;
Increases in the Uniform Business Rate will be kept to the rate of inflation
for another year, effectively freezing rates in real terms;
Export credit cover will be extended and insurance premiums will be reduced
to help small companies increase exports.
Small-business organisations greeted the measures with enthusiasm but fear
that increases in petrol duty will push up business costs while the
self-employed will be among those affected by increases in National
Insurance contributions.
They were also concerned that improvements to the loan guarantee scheme did
not constitute an effective replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme,
which is due to expire at the end of this year.

'This Budget means tax increases this year, tax increases next year and tax
increases the year after, a massive betrayal of election promises.'
Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor
'Anything that begins to generate the capability for small and medium-size
businesses to create more employment is very good news.'
Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank
'The total tax on a pint of beer will rise by 1 1/2 p and a bottle of wine
by about 5 1/2 p'
Norman Lamont, before the Treasury admitted that there is no longer any such
thing a  1/2 p
'This is close to the budget the CBI asked for ..but we would have liked an
assurance on the continuation of improved investment allowances, and the
Budget comes with a sting in the tail: future tax increases.'
Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry
'His proposals for 1993-94 are sensible. But his fiscal stance for 1994/95
makes a rather firm assumption that economic recovery will be under way
before it has actually happened.'
Nigel Whittaker, executive director of Kingfisher
'Not a single adjustment was out of harmony. It will give a lot of
confidence to business, especially that the government is starting to tackle
the fiscal gap. But he has left me to go on running my business, and that's
what I wanted to be able to do.'
Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons
'The statement is based on the assumption that economic recovery is well
under way and can be sustained. But in construction the recovery is still
very limited and fragile. It is important, therefore, that the Budget paves
the way for a further cut in interest rates as soon as possible.'
Sir Brian Hill, president of Building Employers Confederation

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Plan to curb borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor announced a package of immediate and future tax increases in
an attempt to avoid 'excessive government borrowing over the medium-term'
from preventing 'a sustained economic recovery'. The package is broadly
neutral this year but will boost government revenues by Pounds 6.7bn in
1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96. Pages 20, 25, 36
VAT extended: Extension of the VAT base limited to domestic fuel and power.
From April 1994 it will be levied at 8 per cent, rising to 17.5 per cent in
April 1995. Pages 20, 22, 38
National insurance to rise: The main rate for employees and the
self-employed will rise by 1 per cent next year, but there will be no change
in employers' contributions. Pages 20, 22, 36, 38
Driving penalised: Road fuels duties will rise by 10 per cent this year to
pay for the abolition of car tax last autumn. This adds 2.7p to a litre of
unleaded and 3.3p to a litre of leaded petrol. Vehicle excise duty will rise
by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125. The discount on high business mileage will be
abolished and, from next year, company cars will be taxed according to their
list price rather than engine size. Pages 26, 38
Income tax: No change in the basic rate and no increase in the top rate of
tax but the 20 per cent tax band will be widened by Pounds 500 to the first
Pounds 2,500 from April 1 this year. It will widen to the first Pounds 3,000
in 1994. Personal allowances, the married couples' allowance and the
inheritance tax threshold of Pounds 150,000 were frozen. Pages 20, 22, 27,
38
PSBR here to stay ..: The PSBR this fiscal year will be Pounds 35.1bn,
Pounds 1.9bn lower than the Autumn Statement forecast. But general
government expenditures of 44 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 mean a PSBR of
Pounds 50.1bn, 8 per cent of GDP, and Pounds 55.6bn excluding privatisation
receipts.
  .but maybe not for ever: The government's objective remains 'to bring the
PSBR back towards balance over the medium term'. But government projections
expect a PSBR of 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 by which time net public
debt will have almost doubled since 1990 to 50 per cent of GDP. Pages 21,
25, 36
Full-funding rule modified: No news on interest rates, but the government
relaxed its funding policy. Sales of gilts to bank and building societies
will now be counted as a non-inflationary funding source. The government has
increased its upper limit for broad money growth next year in part to
accommodate the boost to M4 that relaxing its full-fund rule should allow.
The target for M4 in 1993-94 is widened from the 4-8 per cent range, to a
3-9 per cent range. Pages 21, 25, 36
Excise duties rise: The chancellor left the duty on spirits unchanged; other
alcohol duties rose by 5 per cent. This added 1 1/2 p to a pint of beer and
5 1/2 p to a bottle of wine. A 6.5 per cent increase in tobacco duty added
10p to a packet of 20 cigarettes. Pages 22, 26, 39
Housing: The stamp duty threshold for houses, land and property was doubled
to Pounds 60,000. But tax relief on mortgage interest will be limited to 20
per cent from April next year. Page 38
Small businesses: Business rates will not increase in real terms this year
and the threshold above which traders are required to register for VAT will
rise from Pounds 36,600 to Pounds 37,600. There will be relief on capital
gains tax where entrepreneurs reinvest the gains from the sale of shares in
their own business in new unquoted trading companies.
Premiums on the loan guarantee scheme will be reduced and traders will also
be able to claim VAT relief on bad debts after six months. VAT penalties
imposed for late returns and misdeclarations will be eased. Pages 20, 26
Industry: The rate of advanced corporation tax will be reduced to 22.5 per
cent for this financial year and to 20 per cent from April 1994. The
chancellor also announced improvements to export credits. Pages 20, 22, 25,
37
Long-term unemployed: A new vocational education programme will finance
30,000 unemployed people to take full-time courses. Expansion of business
start-up schemes will provide an extra 10,000 places for people wishing to
start their own businesses. Pages 27, 36
Infrastructure: The channel tunnel rail link will proceed as a joint venture
between the government and the private sector and the Heathrow Express will
go ahead.
Tax burden increasesThe net result of the changes increases tax revenues by
a modest 0.1 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to 36 1/2 per cent of GDP. But the
delayed effects of the changes mean the measures add 1.7 per cent of GDP in
tax rises by 1997-98, by which time revenues will have risen to 39 1/4 per
cent of GDP. Pages 22, 34
'Budget for sustained growth': The chancellor said the economy 'enters the
year in a more favourable position than most of our main competitors' having
'won' the inflation battle. Pages 24, 25, 32, 33

FT  17 MAR 93 / Hussey urged to quit the BBC by Checkland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Michael Checkland, former BBC director-general, last night called for
the resignation of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC's board of
governors, over the John Birt affair. Sir Michael blamed Mr Hussey for the
furore surrounding the freelance status and tax position of Mr Birt, who
became director-general on January 1.
It was revealed this month that Mr Birt had not been on the BBC staff
payroll. His salary was paid into his own company, John Birt Productions,
and he paid a lower tax bill as a result.
Mr Hussey, who is not due to retire until November 1996, is the first BBC
chairman appointed for a second five-year term.
As the battle over Mr Birt's position moved towards a climax, the board of
governors gave him full support last night, after a four-hour meeting at BBC
Television Centre, where Mr Hussey is due to host a farewell dinner for Sir
Michael tonight.
The governors said after their meeting they acknowledged public and staff
concern that Mr Birt had not been on staff, accepted full responsibility for
the errors made, and apologised.
However, their statement seemed less clearly supportive of Mr Hussey than Mr
Birt. Several governors before last night's meeting expressed anger that
they had not been told of Mr Birt's freelance status.
The statement simply referred to the board, 'under the leadership of the
chairman', being committed to further measures to enhance the BBC's openness
and accountability. A statement expected tomorrow could give more details on
the measures.
Sir Michael, in a speech to the Royal Television Society in London last
night , blamed Mr Hussey, and his vice-chairman, Lord Barnett, for not
insisting Mr Birt joined the staff of the BBC when he became
director-general.
Sir Michael said Mr Birt had been advised by senior colleagues to join the
staff payroll when he became director-general. 'He did not, and that was a
gross error of judgment, which the press corrected in 24 hours.'
However, Sir Michael said Mr Birt should not be made to resign. 'If John
Birt were to offer his resignation, the board of governors should refuse to
accept it. A vacuum of executive leadership now would be foolish for the
BBC. The board should however make clear that his (Mr Birt's) position would
be reviewed in 12 months' time by the board, a new chairman and new
vice-chairman.'
The BBC's 41-member general advisory council is due to meet the governors
today. Mr Birt's position is expected to be raised.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Reforms aim to boost
North Sea - Oil Resources
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
REFORM of the North Sea oil taxation regime was announced, with the
objective of encouraging further development of oil and gas resources 'by
allowing companies to keep more of the fruits of their efforts,' the
chancellor said.
The Treasury said the main proposals were:
to reduce the rate of petroleum revenue tax (PRT), which is charged on UK
oil and gas production, from 75 per cent to 50 per cent;
to abolish PRT on oil and gas fields given development consent on or after
Budget day;
to abolish, subject to transitional arrangements, PRT rules that allow
expenditure on new exploration and development to be set against profits of
existing fields;
to make other technical improvements to North Sea taxation.
The rate of PRT on existing fields will be reduced from 75 per cent to 50
per cent for six-month chargeable periods ending after 30 June 1993. PRT is
to be completely abolished for future 'non-taxable' fields. 'Non-taxable'
fields are those given development consent by the Department of Trade and
Industry on or after March 16 1993.
The abolition applies to tariffing income from third-party use of assets and
disposal receipts from asset sales as well as to oil and gas production
income.
Cross-field PRT relief for exploration and appraisal (E&amp;A) - setting the
cost of E&amp;A for a new field against the PRT profits of an existing field -
is to be abolished. This will apply to expenditure incurred on or after
March 16 1993 except where the expenditure was both necessarily incurred
under contracts signed before Budget day and incurred within two years after
Budget day.
Cross-field allowance (CFA) - setting up to 10 per cent of the cost of
developing a new field against the PRT profits of an existing field - is to
be unchanged for 'taxable fields', that is, fields with development consent
before Budget day: and is to be abolished for 'non-taxable' fields outside
PRT
Tariff receipts allowance (TRA) is to be unchanged for tariffs paid by
'taxable' fields. Where a future, 'non-taxable', field pays a tariff, no TRA
will be due in the service-providing field.
Oil allowance is to be unchanged, as is 'ring fence' corporation tax
(subject to Budget measures applying to all companies). Thus, for example,
100 per cent E&amp;A relief is effectively maintained at corporation tax rates.
Measures will be introduced to ensure that future expenditure does not get
relieved early, and thus at a higher PRT rate than justified.
The rules on when expenditure is 'incurred' for PRT purposes, including in
transactions between associates, will be clarified. Expenditure will be
treated as 'incurred' only when the claimant has an unconditional obligation
to pay another party the amount claimed.
Rules will allow stage payments to be claimed, provided they are not
disproportionate to the performance of the contract at that time. The rules
on when expenditure may be allowed in a PRT assessment will also be
clarified. Expenditure incurred after the end of a chargeable period will
not be allowed (other than by carry-back of future losses) in a PRT
assessment in respect of that period.
Where losses are carried back against PRT paid in earlier chargeable
periods, the PRT repayment plus interest is now 'capped' at 85 per cent of
the part of the loss carried back to the earlier period.
With the PRT rate reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, the 'cap' is
similarly to be reduced from 85 per cent to 60 per cent. This will apply to
repayments in respect of chargeable periods ending after June 30 1993, ie
after the rate cut.
Where losses are carried back to periods pre-dating the rate cut, the
present 85 per cent cap will continue to apply to the repayments for those
periods.
Fields (or parts of fields) not within UK jurisdiction come into the PRT
charge only in respect of tariff or disposal receipts.
In line with the treatment of future UK-sector fields, future 'foreign
fields' will be 'non-taxable' fields, ie outside PRT. Fields straddling an
international boundary line will be treated as wholly 'non-taxable' fields
where the UK part is 'non-taxable'.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Plan to widen VAT relief
 -Training
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
THE VAT relief available to training providers participating in
government-funded training programmes is to be widened under Budget
proposals.
From April 1 supplies of all such training, including the provision of work
experience, will be exempt.
The chancellor aims to minimise the effect of VAT on government-funded
training and to introduce greater uniformity in tax treatment.
Training providers affected by the change will need to consider how it
affects their tax status.
Some may make only exempt provision, in which case they will be unable to
reclaim any input tax but they will no longer need to be registered. Other
training may become partially exempt, in which case providers will no longer
be able to reclaim all their input tax.
The changes will be made by way of the Value Added Tax (Education) Order
1993. The estimated revenue effect is an annual loss of around Pounds 25m.
The chancellor proposes to exempt from tax the value of outplacement
services provided to employees.
This will apply to employees made redundant yesterday or after, or to
outplacement services bought from yesterday onward. The proposal is that:
counselling services provided to employees who are, or become redundant,
will be exempt from income tax; employers paying for counselling services
for these employees will get a tax deduction for these payments.
The intention is to improve labour market flexibility. The measure responds
to widespread representations, particularly from employers' representative
bodies and from employees themselves.
The proposal will allow employers to provide outplacement services free of
tax, whether or not the total redundancy package is worth more than Pounds
30,000.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Auctions of gilts to
take place every month - Government Funding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
AUCTIONS OF gilts will take place roughly once a month, instead of once
every two months, the Bank of England said yesterday.
In a statement, the Bank set out the framework within which it intends to
conduct sales of gilt-edged stock in the year ahead, 'in accordance with the
chancellor's announced intention to continue to pursue the full fund policy
but to allow sales of debt to banks and building societies to count as
funding in the same way as sales of debt to other sectors.'
Purchases of gilts by banks and building societies in 1992-93 - estimated at
more than Pounds 5bn to the end of February - will be taken into account in
implementing funding policy over the next two to three years, the Bank said.
'In 1993-94 National Savings' instruments are once again expected to make an
important contribution to funding. This contribution will result in an
equivalent reduction in the gilt funding requirement.
'In its operations in the gilt-edged market, the Bank will continue to use
the diverse range of selling techniques and funding instruments which have
been deployed successfully in the current financial year.'
Thus the Bank will continue the mixed approach to gilt-edged funding
combining a programme of auctions with official sales of stock 'on tap' in
the secondary market.
The Bank intends that gilt-edged auctions should continue to provide the
backbone of funding. For the last two financial years, auctions have been
held at roughly bi-monthly intervals.
In 1993-94, it is proposed to increase their frequency and to pursue a
pattern of auctions at broadly monthly intervals, though as hitherto
flexibility will be retained to vary the timing of auctions where
appropriate in the light of events.
'The size of individual auctions is likely to be in the range of Pounds
2bn-Pounds 4bn. The programme of auctions overall is expected to account for
a higher proportion of the total gilt funding requirement than in the
present year.
'The auctions will be conducted on the same basis as those for the last two
years: the stock will be auctioned on a bid-price basis, open to all comers
without commission, with provision for non-competitive bids of up to Pounds
500,000.
The stocks offered, which will extend over the full maturity range, may be
new stocks or additional tranches of existing stocks and may be in either
fully or partly-paid form.
'However, the Bank proposes to make two minor changes to the timetable for
auctions. First, market participants have suggested that the announcement
timetable for auctions can be shortened.
Accordingly the Bank proposes that the notice period for the date of each
auction should be reduced to not less than 10days (from the present fourteen
days), with full details continuing to be given not less than seven days
ahead of the auction.
'Second, market participants have questioned the need for a 'fallow period'
after an auction as long as 28 days, during which the Bank at present
undertakes not to sell in its 'tap' operations stock of a similar maturity
or type to that offered at the auction.
Accordingly, the Bank proposes to cease to specify a precise length of
'fallow period', but will nevertheless continue to refrain from issuing
stock of a similar type or maturity to the auction stock for a reasonable
period after the auction, and will only do so if there is evident market
demand for further such stock.
The Bank intends to discuss both these changes shortly with the gilt-edged
market makers.
The programme of auctions will continue to be supplemented by sales of stock
by the Bank 'on tap' on the secondary market through its day-to-day
operations with the gilt-edged market makers.
Tap sales may take the form of sales of existing stock from official
holdings or of packages of tranchettes (or a single, larger tranche) of
newly-created stock.
'The Bank also has available the option of offering stock by minimum price
tender, underwritten by the authorities at a minimum tender price, though
use of this technique is likely to be infrequent given the continuing
programme of auctions.'
Among measures to boost the National Savings contribution are reintroduction
of the First Option Bond and higher holding limits for most of the other
National Savings products, the Department of National Savings said.
Applications for purchase of First Option Bonds will be accepted from Monday
22 March. Prospectuses and application forms will be available at post
offices from 29 March.
The guaranteed rate for the first 12 months the bonds are held will be 6.34%
gross, equivalent to 4.75% net. A bond to the value of Pounds 20,000 or more
will earn a guaranteed bonus of 0.4% gross (0.3% net) over the first 12
months. The holding limit remains unchanged at Pounds 250,000.
Holding limits are to increase - for savings certificates: 40th Issue - from
Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 10,000; 6th index-linked issue - from Pounds 5,000 to
Pounds 10,000. Reinvestment Certificates of each Issue - from Pounds 10,000
to Pounds 20,000; Income Bonds: from Pounds 50,000 (Pounds 100,000 for joint
holdings) to Pounds 250,000 (sole or joint holdings). Capital bonds: from
Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000 aggregate for all series after series A All
with effect from March 18.
For premium bonds, the rise is from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 20,000. with
effect from 13 April, and for the Investment Account from Pounds 25,000 to
Pounds 100,000 from 10 May.

THE CHANCELLOR proposes to make some changes to Personal Equity Plans
(PEPs).
The main points are that, from 6 April 1993: Investors who wish to make
regular subscriptions to a PEP for a number of years will need to complete
only one initial application form; A number of minor (mostly administrative)
changes will be made to the PEP rules in response to representations, in
particular those arising from the Inland Revenue's consultation document
last year; 'Non-qualifying' unit and investment trusts will have to hold at
least 50 per cent of their investments in ordinary shares to qualify for PEP
subscription up to Pounds 1,500.
The chancellor's intentions are to simplify administrative procedures for
PEP managers and investors; to make minor improvements in the legislation;
to improve the quality of statistical information; and to maintain the
emphasis on investment in shares.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): 'Capital loss buying'
curb
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET includes proposals to restrict the set off of capital losses
brought into a group of companies as the result of a company joining the
group. Losses set off against gains arising on or after yesterday will be
restricted where they came from a company which joined the group after 31
March 1987.
The chancellor's intention is to curtail 'capital loss buying' - a practice
used by groups to reduce tax liability on capital gains. It involves buying
in losses from other companies which have nothing to do with the purchasing
group's own efforts or activities, and getting the benefit of tax relief on
the losses even though the group has not suffered the loss.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Share option tax change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET contains a change intended to remove a possible disincentive to
companies wishing to set up approved share option schemes.
The change is to the tax treatment of capital gains which may arise on the
grant of share options by companies to their employees under approved share
option schemes.
The proposal is that the amount of the capital gain on which the company is
chargeable to tax in these circumstances should be the amount, if any,
actually paid for the option by the employee.
The proposed change applies to share options granted under approved share
option schemes on or after yesterday.

be 12%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DUTY ON tickets for the National Lottery will be 12 per cent, the chancellor
said. Other lotteries, such as those run on behalf of charities and local
authorities, will be exempt.
He said the announcement on the lottery, due to start next year, was being
made 'to allow businesses to make informed competitive tenders' for the
contract to operate the system for the government.
At the same time, the chancellor proposed an increase of 20 per cent in most
rates of gaming machine licence duty from May 1, though duty on small-prize
machines - costing up to 5p per play - will not rise and is to be abolished
from November 1.
Customs and Excise yesterday laid an Order before Parliament to increase the
exemption limit for non-dutiable bingo played at fairgrounds and other
commercial entertainments from Pounds 20 to Pounds 25.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Courses offered to
30,000 jobless - Full-time education
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
OPPORTUNITIES for 30,000 unemployed people to pursue relevant full-time
courses of education for up to a year, with fees paid and an allowance
equivalent to their benefit entitlement, were announced.
The scheme, Learning for Work, will be administered by Training and
Enterprise Councils (Tecs) and Local Enterprise Councils which will contract
with further education colleges or other course providers.
Community Action will provide 60,000 opportunities for people to do
voluntary work on a part-time basis at the same time as looking for work.
They will receive an allowance equivalent to their benefit plus Pounds 10.
The programme will be delivered by the Employment Service, contracting with
the voluntary sector and other providers. Projects might include caring or
environmental activity. The scheme will start in the summer.
A total of 10,000 more places will be funded on the Business Start Up
scheme. The Department of Employment said this should mean at least 50,000
unemployed people can start their own businesses with the support of
training and counselling, and a weekly allowance for up to 15 months.
Tecs will bid competitively for money from a Pounds 25m fund to develop new
ways to help unemployed people into work and create jobs. Projects will be
chosen on the basis of the degree of innovation, the effect on unemployment,
the degree of involvement of the private sector and the ability to deliver
practical projects quickly.
There will be four pilots in different parts of the country to test how
effective it is to encourage the recruitment of long-term unemployed people
by paying a temporary subsidy to employers.
Different approaches will be tried out in the different pilot areas.
Employers who take on people who have been unemployed either for more than
two years or more than four years, depending on the pilot areas, will be
paid a subsidy related to average benefits. The pilots, two run by Tecs and
two by the Employment Service, will start in the summer.
The new package will cost about Pounds 230m - about Pounds 125m once the
estimated saving in benefits has been taken into account.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Attempt to tackle
deficit in fund - National Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
CHANGES in National Insurance contribution rates were announced in an
attempt to tackel the deficit in the National Insurance Fund. The changes
are aimed at raising Pounds 1.8bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 2.2bn in 1995-96.
From April 6, 1994, Class 1 contribution rates for employees are to rise by
1 percentage point to 10 per cent, and Class 4 rate for the self-employed -
paid on profits between the Lower Profits Limit and the Upper Profits Limit
(LPL) - is to rise by the same amount to 7.3 per cent.
The position of employees earning below the Lower Earnings Limit and the
self-employed with profits below the Lower Profits Limit will be unchanged.
The initial 2 per cent Class 1 payment and the rates of employers'
contribution would be unaffected.
The government expects there still to be a need for a Treasury grant over
the next few years because the revenue raised is unlikely to be sufficient
to eliminate the National Insurance Fund's in-year deficit.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Standard set for excise
payments - Oil Duty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
EXCISE DUTY on oil is to be assessed in future on the volume of the oil at a
standard 15 degrees Celsius, Customs and Excise said yesterday.
Customs described the change as technical, required to implement the
provisions of an EC directive on the duty structure for mineral oils.
It said: 'The density of oil products varies with temperature and the actual
quantity of oil delivered will vary slightly as the temperature rises and
falls.
The proposal will require deliveries of oil products to be adjusted to the
volume which would have been delivered at a temperature of 15 degrees
Celsius and the excise duty calculated on that volume.
'As our climate does not suffer from wide extremes of temperature and the
adjustments are in any case very small, this proposal will have only a minor
impact. Domestic consumers will notice no change.
'This system is already widely used by oil companies for internal
accounting, and is the agreed method of duty accounting in the EC.
'At present excise duty is accounted for on the basis of the volume at the
delivered temperature. Conversion to a standard temperature ensures that any
difference is cor-rected and that a consistent quantity of product is
accounted for.'
The Finance Bill will make provision for the conversion methods to be used,
and for retaining bulk volume measurement in circumstances where temperature
adjustment is not possible (eg importation of oil in drums).
A joint Customs/Industry Working Group has been formed to produce guidelines
on the introduction and operation of standard temperature accounting.
Subject to the recommendations of this group, the change is expected to take
effect on 15 October 1993. This coincides with the start of a duty
accounting period.
The proposal is expected to be revenue neutral.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Definition of beer and
some wines to widen - Excise duties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
AN EXTENSION of the definitions of beer and sparkling wine is among measures
proposed to comply with European single market rules on excise duties.
The definition of beer will be extended to cover all beer exceeding 0.5 per
cent alcohol by volume (ABV) and any product containing a mixture of beer
with non-alcoholic drinks, Customs and Excise said.
However, for beer between 0.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent ABV no duty will be
payable. All movements of beer within the EC, whatever strength, will be
governed by the same control arrangements.
The definition of sparkling wine will be extended to include wine in any
bottle having a mushroom stopper held in place by ties or fastenings,
regardless of the pressure. Previously, wine in mushroom stopper bottles was
not dutied as sparkling wine if the pressure was below 1.5 bars. No known
current products are affected.
The limit up to which wine and made-wine may be strengthened by adding
additional alcohol will be set at 22 per cent ABV. This proposal aligns the
fortification levels for wine and made-wine. Previously it had been
permissible for wine to be strengthened up to 23 per cent ABV but no known
current products are affected.
The blending or mixing of alcoholic products to produce a dutiable alcoholic
product for sale is being restricted to taking place within premises
approved as tax warehouses, unless Customs directs otherwise. The effect is
to ensure that the correct rate of duty is paid on the finished product.
This measure does not extend to drinks mixed at the point of sale, such as
cocktails in pubs or cocktail bars.
Wine and made-wine with a strength of more than 22 per cent ABV will be
dutied at the same rate per degree of alcohol as spirits.
The definition of methylated spirits, which are exempt from excise duty,
will be extended to include spirits denatured to other member states'
requirements, provided they have EC approval.
With the exception of the change to duty payable on alcoholic drinks with a
strength over 22 per cent (which takes effect from Budget day) all other
provisions take effect from royal assent.
The beer end-product duty rate will be Pounds 10.45 per hectolitre per one
per cent of alcohol by volume when the new system is brought into effect on
June 1 1993.
The chancellor also proposed to repeal the provisions allowing drawback
(refund of duty) on beer deposited in an excise warehouse. The repeal will
come into effect on September 1 1993. With the introduction of beer
end-product duty, these provisions are no longer necessary as it will be
possible for beer to move to an excise warehouse without payment of excise
duty.
It is intended to repeal the existing drawback (refund of duty) arrangements
for beer going to the Isle of Man. The provisions will be brought into
effect when agreement is reached between the UK and Isle of Man governments
on making beer duty a shared revenue.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Plan to cut cost of 'pay
and file' - Self-assessment for corporation tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
THE CHANCELLOR unveiled proposals for reducing the cost to companies of
taking part in the government's new 'Pay and File' system of self-assessment
for corporation tax - which comes into force in October.
The Inland Revenue said the most important change was to allow companies to
authorise people other than their company secretaries to sign documents for
tax purposes.
Other changes relate to the transitional periods which straddle the
changeover date from the old system; the circumstances in which claims to
relief may be made by members of groups; and the payment of interest or
repayment supplement where losses or advance corporation tax are carried
back to earlier years.
The penalty for failing to give notice of chargeability under Pay and File
is based on the amount of corporation tax unpaid after giving credit for
income tax deducted at source. The credit is to be limited to the income tax
which can be set off against the corporation tax liability and will exclude
other income tax payable.
Additional claims to reliefs may be submitted in certain circumstances where
assessments are made outside the normal time limits for such claims. This is
to be extended to include assessments which are made to recover excess group
relief under Pay and File.
The rules for making returns which apply to periods of account before Pay
and File is introduced are to be adjusted so that they do not inadvertently
prevent the Revenue from raising an assessment or collecting tax until after
the normal due date for the accounting period.
The rules for carrying back losses which do more than simply discharge part
of a Corporation Tax liability but result in a reworking of charges or
set-offs in the computation are to be adjusted to ensure that interest is
charged on the original liability up to the due date for the later period in
which the set-off or loss arose.
The rules for charging an automatic penalty if a company fails to deliver a
return within 18 months of the end of the return period are to be adjusted
to ensure that a penalty will not arise unless there has been a failure to
submit a return, but that a tax-geared penalty will always be due when there
has been a failure.'
The Revenue said a number of representative bodies had expressed concern
about the signature of returns and other documents required from companies
under the Taxes Acts. It proposes 'to allow companies to act through any
authorised person, except where the company is in liquidation in which case
the company will, as now, be able to act only through the liquidator.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Triangular transactions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Simplification procedures will apply to some commercial transactions which
involve traders from other member states of the European Community from
August 1.
These changes are for 'triangular' transactions when commercial goods are
supplied in a chain involving three traders located in different member
states, but where physical delivery of the goods involves their movement
direct from the first member state to the third; and goods installed or
assembled in the UK by traders from other EC countries.
The intention is to give legal effect to an EC-wide scheme aimed at reducing
the need for intermediate suppliers to register for Vat in the country where
the goods are delivered.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Regulatory burden on
small businesses eased - VAT and capital gains tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
REFORMS TO the capital gains tax and value added tax regimes aimed at
helping small businesses were a central feature of the Budget.
The chancellor also announced changes to the Loan Guarantee Scheme, rules
governing tax relief on bad debts and on late payments.
Measures were announced to relax the regulatory burden of VAT, particularly
on small businesses, raising the thres-holds for VAT registration and for
the VAT cash accounting scheme and easing the VAT penalty regime, as well as
reforming the corporation tax pay-and-file scheme. The government is also
looking at a closer alignment of the base for National Insurance
contributions and income tax.
The Department of Trade and Industry is to publish a consultation paper on
easing the burden of statutory audit requirements as they affect very small
companies. Businesses will fill in 10m fewer forms this year because of
Customs and Excise single-market changes. Next year, following the move to a
November Budget, most employers will have to change tax codings once a year
instead of twice.
Proposals included reducing premiums charged on the Loan Guarantee Scheme to
 1/2 per cent on the whole loan for guarantees on fixed-rate lending and to
1 1/2 per cent on the whole loan for guarantees on variable-rate lending -
compared with a current premium of 2 1/2 per cent for both types of loans,
although that is charged on the guaranteed portion of the loan and is
equivalent to 1 3/4 per cent on the whole loan.
The Treasury said: 'The bigger reduction for guarantees on fixed-rate
borrowing should make it easier for eligible small businesses to secure
fixed-rate loans on reasonable terms. These reductions should take effect in
the next month or so.
'The president of the board of trade will also be taking forward with the
banks further changes to the scheme to make it more attractive for
established businesses, in particular by increasing the maximum size of
eligible loan to such businesses from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000, and
increasing the proportion guaranteed from 70 per cent to 85 per cent.
'The general loan guarantee scheme currently provides a 70 per cent
guarantee on qualifying loans up to a maximum of Pounds 100,000 over periods
from two to seven years in return for an annual premium of 2 1/2 per cent of
the guaranteed portion of the outstanding loan. In Inner City Task Force
areas the scheme provides an 85 per cent guarantee and the annual premium is
2 per cent on the guaranteed portion.
'The premium for guarantees on inner-city loans will also be reduced to  1/2
per cent on the whole loan.
'This further reduction will follow changes announced by the president of
the board of trade on December 14 1992 that premiums (charged on the
guaranteed portion of the loan) for all guarantees issued under the
inner-city variant would be reduced to 1 per cent (equivalent to 0.85 per
cent on the whole loan) from April 1 1993 along with other changes to scheme
rules aimed primarily at making the scheme more cost-effective and more
attractive to inner-city small firms.
'Two capital gains tax changes in the Budget both respond to widespread
representations from small businesses:
'No CGT charge will arise when entrepreneurs sell shares in their own
company and reinvest in other unquoted trading companies;
'The second relaxes the rules on CGT retirement relief, allowing both
employees and directors with as little as a 5 per cent shareholding to
benefit.
'There will be additional help for traders suffering the consequences of bad
debt and late payments.
'The period after which VAT relief can be obtained on bad debts is reduced
from 12 months to six, giving businesses a cashflow benefit of Pounds 150m
in 1993-94.
'The eligibility threshold for the VAT cash accounting scheme is raised from
Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 350,000, and entry to the scheme is made easier.
'A Customs and Excise consultation document about the cash accounting scheme
has also been published on Budget day.
'Government departments will now be required to publish details of their
payment performance in their Departmental Reports.
'Two other changes to VAT administration will be welcome to small
businesses:
'The VAT penalty regime will be reformed. The level of an error in VAT
accounting at which a misdeclaration penalty is charged is raised
considerably, and Customs and the VAT tribunals are given wide powers of
mitigation.
'The threshold above which businesses are required to register for VAT is
raised in line with inflation, from Pounds 36,600 to Pounds 37,600.'
The chancellor announced a range of other measures aimed at supporting
business.
The Treasury said: 'There will be no real increases in business rates this
year. This measure, which will save businesses Pounds 370m in 1993-94,
renews the transitional relief provided last year and will help many small
businesses. '10,000 more places will be funded on the Business Start Up
scheme in 1993-94, giving a direct boost to small-business creation and a
stimulus to self-employment in years to come.
'Measures will be taken to alleviate the problem of surplus ACT,
particularly for international companies, which should help keep business
cost centres, such as research and development facilities, in the UK, and
make the UK a more attractive place for international companies to set up
their headquarters.
'This will have consequential benefits for many small suppliers and service
businesses. More export credit cover will be made available, and premiums
will again be reduced. Many small businesses depend either directly or as
sub-contractors on the UK's flourishing export sector, and will benefit from
these changes.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Revenue-neutral tax
measures - Lloyd's Underwriters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
THE chancellor proposed in his Budget to introduce a package of measures to
reform the tax arrangements applying to Lloyd's underwriters. Overall the
reform is revenue-neutral. The main features are:
A new tax deductible reserve, replacing the present limited special reserve
fund, to enable underwriters to put aside profits free of tax to meet future
losses.
Removing the special treatment of gains on assets representing invested
premiums and incorporating them in trading profits.
A more coherent and comprehensive set of rules for taxing receipts and
giving relief for various expenses.
The chancellor's intention is to help underwriters build up reserves to meet
future losses and to simplify and rationalise the present system of taxing
underwriters.
The chancellor proposed in his Budget to introduce a power to make
regulations about the timing of repayments to friendly societies which have
some tax-exempt business.
The chancellor's intention is that the present concessional arrangements
under which these societies receive repayments of tax should be replaced by
a statutory scheme coming into effect on January 1 1994.
It is proposed that the new repayment arrangements will be based on the
existing rules for repaying income tax to both friendly societies and life
assurance companies in respect of their pension business. The new provision
will allow regulations to be made to adapt the pension business rules to the
circumstances of friendly societies with some tax-exempt business.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Reforms extend principle
of mitigation - VAT Penalties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REFORMS TO all the principal VAT penalties were proposed in the Budget,
which the Treasury said were 'intended to achieve the correct balance
between the rights of the individual trader and of the vast majority of
businesses which pay their tax accurately and on time'.
The changes envisaged are:
Reforms to the penalty for misdeclarations made on VAT returns, intended to
reduce the number of penalties issued by 40 per cent.
The introduction of mitigation for penalties assessed after Royal assent
will give Customs additional flexibility to deal with hard cases.
The removal of restrictions on mitigation of penalties for civil fraud,
allowing Customs or the VAT tribunals to reduce the penalty as they see fit.
The extension of mitigation to certain other civil penalties - including the
penalty for late registration - for assessments made after Royal assent.
Reforms to the default surcharge for making late returns or paying VAT late.
The measures include an immediate reduction in the top rate of surcharge
(from 20 to 15 per cent) and a new minimum surcharge of Pounds 200.
Surcharges for less than Pounds 200 will not be issued except for persistent
defaulters. This will take effect later this year and could take up to
125,000 small traders out of surcharge altogether.
Capping interest charged on misdeclarations so that assessments of interest
will not date back more than three years. The measure will come into force
as soon as computer changes can be made later this year.
The Treasury said a review of repayment supplement (the penalty on Customs
for the late processing of repayments) was in progress and may lead to
changes later in the year. The same principles will be observed as in the
review of penalties on traders. The government intends to retain the
repayment supplement as a deterrent measure, and not as commercial
restitution.
The commissioners are to have to mitigate misdeclaration penalties and their
decision will be appealable to a VAT tribunal. Some factors will be excluded
by the Finance Bill in determining the degree of mitigation. These will be
whether the trader has acted in good faith, inability to pay, and whether or
not there has been a net loss to the Exchequer.
The Treasury also announced:
A change in the base against which misdeclarations are tested for
seriousness. The net tax base, which is the net amount of tax which is
payable or repayable, will be replaced by a gross tax base, equal to the sum
of input tax and output tax reflecting the trader's tax throughput.
A new test to target repeated misdeclarations, replacing the old persistent
misdeclaration penalty (PMP).
The changes will be introduced by Treasury order after a decent interval
following Royal assent. Until then, Customs will not normally assess
penalties under the current provisions.
The chancellor also announced removal of mitigations on penalties on tax
evaded, which can currently be given on the grounds of a trader's
co-operation in determining the true liability to tax.
In future, said the Treasury, 'the commissioners of Customs and Excise, or,
on appeal, a tribunal, will have power to vary the penalty to such amount as
they see fit. The only limitations in determining the amount of reduction
are that no regard will be given to the trader's inability to pay or to the
fact that there may have been no loss of tax to the Exchequer. This easement
will make mitigation more flexible and bring Customs more into line with
Inland Revenue procedures.'
The maximum rate of default surcharge - imposed on businesses which have
been late in rendering returns or making full payment of tax on three
occasions within a set period - is reduced to 20 per cent. Other reforms
include:
Lowering the maximum rate of surcharge further, from 20 per cent to 15 per
cent.
Notifying first defaults to the trader rather than notifying only on the
second default as now. This will bring forward liability to surcharge to the
second default rather than the third as at present, but there will be a new
lower starting rate of surcharge at 2 per cent.
Not issuing surcharge assessments for less than Pounds 200, except when they
are calculated at either of the two top rates of surcharge.
Linking surcharge liability and the rate of surcharge only to late payments
of tax and not to late VAT returns.
There is no liability to default surcharge if traders can satisfy Customs or
a VAT tribunal that there is a 'reasonable excuse' for late payment.
Interest is charged on all misdeclarations of tax under Section 18 of the
Finance Act 1985. The capping at three years will mean that interest is not
assessed to a date more than three years prior to the assessment of the tax
misdeclared. Interest will continue to accrue, however, if the tax
assessment remains unpaid. The cost of the changes is Pounds 50m in 1993-94
and Pounds 75m in a full year.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Valuation allowance for
share disposals - Rollover relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
IT IS proposed to add new EC agricultural quotas for the premium given to
producers of ewes and suckler cows to the list of assets which qualify for
capital gains tax rollover relief. In addition the chancellor proposes a
general power to add, by Treasury order, to the list of assets which qualify
for rollover relief.
The proposals recognise the fact that, since such quotas can be capital
assets of farming trades, rollover relief should be available for them.
The changes will apply to acquisitions and disposals on or after January 1
1993.
On the valuation of shares the Inland Revenue has issued an extra-statutory
concession relating to the calculation of March 31 1982 values of shares and
securities for capital gains tax rebasing and indexation purposes.
The concession will allow individuals and companies disposing of shares
acquired from their spouse or a company in the same group owning the shares
at March 31 1982 the choice of adopting a more favourable basis of valuation
at that date.
The concession applies to a disposal of shares which an individual has
acquired on a no gain/no loss transfer from a husband or wife who held the
shares on March 31 1982 or which a company has acquired on a no gain/no loss
transfer from a company in the same group which held the shares on March 31
1982.
For indexation and rebasing purposes the individual or company is treated as
having held the transferred shares on March 31 1982. They are added to any
shares the taxpayer actually held on March 31 1982 and all the shares are
valued as a single holding.
This may have the effect of lowering the March 31 1982 market value of the
shares in the hands of the transferee.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Disincentive removed
over foreigners - Relocation Packages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
PROPOSALS TO change the tax treatment of relocation packages offered to
employees who make job-related house moves will remove a disincentive for
companies to bring foreign nationals to work in the UK and reduce the cost
of what had become a very expensive relief, the Treasury said yesterday.
It said there would be two changes.
Tax relief for removal expenses and benefits will be put on to a statutory
basis and limited to Pounds 8,000 per move. Relief will be available whether
or not an employee sells his or her old home.
Tax relief for additional housing cost payments will be withdrawn.
The changes will apply to employees who start a new job or move with their
existing employer on or after April 6 1993, but there will be transitional
arrangements for employees who are already committed to moving.
The existing extra-statutory reliefs will be available for employees who
start new jobs before April 6 1993.
Under the terms of extra-statutory concession A5 an employee is not taxed on
certain removal expenses which an employer pays or re-imburses or on certain
benefits which an employer provides if the employee has to change residence
either as a result of a job transfer with the existing employer or to take
up a new employment.
Relief is available only where it would be unreasonable to expect the
employee to work at the new location without moving nearer to it and
provided the employee disposes of any interest in his or her home at the old
location.
The Inland Revenue interprets 'change of residence' as meaning that the
employee must sell his or her old home.
The chancellor proposed that these conditions should be broadly matched in
the statutory relief.
But there will be some important changes.
There will be a ceiling of Pounds 8,000 on the relief available to set
against the costs of each move.
Employees will no longer be required to sell their old home to qualify for
relief.
Payments by employers to compensate employees for losses on sale of their
old homes will not qualify for relief.
The categories of help given by employers to employees who move house which
will be covered by the proposed statutory relief include:
Selling the old home - for example, legal fees and estate agent services.
Buying or renting the new home - for example, legal fees and stamp duty.
Removal of furniture and effects; assistance with travel and subsistence
costs incurred in connection with the move, for example, journeys undertaken
to find a home at the new location and the provision of temporary
accommodation at the new location before a permanent move. Provision of
replacement goods, services and facilities  - for example, the replacement
of carpets and curtains which are not suitable for removal to the new home.
Bridging loans; and services of relocation management (or similar)
companies.
The new rules will apply to moves relating to jobs started on or after 6
April 1993.
Under transitional arrangements, payments made and benefits provided on or
after April 6 will continue to qualify for extra-statutory tax relief
provided the employee has entered into a firm commitment to move before
April 6 and starts the job at the new location before August 1.
To determine whether an employee satisfies the first condition, the Inland
Revenue will need evidence either that the employer has given formal
notification of the job transfer or that the employee is committed to
accepting the job transfer.
Extra-statutory concession A67 exempts from tax certain payments to
employees by employers towards the additional housing costs - increased
mortgage interest or rent - incurred as a result of moving with their jobs
to more expensive housing areas.
Tax relief is available only when payments are made for a limited period,
reduce year by year and do not in total exceed a prescribed maximum.
The maximum has varied from time to time in line with changes to the amount
payable to civil servants under their additional housing costs allowance.
The present maximum, which has applied since February 1, is Pounds 13,440.
At the chancellor's request, the Board of Inland Revenue will withdraw this
extra-statutory concession with effect from April 6.
Under transitional arrangements tax relief will continue for any employees
who have entered into a firm commitment to move with their jobs to a more
expensive housing area before April 6 and who then start their job at the
new location before August 1.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Five linked changes
planned to credits - Dividend Tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
FIVE LINKED changes were proposed on tax applying to dividends; to reduce
the value of the tax credit on dividends paid by UK companies from 25 per
cent to 20 per cent for dividends paid after 5 April 1993; to reduce
correspondingly the present income tax charge on dividends from the basic
rate of 25 per cent to the lower rate of 20 per cent; to reduce
correspondingly the rate at which a UK company has to account for advance
corporation tax (ACT) when it pays a dividend from 25 per cent to 20 per
cent, but with a transitional rate for 1993-94 only of 22.5 per cent; to
reduce the rate of corporation tax paid by authorised unit trusts in line
with these changes; to introduce transitional payments to charities with
dividend income from UK companies.
The chancellor's intention is: to provide an overall cash flow benefit of
nearly Pounds 2bn in 1993-94 and 1994-95 to all UK companies paying
dividends; to reduce the amount of new surplus ACT arising in 1993-94 and
subsequent years by some Pounds 300 million a year; to raise revenue of
about Pounds 1bn a year from 1995-96 onwards. Tax credits accompany
dividends paid by UK companies can be set against a UK resident
shareholder's liability to tax on the dividend. A shareholder who is exempt
from tax on dividends (such as a pension fund or a charity), who is not
liable to income tax because any income is covered by allowances, or whose
income falls within the lower rate band of income tax, can claim payment of
all or part of the credit.
The value of the tax credit is currently 25 per cent of the dividend plus
the tax credit. This exactly matches liability at the basic rate of income
tax of 25 per cent on the sum of the dividend and the tax credit.
From 1993-94, the value of the tax credit falls to 20 per cent of the
dividend plus the tax credit. The credit on a dividend of Pounds 75, for
example, thus becomes Pounds 18.75 (20 per cent of Pounds 75 plus Pounds
18.75). This will exactly match the new income tax charge at the lower rate
on the sum of the dividend and the tax credit.
Shareholders who are exempt from tax on dividends, or not liable to tax,
will be paid the tax credit on dividends paid after 5 April 1993 at the
lower rate of 20 per cent. This will also apply to tax credits paid to
holders of Personal Equity Plans.
Individual shareholders whose income falls within the lower rate band of
income tax charged at 20 per cent can, at present, claim payment of that
part of the credit which exceeds their liability. After 5 April 1993, they
will not be entitled to any tax credit payment as the tax credit will no
loner exceed the liability.
For shareholders who are currently liable at the basic rate of income tax of
25 per cent, the present tax credit matches the liability on dividends and
there is no further tax to pay.
After 5 April 1993, the tax credit will continue to match the liability
exactly, but at 20 per cent.
Individual shareholders who are liable at the higher rate of income tax of
40 per cent currently pay extra tax on dividends at the difference between
the higher rate and the value of the credit.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Lower-rate band widened
by Pounds 500 but allowances frozen - Tax allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
THE Chancellor proposed to: increase the width of the lower rate band by
Pounds 500 to Pounds 2,500 from 1993-94, and by a further Pounds 500 to
Pounds 3,000 from 1994-95; keep at their current level the rates of tax, the
allowances, and the basic rate limit above which higher rate tax is paid.
The increase in the lower rate band will benefit all taxpayers with an
income more than the new lower rate limit (a minimum of Pounds 5,945 for
someone under 65) by 48p per week. The tax reductions, including any tax
overpaid from April 6, will generally be in pay packets on the first pay day
after May 17.
A total of 4.9m people - an increase of 1m over 1992-93 - will pay tax at
the lower rate only in 1993-94.
The intention is to continue towards establishing 20 per cent as the basic
rate of tax.
The statutory indexation provisions will be overridden. These adjust the
main allowances and tax thresholds in line with the percentage increase in
the retail prices index unless parliament decides otherwise.
The yield in 1993-94 from holding all allowances and thresholds unchanged
would have been Pounds 730m (compared with statutory indexation). Against
that, the widening of the lower rate band will cost about Pounds 370m. So
the net yield of these income tax proposals will be about Pounds 360m.
New tax tables including the wider lower rate band will be sent shortly to
employers. The design of the tables has been improved. They will be applied
on the first pay day after May 17 when employees will begin to get the
benefit of the widening of the band.
Because no change is being made in the allowances, most current code numbers
will continue to apply in 1993-94.
Some employees will however already have received a different code number
for 1993-94 because of a change in their circumstances. People whose codes
include adjustments for car benefits will also get new codes to take account
of the Budget changes to these.
This is the last year in which Budget changes to PAYE codes will be made
after the tax year has already started. The move to a unified Budget in
November will mean that in future most people will get their final new codes
before the start of the year.
Self-assessment and simplification of personal tax
A major reform of the system for assessing personal tax will be introduced.
The reform is designed to make the process of making tax returns and
payments simpler and fairer. The new system will apply from the 1996-97 tax
year.
Legislation in the 1994 Finance Bill will: abolish the complex 'preceding
year' basis of income tax for the self-employed; give all those who complete
tax returns the option of self-assessment that is working out their own tax
bill; give them one tax statement, with one tax bill, for all their income.
These proposals pave the way for the most fundamental reform of personal tax
administration in almost 50 years.
The proposals are expected to affect about 8m people. They are the 4m people
whose main source of income is from self-employment or investments, and some
4m employees and pensioners who receive tax returns.
The Inland Revenue has published two consultative documents on proposals to
simplify the system for assessing personal tax. In response there has been
wide acceptance that the existing system should be reformed, and that the
proposals are generally the right way forward. The chancellor has therefore
decided that the changes should proceed.
The proposals are designed to make things simpler for most of the
self-employed, and make personal tax easier to understand. And
self-assessment will allow taxpayers more control over their tax affairs, if
they take up the option of working out their own tax bill.
The changes are fully consistent with, and will help, the Inland Revenue's
programme of change leading to improved service for the taxpayer.
The new rules will apply to everyone who receives a tax return, and will
first apply to the tax year 1996-97. The proposals will not affect the large
majority of employees for whom the PAYE and deduction at source arrangements
already collect the right amount of tax, and who are not sent returns to
complete each year. Nor will they affect people who claim repayment of tax
on bank and building society interest and dividends, using the new
simplified claim forms. The returns for 1996-97 will be issued in April
1997, and the first completed self-assessment returns will be due at the
beginning of 1998. Taxpayers who ask the Inland Revenue to work out their
tax bill will have to complete their return by October 1997.
The main proposals will be spelt out in more detail, following further
consultation, this autumn. But, briefly, they are to: tax all income on a
common current year basis, with trading profits being taxed in the year of
assessment which includes the accounts year-end; bring together all of a
taxpayer's income on one tax statement, with one tax bill; allow taxpayers
to choose whether to assess themselves and work out how much tax is due on
their total income for the year or to ask the Inland Revenue to make the
assessment on the taxpayer's own figures.
Despite the administrative benefits of fiscal accounting (that is to say,
requiring taxpayers to align their accounts with the fiscal year), the
Chancellor believes that it would be wrong to compel people to draw up their
accounts to any given date.
At present people with more than one source of income can be taxed on a
variety of preceding year and current year bases, with different tax payment
dates. And for the self-employed there are special rules for assessing the
profits of the first three and last three years of the business. The
Chancellor's proposals are designed to sweep away these complications.
The rules for the transition to the new system of taxing the self-employed
will be framed to maintain the flow of tax to the Exchequer, while ensuring
that businesses are not taxed twice. They will therefore be assessed to tax
for the transitional year 1996-97 on the average of their profits for that
year and the previous one. This means that, broadly, the equivalent of one
year's profits will not be taxed. This will balance the additional liability
incurred when the business was started and the first year's profits formed
the basis of assessment for more than one year. There will be further
discussions about the form of the transitional relief when a business ceases
after the change.
Taxpayers who complete returns will normally have to deal with the Revenue
only once or twice a year, when they send in their returns and payments. In
most cases these would be accepted without any further enquiries or
correspondence, but the Revenue would have the right to check any return and
taxpayers would be notified of returns selected for later examination.
Taxpayers would be liable to additional charges if they failed to send in
payments, returns and accounts on time. The Inland Revenue will continue to
consult on the detailed arrangements that will be needed to make the new
system work.
Costs to taxpayers and the Inland Revenue
The changes will largely do away with the current system of estimated
assessments, appeals, postponements, appeal hearings, agreement of profits
after checking returns and revision of assessments. This should produce
substantial savings in time and effort for taxpayers and the Inland Revenue.
There should also be further savings for taxpayers from the simpler rules,
which would make it easier for them to deal with their own tax affairs. But
the Inland Revenue will still work out their tax bills if they cannot, or do
not want to, do it themselves.
Some have said that the reforms timetable that was originally suggested
would not allow taxpayers, their advisers and employers sufficient time to
prepare for the new system. The Chancellor has responded to this by
deferring the start date by one year from that implied in the November
consultative document.
Further consultation
In devising the detailed rules for the new system, the government will wish
to consult closely, particularly with representative bodies and employers,
to ensure that the proposals are implemented as smoothly as possible.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Price-based tax aims to
end market distortion - Company Cars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
TAXING company cars on the basis of their list price would provide a 'fairer
measure of the benefit people receive, eliminate a cause of distortions in
the new car market, and reduce incentives to drive less fuel-efficient
cars,' the Treasury said yesterday.
It said that company car drivers with relatively cheap cars will be better
off compared with the present system; those with relatively expensive cars
for the band will have a higher tax charge; and those with cars around the
average price for the band will remain in much the same position.
The Treasury said: 'The new system will also deal more neutrally with diesel
cars which often have larger engines than the equivalent petrol car.
'The present broad-scale charges will be replaced by a new measure of the
benefit of a car for private use:
the full cost of the car - 35 per cent of the list price of the car from
April 6 1994;
with a discount of one-third if the employee drives more than 2,500 business
miles in a year, or two-thirds if the employee drives 18,000 or more
business miles;
all reduced by a third for cars four or more years old at the end of the tax
year.
'The effect is that on average the charge will be the same as under the
present system, but some individuals will pay more and others less.
'The chancellor announced in his Budget in 1992 his intention to introduce
price-based measures of the value of company cars. These proposals take
account of views expressed in response to the Inland Revenue's consultative
document issued in July 1992 on the details and timing of the change. The
chancellor proposes to base the new tax charge on the full cost of a car for
a year. Full cost includes not only running costs but also large fixed costs
(such as depreciation and financing costs). The measure of full costs for
the income tax charge will be 35 per cent of the price of the car. Free fuel
for private use will continue to be taxed separately.
'The price of the car will be defined to be its list price at the time it
was first registered, plus the price of 'extras' provided with the car. The
consultative document discussed the operational attractions of some form of
banding of cars by price. After taking into account the views expressed
during the consultative exercise the new system now proposed will not be
banded. Each company car will be dealt with on the basis of its price.
'There will be special rules to arrive at a price for a car if,
exceptionally, no list price is published. In addition cars over 15 years
old, with an open market value of more than Pounds 15,000, will be taxed by
reference to their value if that is higher than their list price.
'The value of the benefit will be reduced to take account of the business
use. The full cost will be reduced by:
one third for 2,500 to 17,999 business miles a year;
two-thirds for 18,000 or more business miles a year.
'This reproduces the present broad apportionment of the costs of a car
between employer and employee which the government indicated last year it
had no plans to change.
'There will also continue to be a further reduction of one third for cars
that are four or more years old at the end of the tax year. Second cars will
also be taxed on their full cost. As at present, there will be no reduction
for business use unless the second car is used for more than 18,000 business
miles a year. The full cost will then be reduced by a third.
'Payments by employees for the private use of the car will continue to
reduce pound for pound the value of the benefit.
'The new system will start on April 6 1994. It will apply in 1994-95 and
subsequent years to all company cars. This timetable will allow the Inland
Revenue to seek, during 1993, details from employers of the prices of the
cars they make available to their employees. The new charges will then be
taken into account at the end of 1993 when setting employees' PAYE codes for
1994-95.
'Neither employees nor employers need contact their tax office about these
changes. The Inland Revenue will get in touch with employers to seek
information about the list prices of their company cars.
'The consultative document proposed new arrangements for employers to notify
the tax office at the end of each month of details of cars newly provided to
employees. It is now proposed that employers should be required to give tax
offices this information only quarterly. This will meet their requests for
less onerous arrangements while still allowing the Inland Revenue to adjust
employees' PAYE codes, and so avoid large underpayments of tax.
'The Inland Revenue will also, with ministers' approval, continue
discussions with employers and other interested parties about the collection
of tax on company cars and possible further ways to simplify administration.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Relief for higher-rate
taxpayers to be cut - Married Couple's Allowance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
THE chancellor proposes to introduce legislation in the 1994 Finance Bill to
restrict relief for the married couple's allowance, and the other allowances
linked to it, to the lower rate of 20 per cent from 6 April 1994; raise the
married couple's allowance for couples aged 65 and over by Pounds 200; and
increase the width of the lower rate band by another Pounds 500.
The chancellor's intention in restricting the married couple's allowance is
to raise revenue and to make the allowance worth the same amount to
taxpayers at all levels of income.
The married couple's allowance, like the other income tax allowances,
currently reduces a taxpayer's liability at his or her marginal rate of tax.
For example, the current allowance of Pounds 1,720 for someone aged under 65
reduces their annual tax bill by Pounds 688 (40 per cent of Pounds 1,720) if
they are a higher rate taxpayer, but by half that amount (Pounds 344 or 20
per cent of Pounds 1,720) if they pay tax only at the 20 per cent lower
rate.
The change proposed will mean that the allowance will reduce the tax bills
of all taxpayers entitled to it by the same amount, ie 20 per cent of the
allowance. So at the 1993-94 level the allowance for those aged under 65
would be worth Pounds 344 regardless of the taxpayer's marginal rate.
The restriction will also apply to the allowances which are set at the same
level as the married couple's allowance for those aged under 65. For
example: the additional personal allowance (mainly for single parents); the
widow's bereavement allowance (paid to a widow in the year of her husband's
death and the following year); and the relief for maintenance payments to a
divorced or separated spouse.
The widening of the lower rate band will be worth a further Pounds 25 a year
to all basic and higher rate taxpayers, married or single. The net effect of
both measures on a married man aged under 65, paying tax at the basic rate,
and assuming no other changes in allowances, would be a tax increase of
Pounds 1.17 a week. A higher rate taxpayer aged under 65 would pay Pounds
6.13 a week more. Taxpayers with income of less than about Pounds 6,500
would not be affected.
The higher amounts of the MCA for taxpayers aged 65 and over will also be
restricted to 20 per cent, but these allowances will be increased at the
same time so that the maximum loss to a basic rate taxpayer aged 65 or over
will be no greater than the loss to a basic rate taxpayer aged under 65. The
increase in the higher amounts of MCA will mean that about 130,000 taxpayers
on low incomes will gain up to 75 pence a week, including 30,000 who will be
taken out of tax altogether.
The restriction of the value of the married couple's allowance and linked
allowances will be implemented for employees by making a reduction in their
PAYE tax codes.
The amount of the reduction will depend on their marginal rate of tax and
hence on an estimate of their total income. This will be corrected if it
proves to be wrong at the end of the year. Codes including these
restrictions will be issued early in 1994. For taxpayers not covered by
PAYE, the restriction in relief will be made in assessments or in
calculating repayments.
The restriction of the married couple's allowance will raise about Pounds
900m in 1994-95 (Pounds 1.2bn in a full year), of which Pounds 320m in
1994-95 will be spent on increasing the lower rate band to Pounds 3,000.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Borrowers will find it
easier to move home - Mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
BORROWERS whose houses are valued at less than their outstanding mortgages
will now find it easier to move home, said the Inland Revenue.
Mortgage interest relief will be allowed on a loan originally used to buy a
borrower's previous home as though the loan had been used to buy the new
home, if that new home is substituted for the previous one as security for
the loan.
Lenders may keep an old loan in existence, rather than redeeming it and
advancing a new one, without the borrower losing entitlement to mortgage
interest relief.
The Inland Revenue said the loan would be treated as made on the day that
the security substitution takes place, and treated as used to buy the new
home.
It said: 'As a result, mortgage interest relief is to be available on the
loan as though it was a new loan taken out to buy the home. The amount of
the loan that is eligible for mortgage interest relief - subject to the
Pounds 30,000 limit - will be the smaller of the purchase price of the new
home (less any new loan taken out) and the amount of the old loan
outstanding at that time.
'Unmarried people sharing together whose loans were originally made before 1
August 1988 may at present be receiving relief on more than Pounds 30,000.
Their combined relief will be restricted to Pounds 30,000 when they move, in
the same way as it would be if they took out a new loan in the conventional
way.
Mortgage interest: extension to temporary relief:
The circumstances in which borrowers moving home may continue to claim
mortgage interest relief on their old homes for a limited period after they
have moved have been extended. Under the new rules, which are to come into
effect immediately, it will no longer be necessary to take out a loan to buy
a new home in order to continue to claim relief.
Anyone over 65 with a life annuity home income plan may leave their home
without losing interest relief on the loan used to buy the annuity.
The Inland Revenue said the intention was to give to people moving into
rented properties who were unable to sell their existing homes at once the
benefit which was now available to people who were buying their new homes.
A similar benefit is to be made available to elderly people with home income
plans who are no longer able to stay in their homes, perhaps because they
have to move into a nursing home, and whose old homes cannot be sold
immediately.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Help given over sale of
business assets - Capital Allowance Provisions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
CHANGES were announced in capital allowances which allow connected persons
to elect to treat the sale of industrial buildings, and some other business
assets, as having taken place at their tax written-down value.
The changes are aimed at helping some taxpayers wishing to restructure their
business and at preventing manipulation of election provisions. The changes,
in relation to sales on or after 16 March, are:
To extend the provisions to include qualifying hotels; commercial buildings
in enterprise zones; and scientific research assets.
To allow elections only in cases where both parties are entitled to capital
allowances.
The Inland Revenue said: 'Under the capital allowances legislation connected
persons can elect to treat the sale of certain categories of assets, for
example industrial buildings and mineral extraction assets, as having taken
place at tax written-down value (the original cost less allowances already
taken).
The result of this is that the sale will not give rise to any balancing
adjustment. That is, the sale takes place on a no-gain, no-loss basis. In
these cases, writing-down allowances are available to the new owner on the
remaining unrelieved expenditure. Any subsequent disposal of the asset to an
unconnected person will give rise to a charge or allowance on the same basis
as it would have done had the seller continued to own the asset.
Effectively, for capital allowances purposes the buyer 'steps into the
shoes' of the seller.
An election to treat the sale of assets as having taken place at tax
written-down value has previously been unavailable where the assets
concerned were qualifying hotels, commercial buildings in enterprise zones
and scientific research assets. The chancellor's proposal extends the
election provisions to cover such assets.
The chancellor also proposes that no election will be available where
allowances or charges under the Capital Allowances Code cannot be made on
either of the parties to the sale.
This is on the basis that tax-exempt persons cannot 'stand in the shoes' of
taxpayers as far as tax liabilities are concerned.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Company in newownership
loses tax carry back - Advance Corporation Tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
THE carry-back of advance corporation tax is to stop with immediate effect
when ownership of a company changes and there is a fundamental change in the
nature or conduct of its business.
Inland Revenue said the intention was to prevent the loss of corporation tax
which can occur when a company changes hands. In some cases the company
which is sold may have as its only significant asset the capacity to off-set
ACT against corporation tax it has previously paid. Following the change of
ownership, surplus ACT may be created in the company, and then carried back
to generate a repayment of the corporation tax previously paid.
In a statement, Inland Revenue said: 'Under existing law, where, in any
three-year period, there is both a change in the ownership of a company, and
a major change in the nature or conduct of its trade or business, ACT paid
by the company in respect of distributions made before the change of
ownership may not be set against liability to corporation tax arising after
the change.
'Another restriction prevents ACT paid by a company in respect of
distributions made before a change of ownership from being carried forward
when the trade or business has become small or negligible before the change
of ownership, and is subsequently significantly revived following the
change.
'The new proposal will apply in a similar way to prevent ACT paid in respect
of distributions made after a change of ownership from being set against
liability to corporation tax arising before the change if there is also a
major change in the nature or conduct of the business.
'The proposed clause which will be included in the 1993 Finance Bill is:
In section 245 of the Taxes Act 1988 (calculation etc of ACT on change of
ownership of company) after subsection (3) there shall be inserted the
following subsections:-
'(3A) No advance corporation tax paid by the company in respect of
distributions made in an accounting period ending after the change of
ownership shall be treated under section 239(3) as paid by it in respect of
distributions made in an accounting period beginning before the change of
ownership; this. . . shall apply to an accounting period in which the change
of ownership occurs as if the part ending with the change of ownership, and
the part after, were two separate accounting periods.
(3B) Subsection (3A) above applies in relation to changes in ownership
occurring on or after 16 March 1993.'
The proposal will yield about Pounds 150m in a full year to the Exchequer.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Cash flow benefit of up
to Pounds 2bn sought - Taxation of dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
FIVE linked changes are proposed in the taxation of dividends. The Treasury
said the intention was to provide an overall cash flow benefit of nearly
Pounds 2bn in 1993-94 and 1994-95 to all UK companies paying dividends, to
reduce the amount of new surplus advance corporation tax arising in 1993-94
and subsequent years by some Pounds 300m and to raise revenue of about
Pounds 1,000m a year from 1995-96 onwards.
The main changes are:
to reduce the value of the tax credit on dividends paid by UK companies from
25 per cent to 20 per cent for dividends paid after 5 April 1993;
to reduce correspondingly the present income tax charge on dividends from
the basic rate of 25 per cent to the lower rate of 20 per cent;
to reduce correspondingly the rate at which a UK company has to account for
advance corporation tax (ACT) when it pays a dividend from 25 per cent to 20
per cent, but with a transitional rate for 1993-94 only of 22.5 per cent;
to reduce the rate of corporation tax paid by authorised unit trusts in line
with these changes;
to introduce transitional payments to charities with dividend income from UK
companies.
The general rules are:
Tax credits on dividends: Tax credits accompany dividends paid by UK
companies. They can be set against a UK resident shareholder's liability to
tax on the dividend. A shareholder who is exempt from tax on dividends (such
as a pension fund or a charity), who is not liable to income tax because any
income is covered by allowances, or whose income falls within the lower rate
band of income tax, can claim payment of all or part of the credit. Tax
credits are also payable to certain non-resident shareholders, such as
Commonwealth citizens and citizens of the Republic of Ireland. Partial tax
credits are payable to some other non-resident shareholders under the terms
of some of the UK's double taxation agreements.
The value of the tax credit is currently 25 per cent of the dividend plus
the tax credit. The credit on a dividend of Pounds 75, for example, is
Pounds 25 (25 per cent of Pounds 75 plus Pounds 25). This exactly matches
liability at the basic rate of income tax of 25 per cent on the sum of the
dividend and the tax credit.
From 1993-94, the value of the tax credit falls to 20 per cent of the
dividend plus the tax credit. The credit on a dividend of Pounds 75, for
example, thus becomes Pounds 18.75 (20 per cent of Pounds 75 plus Pounds
18.75). This will exactly match the new income tax charge at the lower rate
on the sum of the dividend and the tax credit.
Tax liability on dividends: Shareholders who are exempt from tax on
dividends, or not liable to tax, will be paid the tax credit on dividends
paid after 5 April 1993 at the lower rate of 20 per cent. This will also
apply to tax credits paid to holders of Personal Equity Plans.
Individual shareholders whose income falls within the lower rate band of
income tax charged at 20 per cent can, at present, claim payment of that
part of the credit which exceeds their liability. After 5 April 1993, they
will not be entitled to any tax credit payment as the tax credit will no
longer exceed the liability.
For shareholders who are currently liable at the basic rate of income tax of
25 per cent, the present tax credit matches the liability on dividends and
there is no further tax to pay. After 5 April 1993, the tax credit will
continue to match the liability exactly, but at 20 per cent.
Individual shareholders who are liable at the higher rate of income tax of
40 per cent currently pay extra tax on dividends at the difference between
the higher rate and the value of the credit. Such a shareholder who at
present receives a dividend of Pounds 75, for example, is taxable at 40 per
cent on income of Pounds 100 (including the tax credit of Pounds 25), and
can set the tax credit of Pounds 25 against the liability of Pounds 40
leaving a further Pounds 15 to pay. For dividends paid after 5 April 1993,
this further payment will be greater. A shareholder receiving a dividend of
Pounds 75, for example, will be taxable at 40 per cent on income of Pounds
93.75 (dividend of Pounds 75 plus tax credit, at the new rate, of Pounds
18,75) and, after setting off the tax credit of Pounds 18.75 against the
liability of Pounds 37.50, there will be a further Pounds 18.75 to pay.
Dividends and other income and allowances: Dividends will be treated as the
top slice of income. A shareholder with income other than dividends will
have the full amount of the lower rate band of 20 per cent available to set
against that other income. A shareholder liable at the higher rate will pay
an additional 20 per cent tax on dividends to the extent that those
dividends fall above the threshold for the higher rate (basic rate limit).
Personal allowances and other reliefs which are set against the total income
of an individual will continue to be given in the way which produces the
greatest reduction in the individual's liability to tax.
Rate of Act: A company which pays a dividend has to pay ACT. The rate at
which ACT is paid is currently 25 per cent of the sum of the dividend and
the ACT payable on it. A company pays ACT of Pounds 25 for each Pounds 75 of
the dividend. After 5 April 1994, the ACT rate will be reduced to 20 per
cent. A company will pay ACT of Pounds 18.75 for each Pounds 75 of the
dividend.
For dividends paid after 5 April 1993 and before 6 April 1994, the ACT rate
will be set between the present and the new rate. It will be 22.5 per cent
of the sum of the dividend and the ACT payable on it. A company will pay ACT
of just over Pounds 21.77 for each Pounds 75 of the dividend.
Other ACT points: The rules for setting ACT against corporation tax
liability will be unchanged.
The maximum amount which a company is able to set against the liability for
any accounting period is the amount of ACT which would have been payable on
a distribution of an amount which, together with the ACT that would have
been payable on it, would have been equal to the profits of the accounting
period. That limit, which at present is Pounds 25 for every Pounds 100 of
taxable profits, will be Pounds 20 for every Pounds 100 of taxable profits
except for the transitional year of 1993-94 when it will be Pounds 22.50.
There are special rules about the ACT payable when a company receives
dividends as a shareholder in another company which it then pays on as
dividends to its own shareholders. Broadly speaking, a company pays ACT only
on the excess of the dividends it pays over the dividends it receives in any
accounting period. Under the proposals, this principle will continue to
apply. For 1993 and 1994, as for any year in which the ACT rate changes, a
company's accounting period which starts before 6 April and finishes on or
after that date will be treated as two separate accounting periods for the
purpose of these rules.
Charities receiving dividends from UK companies are normally entitled to
claim payment of the accompanying tax credit by virtue of their exemption
from tax on this income. For a transitional period of four years from
1993-94, charities will also be able to claim additional payments.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Help given over sale of
business assets - Capital allowance provisions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
CHANGES were announced in capital allowances which allow connected persons
to elect to treat the sale of industrial buildings, and some other business
assets, as having taken place at their tax written-down value.
The changes are aimed at helping some taxpayers wishing to restructure their
business and at preventing manipulation of election provisions. The changes,
in relation to sales on or after 16 March, are:
To extend the provisions to include qualifying hotels; commercial buildings
in enterprise zones; and scientific research assets.
To allow elections only in cases where both parties are entitled to capital
allowances.
The Inland Revenue said: 'Under the capital allowances legislation connected
persons can elect to treat the sale of certain categories of assets, for
example industrial buildings and mineral extraction assets, as having taken
place at tax written-down value (the original cost less allowances already
taken).
The result of this is that the sale will not give rise to any balancing
adjustment. That is, the sale takes place on a no-gain, no-loss basis. In
these cases, writing-down allowances are available to the new owner on the
remaining unrelieved expenditure. Any subsequent disposal of the asset to an
unconnected person will give rise to a charge or allowance on the same basis
as it would have done had the seller continued to own the asset.
Effectively, for capital allowances purposes the buyer 'steps into the
shoes' of the seller.
An election to treat the sale of assets as having taken place at tax
written-down value has previously been unavailable where the assets
concerned were qualifying hotels, commercial buildings in enterprise zones
and scientific research assets. The chancellor's proposal extends the
election provisions to cover such assets.
The chancellor also proposes that no election will be available where
allowances or charges under the Capital Allowances Code cannot be made on
either of the parties to the sale.
This is on the basis that tax-exempt persons cannot 'stand in the shoes' of
taxpayers as far as tax liabilities are concerned.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Changes on loan interest
will stop loss to Exchequer - Multinationals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
MEASURES will be introduced to charge to tax interest payable within
multinational groups to UK companies by non-resident associated companies on
certain loans and other forms of debt as it accrues rather than when it
arises.
The Inland Revenue said in a statement: 'The legislation will apply where
the terms of the financial arrangement are such that, in any 12 month
period, the amount of interest payable may be less than that accruing pro
rata to the lender in the period. These measures will cover all interest
accruing from midnight on March 31 1993, in relation to such debts. The
chancellor's intention is to bring the charging to UK tax of such interest
(or equivalent) more closely into line with that accorded by most of the
UK's major trading partners.
'This will prevent the loss to the exchequer which results from
multinational groups using the differences in national tax rules in order to
defer UK tax liabilities.
'At present, interest is generally chargeable to tax in the UK when it
arises, rather than when it accrues, unless interest is chargeable to tax as
a receipt of a trade. Most of the UK's major trading partners tax all
interest as it accrues to the lender. Since these countries also tend to
give tax relief to a borrower as interest accrues, multinational groups can
take advantage of this difference in tax treatment. Tax relief for the
interest is obtained by the borrower on an accruals basis but the lender
defers his liability to tax on the interest (often for long periods) by
being taxed on an arising basis.
'The proposed legislation will apply only to loans or other relevant
advances from a UK resident company directly or indirectly to a non-resident
associated company.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Special treatment
offered to voluntary scheme - Company Dividends from Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
A CONSULTATIVE document yesterday described a possible scheme for addressing
the problem of surplus advance corporation tax arising on account of
dividends paid by a company out of foreign source profits which have borne
foreign tax.
The Inland Revenue said: 'The main features of the scheme would be:
It would be optional;
A company could pay a foreign income dividend (FID) with special tax
treatment;
ACT would be payable on the FID in the normal way;
If it was subsequently established that the FID had been paid out of foreign
source profits, any surplus ACT in respect of the FID would be repayable by
the Exchequer;
In calculating any further tax due from shareholders on FIDs, they would be
treated as receiving income which had borne income tax at the lower rate of
20 per cent under the Chancellor's proposals; there would be no further tax
to be paid by shareholders liable at the lower or basic rate of tax, but a
FID would not carry any tax credit;
There would be special arrangements for intern-ational headquarter
companies.
'The chancellor's intention in issuing the consultative document is to see
whether an acceptable way can be found to relieve a long-standing problem
for many of the companies which want to pay dividends out of foreign source
profits.
'Following consultations, the chancellor intends to introduce legislation
for the scheme in the Finance Bill due to be published in January 1994. The
chancellor intends to legislate for a special scheme to make the UK more
attractive as a location for international headquarter companies if, for
whatever reason, it is not possible to introduce the full scheme.
The budget also included a proposal to improve tax relief now available for
expenditure incurred by enterprises before they begin trading. The Inland
Revenue said this should be of particular benefit to companies undertaking
infrastructure projects.
First, he proposes to extend from five years to seven years the period for
which businesses can claim relief for expenditure incurred before the start
of trading.
The new seven-year period will apply to individuals, partnerships or
companies who start to trade on or after April 1 1993.
Second, he proposes to extend the relief for pre-trading expenditure to
certain types of interest and other expenses incurred by companies which
currently fall outside the scope of the relief. The new relief will apply to
companies which start to trade on or after April 1 1993.
Third, he proposes to fill a gap in the relief available for expenditure on
the preparation of a site for waste disposal.
The scope of that relief is to be widened and, in particular, will extend to
such expenditure incurred before trading begins. For anyone starting to
trade on or after April 1 1993, such expenditure will be deemed to be
incurred on the first day of trading.
The chancellor's intention is to remove tax obstacles to the undertaking of
projects, particularly those with lengthy lead times.
The proposed changes should give enterprises greater freedom to structure
their financial affairs before they start trading according to their own
commercial considerations, rather than being driven by tax considerations.

<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
FOREIGN exchange gains and losses for companies on all monetary assets and
liabilities are to be taxed or relieved as income as they accrue, in what
the Chancellor described as a measure to enhance London's status as a world
financial centre.
Exchange gains and losses on monetary assets (such as cash, bank deposits
and debts receivable) and liabilities will be taxed or relieved as income
receipts or deductions (for trading items, as part of trading profits or
losses).
Monetary assets in foreign currency which are currently subject to capital
gains tax will cease to be so.
Exchange differences on monetary items will be recognised as they accrue (as
happens for accounts purposes when the items are translated into sterling).
Unrealised exchange gains above certain limits may be partially deferred
(where they arise on long-term capital items).
Trading profits before capital allowances may be calculated by reference to
currencies other than sterling where certain conditions are met.
There will be provision for exchange differences on a borrowing which
'matches' a non-monetary asset to be deferred until the asset is disposed
of.

This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and

THE chancellor also announced measures aimed at ensuring that tax relief to
approved occupational pension schemes is given only when contributions are
actually paid into pension schemes.
The Inland Revenue said its long-standing view of the law was 'that an
employer may have a deduction from profits for tax purposes only for sums
paid into an approved occupational pension scheme'. Doubt has recently been
cast on this view particularly following a Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice (SSAP 24) issued in 1988.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Help over sale of
business assets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
CHANGES were announced in the capital allowance provisions which allow
connected persons to elect to treat the sale of industrial buildings, and
some other business assets, as having taken place at their tax written-down
value.
The changes are aimed at helping some taxpayers wishing to restructure their
business and at preventing manipulation of the election provisions. The
changes, in relation to sales on or after 16 March, are:
To extend the provisions to include qualifying hotels; commercial buildings
in enterprise zones; and scientific research assets.
To allow elections only in cases where both parties are entitled to capital
allowances.
The Inland Revenue said: 'Under the capital allowances legislation connected
persons can elect to treat the sale of certain categories of assets, for
example industrial buildings and mineral extraction assets, as having taken
place at tax written-down value (the original cost less allowances already
taken). The result of this is that the sale will not give rise to any
balancing adjustment. That is, the sale takes place on a no-gain, no-loss
basis. In these cases, writing-down allowances are available to the new
owner on the remaining unrelieved expenditure. Any subsequent disposal of
the asset to an unconnected person will give rise to a charge or allowance
on the same basis as it would have done had the seller continued to own the
asset. Effectively, for capital allowances purposes the buyer 'steps into
the shoes' of the seller.
An election to treat the sale of assets as having taken place at tax
written-down value has previously been unavailable where the assets
concerned were qualifying hotels, commercial buildings in enterprise zones
and scientific research assets. The chancellor's proposal extends the
election provisions to cover such assets.
The chancellor also proposes that no election will be available where
allowances or charges under the Capital Allowances Code cannot be made on
either of the parties to the sale. This is on the basis that tax-exempt
persons cannot 'stand in the shoes' of taxpayers as far as tax liabilities
are concerned.
The chancellor's proposed changes will have a negligible revenue effect.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): VAT rules are simplified
for triangular transactions - EC Trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
VAT simplification procedures will apply to some commercial transactions
which involve traders from other member states of the European Community
from August 1.
These changes are for so-called 'triangular' transactions.
These situations arise when commercial goods are supplied in a chain
involving three traders located in different member states, but where
physical delivery of the goods involves their movement direct from the first
member state to the third; and goods installed or assembled in the UK by
traders from other EC countries.
The chancellor's intention is to give legal effect to a Community-wide
scheme aimed at reducing the need for intermediate suppliers to register for
VAT in the country where the goods are delivered.
This is a measure that the British government had argued for strongly during
the single market negotiations.
The government's success in these talks in persuading the other EC countries
to agree to this simplification was warmly welcomed by UK businesses.
The opportunity has also been taken to introduce a similar arrangement for
goods installed or assembled in the UK by overseas traders. This decision
will reduce the need for such overseas traders to register in the UK. The
new arrangements for triangular trade were part of the VAT simplification
directive which was agreed by the Twelve only on December 14 last year.
It was therefore too late to be included with the single market VAT changes
which were announced by the chancellor in last year's budget.
The new arrangements give legal effect to extra statutory concessions which
have been applied administratively in the UK since the single market came
into effect in January.

apply.
'The provisions will apply to loans and other forms of debt, including deep
discount securities and deep gain securities , where all or part of the
accruing interest or equivalent becomes payable at intervals in excess of 12
months by being compounded for periods of more than 12 months , rescheduled
or otherwise deferred.
'Interest accruing to the lender in an accounting period in respect of loans
or other forms of debt covered by this proposed legislation will be treated
(to the extent that it is not otherwise already chargeable) as if it had
arisen during that accounting period, rather than in the later accounting
period in which it actually arises.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Bids for Channel tunnel
link to be sought - Infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
BIDS would be invited from the private sector so that the Channel Tunnel
Rail Link project could be taken forward as a joint venture as soon as
possible.
The timing will be discussed with the private sector participants, but the
government hopes that the new line will be completed around the end of the
decade. The government will make its own contribution to the project in
recognition of the benefits that will accrue to domestic travellers from the
new link.
Full responsibility for the project will be transferred to the private
sector.
A joint venture between British Rail and BAA to build Heathrow Express, a
fast rail link between Heathrow and Paddington, was also announced.
The Treasury said the secretary of state for Scotland would announce in the
next few days the appointment of advisers on involving the private sector in
a package of transport measures around the Firth of Forth, including a new
crossing to be financed and built by the private sector; and also in the
Central Scotland Fastlink, which will connect the north-east of Scotland to
the A74 and M6 artery to the south.
Improvements to the tax relief which is currently available for expenditure
incurred by enterprises before they begin trading, were also announced.
These are intended to remove possible obstacles to the undertaking of large
projects with a long lead time.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary and the minister responsible for
developing the private finance initiative, said projects would be going
ahead which would otherwise have had to wait or not be undertaken at all.
This would allow the private sector to contribute its skill and experience.
The treasury is publishing guidance which it has provided to departments on
the appraisal of the government's contributions to joint ventures.
It expands on the interim guidance on private finance published in December.
The government has decided that the Crossrail project should be re-examined
with the aim of ensuring the greatest possible involvement of the private
sector and maximising value for money.

VALUE ADDED tax is to be applied to domestic fuel from April 1 next year,
and road fuel tax is to rise in real terms in future Budgets, as part of
measures to encourage more efficient use of fuels and reduce emissions of
carbon dioxide.
The chancellor also said that his changes in motoring taxation were in part
intended to ensure that transport would 'play its part in meeting the threat
of global warming, and achieving the CO2 reduction target by encouraging
greater fueleconomy.'
The rise was also intended to finance the abolition of car tax in the Autumn
Statement.
The chancellor said that the rate of duty on road fuels will increase by 10
per cent and the rate of Vehicle Excise Duty for cars, light goods vehicles
and taxis from Pounds 110 to Pounds 125.
'There will also be some small increases in a number of other VED rates, but
those for heavier lorries will remain unchanged.' The changes in vehicle
excise duty rates took effect at midnight.
The rates for around 600 'special type' vehicles, used to move exceptionally
heavy loads, will increase from Pounds 3,250 to Pounds 4,250 from Budget
day, and to Pounds 5,000 on the date of the first Unified Budget. A number
of other minor rates will change.
Changes in the rules covering the concessionary rates for vintage
motorcycles will result in around 1,000 motorcycles paying Pounds 15 vehicle
excise duty instead of Pounds 30. Vehicle excise duty rates for lorries
exceeding 12,000 kgs will remain unchanged.
The vehicle excise duty increases are designed to raise an extra Pounds 300m
in 1993-94.
VAT is to apply to domestic fuel and power at a rate of 8 per cent from
April 1994 and 17 1/2 per cent from April 1995.
The chancellor also gave a commitment to increase road fuel duties by, on
average, at least 3 per cent in real terms in future Budgets, building on
the 10 per cent increase announced in this Budget.
The Treasury said: 'His intention is to make a major contribution to the
UK's programme for limiting carbon dioxide emissions. This programme follows
the signature by the prime minister of the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change at Rio last year.'
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said: 'Taken together with
measures that have already been announced, the UK now has in place policies
which should take us two thirds of the way to meeting the Climate Change
Convention commitments for carbon dioxide emissions, agreed at Rio.
'We expect to ratify the convention, together with other major countries, by
the end of 1993.'
The chancellor also announced that hydrocarbon oil duties are to be extended
to all fuel substitutes. Previously only petrol substitutes and road fuel
gases were subject to duty.
Customs and Excise said the intention was to apply duty to all substitutes
for oils used as motor fuel or heating fuel. Petrol substitutes and road
fuel gases are already charged with duty.
The principal commodities affected are orimulsion, a fuel oil substitute,
diesel fuel substitutes and some motor fuel additives. These will be charged
at the duty rate of the equivalent hydrocarbon oil.
A 10 per cent rise in rates of duty on hydrocarbon oils was announced.
Customs and Excise said the duty increases (including VAT) were equivalent
to: light oils (mainly leaded petrol), 3.3p a litre, 14.9p a gallon;
unleaded petrol 2.7p/12.5p; heavy oil used as road fuel (derv) 2.7p/12.2p;
gas oil (excluding VAT) 0.1p/0.6p; fuel oil (excluding VAT) 0.1p/0.5p.
A commitment was also announced to raise road fuel duties by, on average, at
least 3 per cent a year in real terms, as part of the strategy to return
carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Tax relief on
government-funded schemes - Training
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
THE VAT relief available to training providers participating in government
funded training programmes is to be widened under budget proposals. From
April 1 supplies of all such training, including the provision of work
experience, will be exempt.
The Chancellor's intention is to minimise the impact of Vat on government
funded training and to introduce greater uniformity in tax treatment.
Training providers affected by the change will need to consider how it
affects their tax status. Some may make only exempt provision, in which case
they will be unable to reclaim any input tax but they will no longer need to
be registered. Other training may become partially exempt, in which case
providers will no longer be able to reclaim all their input tax.
The changes will be made by way of the Value Added Tax (Education) Order
1993.
The estimated revenue effect is an annual loss of around Pounds 25m.
The Chancellor proposes to exempt from tax the value of outplacement
services provided to employees. This will apply to employees made redundant
yesterday or after, or to outplacement services bought from yesterday
onward. The proposal is that: counselling services provided to employees who
are or become redundant will be exempt from income tax; employers paying for
counselling services for these employees will get a tax deduction for these
payments.
The intention is to improve labour market flexibility. The measure responds
to widespread representations, particularly from employers' representative
bodies and from employees themselves.
The proposal will allow employers to provide outplacement services free of
tax, whether or not the total redundancy package is worth more than Pounds
30,000. The exemption will apply for employees whose employment ends on or
after 16 March, irrespective of when the counselling services are provided.
It will also apply for those made redundant before 16 March where
expenditure on counselling services is incurred on or after that date.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Red Bood Details): The effects of Budget
measures on tax yields
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS section explains how the effects of Budget measures on tax yield are
calculated.
The general approach: the direct effect of a tax change is the difference
between the tax yields obtained by applying the post-Budget tax regime and
the pre-Budget tax regime to the levels of income, profit etc expected after
the Budget.
Since total income and total spending at factor cost are fixed at their
post-Budget levels, the estimates of direct effects do not include any
effect the tax changes themselves may have on levels of income and spending.
Other effects on behaviour are taken into account where they are likely to
have a significant effect on the yield. For example, changes to excise
duties influence the pattern of consumer spending.
The estimates take account of any consequential changes in receipts from
related taxes. For example, the estimated yield from increasing the excise
duty on tobacco includes the change in the yield of VAT on that duty, but
also the change in VAT and other excise duties resulting from the new
pattern of spending.
The direct effect of some tax changes is affected by the implementation of
others. Where this happens, measures are costed in the order in which they
appear in the accompanying table. In the first column of the table opposite
the pre-Budget regime is simply the regime of allowances, thresholds and
rates of duty which applied in 1992-93.
The remaining three columns strip out the effects of inflation on the tax
system by assuming that allowances, thresholds and rates of duty are
increased in line with prices in this and in future Budgets. Measures
announced in this Budget are assumed to be indexed in the same way in future
Budgets.
The move to a November Budget: This year the estimates need to take account
of the fact that the normal date of the Budget is being brought forward from
March to November. In line with the Chancellor's decisions on indexation
provisions and the timing of tax changes, the following assumptions are made
in calculating the indexed base:
March 1993 Budget: allowances, thresholds and rates of duty raised in line
with the increase in the RPI over the year to December 1992 (2.6 per cent);
November 1993 Budget: allowances and thresholds raised in April 1994 in line
with an assumption for the increase in the RPI over the year to September
1993 (2 per cent). Rates of excise duty rise on Budget day (1 January 1994
for alcohol) in line with the assumed increase in the RPI over nine months
to September 1993 (2 per cent). (This assumption for excise duties also
applies to the first column of the table.)
November 1994 Budget: excise duties rise on Budget day (1 January 1995 for
alcohol) and allowances and thresholds in April 1995 in line with the
assumed increase in the RPI over 12 months to September 1994 (3 3/4 per
cent).
November 1995 Budget: rates of excise duty rise on Budget day (1 January
1996 for alcohol) in line with the assumed rise in the RPI in the year to
September 1995 (3 1/4 per cent).
The RPI assumptions for the November 1993, 1994 and 1995 Budget are stylised
figures compatible with the projections of the RPI excluding mortgage
interest payments, on the assumption that interest rates remain unchanged at
current levels.
The following notes refer by number to individual line entries in the main
table on the opposite page.
Inland Revenue taxes: 1, 3 Under statutory indexation the allowances and
limits would have risen by 2.6 per cent.
6 Assumes interest rates are unchanged from current levels. There will also
be a reduction in public spending of Pounds 80 million in 1994-95 and Pounds
90 million in 1995-96 on mortgage interest relief for borrowers who are
non-taxpayers or liable only at the lower rate of income tax.
9 Assumes average list prices of cars will increase by 3 per cent a year.
The new charge would produce the same yield in 1993-94 as the 1993-94 scale
charges.
10 Yield under the current system is estimated at about Pounds 5 million a
year.
Part of the 1994-95 yield is delayed receipt of tax for 1993-94. The 1995-96
yield assumes about 350,000 vans will be taxable in 1995-96.
12 The estimates of revenue effects assume levels of dividends are
unaffected, and include the fall in ACT payments by companies, the fall in
tax credits paid to non-taxpayers and exempt institutions, the extra income
tax payments by higher rate taxpayers and discretionary trusts and the
increase in companies' mainstream corporation tax payments.
The yield of the changes after 1995-96 is expected to be about Pounds 1
billion per year.
14 The yield represents the estimated direct effect of the measure on the
existing level of capital loss buying activity. Without this measure there
could be a more significant loss of tax in the future.
18 These proposals will not affect receipts significantly before 1995-96 and
are expected to be broadly revenue neutral over a period.
20, 21 The yields represent the estimated direct effect of the measures on
the existing level of activity.
Without these measures there could be a more significant loss of tax in the
future.
23 The figures allow for effects on corporation tax receipts and estimates
of the effects of the reform on North Sea activity.
24, 27 Under statutory indexation, the capital gains tax annual exempt
amount and the inheritance tax threshold would have risen by 2.6 per cent.
Customs and Excise taxes: 35-45 The effect of moving the Budget date from
March to late November is to reduce yield from excise duties in 1993-94 by
about Pounds 100 million.
This is because there is usually a rise in clearances of excise goods before
the Budget and a fall afterwards. 1993-94 will include two post-Budget dips,
and this will depress receipts over the year as a whole.
This is taken into account in the forecast, but not scored as a Budget
measure.
39 These figures show the increased yield from road fuel duties which goes
beyond what is required to recoup the cost of car tax abolition announced in
the Autumn Statement.
46 Duty from the lottery will be broadly offset by reductions in receipts
from betting and other taxes on spending.
47 The Finance Bill will include a number of minor measures which
individually and collectively have no revenue effect: measures to end the
refund of duty on beer returned to bond following the introduction of the
new beer end product duty on 1 June 1993; a revised definition of beer; a
provision to tax any wine in bottles with mushroom stoppers as sparkling
wine irrespective of pressure; reducing the maximum permitted level of
fortification of wine from 23 per cent alcohol by volume to 22 per cent.
This brings it into line with the maximum level permitted for made wine
which was increased from 18.3 per cent to 22 per cent on 1 January 1993;
taxing all alcoholic drinks over 22 per cent alcohol by volume at the
spirits duty rate; an anti-avoidance measure to ensure that the correct rate
of duty is paid on blended drinks; allowing imported spirits denatured to
the requirements of other EC member states to benefit from the duty
exemption for methylated spirits denatured to UK requirements; to levy
hydrocarbon oil duties on volumes calculated at a standard temperature of 15
degrees Celsius rather than the ambient temperature; to extend the existing
provisions in EC directives for mutual assistance and mutual recovery of VAT
and customs duties to excise duties; existing arrangements for refunding
duty on beer exported to the Isle of Man are to be repealed when agreement
is reached between the UK and the Isle of Man Government on making beer duty
a shared revenue.
Vehicle excise duties: 48 Includes changes to motorcycles and other minor
rates.
Business rates: 50 The cost in 1995-96 is not known since it will depend on
the transitional arrangements, if any, introduced following the 1995
revaluation.
National insurance contributions: 52 Takes account of the fact that half of
Class 4 NIC charges can be offset against self-employment income charged to
income tax.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Red Bood Details): Summary of main proposals for
tax and benefits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS section summarises the tax and national insurance proposals in the
Budget.
The effect of these changes on government revenues is set out in the table
below.
INLAND REVENUE
Income tax: There will be no change to income tax allowances or the income
limit for age-related allowances for 1993-94.
The 20 per cent tax band will be widened from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 2,500
for 1993-94, and by a further Pounds 500 to Pounds 3,000 for 1994-95. The
basic rate limit is unchanged at Pounds 23,700.
From 6 April 1994 tax relief for the married couple's allowance, and
allowances linked to it, will be restricted to 20 per cent. The married
couple's allowance for those aged 65 and over will be increased by Pounds
200.
Measures will be brought forward to simplify the assessment and collection
of personal tax from 1996-97.
The proposals, which were outlined in the Inland Revenue consultation paper
'A Simpler System for Assessing Personal Tax' published in November 1992,
offer the option of self-assessment to all who pay tax by assessment; apply
the same rules for assessment and payment of tax to income from different
sources; and simplify tax for the self-employed by assessing income for each
year as it arises instead of on the preceding year' basis.
Benefits and expenses: The car benefit scale charges will be increased by 8
per cent from 6 April 1993. From 6 April 1994 they will be replaced by a
charge of 35 per cent of the list price of the car, with discounts for
business mileage and for cars four or more years old. These scale charges
are used for employers' national insurance contributions as well as income
tax.
The scales for assessing the benefit of fuel provided by employers for
private use in company cars will be increased by 20 per cent, and the
reduction in the charge for 18,000 or more business miles a year will be
abolished, from 6 April 1993. The scales are used for employers' national
insurance contributions as well as income tax. The fuel scales for VAT will
be similarly amended.
The existing charge on vans made available by employers for private use will
be replaced from 6 April 1993 by a standard charge of Pounds 500 a year, or
Pounds 350 if the van is four or more years old. Any benefit from a van
weighing more than 3.5 tonnes will be exempt from tax.
The benefit-in-kind of workplace sports facilities will be exempt from tax
from 6 April 1993.
There will be a ceiling of Pounds 8,000 per move on expenses and benefits
which qualify for tax relief when paid or provided by employers as part of
relocation packages.
In future, relief will be available whether or not employees sell their old
home. The relief will be put onto a statutory basis.
Concessionary relief for payments made to help meet additional housing costs
following a job related move will be withdrawn.
The changes will apply to employees who start a new job on or after 6 April
1993, but there will be transitional arrangements to protect employees who
are already committed to moving.
Outplacement counselling provided to redundant employees will be exempt from
income tax with effect from 16 March 1993, and restrictions which in some
cases prevent employers getting tax relief on the costs will be removed.
Tax relief on mortgage interest will be restricted to 20 per cent with
effect from 6 April 1994. Relief will remain at 25 per cent for those aged
65 and over who take out a loan to buy a life annuity.
The stamp duty threshold for transactions in land and property will be
raised from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000 for instruments executed on or
after 16 March 1993 and not stamped before 23 March 1993.
Borrowers will be entitled to mortgage interest relief where, on or after 16
March 1993, a lender substitutes a borrower's new home for a previous home
as security for a loan.
Under present law, relief is available only if the new home is bought with a
new loan.
Temporary relief for mortgage interest will be extended to: borrowers who
move out of their home without taking out a loan to buy a new home, provided
the property is put up for sale; elderly people who move out of a property
used as security for a loan which is used to buy an annuity, provided that
the property is put up for sale.
These changes will apply to mortgage interest paid on or after 16 March
1993.
Two further minor changes to the tax treatment of housing are: new rules
will be introduced for stamp duty on property purchased under the rent to
mortgage and rent to loan schemes being created by the Housing and Urban
Development Bill; Inland Revenue will be given clear statutory authority to
recover amounts overclaimed by MIRAS lenders, together with appropriate
interest and penalties, with effect from Royal Assent.
Savings and financial services: Business Expansion Scheme tax relief will no
longer be available to individuals who obtain loans which are connected in
any way with shareholdings they acquire through the scheme.
This applies for shares issued on or after 16 March 1993.
The maximum level of earnings for which pension provision may be made with
tax relief will remain at Pounds 75,000.
A new scheme will be introduced to replace the special reserve fund and
enable Lloyd's underwriters to build up a tax-free reserve to meet losses.
Gains on assets representing invested premiums will be chargeable as trading
profits rather than to capital gains tax. The tax treatment of certain
reliefs and expenses will be simplified.
Two minor measures are: repayments to friendly societies for their
non-pension exempt business will be put onto a statutory basis; a number of
minor amendments will be made to the administrative rules for Personal
Equity Plans.
Charities: The minimum size of single donations to charities which qualify
for relief under the Gift Aid scheme will be reduced from Pounds 400 to
Pounds 250 from 16 March 1993.
The annual limit on charitable donations qualifying for income tax relief
under the payroll giving scheme will be raised from Pounds 600 to Pounds 900
from 6 April 1993.
Tax relief for voluntary contributions by an employer towards costs incurred
by a charitable agency in running a payroll giving scheme will be put onto a
statutory basis.
Residence rules: The rule under which someone who has accommodation
available for use in the UK is considered resident for tax purposes for any
year in which they visit the UK, will be abolished. This applies to income
and capital gains tax and takes effect from 6 April 1993.
Taxation of dividends: The value of tax credits attached to dividends paid
after 5 April 1993 will be reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.
The income tax charge on dividends will be reduced from the basic rate of 25
per cent to the lower rate of 20 per cent.
This means that basic and lower rate taxpayers will have no more tax to pay
on their dividends, and no part of the tax credit will be payable to lower
rate taxpayers. Higher rate taxpayers will continue to be liable at the
higher rate of 40 per cent, of which 20 per cent will be met by the tax
credit.
Charities with dividend income will be able to claim special payments for a
four year period to ease the transition to the new lower rate of tax
credits.
The rate of advance corporation tax (ACT) will be reduced from 25 per cent
to 22 1/2 per cent for 1993-94 and to 20 per cent from 1994-95.
Business taxation: A consultative document is being issued with a view to
legislation in 1994 on a proposal which would allow companies to reclaim
surplus ACT which arises from certain dividends paid out of foreign income
which has borne foreign tax.
The Government intends in any event to legislate in 1994 for such a scheme
for international headquarters companies.
The tax treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses will be reformed so
that gains and losses on all monetary assets and liabilities will be taxed
or relieved as income as they accrue.
The date for implementation of these changes will be announced in due
course.
A number of changes will be made to limit the scope for tax avoidance:
interest accruing after 31 March 1993 which is payable within multinational
groups on certain loans and other forms of debt will become chargeable to
tax as it accrues rather than when it arises; group companies will no longer
be able to set certain capital losses against capital gains where the losses
arise outside the group and are brought in by a company joining the group.
This will apply to disposals on or after 16 March 1993, where a company
joined the group after 31 March 1987; where there is a change in company
ownership, in certain circumstances it will no longer be possible to set off
ACT paid after the change against corporation tax paid before it; UK
companies which control foreign companies will (subject to certain
exclusions) be liable to UK tax on the profits of the foreign company
arising on or after 16 March 1993 where the overseas tax paid by that
foreign company is less than three-quarters (previously one half) of the tax
that would be payable if it were resident in the UK; the capital allowance
provisions for connected persons will be extended to qualifying hotels,
commercial buildings in enterprise zones and scientific research assets, and
will be amended so that elections are available only where both parties are
entitled to capital allowances; the provisions which limit capital
allowances for assets leased overseas will be amended to ensure that they
operate as originally intended; the basis on which contributions by
employers to approved occupational pension schemes may be allowed for tax
purposes will be clarified, with effect from 6 April 1993; changes will be
made, with effect from 16 March 1993, to the capital gains rules applying to
exchanges of shares and securities under company take-overs, reconstructions
and reorganisations of share capital.
European Community (EC) agricultural quotas for ewe and suckler cow premiums
will qualify for rollover relief from 1 January 1993.
Other qualifying assets may be introduced in future by Treasury Order.
Other changes are: the period for which businesses can claim relief for
costs incurred before trading begins will be extended from five to seven
years.
Relief will also be extended to trade related charges paid by companies, and
costs of preparing waste disposal sites, incurred before trading begins;
some improvements will be made to the Pay and File rules which come into
force on 1 October 1993, including provision for a wider range of people to
sign company returns; the capital gain chargeable to tax when a company
grants a share option to an employee under an approved scheme will be
limited to the amount, if any, actually paid for the option by the employee;
the rules for the recovery of under-deductions of PAYE by Government
departments will be brought into line with those for the private sector from
1993-94.
Oil taxation: The rate of petroleum revenue tax (PRT) will be reduced from
75 per cent to 50 per cent from 1 July 1993, and PRT will be abolished for
fields which get development consent on or after 16 March 1993.
Subject to transitional arrangements, spending on exploring for and
appraising new fields may no longer be set against PRT arising from existing
fields.
Similar changes will be made for future development costs in fields for
which PRT has been abolished. The special PRT allowance for tariff receipts
will not be given when tariffs are paid from a new non-PRT field.
Double taxation relief will be made available to reduce a PRT liability on
certain non-oil production receipts.
Capital gains tax: The capital gains tax annual exempt amount will remain at
Pounds 5,800 for individuals and Pounds 2,900 for most trusts.
Entrepreneurs who sell shares in their own company will not be liable to
capital gains tax when the gains are reinvested in unquoted shares in other
qualifying trading companies. This takes effect from 16 March 1993.
The capital gains tax retirement relief provisions will be changed to relax
the shareholding condition to a single 5 per cent test and allow full-time
working employees, as well as directors, to qualify for the relief. This
takes effect from 16 March 1993.
Inheritance tax: The threshold for inheritance tax will remain at Pounds
150,000.
Some minor changes will be made to inheritance tax: the three year period
after death during which land and buildings may be sold and the sale price
substituted for the value at death, will be extended to four years for sales
from 16 March 1993; where an estate contains investments with quotations
that have been suspended within a year after death, the investment, if
unsold, may be valued for inheritance tax purposes at the value one year
after death.
This will apply where the death occurred on or after 16 March 1992; in
inheritance tax appeals, the Special Commissioners will be given powers to
refer questions about the value of land to the Lands Tribunal.
CUSTOMS AND EXCISE
Value added tax: VAT will be charged on domestic fuel and power at 8 per
cent from 1 April 1994 and at the full standard rate from 1 April 1995.
The turnover threshold above which traders are required to register for VAT
will rise from Pounds 36,600 to Pounds 37,600 from 17 March 1993, in line
with the increase in the RPI in the year to December 1992. The
deregistration threshold will rise from Pounds 35,100 to Pounds 36,000 from
1 May 1993.
All major VAT penalties on late returns and misdeclarations will be reformed
during 1993. The reforms are the outcome of reviews announced by the
Chancellor in his 1991 and 1992 Budgets and consultation with traders.
Traders will be able to claim VAT relief on bad debts after six months
rather than a year, from 1 April 1993.
More small businesses will be able to benefit from the cash accounting
scheme, under which VAT is handled on the basis of cash paid and received
rather than invoiced. The turnover limit below which firms may join the
scheme is being increased from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 350,000 a year from
1 April 1993; and businesses will no longer have to make a written
application to Customs and Excise to join.
There are a number of minor changes to VAT: new arrangements are being
introduced to simplify the taxation of so called 'triangular' transactions
involving traders located in different EC member states from 1 August 1993;
the VAT relief on samples is to be simplified and widened to help businesses
provide samples, with effect from Royal Assent.
This will help the music industry in particular; a scheme is being
introduced to extend the number of horse owners eligible for VAT
registration; for the second year of the Payments on Account scheme starting
in October 1993, businesses are to be included on the basis of their VAT
liabilities in 1992-93.
Under this scheme certain large businesses are required to make a monthly
payment on account towards their quarterly VAT bills; a special scheme
covering gold sales between registered traders will be introduced from 1
April 1993, to minimise the increased scope for fraud arising from the
introduction of the single market; the law on input tax will be clarified to
ensure that businesses only reclaim VAT on goods and services purchased for
making taxable supplies, with effect from Royal Assent; controls will be
introduced, with effect from Royal Assent, to protect VAT and customs duty
on vehicles brought into the UK.
The previous controls lapsed when car tax was abolished in November 1992;
all training, including work experience, provided under Government funded
training programmes will be exempt from VAT from 1 April 1993.
This widens an existing exemption for certain training; the zero-rating on
certain protective boots and helmets approved by the British Standards
Institution will be extended to similar products meeting equivalent EC
safety standards; parts and equipment for some ships and aircraft, other
than those used for recreational purposes, will be zero-rated from 1 April
1993.
Excise duties: Most excise duties will rise from 6pm on 16 March 1993. The
duty on spirits is not being increased.
The duty on road fuels will be raised on average by at least 3 per cent in
real terms in future Budgets. This will encourage more efficient use of fuel
and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. Developments in charging for road
use will be taken into account in determining the appropriate level of duty.
The National Lottery, which is due to start in 1994, will be taxed at a rate
of 12 per cent of gross stakes.
Most rates of gaming machine licence duty will be increased by 20 per cent
from 1 May 1993, except for the duty on small prize machines costing less
than 5p per play which is unchanged and will be abolished from 1 November
1993.
The exemption limit for fairground bingo will be increased to Pounds 25 from
5 April 1993.
Hydrocarbon oil duties will be extended to all fuel substitutes including
orimulsion (a fuel oil substitute), rapeseed diesel and certain motor fuel
additives from shortly after Royal Assent.
The definition of hand rolling tobacco will be revised from Royal Assent.
This is to stop pipe tobacco, which has a lower rate of duty, being marketed
for rolling into cigarettes.
Vehicle excise duties: Duty on cars, light goods vehicles, vans and taxis
will rise from Pounds 110 to Pounds 125 from 17 March 1993. A range of minor
rates, including those applying to motorcycles, trade licences, and small
lorries, are increased by a similar percentage.
The rate for special type vehicles will be increased to Pounds 4,250 from 17
March 1993, and to Pounds 5,000 from Budget day in November 1993.
Concessionary rates for vintage motorcycles will be simplified. Other VED
rates, including the majority of those for lorries, are unchanged.
BUSINESS RATES
England and Wales: Rate bills for properties in England and Wales which are
in transition to higher bills as a result of the 1990 reforms will not
increase in real terms in 1993-94. This change will reduce the total rates
bill in England and Wales by 2.6 per cent. Bills will rise in line with the
uprating of business poundages already announced in November 1992 which is
based on the rise in the RPI in the year to September 1992 (3.6 per cent).
Scotland and Northern Ireland: Scotland and Northern Ireland have different
arrangements for business rates but their total rates bill for 1993-94 will
also be reduced by 2.6 per cent.
National insurance contributions: From 1 April 1994 the main rate of
employees' national insurance contributions will be increased by 1
percentage point to 10 per cent and the Class 4 rate of contributions for
the self-employed will be increased by 1 percentage point to 7.3 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Red Bood Details): Full fund changes outlined
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S full fund policy helps to ensure that its borrowing is
financed in a non-inflationary way and provides markets and investors with
an indication of the scale of funding the authorities are likely to
undertake year by year.
Under the present definition the net total of maturing debt, the PSBR and
any underlying increase in the foreign exchange reserves has been met by
sales of debt to purchasers other than banks and building societies.
Under the present definition, if banks and building societies seek to
increase their own liquidity by buying gilts, the government has to sell
more debt. This is not appropriate when demand for credit is weak and the
growth of the private sector's liquidity is subdued. Moreover, this process
drains cash from the money markets, increasing the need for the authorities
to provide money market assistance and for the banks and building societies
to part with the liquid assets that are acquired in those official
operations.
As a result, the ability of banks and building societies to increase their
total liquidity is constrained; and the task of managing the provision of
money market assistance is made more complicated.
The government intends to continue the full fund policy but from now on to
allow sales of debt to banks and building societies to count as funding, in
the same way as sales of debt to other sectors. As before, sales of Treasury
bills will not count as funding, and no change is envisaged in the practice
whereby current coupon gilts below three years' maturity are not issued
other than in exceptional circumstances, reflecting the policy's unchanged
objectives.
The policy will be operated in a symmetrical way. When banks and building
societies are net buyers of government debt, total debt sales will be lower
than under the present specification. But when banks and building societies
are net sellers, total debt sales will be higher. Over a period of years
this will not change the total amount of debt sales, except to the extent
that there is a long-term trend in bank and building society holdings.
This change will take effect from 1993-94.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Red Bood Details): Sustained growth and low
inflation at strategy's core
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Medium Term Financial Strategy sets out the framework for achieving
sustainable growth based on permanently low inflation.
Last autumn, following the suspension of sterling's membership of the ERM,
the government put in place a new policy framework for its counter-inflation
strategy. At the centre of this framework is a quantified target - to keep
underlying inflation (as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage interest
payments) in the range 1 per cent to 4 per cent, and to bring it down to the
lower part of this range by the end of the present parliament.
This target implies a path for the growth of money GDP - total spending in
the economy in cash terms - averaging about 6 per cent a year over the next
three years, and falling gradually thereafter. It is the role of
macroeconomic policy to deliver this. The purpose of microeconomic policy is
to improve the efficiency of markets and strengthen the supply performance
of the economy, so as to raise the growth rate of output compatible with a
given inflation path.
MONETARY POLICY
The conduct of monetary policy involves a judgment on inflationary trends in
the economy and whether the government's objective is likely to be achieved.
While sterling remains outside the ERM, decisions about interest rates are
based on a continuing assessment of monetary conditions, measured
principally by the growth of narrow and broad money, and movements in the
exchange rate and asset prices. Developments in these and other relevant
indicators are now set out in the Monthly Monetary Report, which has been
published by the Treasury since December.
For both narrow and broad money the government has set monitoring ranges
which are judged to be consistent with the medium-term path for money GDP
and hence inflation. There is no similar range for the exchange rate, but
this remains an important indicator which directly influences domestic costs
and prices and reflects market perceptions of the stance and future
direction of policy. Movements in asset prices have in the past been
valuable leading indicators of inflation.
If narrow or broad money moves outside its monitoring range, or there is a
sharp movement in the exchange rate or asset prices, this is likely to be a
cause for concern; but the evidence from any one indicator has to be weighed
against the message from the others in judging the outlook for inflation.
NARROW MONEY
Last year's MTFS set a target of 0 per cent to 4 per cent for M0 growth in
1992-93, and this target was reaffirmed in the autumn. M0's 12-month growth
rate fell below the centre of the target range in June, but rose in the
second half of 1992 and was above the top of the target range in February.
Interpretation of M0 has been complicated by recent developments in the
relationship between its growth and that of money GDP. Over the last two
decades the average growth of M0 was about 4 per cent a year lower than that
of money GDP and the velocity of M0 rose accordingly. But in the last few
years there have been signs that M0's velocity trend has slowed down.
For the time being the government considers it prudent to retain a range of
0 per cent to 4 per cent for M0. This will apply for the whole period
covered by this year's MTFS. It will be treated as a monitoring range rather
than a target, because the government now has a target for the inflation
rate itself. Following the recent sharp fall in interest rates, M0 growth
may be above this range in the short term; but with policy set to deliver
the government's inflation objective it should fall back in the medium term.
BROAD MONEY
No ranges were set for broad money between 1986 and 1992; however, M4 was
still taken into account in assessing monetary conditions. It was decided
last autumn to publish a monitoring range for M4, to show what growth rates
would or would not be regarded as a cause for concern. The monitoring range
in the second half of 1992-93, announced in the Autumn Statement, is 4 per
cent to 8 per cent. M4 growth has fallen since the monitoring range was set,
reflecting in particular very low growth in lending to the personal sector
in the fourth quarter, and has been below the range since the start of 1993.
The government is setting a monitoring range for M4 of 3 per cent to 9 per
cent for the whole period covered by the MTFS. The mid point of the
monitoring range is unchanged at 6 per cent; but the width has been
increased to 6 percentage points because it now applies to a longer period.
FISCAL POLICY
Fiscal policy will be set to maintain sound public finances, which are
essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The government's objective is
to bring the PSBR back towards balance over the medium term.
A large part of the present PSBR is attributable to the effects of the
economic cycle. But it is impossible to determine with any precision how
much of it will be reversed as the economy recovers. Whatever the underlying
position, the actual level of the PSBR is important in itself because it
adds to the amount of public sector debt outstanding and thereby raises debt
servicing costs. A run of large budget deficits, even if largely cyclical in
origin, would lead to a weakening in the underlying fiscal position.
Tight public expenditure ceilings were announced in the Autumn Statement.
The discretionary increases in tax revenues announced in the Budget will
build up over time, and together with the public expenditure plans will thus
ensure a steady improvement in the underlying fiscal position. The direct
effects of the Budget measures on revenues are summarised in an accompanying
table.
The speed with which the PSBR declines will depend on the rate of growth of
the economy over the medium term.
At the trough of a recession it is very difficult to assess future growth
prospects. The illustrative projections shown in an accompanying table
assume that the recovery continues to gather pace in 1994, and that output
then grows somewhat faster than its trend rate for a number of years. These
growth assumptions are very similar to the average of the projections made
by the Panel of Independent Forecasters (nearly 3 per cent a year); and
slightly lower than in last year's MTFS.
With a degree of spare capacity likely to remain for some years yet,
inflation is assumed to fall further in the medium term. But there may be
little progress over the next two years if the current level of the exchange
rate continues.
These assumptions for output and inflation imply a path of money GDP growth
which averages about 6 per cent a year over the next three years, before
declining in subsequent years. Because of timing effects associated with the
fall in the exchange rate, both the GDP deflator and money GDP will
understate underlying movements in 1993-94, and overstate them in 1994-95.
PROJECTIONS
The assumptions in the money GDP growth table underlie the projections for
the public finances shown in the table of fiscal projections. After rising
in 1993-94, the PSBR falls significantly as a proportion of GDP, so that by
1997-98 it is down to 3 3/4 per cent.
The revenue projections are based on the conventional assumption of constant
tax and national insurance rates from 1993-94, except where future changes
have already been announced. All proposed Budget changes are taken into
account. Allowances, thresholds and specific duties are assumed to be
indexed in subsequent Budgets from the levels proposed in the March 1993
Budget.
The ratio of general government receipts to GDP falls in 1993-94; the
delayed effects of broadly unchanged levels of economic activity in 1992-93,
outweigh the effects of the Budget measures. Thereafter the ratio rises as
the economy recovers and the wedge of tax increases announced in the Budget
builds up. Projections for the non-North Sea tax burden and the components
of general government receipts consistent with the table of fiscal
projections are given in accompanying tables.
The objective of the government's public expenditure plans continues to be
that public spending should take a declining share of national income over
time, while value for money is constantly improved. The ratio of general
government expenditure excluding privatisation proceeds to GDP was on a
downward trend for much of the 1980s, though in recent years the impact of
the recession has caused the ratio to rise. It should resume its downward
trend as the economy recovers, and as the PSBR and thus the growth of debt
interest begin to fall.
UNEMPLOYMENT
The projections of general government expenditure in an accompanying table
incorporate the control totals published in the 1992 Autumn Statement for
the period to 1995-96. Detailed plans for the new control total will be
settled in future Surveys. The projections for cyclical social security take
account of higher levels of unemployment since the Autumn Statement. Those
for gross debt interest payments reflect the PSBR projections in the table
of fiscal projections.
The effect of the recession on the PSBR has led to a rise in the net public
sector debt ratio, and this ratio will continue to rise in the next few
years. As the PSBR comes down, the rate of increase will slow. How quickly
it does so, and the level at which the ratio peaks, will depend on the
medium-term economic growth rate.
There is inevitably some uncertainty about medium term prospects. The
economy is operating well below capacity at the moment, and output is likely
to return towards trend over the medium term. But trend output - the level
consistent with stable inflation - is not directly observable, and has to be
inferred from other economic data. How quickly output will return to trend
is also uncertain.
Economic growth is most unlikely to follow the precise path set out in the
main projection. On the one hand, growth could be stronger, given the
present degree of spare capacity: for example, if businesses control their
costs tightly and respond strongly to the recent gain in cost
competitiveness, UK trade performance could be further improved. But
equally, the pick-up in growth could be more sluggish: high levels of
private sector indebtedness could continue to hold back the recovery in
domestic demand, in both the UK and other countries, and the growth in world
trade could be weaker than currently expected.
An accompanying table shows two variants which are used to illustrate the
sensitivity of the fiscal prospect to the rate of growth. The growth rates
differ from the main case by  1/2 per cent in either direction from 1994-95.
SIGNIFICANT
In the absence of discretionary action, the path of the PSBR is
significantly affected by the growth rate. An accompanying table illustrates
this using the assumptions in the table of variant growth assumptions.
In the stronger growth case the PSBR falls to 2 1/4 per cent of GDP by
1997-98. And even if economic developments are less favourable, the wedge of
tax increases announced in the Budget should ensure a substantial reduction
in the PSBR over the medium term.
Whatever the out-turn for growth, the government will take whatever action
is necessary to ensure a sound and sustainable fiscal position.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Red Bood Details): Exports expected to spur
drive for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section contains articles from the Financial Statement and Budget
Report for 1993-94, issued after the chancellor's speech. The report, known
as the 'Red Book', gives the government's economic forecasts to mid-1994,
sets out the latest version of the Medium Term Financial Strategy and
outlines the proposed tax changes in the Budget.
SINCE last summer, activity has fallen sharply in continental Europe and
Japan, but there has been a stronger than expected recovery in the US. GDP
in the G7 economies is estimated to have increased by 1.5 per cent in 1992.
Activity in Europe and Japan is likely to remain weak, and G7 GDP growth may
be no more than 1.5 per cent again in 1993. With plenty of spare capacity,
G7 inflation is forecast to remain below 3 per cent.
GDP in the UK was somewhat stronger in the second half of 1992 than
anticipated in the Autumn Statement, rising by  1/4 per cent on the first
half. While non-oil GDP fell by  1/2 per cent in 1992 as a whole, it was
broadly flat over the year to the fourth quarter. There remain considerable
uncertainties and a wide range of views about the prospects for 1993. The
forecasts from the Panel of Independent Forecasters range from growth of
1/4 to 2 per cent with an average of a little above 1 per cent.
The Treasury forecast is very similar, at 1 1/4 per cent,  1/4 percentage
point more than in the Autumn Statement, reflecting the higher than expected
level of GDP in the second half of 1992. Growth is projected to pick up
through the year, reaching 3 per cent in the year to the first half of 1994
(2 1/4 per cent non-oil).
In the Treasury forecast, the recovery is expected to come both from an
increase in domestic demand, principally consumer spending, and exports.
Trade performance improves significantly on 1992, although net trade makes
virtually no contribution to GDP growth because imports rise as domestic
demand increases.
Further progress has been made on inflation, with underlying RPI inflation
down to 3 1/4 per cent in January. There remain powerful underlying
disinflationary pressures and, apart from petrol prices, there is as yet
little evidence of any effect on retail prices from the lower exchange rate.
Underlying earnings growth fell to 4 3/4 per cent in December and should
fall further in 1993 as the effect of recent low settlements feeds through.
Employment fell sharply and unemployment continued to rise in the second
half of 1992. These trends are forecast to moderate in 1993, but with
unemployment a lagging indicator, it may be some time before it begins to
fall back.
The current account deficit rose to Pounds 12 billion in 1992 from Pounds
6.5 billion in the previous year, with the visibles deficit rising and the
invisibles surplus falling. The visibles deficit is forecast to increase
further in 1993, largely due to a deterioration in the terms of trade but
also to sluggish growth in some of the UK's main trading partners. While
there may be some improvement in the invisibles position, the current
account deficit is projected to widen to Pounds 17.5 billion.
This is broadly in line with the majority view of the Independent Panel,
though somewhat above the average.
The sterling index has averaged 78 1/2 so far this year, 15 per cent lower
than in the three months before ERM suspension. Base rates at the beginning
of March were 4 per cent lower than at the beginning of September. This
easing of monetary policy underpins the forecast of recovery. M0 growth has
been within its target range for most of 1992-93, though above it in
February. M4 growth has recently been below its monitoring range.
The estimated outturn for the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in
1992-93 is Pounds 35 billion, well up on last year's Budget forecast but
lower than in the Autumn Statement. The PSBR is forecast to be Pounds 50
billion in 1993-94.
The forecast is based on the conventional assumption that sterling remains
close to recent levels, and assumes that oil prices average Dollars 18 a
barrel.
WORLD ECONOMY
After stabilising in the summer, industrial production in the G7 was again
falling by the end of last year, as continued weakness in Japan and
continental Europe more than offset a strengthening of activity in North
America. In the latest three months, industrial production in the US was up
3 per cent on a year earlier, compared with a fall of over 3 per cent in the
major continental European economies and 7 per cent in Japan. Business
confidence in the US has risen, but in Europe it is falling sharply and in
Japan it is at its lowest level since 1976.
Recent movements in industrial production have been mirrored in GDP. By the
second half of the year, GDP was falling in Japan, France and Italy, while
in Germany, it has fallen by a cumulative 1 1/2 per cent from its peak in
the first quarter. By contrast, in the fourth quarter of 1992, US GDP grew
at its fastest rate for five years. In G7 as a whole, GDP is estimated to
have risen by 1 1/2 per cent in 1992, following growth of only  3/4 per cent
in 1991.
The marked divergence in activity across the G7 is partly a consequence of
recent developments in monetary and fiscal policy. In the US, real
short-term interest rates have been under 1 per cent for the last year. This
is in marked contrast to continental Europe where, despite some slight
easing since the currency turmoil in September, real short-term rates are
still very high, at around 6 per cent. And in many European countries,
discretionary fiscal tightening has accompanied the monetary squeeze. But in
Japan there has been a substantial monetary easing and a large fiscal
package has been announced though, so far, this has failed to stem the
decline in activity.
In most countries, abundant spare capacity has maintained downward pressure
on inflation. Since June, inflation has fallen by around 1 percentage point
in Japan, France and Italy and has stabilised at just over 3 per cent in the
US. But in Germany, inflation picked up in the second half of 1992 and,
following the 1 per cent rise in VAT at the beginning of this year, it is
now 4 1/4 per cent. Average consumer price inflation in the G7 countries is
just under 3 per cent.
Despite the continued overall weakness of G7 activity, non-oil commodity
prices have risen by over 10 per cent since October as the prospect of
stronger US activity became apparent. However, in real terms, non-oil
commodity prices remain close to their lowest level since the early 1970s.
Oil prices have been relatively stable since the end of the Gulf war. Since
December, the Brent price has averaged around Dollars 18 a barrel and it is
assumed in the forecast to remain at that level.
G7 GDP growth in 1993 is forecast to be 1 1/2 per cent, the same as in 1992
and only slightly below the Autumn Statement forecast of 1 3/4 per cent.
However, there have been some significant changes to the prospects for
individual countries. In the US, growth of 3 1/4 per cent is now forecast
for 1993 compared with 2 1/4 per cent last November.
This upward revision partly reflects a stronger outturn for the second half
of 1992 than had been expected. But also, against a background of stronger
business and consumer confidence, it now appears that reasonably robust
growth will be maintained through 1993. It will be helped by the small
fiscal stimulus included in President Clinton's budget package and by the
fall in long-term interest rates following the announcement of medium-term
deficit reduction measures.
The forecast for GNP growth in Japan in 1993, at 1 per cent, is well below
forecasts by the OECD and the IMF at the end of last year. This reflects the
continued slide in indicators of activity in recent months, and the lack of
any forward indicators yet pointing to recovery. The net stimulus from the
fiscal package announced in August is likely to be considerably less than
originally thought. Its impact has, in any case, been affected by the
prolonged delay before its approval by the Diet.
In the three largest continental European economies, the expectation is, on
average, for a fall in GDP of around  3/4 per cent in 1993, following growth
of only 1 1/4 per cent in 1992. In Germany, GDP has fallen for three
quarters, and no pick-up is expected until the second half of the year as
high real interest rates and the need for fiscal consolidation continue to
depress business and consumer confidence. GDP in Germany could fall by 1 1/2
per cent in 1993 as a whole. Growth in Italy and France will be affected
directly by the weakness of activity in Germany, but also by the high real
interest rates and discretionary fiscal tightening across Europe.
Although commodity prices have picked up in recent months, output in the G7
is well below trend and the growth in demand is expected to remain weak in
1993. Hence, the prospect is for inflation to remain subdued. Consumer price
inflation in the G7 is forecast to fall from 2 3/4 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1992 to around 2 1/2 per cent by the fourth quarter of this year,
and to remain at that level in the first half of 1994.
Despite the slowdown in industrial countries, world trade has held up
remarkably well, helped in part by buoyant Far Eastern markets. World trade
in manufactures is estimated to have grown by 4 1/2 per cent in 1992 and a
similar rate of growth is forecast for 1993. However, growth of UK export
markets, which are weighted more heavily towards Europe, is forecast to fall
from 4 1/2 per cent in 1992 to 3 3/4 per cent in 1993.
DEMAND AND OUTPUT
GDP rose slightly in the second half of 1992, a stronger performance than
anticipated in the Autumn Statement. It edged up in both the third and
fourth quarters, but non-oil GDP fell marginally. In 1992 as a whole, GDP
was  1/2 per cent down on 1991, though it was broadly unchanged between the
fourth quarters of 1991 and 1992. A small increase in domestic demand was
more than offset by a fall in net trade volumes.
Within GDP, oil output recovered strongly in the second half of 1992 and
rose 3 1/4 per cent in the year as a whole. Other energy output also
recovered in the second half of the year. Manufacturing output fell back a
little in the fourth quarter, though not as much as suggested by business
surveys in the summer and autumn, and it was  1/2 per cent higher than a
year earlier. Construction output fell in 1992 but not as much as in 1991.
Service sector output was little changed.
The four percentage point cut in base rates since early September, the fall
in the value of sterling and the measures announced in the Autumn Statement,
have enhanced the prospects for recovery. Business optimism has improved and
there are signs of strengthening consumer demand.
Nevertheless downside risks remain to the central forecast. Consumer demand
may remain hesitant, held back by high levels of debt relative to income and
to house prices, and by the fear of unemployment. And the outlook for the
continental European economies is very subdued. Moreover business surveys
have indicated false dawns before, notably in the autumn of 1991 and the
spring of 1992. On this occasion, however, the improvement in confidence
follows a tangible easing of policy: there is therefore a better chance that
it will translate into higher activity and prove more durable.
The forecast for GDP growth in 1993 is 1 1/4 per cent, broadly in line with
the average of forecasts by the Independent Panel, but slightly more than in
the Autumn Statement reflecting higher than expected output in the second
half of 1992. Growth in the year to the second half of 1993 is unchanged
from the Autumn Statement at 1 3/4 per cent. It is forecast to pick up
further to 3 per cent (2 1/4 per cent non-oil) in the first half of 1994.
Manufacturing output is forecast to rise more rapidly than GDP during the
course of 1993 because of the impact of improved competitiveness.
The main contributions to growth in 1993 are expected to come from
consumers' expenditure, up 1 1/4 per cent, and exports, up 5 1/2 per cent.
Stocks are also forecast to make a contribution to GDP growth, with
destocking coming to an end during the course of the year.
PERSONAL SECTOR
Consumers' expenditure has moved ahead since the first quarter of 1992,
rising by 1 1/4 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter. Recent
consumption indicators have turned out much as expected. But real personal
disposable income was much stronger than forecast, increasing by 2 1/4 per
cent in 1992 despite a sharp fall in employment. As a result, the saving
ratio rose 1 3/4 points in 1992, to 11 1/2 per cent.
Personal sector spending has been closely linked with housing market
developments in the past few years. Although both turnover and prices fell
sharply in the autumn of 1992, this now looks to have been the effect of the
stamp duty concession, which ended in mid-August and which shifted activity
into the summer. Sentiment in the housing market has clearly improved in
recent months, with help from the lower level of interest rates, the reduced
level of repossessions and the measures announced in the Autumn Statement to
take empty properties off the market.
Surveys of estate agents and housebuilders suggest greater activity in the
early part of 1993, but this has not yet been reflected in official housing
market turnover statistics. House prices, though 7 1/4 per cent lower than a
year ago according to the Halifax measure, have fallen by only 1 per cent in
the last four months. The house price/earnings ratio is now back to 1986
levels, and below its average of the last 25 years. While the market is
currently weak by earlier standards, both prices and turnover may start to
rise during the year.
Personal sector spending is likely to continue to be restrained by the
desire for further balance sheet adjustment and by the fear of unemployment.
However, consumer confidence has picked up since the Autumn Statement and
the interest rate cuts since ERM suspension have made current levels of debt
easier to service. Retail sales have continued their upward trend, and
survey and other evidence from distributors also suggests a pick-up in
spending in the early months of the year. It therefore seems likely that
there have been further increases in consumption so far in the first quarter
similar to those in the second half of 1992. Moreover spending is unlikely
yet to have reacted fully to the surprisingly strong growth of real incomes
in 1992.
Thus, despite projected slower growth of real personal disposable income in
1993 of  3/4 per cent, consumer spending is forecast to grow by 1 1/4 per
cent. This implies a fall in the saving ratio from its high 1992 level.
Personal sector investment in dwellings - which includes home improvements
as well as the purchase of new properties - might be little changed in 1993,
following a fall of 2 per cent in 1992.
The personal sector's financial balance is expected to remain in surplus in
1993 - about 6 3/4 per cent of personal disposable income. The debt/income
ratio fell in 1992; it is expected to fall again in 1993 but by less than in
1992. The debt/income ratio by mid-1994 could be about 7 percentage points
below its peak in 1991.
COMPANY SECTOR
Faced with falling turnover and downward pressure on profit margins through
the recession, companies have reacted by cutting costs, particularly by
shedding labour. As a result industrial and commercial companies' profits
(net of stock appreciation) have barely risen since 1990. At the same time
dividends have continued to increase, rising 20 per cent in the past two
years. But with lower tax payments - down by over a quarter between 1990 and
1992 - and falling short-term interest payments, particularly in 1992,
company saving (undistributed income) rose by over 6 per cent between 1991
and 1992.
Profitability of non-North Sea industrial and commercial companies, as
measured by the real rate of return, is forecast to pick up in 1993 as
demand rises, firms continue tight control of labour costs, and pressure on
margins eases. And with lower tax and short-term interest payments, company
saving can be expected to increase sharply.
Business investment has held up well during the recession. Following a 9 per
cent fall in 1991, it fell by only 2 per cent in 1992, despite weak
profitability, and actually rose between the second halves of 1991 and 1992.
Manufacturing investment has risen for three consecutive quarters to the
fourth quarter of 1992.
Given the degree of spare capacity and companies' continuing financial
deficit, a sharp rebound in business investment in 1993 is unlikely. The
temporary increase in capital allowances announced in the Autumn Statement
will boost investment in 1993, and the CBI survey balances for business
optimism and investment intentions recovered quite strongly between October
and January.
Non-oil business investment is forecast to rise modestly in 1993, by 1 per
cent on 1992. However, with North Sea investment expected to fall, total
business investment is forecast to fall by  1/2 per cent in 1993. Business
investment rises through 1993 as recovery gathers pace and profitability
improves, with growth of 2 per cent in the year to the first half of 1994.
The trough in business investment as a share of GDP is likely to occur in
the first half of 1994, at a level well above those seen between 1970 and
the mid-1980s.
General government investment rose by 9 per cent in volume terms in 1992. It
is forecast to rise by 5 per cent in 1993 mainly due to increased local
authorities' investment following the temporary relaxation of the rules for
spending out of capital receipts announced in the Autumn Statement.
The forecast for whole economy fixed investment in 1993 is a small increase
of  1/2 per cent. This is above the forecasts made by most members of the
Independent Panel, which point to a fall in 1993. But given the
uncertainties and the volatility of investment the difference is well within
the margins of error; and two panel members are expecting investment to
increase by more than the Treasury forecast.
Destocking continued in 1992, although at a slower pace than in 1991. The
rate of destocking is forecast to slow further through 1993, with a return
to stockbuilding expected in the second half of the year. Stockbuilding is
forecast to add  1/4 percentage point to GDP growth in 1993, and 1 1/4
points in the year to the first half of 1994. For 1993 the Treasury forecast
is similar to most forecasts made by members of the Independent Panel.
Industrial and commercial companies cut their financial deficit to about 1
3/4 per cent of GDP in 1992 from 2 per cent in 1991, and 3 3/4 per cent in
1990. With saving increasing sharply, investment rising only slowly, and
further destocking, industrial and commercial companies are expected to move
into financial surplus in 1993.
The cumulative fall in employment of nearly 2m to September 1992 from its
peak in June 1990 has been reflected in a strong productivity performance.
Despite the weakness of output, non-oil productivity has been rising since
early 1991, increasing by 2 1/2 per cent in the year to the third quarter of
1992. Over the year to the fourth quarter of 1992 manufacturing productivity
rose by 6 per cent. These rates of productivity growth are much faster than
normal at this stage of the cycle.
UNEMPLOYMENT
Unemployment has risen considerably less than the fall in employment - by
about 1.4m to January 1993 from its low point in April 1990 - reflecting
falling workforce participation. Following a further round of job losses in
the second half of 1992 the rate of increase in unemployment rose, having
moderated earlier. The rate of increase should start to slow down again as
the economy recovers; though since the level of unemployment typically lags
behind the cycle in activity it will be some time before it starts to fall
again.
The current account deficit was Pounds 12bn in 1992, compared with Pounds 6
1/2 bn in 1991. The visible trade deficit rose to Pounds 14bn, as a result
of an adverse movement in trade volumes, with import volumes rising twice as
fast as exports. However, exports were rising more strongly than imports
towards the end of the year. Although the terms of trade deteriorated
sharply in the fourth quarter of 1992 following sterling's depreciation,
they were  1/2 per cent better in 1992 as a whole than in 1991.
In 1991 the invisibles surplus benefited from contributions from abroad
towards the UK's Gulf War costs and from exceptionally low net transfers to
the EC. It is not surprising therefore that the surplus fell in 1992. But at
Pounds 2bn it was much lower than anticipated in last year's Budget
forecast: estimates both of the level of the surplus in 1991 and of the UK's
net stock of overseas assets have been revised down since then.
LABOUR COSTS
Manufacturing unit labour costs were unchanged in the fourth quarter of 1992
compared with a year earlier as earnings growth continued to slow and
productivity growth picked up. By contrast, competitors' unit labour costs
probably grew by 3 1/4 per cent. This underlying improvement in
competitiveness is likely to continue in 1993, with UK unit labour costs set
to fall while competitor countries' costs continue to rise. The gap between
UK and overseas unit labour cost growth is forecast to improve
competitiveness on its own by about 4 per cent in 1993.
The lower exchange rate compared with most of last year will enhance this
underlying improvement, so that actual cost competitiveness may be about 20
per cent better in mid-1993 than a year earlier. Price competitiveness is
also forecast to improve in 1993, but not by as much as cost competitiveness
because exporters are likely to rebuild their profit margins.
Non-oil export volumes were on an upward trend during 1992 reaching record
levels in the fourth quarter. They rose 2 1/2 per cent in the year as a
whole. The growth of world trade in manufactured goods (which account for
around 90 per cent of UK non-oil exports) is expected to be similar in 1993
to 1992, although the growth in UK export markets is forecast to fall from 4
1/2 per cent to 3 3/4 per cent. But better competitiveness means that
exports should grow faster than this in 1993, although there is a good deal
of uncertainty about the speed with which improved competitiveness will
affect export volumes.
Manufactured exports could rise by 7 1/2 per cent in 1993, over 3 per cent
faster than world trade and twice as fast as UK export market growth.
Exports should continue to benefit from the improved competitiveness beyond
1993 with further increases in the UK's share of world trade. Exports of all
goods are forecast to rise 6 1/2 per cent in 1993 and just over 10 per cent
in the year to the first half of 1994.
While import growth outstripped demand growth last year, the rise in import
penetration was not out of line with its long-term trend. The specialisation
of world production has led to a rise in import penetration in the UK as in
other countries. The counterpart of rising import penetration due to
increased specialisation is faster growth of world trade than world
activity, and with it the faster growth of UK exports than GDP. A further
rise in import penetration is to be expected in 1993, though the
improvements to competitiveness, which benefit firms competing with imports
just as much as exporters, should keep it down. The volume of imports of
goods is expected to rise by 5 1/2 per cent in 1993, a little less than in
1992 despite stronger domestic demand.
Normally after a large fall in the exchange rate import prices rise faster
than export prices, and this is evident in the monthly figures available
since ERM suspension. The resulting terms of trade loss, expected to be
nearly 5 per cent for non-oil goods comparing 1993 with the whole of 1992,
has a significant adverse effect on the visible trade deficit, more than
accounting for the deterioration in 1993.
However, in large part it arises because UK exporters hold back from raising
their prices in the interest of selling more to their customers. The higher
volumes that result will work to offset the adverse terms of trade effect,
but will take some time to come through. Similarly improved competitiveness
will tend to reduce import volumes, further offsetting the terms of trade
loss. As export prices catch up, there is the prospect of some improvement
in the terms of trade in the first half of 1994.
IMPORTS
Oil and gas production rose 3 1/4 per cent in 1992. It is expected to rise
by 6 per cent in 1993 as new fields begin production and as output resumes
from those fields affected by the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988. Output is
expected to be near the centre of the DTI's Brown Book range, which shows a
further sharp increase in 1994. Net oil exports are expected to rise in 1993
with export volumes over 3 per cent higher and import volumes  1/2 per cent
higher than in 1992. The oil surplus is expected to rise to nearly Pounds
2bn in 1993.
The surplus on interest, profits and dividends (IPD) rose from Pounds 1/2 bn
in 1991 to Pounds 3bn in 1992. However, several exceptional factors account
for much of this turnround: IPD was depressed in 1991 because of Gulf War
effects on oil companies' profits; and during 1992 there were exceptional
currency market earnings associated with the turmoil in September.
Continuing current account deficits will reduce the UK's net stock of
overseas as sets and therefore the IPD balance over the years ahead.
Against this, the lower exchange rate will raise the sterling value of
foreign currency assets and receipts. The UK's net stock of overseas assets
is estimated to have fallen from Pounds 11bn at the end of 1991 to near zero
in the middle of 1992. By the end of the year it had risen to Pounds 37bn,
as exchange rate revaluations more than offset the effect of the current
account deficit.
Like goods, the services balance will benefit from the improved
competitiveness, though adverse terms of trade effects may dominate in 1993.
The volumes of both exports and imports are forecast to rise quite strongly
during 1993, exports more so than imports. But because they start from
rather depressed levels in the second half of 1992, growth between 1992 and
1993 as a whole is quite modest, 1 per cent for exports and  1/2 per cent
for imports. The balance of transfers is expected to change little between
1992 and 1993. Overall, the surplus on invisibles might be Pounds 3 1/2 bn
in 1993, up from Pounds 2bn in 1992.
The current account deficit is expected to rise to Pounds 17 1/2 bn in 1993
, with the recovery in the invisibles surplus more than offset by the
increase in the visibles deficit. Although the forecast is above the average
of the Independent Panel's forecasts, five of the seven panel members expect
the deficit to be in the range Pounds 16 1/2 bn to Pounds 20bn.
The weakness of demand has kept strong downward pressure on inflation,
despite the lower exchange rate. Underlying inflation, as measured by the
RPI excluding mortgage interest payments (MIPs), was 3.2 per cent in January
 -down 2 1/2 percentage points since April 1992. As yet, with the exception
of petrol prices, there is little obvious sign of inflationary pressures at
the retail level as a result of sterling's depreciation. Since last
September retail goods price inflation has continued to fall somewhat faster
than retail services price inflation. All-items RPI inflation has fallen
more rapidly than the underlying rate in recent months, and to a
significantly lower level, reflecting the effect of mortgage rate
reductions. The all-items rate in January was 1.7 per cent, the lowest rate
since September 1967.
Producer output price inflation, excluding food, drink and tobacco, was a
little higher in January and February, at 2.7 per cent, than the low point
of 2.4 per cent reached in late 1992. This perhaps reflects the beginnings
of the impact of the lower exchange rate on output prices. But producer
output price inflation remains low by historical standards: 1992 apart, the
rate was last below 2.7 per cent in May 1969. Producer input prices, on the
other hand, have clearly been affected by the lower exchange rate, albeit
somewhat less than expected, with the index 8 1/4 per cent higher in
February than last August. Even so the pressure on producers' profit margins
has been eased by the sharp decline in unit wage cost growth: in the fourth
quarter of 1992 unit wage costs in manufacturing were unchanged on a year
earlier.
NEW GROUND
Whole economy underlying earnings growth has continued to break new ground
by the standards of the past 25 years. In December it fell to 4 3/4 per
cent, having fallen sharply since showing signs of stickiness at around 7
1/2 per cent early in 1992. And under the influence of falling inflation,
weak demand for labour, and financial pressures on companies, pay
settlements have clearly resumed a downward path since last summer. CBI data
point to recent settlements in both manufacturing and services falling to an
average of under 3 per cent, compared with around 5 per cent a year or so
earlier.
Low headline inflation and a slack labour market indicate that earnings
growth may continue to fall for some time yet, though a recovery in profits
may progressively exert some upward pressure on earnings. With subdued
earnings growth and further gains in productivity growth, unit labour costs
are forecast to increase only marginally in 1993 in the private sector, and
to fall in manufacturing.
Manufacturers' input price inflation is expected to pick up further during
much of 1993, largely reflecting higher import costs as a result of the
lower exchange rate. Manufacturers are also likely to take advantage of
increased demand partly by rebuilding their profit margins. These factors
are expected slightly to outweigh the effects of lower unit labour costs on
producer output prices. The net result is that producer output price
inflation is forecast to rise to 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993,
before falling back to 3 1/2 per cent in the second quarter of 1994 as
import price inflation recedes.
However, underlying RPI inflation is not expected to rise as much from its
current level. Although retail goods price inflation is likely to pick up as
the effects of the lower exchange rate feed through, services price
inflation, which typically responds more slowly to changes in economic
activity, should continue to come down. Underlying RPI inflation is forecast
to be 3 3/4 per cent in both the fourth quarter of 1993 and the second
quarter of 1994.
This includes the effects of the measures announced in the Budget. Compared
with the Autumn Statement forecast, which allowed for increased motoring
taxes to recoup the cost of abolishing car tax, the Budget is expected
directly to add around  1/4 per cent to the level of the RPI excluding MIPs
in 1993, and a further  1/2 per cent by the second quarter of 1994. For the
fourth quarter of 1993 the Treasury forecast is just below the average of
forecasts made by the Independent Panel. However, three members of the panel
have forecasts at or below 3 1/2 per cent.
For given underlying inflation, the all-items RPI inflation rate will depend
on what happens to mortgage rates. The forecast of underlying inflation
implies that if mortgage rates remained unchanged from present levels,
all-items RPI inflation would be 2 1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter of
1993. A one percentage point change in mortgage rates changes the level of
the all-items RPI by just over  1/2 per cent, other things being equal.
The relatively flat profile of the forecast for underlying inflation
contrasts with the path forecast for the GDP deflator, which measures the
price of domestic value added (principally unit labour costs and profits per
unit of output). The GDP deflator is now expected to rise by 3 1/2 per cent
in 1992-93. But in 1993-94 it is forecast to rise by only 2 3/4 per cent,
partly reflecting the effect of the lower exchange rate on the terms of
trade. It is also held down by low public sector pay growth as a result of
the limit on settlements announced in the Autumn Statement.
STERLING
Sterling was suspended from the ERM on September 16 last year. Since then,
it has traded at an average level of DM2.44, or 15 per cent below its
average level during 1992 prior to suspension. Against a basket of
currencies, it has averaged 13 per cent lower, with the sterling index
within the range 76 to 82 1/2 since mid-October.
Base rates, at 6 per cent, are four percentage points lower than before
sterling's membership of the ERM was suspended, and UK short-term interest
rates are the lowest in the EC. They were 10 1/2 per cent one year ago.
Mortgage rates have come down by less, to just under 8 per cent compared
with 11 1/2 per cent at the beginning of last year. At current levels they
are the lowest since the early 1970s.
Long-term interest rates have continued to fall. Ten-year yields averaged 8
per cent in February, over 1 per cent below their level a year earlier, and
nearly 4 per cent lower than their average 1990 level. Since ERM suspension,
the yield gap has switched over, with short rates below long rates for the
first time since 1988.
Equity prices were depressed in the run-up to the currency turbulence in
September, but have since recovered strongly. In February they were 24 per
cent above their average level in August. Dividend yields have fallen
correspondingly, though they remain close to average levels in the
mid-1980s. Commercial property rentals and residential house prices remain
depressed. Although house prices in February were 7 1/4 per cent below their
level a year earlier (on the Halifax measure) they have fallen only 1 per
cent in the last four months.
Annual growth of M0 was between 1 1/2 per cent and 3 per cent throughout
1992, comfortably within its 0 per cent to 4 per cent target range. Towards
the end of the year, however, M0's shorter term growth rates increased
strongly, and its 12-month growth rate exceeded 4 per cent in February. M0's
relatively strong growth - and its correspondingly low velocity growth - may
be a consequence of the falls in interest rates during the year, which
reduce the incentive to economise on cash. M4 growth, in contrast to M0, has
continued to fall. It was 3.2 per cent in January, below the monitoring
range of 4 per cent to 8 per cent announced in the Autumn Statement.
CREDIT
The growth of M4 lending - bank and building society lending to the private
sector - has, like M4, continued to decline over the past year. M4 lending's
annual growth was 4.2 per cent in January. Personal sector borrowing has
been depressed by weak activity in the housing market and the desire to
reduce debt. Lending to industrial and commercial companies has been
similarly depressed, growing by less than 1 per cent in each of the past two
years.
The accompanying table compares the main elements of the forecast published
in the 1992 FSBR with the outturns for 1992 or the latest estimates for
1992-93. GDP fell unexpectedly in 1992. Domestic demand and exports were
weaker than forecast although the errors here were no bigger than the
averages from past forecasts. But imports were stronger than projected,
largely due to a shift in the composition of demand towards manufactures.
This was also reflected in a larger current account deficit than forecast.
The counterpart of weaker than anticipated activity has been faster progress
on inflation. And the public sector borrowing requirement is likely to be
well above last year's FSBR forecast.
All forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties. Recent Treasury
forecasts have emphasised that these are most acute when the economy is at
or close to a turning point, and that remains true on this occasion. The
recent movements in the exchange rate have added to the uncertainty. The
forecast is based on the conventional assumption that the exchange rate
remains close to recent levels. The forecasts presented here are central
forecasts, a balance of upside and downside risks. The accompanying table
shows average errors from past FSBR forecasts.

<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, rose to deliver his
Budget speech at 3.31pm, and completed it at 5.22pm, a duration of 1 hour
and 51 minutes. He said:
'Mr Deputy Speaker, in my Budget last year I announced a far-reaching reform
that was supported, I believe, on all sides of the House. From November this
year, public expenditure and taxation will be brought together in one annual
Budget statement.
The advantages of the new system are clear.
Ensuring that tax and spending decisions are taken at the same time will
allow better control over government borrowing.
Indeed that is the main purpose of the change. And with tax, spending and
borrowing decisions presented in a single statement the relationship between
them will be much easier to understand.
But for now our existing, and to me rather antiquated, procedures remain in
place. And I shall, therefore, concentrate today largely on the tax side of
the accounts. My Budget should nonetheless be considered alongside the
Autumn Statement I delivered just four months ago.
In that statement I set a firm limit on public sector wage increases. This
was essential and we shall stick to it. And I established tight overall
spending ceilings for the next three years. But I also gave priority to
programmes that would help to promote growth and the long-term performance
of the economy. In this way, the Autumn Statement played a key role in
putting Britain on course for recovery.
My Budget today is designed to ensure that this recovery will be sustained.
Above all, this Budget has two objectives: first, to support the recovery in
the year ahead; and second, to set out a clear medium-term strategy for
bringing the borrowing requirement back towards balance.
The Financial Statement and Budget Report, together with a number of press
releases filling out the details of my proposals, will be available from the
Vote Office as soon as I have sat down.
Mr Deputy Speaker, it is impossible to review the short-term prospects for
the British economy without first considering what is happening in the world
outside. Many people talk as if Britain's economic problems were unique, as
if we can somehow insulate ourselves from the economic tides that sweep
across the world. The truth, of course, is quite different. As an open
economy which exports a third of its output, developments abroad have a
profound impact on Britain.
The one ray of light on the world scene has been the recovery in North
America and particularly in the United States. The US economy grew by over 2
per cent last year, with growth in the final quarter revised up to an annual
rate of 4 3/4 per cent.
But the success of the United States stands in marked contrast to
developments elsewhere.
Industrial production has been falling in many of the world's largest
economies - over the last year it has fallen 2 per cent in Italy; by 2 1/2
per cent in France; by 6 1/2 per cent in Germany; and by 7 per cent in
Japan. By contrast, in Britain industrial production has actually risen.
And the recent indicators of GDP confirm this gloomy world picture. Even
Japan has now been visited by the prospect of recession, with GDP declining
by  3/4 per cent in the second half of 1992. France and Italy have also had
to cope with falling output.
And Germany, still struggling with the costs of re-unification, has now
suffered three successive quarters of declining GDP.
It was against this background that the prime minister and I secured
agreement at the Edinburgh Council last December to a European Growth
Initiative.
This was closely modelled on my own Autumn Statement, and was designed to
deal with the most serious problem facing the European Community - the
seemingly inexorable rise in unemployment across the continent.
Last year unemployment in the Community rose by 1 1/4 m and it is projected
to rise further this year to some 11 per cent of the work force. France,
like Britain, has 3m unemployed; in Ireland and Spain more than 1-in-6 are
out of work. Even in western Germany, unemployment is rising once again.
To a large extent this pattern reflects the impact of recession.
But particularly in the European Community, the recent rise in unemployment
comes on top of a relentless upward trend. In the Community as a whole
unemployment rose in every single year from 1973 to 1985; and though it fell
back in the boom of the late 1980s, it has stayed at well over twice the
level of 20 years ago.
Unemployment in Europe is much higher than in many other parts of the world;
and it cannot be reduced simply by stimulating demand. A deep-seated problem
needs more fundamental solutions. It requires more flexible markets, not
just for labour but also for goods and services. And it requires support
given by governments to be directed less at propping up declining
industries; and more at helping the unemployed to rejoin the workforce.
Above all, Mr Deputy Speaker, if we are to secure a lasting reduction in
unemployment over the years ahead, we must continue to resist the imposition
of job-destroying measures emanating from Brussels.
The high cost economies of the European Community cannot insulate themselves
from the world outside - from the more flexible economies of the Pacific Rim
and North America.
Nothing would do more damage to job prospects, not just in Britain, but
across Europe, than the imposition of further tax or regulatory burdens on
employers. That is why this government will never sign the social chapter.
UK ECONOMY
Mr Deputy Speaker, while activity has been falling in many parts of the
world, GDP in Britain rose slightly in the second half of last year.
And with interest rates down by 4 percentage points in just 6 months,
Britain enters the year ahead in a more favourable position than most of our
major competitors. That is confirmed by the European Commission, which
expects Britain to be the fastest growing of all the major European
economies both this year and next.
The substantial interest rate cuts I have made provide a solid foundation
for recovery this year. And they come alongside the measures in my Autumn
Statement to revive business confidence. We are already beginning to see
their effects.
Lower interest rates have contributed to a pick up in the growth of narrow
money, while retail sales have been on a steady upward trend for almost a
year.
The abolition of car tax has prompted a surge in activity in the motor
trade, right at the heart of British manufacturing. New car registrations
were nearly 16 per cent higher in the latest three months than a year
earlier.
By the end of this month the additional money I provided in the Autumn
Statement will have taken about 20,000 properties off the housing market.
Although house prices remain weak, building society commitments and advances
are stronger and both housebuilders and estate agents are now reporting
increased activity.
The extra support I announced for British exporters will reinforce the
competitiveness of our companies trading overseas, while exports in the last
three months of 1992 were already at record levels.
And the temporary increase I announced in capital allowances will provide a
continuing boost to business investment over the next six months. According
to the CBI, manufacturers are more optimistic now than at any time for
almost five years.
The recovery we have seen in confidence rests, above all, on one crucial
foundation - the dramatic progress we have made in reducing inflation.
There has been much debate about Britain's experience with the ERM. Today I
wish to make just two observations.
First, it was absolutely vital to get inflation in this country down. The
two years we spent in the ERM were tough. But the war against inflation was
one we had to fight and one we had to win.
Second, once sterling left the ERM, and with inflation sharply down, we were
right to take the opportunity that gave us to relax policy and get interest
rates down.
Inflation is now at its lowest level for over 25 years. The rapid fall in
the headline rate is, of course, partly the result of the reduction in
mortgage rates. But even more significant is the fall in underlying
inflation - down in the last year from 5 1/2 per cent to 3 1/4 per cent.
Except for a few months in 1986, after the collapse in the oil price,
underlying inflation has not been this low since February 1968.
Mr Deputy Speaker, in my Mansion House speech I announced the establishment
of the Panel of Independent Forecasters. My intention in doing so was to
demonstrate more clearly that the judgments the government has to make are
not based on one single forecast.
I have now received the Panel's first report and I am most grateful for
their contribution. The Panel recognise that the substantial relaxation of
monetary policy has greatly improved the prospects for recovery in 1993.
Their forecasts for growth this year vary between  1/4 and 2 per cent, with
an average of just over 1 per cent.
SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS
The Treasury forecast is very similar. Broadly in line with the average of
the Panel's forecasts, we expect GDP to grow by 1 1/4 per cent this year,
with the recovery gathering pace through the year. Growth in the year to the
second half of 1993 might reach 1 3/4 per cent, rising to 3 per cent in the
first half of 1994.
But, as the Panel stress, uncertainties remain. It is possible that growth
this year may exceed the 1 1/4 per cent forecast that I have made.
But there are significant downside risks too. It is very difficult to be
sure when consumers will feel that their finances are sound enough to
support a stronger growth of spending. And there are, as I have said,
considerable doubts about the prospects for our major export markets.
This will inevitably affect the prospects for the current account. The
deficit in 1992 was about Pounds 12bn. And as the economy recovers and the
unfavourable short-term effects of the fall in the exchange rate feed
through, I expect the deficit to widen this year to Pounds 17.5bn. But the
measures I shall be putting in place today should help to strengthen our
trade position over the years ahead; and I expect the deficit in the
meantime to be readily financeable.
THE MEDIUM-TERM
Mr Deputy Speaker, the key to an improved trade performance lies in the
competitiveness of our products. And the signs are encouraging. Earnings are
now growing more slowly than at any time for 25 years. Labour productivity
has been rising rapidly; and while unit wage costs in manufacturing - have
been rising in Japan and Germany, here they showed no increase at all during
1992. British business now has a great opportunity to expand into overseas
markets and to replace imports at home. But costs must be kept under firm
control.
The government's task is to provide a clear and practicable framework for
policy - to ensure that business has the freedom and the support it needs to
get on with the job. Our strategy for sustained growth rests on three key
principles: first, that growth comes from the private sector, not from
Whitehall; second, that a continuing commitment to low inflation is vital if
competitiveness is to be maintained; and third, that the only way to
increase the country's long-term growth rate is by improving the supply
performance of the economy.
SUPPLY SIDE POLICY
Mr Deputy Speaker, supply side improvements are seldom the stuff of
headlines. But the policies this government has pursued have begun to
improve the way that markets work. We have transferred to private ownership
some two-thirds of the state sector we inherited; and our labour market
reforms have given back to management the power to manage, so that last year
the number of days lost to strikes was the lowest for a century.
But we still have a long agenda of unfinished business.
In my Autumn Statement I set out proposals to increase the role of the
private sector in modernising Britain's infrastructure. And I also announced
additional resources to underpin the education reforms we have set in train.
The wealth of a nation depends largely upon the skills of its people; and
nothing could be more important for the long-term performance of the British
economy than the steady improvement in education and skills that this
government is committed to bring about.
INFLATION AND MONETARY POLICY
But if long-term improvements in economic performance are determined largely
by the supply side, we have seen all too often in the past 20 years how
short-term prospects can be blown off course by inflation. I am absolutely
determined that this should not happen again.
The government's objective is to keep the underlying rate of retail price
inflation within the range of 1-4 per cent and to bring it down to the lower
half of that range by the end of this parliament. I expect underlying
inflation to be 3 3/4 per cent at the end of this year, close to the top of
its target range. But inflation should fall further over the medium-term.
Monetary policy is set to meet that objective.
The detailed framework for monetary policy was set out in my letter to the
Treasury and Civil Service select committee last Autumn. And since then I
have introduced two further developments to demonstrate our determination to
conduct monetary policy in a way that will deliver our inflation target. We
now publish a Monthly Monetary Report which shows the information that
guides our decisions. And I have also asked the Bank of England to provide
regular reports on our progress towards meeting our inflation objective.
Interest rate decisions are based on a continuing assessment of monetary
conditions, measured principally by the growth of narrow and broad money,
and movements in the exchange rate and asset prices. And alongside the
target for inflation, I am setting monitoring ranges for both the narrow and
broad measures of the money supply; for the period of this Parliament the
ranges are 0-4 per cent for M0 and 3-9 per cent for M4.
In judging the prospects for inflation, I have to weigh the evidence from
all the indicators, taken together. If any one is out of line, it is
particularly important to assess its significance against the performance of
the others.
Following the recent substantial reduction in interest rates M0 growth may
be above its monitoring range in the period ahead. But on the basis of the
indicators taken together I believe that interest rates at their current
level are consistent with the achievement of the government's inflation
objectives. And at the lowest level in the European Community, they are also
fully consistent with the prospects for recovery this year.
I turn now to funding, a subject of peculiar fascination for many City
commentators and of particular interest to a number of my Rt Hon and Hon
friends.
The government's full fund policy ensures that its borrowing does not add to
inflationary pressures. I am clear that this policy remains appropriate.
But from time to time it has been right to reconsider its detailed
application. I have therefore decided that transactions by banks and
building societies in gilts will, from now on, be included in the funding
definition. In periods when banks and building societies reduce their
holdings of gilts extra sales to other sectors will be needed. But in
current conditions the change I am making will help to ease the pressures on
liquidity and avoid complicating money market arrangements. If it also leads
to some strengthening in the growth of M4 that would be no bad thing.
In the year ahead sales of gilts will as usual form the bedrock of the
funding programme. But National Savings will again make an important
contribution.
FISCAL POLICY
Mr Deputy Speaker, in controlling inflation, monetary policy must of course
be supported by a sustainable fiscal policy.
I expect a PSBR in the current financial year of Pounds 35bn, slightly lower
than projected at the time of my Autumn Statement. But because unemployment
tends to increase for a while even after growth has resumed and because some
taxes, particularly corporation tax, are collected a year in arrears, I
expect borrowing next year to rise further. The PSBR for 1993-94 has
therefore been set at Pounds 50bn, some 8 per cent of GDP.
Unless action is taken, large deficits will continue over the medium-term.
The PSBR could still be around 6 per cent of GDP in 1996-97, the last year
of this parliament. I do not believe that borrowing on that scale is
acceptable and I shall be announcing measures today to reduce it
progressively over the years ahead.
In the early 1980s we took steps to bring the public finances back under
control. We turned a PSBR of over 5 per cent of GDP into a surplus of 3 per
cent. And we nearly halved the ratio of public sector debt to GDP. We did
not shrink from making the necessary changes then and I will not shrink from
making them today.
The rise in the PSBR since 1989-90 is largely due to the recession. And
because of the reduction in the national debt in the 1980s, I have been able
to allow the so-called 'automatic stabilisers' - the increases in public
spending and the reduction in tax receipts that directly reflect the
weakness of the economy - to operate fully. It was right to do this to
maintain the level of demand during the recession. But just as a business
cannot go on year after year ignoring a fall in cashflow caused by a
downturn in the economy; so too the government cannot keep on running up
debt in the hope that recovery will solve our problems.
Even if the higher debt we now face was largely caused by the recession, the
extra borrowing still has to be financed. And as debt mounts up, so too do
the debt interest payments. In this way what might have started off as a
cyclical deficit will soon become a structural deficit unless action is
taken to bring borrowing down.
All round the world we see countries striving to reduce their fiscal
deficits or suffering from their failure to do so sooner. President
Clinton's programme shows that the need for fiscal discipline is now widely
understood. And the deficit which the Italians are now having to deal with
is a salutary warning to those who think that a problem postponed is a
problem solved.
Those who argue that there is no need for action should confront the
consequences of such a course, the consequences not just for the public
finances but also for the level of interest rates.
For all these reasons I believe that the greatest threat to sustained
recovery in Britain would come not from a lack of demand, but from excessive
government borrowing over the medium-term. We have to address that problem
now.
Action to bring the fiscal deficit down clearly has to start with the amount
the government spends. The new control arrangements I put in place last year
were an important first step; and we now have firm ceilings for expenditure
over the next three years that will keep the growth of spending below that
of the economy as a whole.
But proper control of public expenditure cannot be achieved simply by
setting targets. It requires a continuous examination of each and every
department and of all the functions of government. What was once a desirable
role for the public sector may no longer be appropriate today. And that is
why the fundamental reviews of public spending programmes are so important.
These reviews will inevitably take time; so I have also had to look to the
revenue side of the account.
In doing so I have had to balance two key objectives. First, the essential
task of helping recovery. Second, the need to tackle the deficit so that the
recovery will be sustained.
I believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, that my proposals strike that balance. In the
year ahead, 1993-94, their effect will be broadly neutral, thus allowing the
recovery to take hold. And I will be announcing later some measures to
improve that prospect by helping business and the unemployed.
But for subsequent years, as the economy strengthens, my proposals are
designed to build in a wedge of steadily rising revenue.
Overall they will raise revenue by Pounds 6.5bn in 1994-95 and by Pounds
10.5bn in 1995-96, equivalent to 1 1/2 per cent of GDP.
In setting out the government's plans for raising revenue, good intentions
are not enough. I intend that as far as possible these proposals should be
legislated for in this year's Finance Bill.
Taken together with the tight public expenditure plans I announced in the
Autumn Statement, they should ensure that the PSBR returns towards balance
over the medium-term. But if further action proves necessary I shall not
hesitate to take it.
TAXATION OBJECTIVES
Mr Deputy Speaker, the proposals I shall be announcing today are part of a
continuing programme of tax reform. A programme which has sharpened work
incentives and improved the efficiency of the economy.
In deciding where to look for additional revenue, I have been guided by a
number of principles.
First, that where possible money should be raised in a way that will not
damage the working of the economy.
Second, that in general this means reducing the value of allowances and
broadening the tax base rather than increasing marginal tax rates.
And third, that taxation should support social, health and environmental
objectives.
I will deal with my revenue raising proposals in two parts. I will start
with my proposals for the year ahead, 1993-94; and then describe the
measures I propose for the two years thereafter.
For the year immediately ahead, as I have said, my proposals are broadly
neutral. My objective has been to strengthen the recovery by giving help to
business. But in order to pay for this, I have had to raise revenue from
other sectors of the economy.
ALLOWANCES
First, income tax. With inflation now down to levels not seen for a
generation, I propose for the year ahead to freeze the personal allowances,
the married couple's and related allowances, the basic rate limit and the
income limit for age-related allowances.
Unleaded petrol increases by 12p per gallon VAT to be introduced on domestic
fuel and power Warning: Head depths do not match The threshold for
inheritance tax, the capital gains tax exempt amount and the earnings limit
for tax relief on pension contributions will also remain unchanged. This
will save some Pounds 670m this year.
EXCISE DUTIES SECOND, EXCISE DUTIES.
The removal of customs controls at the Channel has been welcomed by many
thousands of travellers who are now seeing the benefits of the single market
at first hand. And, it has also brought many benefits to British business,
including some 10m fewer forms this year.
But there is natural concern too about the impact an increase in
cross-border shopping might have on British businesses, particularly in the
south-east.
In considering what changes to make to excise duties I have had to balance
this against the need to raise revenue. I have therefore decided to raise
the duties on most alcoholic drinks by only 5 per cent this year. From 6.00
pm today, the total tax on a pint of beer will rise by about one and a half
pence and that on a bottle of wine by about five and a half pence.
I have also received many representations this year about the taxation of
spirits, and in particular, the taxation on whisky. This is one of Britain's
most successful exporting industries. I promised in my Budget speech last
year to resist proposals from Brussels to introduce tax rules which would
hit whisky sales in European markets. But having succeeded there, it is
important that our own tax regime does not further disadvantage this
industry. I have therefore decided to make no change in the duty on spirits
this year. I am sure this will be welcomed on all sides of the House and
especially in Scotland.
Next, tobacco. Last July, my Rt Hon friend the Secretary of State for Health
published a white paper containing our commitment to maintain the real value
of the taxation on tobacco products. But again I have also had to take into
account the impact of the single market. I propose therefore to increase the
overall burden of duty by some 6 1/2 per cent, 4 per cent above the rate of
inflation. This will add 10 pence to a typical pack of 20 cigarettes - and,
I regret to say, some 4 1/2 pence to a pack of 5 small cigars.
But I also propose to make this increase in a different way from usual. As
the House will recall, cigarettes are subject to two different excise
duties: a 'specific' duty, which is a flat rate charge per cigarette, and an
'ad valorem' duty, on their price. Given that the health objective is to tax
the harm cigarettes do, it is better to tax the cigarettes themselves rather
than their price. I therefore propose to increase the specific duty on
cigarettes by 10 per cent, while cutting the ad valorem duty from 21 per
cent to 20 per cent. This will mean a proportionately bigger tax increase
for cheap cigarettes many of which are imported.
I also propose this year to increase the duty on most gaming machines by 20
per cent.
Taken together, these changes will raise Pounds 290m in 1993-94 and Pounds
365m in 1994-95.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I turn now to motoring taxes, where I propose to combine
raising revenue with tax reform.
When I abolished car tax in my Autumn Statement, I said that I would recoup
the cost from other motoring taxes.
I therefore propose to raise all fuel duties by 10 per cent from 6.00 pm
today putting 12 pence on a gallon of unleaded petrol and 15 pence on a
gallon of four-star. From midnight tonight, vehicle excise duty for cars -
the tax disc - will also rise, by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125.
Taken together with the abolition of car tax these measures will raise a net
Pounds 400m in 1993-94.
The overall impact will be to shift the tax burden from car buyers to car
users; and to help both the environment and the industry. Together with the
increases I have announced on alcohol and tobacco duties, it will add  1/4
percentage point to the RPI in April, compared with indexation.
FUEL SCALES
Alongside the increase in fuel duties, I propose to increase by 20 per cent
the scale charges for free fuel supplied to company car drivers for private
use. I also propose to abolish the 50 per cent discount currently available
to drivers doing more than 18,000 business miles in a year.
Employees can, of course, avoid this tax altogether by paying for the full
cost of all fuel provided for private journeys themselves. The environmental
impact of my proposals on fuel duties will be strengthened by reducing the
number of motorists who use fuel at no direct cost to themselves. This
measure will raise Pounds 65m in the year ahead and Pounds 70m in 1994-95.
COMPANY CARS AND VANS
I turn next to the tax treatment of company cars.
From its introduction in 1976 until 1988, the income tax charge on company
cars significantly underestimated their true value. Since then charges have
been steadily raised to more appropriate levels. I propose this year to
complete that process by bringing the car scales up to a level which fully
reflects the true value of the benefit of a company car. This requires an
increase in the car scales of 8 per cent, bringing additional revenue of
Pounds 100m in 1993-94.
But, as I said last year, the structure of the current regime remains
unsatisfactory. In most cases the value put on the benefit, and the tax that
is payable, are determined not by the price of the car, but by the size of
its engine. This might have mattered less when scale charges were very low,
but it now gives rise to serious distortions.
Following consultation with the industry, I propose from 1994-95 to replace
the current car scales with a simple system based on the price of the car.
The annual benefit of a company car will be valued for income tax purposes
at a fixed percentage of the manufacturer's list price. To make the reform
revenue neutral, I propose to set that percentage at 35 per cent. Company
car users will then pay income tax at their marginal rate on that amount.
However, I do not believe that it would be right to apply the full rigour of
the charge to those who use the company car largely for business purposes. I
therefore propose that there should be a discount of one-third for those
company car users who drive more than 2,500 miles a year on business, and a
discount of two-thirds for those who do more than 18,000 business miles.
In future, the tax on company cars will rise or fall automatically with the
price of those cars. It follows that there will no longer be any need to set
the tax charge each year in the Budget.
My reform will reduce tax distortions in the car market and enable
manufacturers and fleet managers to plan production and purchasing in a more
rational and stable system. For these reasons, I believe it will be
welcomed.
I also propose to replace the existing complex arrangements for taxing
employees' private use of company vans with a simple scale charge, covering
both the van and any fuel provided, set at the modest level of Pounds 500.
This will raise Pounds 10m in the year ahead and Pounds 35m in 1994-95.
ANTI-AVOIDANCE
In addition I intend to close a number of loopholes which have been
exploited to avoid tax.
First, from midnight last night I propose to exclude from the Business
Expansion Scheme all schemes which involve the provision of loans to BES
investors. The BES was set up to encourage investment in small business -
not to provide highly subsidised loans for top rate taxpayers.
Second, I intend to end the practice whereby group companies buy up other
companies with capital losses simply in order to set those losses against
their own capital gains.
Third, I intend to restrict the situations in which changes in company
ownership can create scope to avoid advance corporation tax.
Finally, I propose to tighten the rules for foreign companies under UK
control.
Full details of these and other measures are provided in a series of Inland
Revenue press notices being issued today.
Taken together, they should raise some Pounds 70m in 1993-94, rising to over
Pounds 480m in the following year.
TAURUS
Before leaving my proposals for 1993-94, I wish to make clear the position
on stamp duties on securities and property other than land and buildings.
Following the decision by the Stock Exchange last week to abandon Taurus,
stamp duty will remain in place at least for 1993-94, raising Pounds 1bn
during the coming year. I will review the position further in the light of
the conclusions of the Securities Settlement Task Force set up by the Bank
of England.
The measures I have proposed so far will raise Pounds 2.4bn in 1993-94, not
including stamp duty. Of this, Pounds 750m is required to finance the
abolition of car tax. I will be using a large part of the rest to reduce
taxes on business.
REVENUE MEASURES 1994-95 AND BEYOND
But before I turn to business taxes, I intend to set out my tax proposals
for 1994-95 and the years thereafter. As I have already explained, these tax
proposals will build up over the years, creating a wedge of increasing
revenue, which, as far as possible, will be legislated for in the coming
financial year.
NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS
In my Autumn Statement I took some tough decisions on current spending to
maintain capital programmes. But, to protect the poorest and most vulnerable
members of society, we also decided to uprate social security benefits in
full. That decision was warmly welcomed on all sides of the House.
But had no further action been taken the effect of that decision, combined
with the rise in unemployment, would have been to push the National
Insurance Fund into deficit. To prevent this, I introduced a new Treasury
Grant and legislation to implement this has been now taken through the
House.
This makes sense at a time when ensuring economic recovery is our priority.
But it is clearly not a fair, or reasonable basis for financing the National
Insurance Fund over the medium-term. A Treasury Grant is paid for by the
general body of taxpayers, including millions of pensioners who have already
made a full contribution to the Fund throughout their working lives.
Accordingly, my Rt Hon friend the Secretary of State for Social Security and
I propose to place the finances of the National Insurance Fund on a firmer
footing.
I do not propose to increase National Insurance Contributions in the coming
year. However, from April 1994, my Rt Hon friend and I propose to increase
the Class 1 main rate of employee National Insurance Contributions by 1 per
cent to 10 per cent and the Class 4 rate for the self-employed by 1 per cent
to 7.3 per cent. The arrangements for employees earning below the lower
Earnings Limit and the self-employed with profits below the lower Profits
Limit will be unchanged by these measures. The necessary legislation will be
brought before the House in the coming year.
Taken together, these increases will raise about Pounds 1.8bn in 1994-95 and
Pounds 2.2bn in a full year.
But, Mr Deputy Speaker, that will still leave a deficit in the National
Insurance Fund of Pounds 2.8bn in 1994-95 and a similar sum the following
year. National Insurance Contributions are, of course, paid not just by
employees and the self-employed, but also by employers. And when a deficit
of this size emerges in the Fund it is natural to look to all contributors
to make up the balance. The remaining deficit is roughly equivalent to an
increase in the employer National Insurance Contribution rate of 1.2 per
cent from 10.4 per cent to 11.6 per cent. But having reflected carefully, I
do not believe that it would be appropriate to increase the burden on
employers. I therefore propose to retain a smaller Treasury grant to make up
the continuing shortfall in the Fund.
NORTH SEA FISCAL REGIME
Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the main objectives of this Government's tax
reforms has been to eliminate tax rules which distort investment decisions.
This was the driving force, for example, behind the far-reaching reform of
the corporation tax system in 1984.
Today I wish to carry this principle through into another important sector
of the economy - the North Sea, and in particular Petroleum Revenue Tax, or
PRT.
When PRT was introduced in 1975, the North Sea oil sector looked very
different - oil prices were very high and the typical oil field was
relatively large. The purpose of the new tax was to ensure that the
Exchequer got its fair share of the large profits that were there to be made
in the North Sea, while companies were left with a reasonable return on
their investments.
But as the North Sea has developed, the PRT regime has come to look
increasingly anachronistic. As profits in many existing fields attract a
marginal tax rate of over 83 per cent, there is little incentive for
companies to keep costs under control or for additional investment in
existing fields. Moreover, as a result of the uniquely generous allowances
that are available, the Exchequer is no longer getting a fair return. In
1991-92, the PRT regime actually cost the Exchequer Pounds 200m.
As many in the oil industry recognise, this is neither reasonable nor
sustainable. The North Sea tax regime has to be placed on a clear long-term
footing. So today I intend to set out a major reform which will raise
revenue in the medium-term and give the oil industry a stable framework to
plan ahead.
I propose from 1 July this year to reduce the PRT rate on existing fields
from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. And for new fields I propose with effect
from today to abolish PRT entirely.
It follows that for new fields I also intend to scrap all the allowances
that go with the existing PRT system; including, for example, relief for
exploration and appraisal expenditure that can be set against PRT on
existing fields. But contracts entered into before today for exploration and
appraisal will continue to get relief against PRT on existing fields for the
next two years. Allowances that can be claimed within existing fields will
remain essentially unchanged.
This reform will greatly simplify the tax regime for new fields, disapplying
at a stroke some 300 pages of complex legislation. And it means that the
only tax on new oil fields in the North Sea will be corporation tax - at 33
per cent, the lowest rate of business tax in the industrialised world.
Britain will have a competitive tax regime which strikes a reasonable
balance between the interests of the industry and those of the nation as a
whole.
For, Mr Deputy Speaker, the paradox of this reform is that despite the
abolition of PRT for new fields, and the reduced rate for existing fields,
after 1993-94 it will actually raise revenue for the Exchequer. I expect the
yield in 1994-95 to be some Pounds 300m and in the following year some
Pounds 400m.
RELOCATION EXPENSES
I turn now to another area where reform is long overdue - the tax treatment
of job-related relocation expenses.
When a company asks its employees to move house, it may offer help with
relocation expenses. Usually, that involves paying for the cost of the
removals, but sometimes, if the move is to a more expensive area, the
employer will also pay allowances towards the employee's higher living
costs.
For the past 40 years we have allowed employees to receive most of this help
tax free, provided the employee has sold his existing home, a condition
which has attracted some criticism. This means that someone whose employer
gives them as much as Pounds 25,000 might pay no tax on it at all. On the
other hand, people who decide to move to find work and pay their own costs
get no help from the tax system whatsoever.
I see a case for some measure of relief where employers help meet employees'
removal expenses. However, it is difficult to find a convincing rationale
for a system of tax relief whose effect is to give the biggest subsidy to
those moving to the highest cost areas. And with these reliefs expected to
cost the Exchequer no less than Pounds 800m this year, I believe the time
has come for reform.
I am therefore asking the Inland Revenue to withdraw the present
extra-statutory concession which helps people moving to a more expensive
area. And I propose to restrict relief on removal expenses to payments of up
to Pounds 8,000 for people whose employers require them to relocate after 6
April this year. Under the new system, the existing home need no longer be
sold to qualify for relief.
Although these changes come into effect immediately, they will not start to
raise revenue until the year after - about Pounds 200m in both 1994-95 and
1995-96.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I turn now to mortgage interest relief. The rapid
expansion of home ownership is one of this government's most enduring
achievements; and I have no plans to change the existing ceiling for
mortgage interest relief of Pounds 30,000.
But in the last few Budgets, we have taken steps to improve the focus of
mortgage interest relief and to contain its costs, most recently in my 1991
Budget, by restricting the relief to the basic rate.
Even so, mortgage interest relief is expected to cost the Exchequer Pounds
4.3bn next year alone. I propose therefore, to reduce the rate at which
relief is given from 25 to 20 per cent. But I propose to defer the
implementation of this change until April 1994. In all, this change will
yield Pounds 900m in 1994-95 and Pounds 960m in the following year.
At current mortgage rates, no borrower will be more than Pounds 10 a month
worse off from the reduced rate of relief; and for many with mortgages below
Pounds 30,000 the increase in payments will be even smaller. Moreover, it is
the level of interest rates, not the amount of tax relief, that is the most
important determinant of the cost of a mortgage. Because interest rates have
fallen so far since October 1990, payments on the average mortgage have been
cut by over Pounds 150 a month. So the cost of the change I am proposing is
equal to just a fraction of the benefit mortgage payers have already
received from lower mortgage rates.
I know that there are some elderly people with life annuity home income
plans, which allow them to draw down some of the savings they have invested
in their houses. Such schemes will continue to attract relief at 25 per
cent.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I am fully aware that, despite some encouraging signs of
increasing activity, the housing market remains fragile. That is why the
changes I have described will not come into effect until next year. And that
is also why I have one further proposal which will affect people buying
houses. Whereas my proposals on mortgage interest relief do not apply until
April 1994, this measure comes into effect immediately. I propose to double
the stamp duty threshold to Pounds 60,000 for documents executed from today
and not stamped before 23 March when the required Budget Resolution has been
considered by this House.
This means that the cost of buying homes priced at between Pounds 30,000 and
Pounds 60,000 will be reduced, by up to Pounds 600. From today, the number
of transactions in the housing market liable to stamp duty will be halved.
This will be of particular benefit to first-time buyers, who tend to buy
less expensive homes.
With mortgage interest rates at their lowest level for decades, this
reduction in stamp duty should provide a further stimulus to the housing
market. The change will cost Pounds 220m in 1993-94 and about Pounds 270m in
the following year.
MARRIED COUPLE'S ALLOWANCE
Mr Deputy Speaker, last year I announced a significant change in the
treatment of the Married Couple's Allowance, giving couples greater
flexibility in allocating it between them. Today, I have a further important
change to propose.
At present the Married Couple's Allowance reduces a taxpayer's liability at
his or her marginal rate. A taxpayer on the 20 per cent lower rate benefits
by Pounds 344 but a higher rate taxpayer gets Pounds 688 - twice as much.
There is no good reason why an allowance intended to recognise the
responsibilities of marriage should give least to those on low incomes and
most to those right at the top of the income scale.
From 6 April 1994 I therefore propose to restrict relief for the Married
Couple's Allowance to the lower rate of 20 per cent. It will then be worth
the same amount to taxpayers at all levels of income. The allowances which
are linked to the Married Couple's Allowance for those aged under 65 will be
similarly restricted.
Because of the higher level of allowance to which they are entitled, this
change will bear harder on elderly married couples.
So also from 1994-95, I propose to increase by Pounds 200 the Married
Couple's Allowance for those aged 65 and over. This will ensure that
pensioners paying tax at the basic rate are affected in the same way as any
other basic rate taxpayer by the change. And elderly married couples in the
lower rate band will actually gain slightly.
As I have said, these changes will not come into effect until 1994-95. They
will then raise about Pounds 900m in 1994-95 and Pounds 1.2bn in 1995-96.
GREEN MEASURES
Mr Deputy Speaker, in recent years, there has been much debate on the
subject of global warming and the role tax measures can play in combating
it. This has led the European Commission to propose a Community-wide carbon
tax. There may indeed be a case for further co-ordinated international
action on global warming. But I remain unpersuaded of the need for a new
European Community tax. Tax policy should continue to be decided here in
this House - not in Brussels.
Individual countries should, of course, take their own measures to give
people the right signals to encourage the efficient use of energy. Today, I
shall propose measures designed to do just that and to raise revenue at the
same time.
Last June, my Rt Hon friend the prime minister signed the UN Convention on
Climate Change at Rio. This was a milestone in international efforts to halt
global warming.
When Britain and other countries have ratified the Convention, the
government will be committed to bring forward measures aimed at returning
greenhouse gas emissions from this country to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
My Rt Hon friend the Secretary of State for the Environment published last
December a consultation paper which set out the various options.
The largest contribution to the growth in UK carbon dioxide emissions in the
coming years is expected to come from the transport sector. I therefore
propose to make clear today the government's long term intention on road
fuel duty. We intend to raise road fuel duties on average by at least 3 per
cent a year in real terms in future Budgets, in addition to the increase I
have already announced for this year.
In deciding the level of duty to be levied in any particular Budget we will,
of course, take full account of conditions at the time, including, if
charges for motorways and urban roads are introduced, the overall level of
taxes and charges which road users are paying. But my announcement today
will help manufacturers and consumers to plan ahead. It should provide a
strong incentive for motorists to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. And it
will raise at least a further Pounds 520m in 1994-95 and Pounds 950m in
1995-96.
But, Mr Deputy Speaker, in order to meet the commitment we entered into at
Rio, action will be required not just in the transport sector, but across
the whole economy. And in deciding how best to meet our carbon emissions
target we will need to ensure that the right incentives are in place
throughout the economy - encouraging people to consume less and conserve
more. Above all, it is crucial to avoid taking measures that will have a
disproportionate impact on the competitiveness of British industry.
Against this background, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have one further measure to
propose that will not only encourage greater energy efficiency in every
household in the country; but will also raise a considerable amount of
revenue for the Exchequer over the years ahead.
Fuel and energy supplies to industry pay VAT in Britain. Those to the home
do not. In this respect, we are unique in the European Community.
I therefore propose, over the next two years, to end the zero rate of VAT on
domestic fuel and power. Again, this change will not come into effect
immediately, but in 1994. VAT will be charged at 8 per cent from 1 April
1994 and at 17 1/2 per cent from 1 April 1995.
Mr Deputy Speaker, this measure will raise some Pounds 950m in1994-95,
Pounds 2.3bn in 1995-96 and around Pounds 3bn a year thereafter. For the
first time the rate of VAT on domestic fuel and power will be the same as
that charged on goods like loft insulation material, which improve energy
efficiency. This will bring an end to the current anomaly which makes a
nonsense of any attempt to use the tax system to improve the environment. My
intention is to legislate for this proposal this year.
Mr Deputy Speaker, social security benefits will, of course, rise
automatically to reflect the price effect of this change. But I recognise
that this will cause particular problems for those on low incomes. My Rt Hon
friend, the Secretary of State for Social Security, will take this into
account when the income related benefits are uprated next year.
Together with measures which have already been announced, these tax
proposals should take Britain two-thirds of the way to meeting the Rio
target. And they will do so in a way that does the least possible damage to
the competitiveness of British industry. I am confident that the remaining
gap can be filled through sensible energy saving measures, as and when the
Convention is ratified by our major industrial competitors.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the measures I have announced so far will raise
substantial revenue in 1994-95 and beyond. I turn now to my measures for
business.
DEREGULATION
As the House is aware, the government has embarked on a major drive to
reduce the burden of regulation on industry. I will therefore start with
three significant measures of deregulation, which should be of particular
benefit to the self-employed and to small businesses generally.
Self-assessment of income tax has operated successfully in many countries,
including the United States. But none of my predecessors has found a way of
introducing it here.
For most people that has not been a problem - the PAYE system already deals
very simply with the tax affairs of some 16 million employees. But for the
8m taxpayers who have to fill in a tax return each year, the current
arrangements are very far from simple.
Following a detailed consultation exercise, I now propose to offer these
people, including 4m self-employed, the option of self-assessment.
Legislation will be brought forward in next year's Finance Bill to implement
the proposal from the earliest practicable date, which is 1996-97.
For those who choose to take it up, self-assessment should provide a
significant reduction in bureaucracy and paperwork;
and it will also bring out more clearly the link between public expenditure
and the burden this places on the individual taxpayer. A more transparent
tax system can only lead to more informed choices and debate; and I believe
that self- assessment for a third of all taxpayers will contribute to that.
But for self-assessment to work, the tax system has to be simple enough for
taxpayers themselves to be able to fill in their own tax returns. My second
reform will achieve a significant simplification, particularly for the
self-employed.
One of the least attractive features of our present tax system is that it is
simply too complicated for them to work out how much tax they owe: people
setting up in business on their own are more or less forced to employ an
accountant.
Since 1926, the self-employed, working under the so-called 'preceding year'
basis of assessment, have generally paid a tax bill based on profits they
made up to two years previously.
People with several different sources of income may be assessed on a number
of different bases, with separate tax bills and payment dates for each. It
would be difficult to invent a more complicated system for taxing the
self-employed even if one set out with that very objective.
Under my new proposals, people will have just one tax bill each year,
covering all their income. And the self-employed will pay tax on the profits
they make in the current year, not the preceding year. This should be a
major simplification; and I am sure it will be warmly welcomed.
Taken together these two measures amount to the most fundamental reform of
income tax administration since the introduction of Pay-As-You-Earn in 1944.
My third announcement will be of particular interest to smaller businesses.
At present, all incorporated businesses must have their accounts audited.
While it is clearly important that accounts should be reliable and indeed,
that the Inland Revenue and other users should have the assurance they need
that the accounts have been drawn up properly, the current statutory audit
requirement imposes a disproportionate cost on smaller businesses. My Rt Hon
friend the President of the Board of Trade will therefore shortly be issuing
a consultative document setting out options for reducing this burden, at
least for the very smallest incorporated businesses. This would deliver
significant savings and would represent a major step in cutting out red
tape.
BUSINESS TAXES
Mr Deputy Speaker, reducing the government's borrowing requirement will
benefit business by ensuring that the recovery is sustained.
But as I said in my Mansion House speech last October, the government is
determined to keep all our policies under continuous review, to ensure that
British business has the backing it needs to compete in world markets. And
this is particularly true of our tax policies.
Britain already has the lowest rate of tax on business profits in the
industrialised world and we have a personal tax system which makes it
attractive for entrepreneurs and managers to live and work in Britain. We
intend to see that continue.
Britain has had an outstanding record over recent years in attracting
investment from overseas. Indeed we have attracted no less than a third of
all foreign investment into the EC over the last few years.
But we cannot be complacent. With the advent of the single market, the
competition in Europe to secure inward investment has become ever more
intense. So my Budget sets out to ensure that our business tax regime
retains its clear competitive edge.
SURPLUS ACT AND THE TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS
In talking to business organisations over the last few months, one issue has
come up again and again - the problem of surplus Advance Corporation Tax, or
ACT. Many believe that this feature of our tax system both penalises
successful British-owned international companies and distorts investment
decisions.
This issue has of course been with us for many years, and it has so far
defied solution. Nonetheless, I made a commitment in my Budget last year to
return to it; and I am pleased to be able to report to the House that I have
now found a way forward.
I hope that the House will bear with me, as I am afraid that my proposals
are complex. But they do attack the problem of surplus ACT, they are central
to the strategy of this Budget, and they raise a significant amount of
revenue.
At present, ACT is paid on dividends at 25 per cent. This funds a tax credit
which covers the basic rate income tax bill of the shareholder. But as its
name implies, it is also an advance payment of the company's corporation tax
bill.
In normal circumstances, the system works very well. But sometimes it does
bring problems, particularly for companies which earn a large proportion of
their profits overseas. These companies often end up paying an ACT bill on
their dividends that is greater than their entire UK corporation tax
liability. The so-called 'surplus ACT' that results cannot be claimed back -
in effect, it becomes an extra tax on profits.
And this can have damaging economic effects. For example, it gives some
companies a strong incentive to move important activities, including
research and development, abroad, leading to the loss of skills and jobs in
the UK. It cannot be right to distort the commercial decisions of British
companies in this way or to give them an incentive to move elsewhere in
Europe.
So today I am putting forward some proposals that will go a long way towards
alleviating the problem.
First, I shall establish a special tax regime from 1994-95 to help
foreign-owned international companies which are considering setting up their
headquarters in the UK. This will make it more attractive for international
companies to base their operations in Britain. And it will further promote
London's position as Europe's leading financial centre.
Second, I am today issuing a consultation document proposing a scheme under
which British companies may choose to class any dividend paid out of
overseas profits as a 'Foreign Income Dividend'. Unlike normal UK dividends,
this will not carry any tax credit and although ACT would initially be
payable in the usual way, the company will be entitled to a refund if it
gives rise to surplus ACT. Once fully operational, this scheme could reduce
the build-up of surplus ACT by some Pounds 250m a year.
Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have one further proposal which will help not
just companies with surplus ACT, but all dividend paying companies; and it
will do so in a way that will also raise considerable revenue. I propose
simply to reduce the rate of ACT in two stages, from 25 per cent to 22 1/2
per cent in 1993-94 and then to 20 per cent in 1994-95.
Reduction of 7 1/2 % in ECGD premiums Loan guarantee scheme premium to small
businesses falls Warning: Head depths do not match This will give companies
which pay dividends a cash flow benefit of about Pounds 2bn over the next
two years. And it will reduce the build-up of surplus ACT by about Pounds
300m a year.
I also propose to reduce from 25 per cent to 20 per cent in 1993-94 the tax
credit that shareholders get when they receive a dividend.
Those familiar with these issues - a select few, I fear - will know that tax
credits affect two main groups of shareholders. Those with no tax liability,
particularly pension funds, can claim a cash payment from the Inland Revenue
for the tax credit. And higher rate taxpayers have to make up the difference
between the 40 per cent top rate of tax and the 25 per cent tax credit they
receive.
So the reduction in the tax credit I am proposing will have two important
effects.
First, the payments that lower rate payers, non-taxpayers and particularly
pension funds, get from the Inland Revenue will be reduced by 5 percentage
points, saving the Exchequer no less than Pounds 1bn a year.
Second, higher rate taxpayers will have to pay an extra 5 per cent of tax on
the dividends they receive, in order to discharge their liability to tax at
the top rate of 40 per cent. This in turn will yield an extra Pounds 200m a
year.
Finally, in order to ensure that most ordinary shareholders are not affected
by this change, I also propose to reduce the rate of tax on dividends from
the current basic rate of 25 per cent to the lower rate of 20 per cent. The
effect of this, combined with the change to tax credits, is to leave most
basic rate taxpayers neither better off nor worse off than they are now.
So, Mr Deputy Speaker, these proposals achieve three objectives at the same
time. They will give companies a Pounds 2bn cashflow boost over the next two
years. They will significantly reduce the problem of surplus ACT for the
future. And they will raise Pounds 900m in extra revenue for the Exchequer
from 1995-96 onwards.
There is, however, one group for whom I believe it would be desirable to
ease the immediate effect of these changes. I therefore propose for
charities to phase in the effect of the reduction in the tax credit over a
four year period. I also have some further measures for charities, to which
I shall turn later.
EXPORT CREDIT
The House will be relieved to hear that my next measure is a little less
opaque. But it is equally important for the long term success of British
manufacturing.
In the Autumn Statement, I announced a substantial increase in export
credits to help British businesses win major contracts abroad. But the fact
remains that export credit insurance has proved expensive for the taxpayer.
For that reason the government has negotiated hard over the years to secure
a reduction in the subsidies offered by other countries. Some progress has
been made, and we shall continue in that effort. But in the meantime,
British firms are sometimes at a competitive disadvantage in seeking
business overseas.
My Rt Hon friend the President of the Board of Trade and I have therefore
looked again at the whole range of ECGD services and have decided to make
some important changes.
First, premiums. Last year, premiums were cut on average by about 20 per
cent. But there is scope to do more. We have therefore decided to make a
further reduction of 7 1/2 per cent in the average level of ECGD premiums.
This means that, while premiums for individual export markets will always
differ, the average level of premiums paid by British exporters next year
will be down to around the average paid by their G7 competitors.
Second, export credit cover. In the Autumn Statement, I increased the cover
available to exporters by Pounds 200m this year, and by a further Pounds 500
million for 1993-94. Over the next three years, my Rt Hon friend and I
propose that additional cover of Pounds 1.3bn should be made available for
those exporting into some of the fastest growing and most important markets
around the world. Taken together with my Autumn Statement announcement, this
means that the annual cover for these markets will have increased by more
than 75 per cent in just 4 years.
As a result British firms will now be able to go out into export markets,
with greater confidence that they can compete on a more equal basis with
their overseas competitors. I am sure that they will seize the opportunities
that are now available to them.
INSURANCE
Over the years, one of Britain's most successful exporting industries has
been insurance. But for some years now, the industry has argued that the tax
reliefs available to some of their European counterparts put them at a
competitive disadvantage.
In fact, that is not the whole story - in other respects, our own tax system
is very favourable. Nevertheless, having reviewed the position again, I
believe that there may indeed be a case for allowing tax relief on certain
types of equalisation reserves covering occasional, exceptional losses.
But if such reserves are to be allowable for tax, they would also have to be
within the regulatory framework for the industry.
This would be a major departure for both the tax and regulatory systems. A
consultation document will be issued later this spring to consider the
options.
LLOYD'S
I also propose to introduce a significant reform of the tax regime for
Lloyd's.
I propose to tax the gains on the disposal of assets which form the premiums
funds of Lloyd's Names in the same way as those of corporate insurers.
And I intend to replace the current reserve arrangements with a better
targeted reserve, which should enhance Lloyd's ability to deal with the
particularly volatile type of risk which makes up most of their business.
My proposals will greatly simplify the taxation of Lloyd's. Lloyd's has had
a difficult time recently; but it remains vital if London is to retain its
pre-eminent position in the world insurance market. Taken together the
reforms I am proposing will be revenue neutral.
SMALL BUSINESS
The measures I have announced so far will be of help particularly to larger
businesses. But small firms play a crucial role in our economy. Small
businesses do not follow the economy - they lead it. That has been
demonstrated time and time again. In this Budget, I shall set out some
further proposals which will help small businesses to lead the recovery once
again.
Following heavy losses in recent years, the banks are bound to be more
cautious in their lending in future. Moreover, the fall in property prices
has reduced the security for their loans.
As the recovery progresses small firms may therefore find that their
prospects for expansion are increasingly threatened by a shortage of bank
finance. My first proposal is directed at that problem.
The government's Loan Guarantee Scheme helps entrepreneurs with viable
projects, but who do not have the track record or loan security to attract
sufficient finance on their own. It enables them to borrow with a government
guarantee, usually for 70 per cent of the value of the loan, in return for
paying a premium of 2 1/2 per cent on the guaranteed part of the loan.
In Germany and the US, a large proportion of lending to small businesses is
done at fixed rates of interest. By contrast, in Britain, most borrowing is
linked to the level of base rates. I believe that many small businesses
would benefit from making more use of fixed rate finance which would give
them more stability and would enable them to plan ahead.
I propose therefore to make a substantial reduction in the Loan Guarantee
Scheme premium for guarantees on fixed rate lending. This will fall to  1/2
per cent and will, I hope, encourage more fixed rate lending. I also intend
to reduce the premium on variable rate loans to 1 1/2 per cent. The premiums
will henceforth apply to the whole loan, not just the guaranteed portion.
This change should take effect in the next month or so.
I also propose that the limit on the size of loan allowed to such businesses
should be raised from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000 and the proportion of
the loan guaranteed increased from 70 per cent to 85 per cent. My Rt Hon
friend the President of the Board of Trade and I will be taking this forward
urgently with the banks.
CGT REFORM
My second measure relates specifically to entrepreneurs who have built up
successful businesses and now wish to sell them in order to start up a new
one.
The current Capital Gains Tax regime provides generous annual exemptions to
those who make regular capital gains from trading in shares. But it is much
less generous to the entrepreneur. Typically, he sells shares in his own
company only once, and so has only one year's annual exemption to set
against gains built up by hard work over many years. So for every Pounds 100
taken out of the old company at the margin he has only Pounds 80 to invest
in a new one.
It is hardly surprising that entrepreneurs complain that they are locked in
by the CGT regime, and prevented from investing their talents elsewhere.
For this reason I propose in future to defer the payment of CGT for any
entrepreneur whose gains from the sale of his own company are reinvested in
another qualifying unquoted trading company, or companies. I know this will
be widely welcomed by the venture capital industry.
I also propose to relax the conditions for CGT retirement relief, by
reducing the qualifying shareholding from 25 per cent to 5 per cent; and to
extend this relief to cover full-time employees, as well as directors. These
changes will cost Pounds 50 million in a full year.
VAT THRESHOLD
I turn now to the VAT regime, which for many small businesses takes up a
great deal of time and can be a particular source of worry. The best way to
help is to keep them out of the VAT system altogether. I am therefore
raising the VAT threshold to the maximum extent possible. The new threshold
will be Pounds 37,600.
Over the last couple of years I have also announced measures to allow
traders to reclaim VAT on debts which remain unpaid after 12 months; and to
encourage firms to take advantage of the Cash Accounting Scheme under which
traders only have to pay VAT to Customs when they themselves have been paid
by their customers.
I now intend to take this further.
I propose to increase the ceiling on turnover below which firms may join the
Cash Accounting Scheme by Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 350,000. This will allow
an extra 15,000 businesses to benefit, on top of the 400,000 that qualify
already.
I also intend to help businesses which are too big to take advantage of the
Scheme. At present, VAT can be reclaimed on any invoice which remains unpaid
after twelve months. I propose to halve that qualifying period to six
months.
These measures will give considerable help to companies, improving traders'
cashflow by some Pounds 150 million in the year ahead.
VAT PENALTIES
In addition, I have a further series of reforms to propose to the current
system of VAT penalties.
First, I intend to focus the rules better so that only larger errors and the
most persistent offenders will incur the 'Misdeclaration Penalty'. This will
reduce the number of penalties imposed by over 40 per cent.
Second, I propose to place a 3 year limit on the number of years' interest
that can be charged when tax has been underpaid.
Third, I have decided to reform the VAT Default Surcharge so that traders
will be notified sooner of default and surcharged at a lower rate and only
on larger defaults. This will make the Surcharge system more effective,
while removing some 125,000 small traders from the Default Surcharge
altogether. I know this will be welcomed by many small businesses.
KEITH REPORT
I have one final reform of the VAT penalty system. Following Lord Keith's
1983 review, the Government concluded that it would be wrong to give Customs
discretion over the level of VAT penalties. After considerable debate, this
conclusion was eventually accepted by the House. But the controversy has
continued ever since and, over time, more and more people have come to
believe that it is wrong to have a penalty regime which is almost entirely
automatic.
I have considered this matter afresh, and concluded that the time has come
to make a change. I propose therefore that Customs should be given some
discretion to mitigate the penalties for some misdeclarations, to enable
them to take account of the individual circumstances of the trader. If
necessary, of course, the trader will still be able to appeal to a VAT
Tribunal, which will also have greater scope for discretion.
These reforms will put the VAT compliance system onto a secure long term
basis. They will be of most benefit to small businesses, for whom the burden
of compliance is heaviest; and I am sure that they will be widely welcomed
on both sides of the House.
BLOODSTOCK
Mr Deputy Speaker, I have already announced my intention to extend Value
Added Tax to domestic fuel and power from 1 April next year. I now have one
further announcement to make on VAT.
As the House knows, it has long been this government's intention to switch
the burden of taxation from direct taxes on income to indirect taxes on
consumer spending.
It is perhaps less well-known that Britain has one of the lowest effective
rates of VAT in the European Community.
Against this background and in a Budget designed to place the public
finances on a sound footing, I have inevitably had to look very carefully at
the whole structure of our current VAT regime and particularly at whether
all of our existing zero rates should be maintained. Some of these
zero-rated goods, for example food and water, are clearly amongst the most
basic necessities of life. Others, for example sewerage and newspapers,
perhaps fall into a different category.
Having reflected carefully, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have decided nonetheless
not to extend the VAT base beyond fuel and power.
I do however have one further announcement on VAT, which will I hope offer
some consolation to those HMs who would rather be at Cheltenham today,
watching the Champion Hurdle.
For some time the bloodstock industry has been concerned about competition
from other EC countries which levy a lower rate of VAT on horses. The single
market has exacerbated this problem and created a major incentive to move
bloodstock business abroad, threatening 30,000 jobs.
There have been intensive discussions between the Jockey Club and Customs
and I am pleased to announce that a way forward has been found.
As a result of proposed changes in the Jockey Club's rules owners who wish
to do so will now be able to organise their racing activities in a more
commercial way. This in turn will enable them to meet the normal business
test for VAT registration and to claim credit for VAT on purchases, subject
to the usual rules.
I know that registration on this basis meets the industry's concerns over
this problem. No Government has done more for racing than this one  - and
quite rightly so, for it is not only an important industry, but a vital part
of our national life. This measure will be welcomed by the industry and by
their many supporters in this House.
UBR
Mr Deputy Speaker, I have one final announcement, which will be of direct
help to many businesses.
My last Budget helped many thousands of firms by altering the business rates
transitional arrangements to accelerate the gains of those who gained most
from the change in the system, while freezing real rates bills which would
otherwise have risen substantially.
The freeze applied for one year only. So many businesses now face a
substantial increase in their rates bills in the year ahead - of up to 20
per cent over and above inflation on large properties and up to 15 per cent
on small properties.
It would, I believe, be wrong to impose such increases in present
circumstances. I therefore propose for a further year to freeze in real
terms the rates bills of those losing from the new system.
As a result of this and last year's measures, no business will face a real
increase in its rates bill in the year ahead, and many will benefit from
reductions. In cash terms, that means that no bill will rise by more than
3.6 per cent, the increase in the RPI in the year to last September.
Subject to parliament's approval, the Government will again pay extra sums
into the business rates pool to ensure that the income of local authorities
is not reduced. My Rt Hon friend the Secretary of State for the Environment
will shortly introduce a Bill to implement these proposals. Full details
will be published today in a press notice.
The new measure will reduce the total business rates bill in England and
Wales next year by 2.6 per cent. Bills in Scotland and Northern Ireland will
likewise be reduced by 2.6 per cent in aggregate. My Rt Hon friends the
Scottish and Northern Ireland Secretaries will be announcing the details.
These measures will again bring significant and early benefit to many
thousands of businesses throughout the United Kingdom. About 800,000
business properties will benefit. The revenue cost is estimated to be some
Pounds 370m in 1993-94 and some Pounds 260m in 1994-95.
Mr Deputy Speaker, taken together, the measures I have announced will reduce
the burden on business by about Pounds 1bn in the year ahead. I am sure that
the whole House will agree that this is the best possible use for the sums I
have been able to raise this year.
NATIONAL LOTTERY AND CHARITIES
The House is aware of the government's plans to introduce a National Lottery
from next year. This will provide a substantial increase in resources for a
number of good causes: charities, sport, the arts, the national heritage and
the millenium fund. I have no doubt that the lottery will be both popular
and successful.
The government has always made it clear that the National Lottery will be
taxed. In deciding the tax rate, I have taken into account the level of tax
on other forms of gambling and the extent to which spending is likely to be
diverted from other taxed activities. Much of course will depend on how the
lottery develops and I shall keep the position under review.
But for the first year of its operation I propose that National Lottery
tickets should be taxed at a rate of 12 per cent. Existing society and local
authority lotteries will be exempt. Winnings will incur no tax whatsoever. I
believe that these proposals will ensure that the National Lottery gets off
to a good start.
Since 1979, the Government has done an enormous amount to help charities.
Indeed, their special position in society is recognised in the substantial
tax reliefs approaching Pounds 1 billion which they already receive. And
they will also benefit from the new Lottery. I now have two further changes
to propose.
First, I intend to raise the annual limit for income tax relief under the
payroll giving scheme from Pounds 600 to Pounds 900 with effect from 6
April.
Second, I propose that the minimum gift attracting tax relief for single
donations under the Gift Aid Scheme should be reduced from Pounds 400 to
Pounds 250 from today.
These measures build on the principle that tax reliefs for charity should
focus on what individuals give, rather than what charities themselves spend.
Taken together, they will boost tax relief on donations to charities by some
Pounds 30m in a full year.
EMPLOYMENT MEASURES
In the Autumn Statement, the government announced a number of measures to
help the unemployed. And in my Budget, I have set out my further proposals
to help business and sustain recovery - the best way to promote employment.
But we know from experience that unemployment may continue to rise for a
while even after growth has resumed. That is a matter of great concern to
the whole country, and it is a concern which I fully share. My Rt Hon friend
the Secretary of State for Employment and I have therefore decided to take
further special measures to help an extra 100,000 unemployed people.
First, we have decided to provide more help for those who wish to set up
their own businesses under the Business Start-Up Scheme. This offers advice
and financial assistance, and has been one of the most successful employment
schemes. We propose to offer an additional 10,000 places in 1993-94. That
will give a direct boost to small business creation and self-employment in
years ahead.
Second, my Rt Hon friend the Secretary of State for Employment proposes to
introduce a new initiative to allow the long-term unemployed to learn the
practical skills they need to find work. Resources will be made available to
allow 30,000 long-term unemployed people to take up full-time vocational
courses.
Third, it is widely agreed that in every community there are plenty of jobs
needing to be done, and plenty of people who want to do them. My Rt Hon
friendthe prime minister has recently indicated the importance of offering
more unemployed people the opportunity to undertake some form of training or
activity. We are therefore launching a new Community Action programme to
allow 60,000 of the long-term unemployed to do part-time work in their local
communities, organised by voluntary groups. Those involved will be paid an
allowance based on their previous benefit rates plus a small premium. The
scheme will start as soon as possible.
Mr Deputy Speaker, those who have been unemployed for a long time tend to
lose touch with the job market, and find it increasingly difficult to find
an employer who wants to take them on.
We propose to test in pilot schemes the feasibility and effectiveness of a
new approach where rather than pay benefits to the long-term unemployed to
do nothing, payments will instead be made, for a limited period, to an
employer who recruits them.
Employers taking on people who have been out of work for at least 2 years
will receive a one-year subsidy based on the benefit payments which would
otherwise have been paid. That subsidy will taper off as the period of
employment progresses. Pilot schemes using different approaches will be
launched this summer in four parts of the country. If they can be made to
work, this could lead to permanent jobs for the long-term unemployed as the
economy recovers.
Finally, the establishment of Training and Enterprise Councils throughout
the country has successfully brought local business people into the design
and running of training and enterprise programmes for the unemployed. I now
propose to offer the TECs a new Pounds 25m fund. My Rt Hon friend the
Secretary of State for Employment will invite TECs to submit competing
applications to develop the most imaginative schemes to help the long-term
unemployed and stimulate job creation. The degree of local business
involvement will be an important criterion against which each application
will be judged.
These measures will cost Pounds 230m and will give special help to those who
need it most, including disabled people. The disabled will be given priority
in the vocational education initiative and in Community Action, helping us
to build on our achievements in helping the disabled back to work. In the
first nine months of 1992-93 the Employment Service found jobs for 31,000
unemployed disabled people, 25 per cent more than in the same period of
1991-92. I am sure the House will welcome this.
PRIVATE FINANCE
Mr Deputy Speaker, in my Autumn Statement I announced significant changes to
the rules for the private financing of major infrastructure projects. This
initiative has met with an enthusiastic response; and today I have a number
of specific developments to announce.
First, Hon Members will recall that legislation has already passed through
both Houses, permitting the construction of a new fast rail link that will
cut the journey time between Heathrow Airport and Paddington. I can now
announce that BAA plc and British Rail have agreed to proceed with this
project, the Heathrow Express. This is a major new joint venture, involving
private sector investment of nearly Pounds 300m.
As well as providing a substantial boost to the construction industry, this
project will significantly enhance the transport infrastructure of the
nation's capital.
Second, Crossrail, a public sector project first proposed in 1989 to reduce
congestion in central London. Mr Deputy Speaker, the government remains
committed to securing for London the benefits that Crossrail will bring. But
we now believe it would be preferable to take this project forward as a
joint venture with the private sector. The present proposals for Crossrail
will therefore be re-examined. Our aims will be to maximise the
participation and financial involvement of the private sector and to secure
the best possible value for money for the taxpayer.
One of the most ambitious civil engineering projects ever conceived has been
made possible by private finance: I refer of course to the Channel Tunnel.
This will provide a fast link between Britain and Paris, cutting journey
times dramatically.
But those times could be cut still further by reducing the time taken for
journeys within Britain itself.
For that to happen a new rail link will be required - from London down to
the Channel Tunnel itself. This will be a massive undertaking - one of the
largest infrastructure projects in this country since the war. But after
careful consideration, the government has decided to make a firm commitment
to the project. So I can announce today that the Channel Tunnel Rail Link
will go ahead.
My Rt Hon friend the Secretary of State for Transport will be inviting the
private sector to come forward with bids so that the project can be taken
forward as a joint venture as soon as possible. We will discuss timing with
the private sector.
We hope to be able to introduce a bill as soon as the legislative timetable
permits, and to see the new line fully completed around the end of the
decade. The government will make its own financial contribution, recognising
the benefits that will accrue to domestic travellers from the new link.
Full responsibility for the project, its management and completion will be
transferred to the private sector.
Subject to the results of detailed work by British Rail over the next few
months, the London terminus of the new link will be located at St Pancras.
This will provide a new lease of life for this magnificent Victorian
building, which will become the gateway to London for international
passengers. My Rt Hon friend the Secretary of State for Transport will make
a statement on the details of the route shortly.
Over the years ahead, my private finance initiative will play an ever
increasing role in the modernisation of Britain's infrastructure. The
projects I have announced today represent a considerable step forward. They
will not only improve the country's transport network; they will also create
jobs. I am sure they will be warmly welcomed on all sides of the House.
INCOME TAX
Mr Deputy Speaker, I turn finally to income tax.
My priority in this Budget has been to set out a clear strategy for reducing
public sector borrowing over the medium term.
I am therefore unable this year to reduce the basic rate of income tax. I
also propose to leave the higher rate of tax unchanged at 40 per cent.
But in my Budget last year I opened up an alternative route for moving over
time to our ultimate objective - a 20p basic rate of income tax for
everyone. The new lower rate band I announced last year at a stroke took 4m
taxpayers on low incomes down to the 20 per cent rate, cutting their
marginal rate of tax by a fifth.
In this Budget I have taken my reform a step further. The government's 20
pence pledge not only involves a reduction in marginal tax rates for 19
million basic rate taxpayers.
But, also, when the basic rate is eventually brought down to 20 pence, tax
reliefs for basic rate taxpayers will, of course, be worth 20 pence in the
pound too. In this Budget, I am bringing forward that change by restricting
three specific tax reliefs to 20 per cent. Not just for basic rate
taxpayers, but for all taxpayers.
First, I have reduced the tax credit on dividends to 20 per cent, to cut the
rate of Advance Corporation Tax which companies pay on dividends.
Second, I will be reducing the rate of relief on mortgage interest payments
to 20 per cent, to cut the subsidy on borrowing and to pay for a reduction
in the tax on housing transactions.
Third, I will be restricting the tax relief for married couples to 20 per
cent, to make it worth the same for all taxpayers.
All these measures are sensible reforms in their own right.
And when revenue has to be raised it is far better to do this by broadening
the tax base than by increasing tax rates.
But, in addition, the restrictions I have introduced will also allow me to
make further progress in getting income tax rates down.
I therefore propose to increase the width of the new 20p band in 1993-94 by
Pounds 500 to Pounds 2,500. That will help all taxpayers currently paying
tax at 25 per cent. And it means that in the coming year nearly 5m taxpayers
will face a marginal rate of income tax of only 20 per cent. Already, for
about a fifth of all taxpayers, I will have delivered on our promise of a
20p rate in the first Budget of the Parliament. And I will have done so by a
sensible and fair reform of the tax system.
But I can also go further. The measures I have announced today will also
allow me to make a further extension of the 20p rate in 1994-95. From April
next year I propose that the 20p band should cover the first Pounds 3,000 of
taxable income, Pounds 500 more than in the year ahead. And we shall
continue to widen the 20p band in the years to come - year by year we will
make further progress towards our objective. A 20p basic rate of tax for
everyone.
CONCLUSION
Mr Deputy Speaker, in the first Budget of the parliament, I have set out the
government's economic strategy.
I have cut the tax burden on business; and given help for small businesses,
exports and the unemployed.
I have demonstrated clearly how we will bring Government borrowing down in
the years ahead.
That is the only way to sustain growth and build a strong and sound economy
in the 1990s.
This is a Budget for sustained recovery and a Budget for jobs - not just for
this year, and next year - but right through the decade. I commend it to the
House.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Credit cut may hit scheme benefits -
Occupational Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCCUPATIONAL pension schemes, particularly 'mature' schemes with few
contributing members and large numbers of existing pensioners, will be hard
hit by the Chancellor's tax changes.
From the new year, for pension schemes and other tax-exempt investors, the
amount of tax credit that can be reclaimed in cash from the Inland Revenue
on share dividends will fall from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.
Mr Andrew Wilson, partner in charge of research at consulting actuaries R
Watson and Co estimates that the move will deprive UK pension schemes of
about Pounds 900m per year in income. 'That means either cuts in benefits or
increases in contribution rates,' he said.
The tax changes, he said, could force some of the companies currently using
pension scheme surpluses to cut or omit their own corporate contributions to
resume funding.
The National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association,
found that 53 per cent of employers are making reduced or no contributions
to their schemes.
Those schemes are relying on the combination of employee contributions and
investment income to pay benefits to current pensioners. Because many of
these are in declining industries where employers' finances are already
strained, they are ill-prepared to spend more on pensions.
Mr Brian Matthews, finance director at ESN Management Group, the pension
scheme of the electricty supply companies, estimated the tax changes will
deprive his scheme of about Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m of income per year.
However, there will be no need to adjust either benefits or contribution
rates because of the large number of current contributing members, he said.
'A more mature scheme dependent on investment income is in a different
situation,' he noted.
The effects of the tax changes will become more pronounced for individual
schemes after the next actuarial valuation - an event which occurs at
triennial intervals. Because actuaries value equities not on market value
but use a method known as 'discounted income value' - based on anticipated
cash flow - pension schemes will show a smaller asset pool at their next
valuation. Thus, even relatively young schemes may have to re-evaluate both
contribution rates and benefits.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Abolition closes loophole - BES Loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABOLITION of Business Expansion Schemes involving loans finishes a
spending spree which raised Pounds 568m since last September, when the
loophole was first discov-ered.
This went towards transferring repossessed housing held by lenders such as
banks and building societies to assured tenancies.
The loophole closed by the chancellor allowed companies to make non-recourse
loans to investors in BES companies six months after original investment,
with only the value of the BES shares themselves as security. The original
intention of the act was that tax relief would be forfeited if the shares
were disposed of within five years.
By offering non-recourse loans after six months of 75p for every Pounds 1
invested, banks and building societies gained very cheap finance while
allowing an excessive return to top-rate taxpayers, who had effectively only
invested 60p for every Pounds 1 received by the building societies.
Mr Lamont's description of the schemes as 'highly subsidised loans for top
rate taxpayers' therefore seems accurate. Basic rate taxpayers could not
benefit from the schemes.
Mr Tim Villiers, chairman of the BES Association, described the move as
disappointing, but admitted that the schemes had been 'pure arbitrage of the
taxman'.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Fresh look but on a small scale -
Employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET measures for the unemployed were small-scale but innovative. The
trade unions and employment lobbyists were quick to point out that the net
cost of the five measures is just Pounds 125m and they will help 100,000
people, only one in 16 of those unemployed for more than six months.
But they also reflect an unusual openness to new ideas, especially in
relation to helping the long-term unemployed back into jobs. The most
radical departure from the past is the acceptance of the principle of job
subsidies to employers who take on the unemployed, an idea long resisted by
the Treasury.
The idea is only being tested out, in slightly differing formats, in four
Workstart Pilot areas at a cost of Pounds 2.6m and will involve just 1,000
people.
The plan is based on the Benefits Transfer Programme idea recently floated
by Professor Dennis Snower, of Birkbeck College, London University, who
suggested the unemployed should have the option of transfering all their
benefits - unemployment benefit, income support, and the associated rebates,
and provisions in kind - to an employer.
In the government's version the option will only be open to those unemployed
for more than two years, about 450,000 people in total. It will allow a
one-year subsidy to the employer of Pounds 60 a week taken from benefits
which would have been paid. The unemployed person gets a normal wage. The
subsidy will taper off as the period of employment progresses.
The traditional objection to employment subsidies is that they create new
employment only at the margin. Observers say that while subsidies may tip
the balance for employers who were already thinking of employing people, the
subsidy 'bribe' otherwise comes a long way down the list as a reason for
employing someone.
Employers are always hiring, even in the middle of a recession. Last year 7m
people found new jobs. Many employers will simply pocket the subsidy for
people they would have hired in any case. There is also the problem of
policing subsidies so that employers do not replace existing workers with
those carrying subsidy.
The Snower-government scheme will specifically prevent employers displacing
existing staff. It has the additional advantage of being targeted at the
very long-term unemployed and, by drawing the subsidy from benefit which
would otherwise have been paid, of being cheap.
Employment lobbyists, such as Mr Peter Ashby of Full Employment UK, also see
new thinking behind the lauch of the new Community Action programme which
will provide benefit plus Pounds 10 for 60,000 people who want to work
part-time and receive help with job-hunting the rest of the time.
Apart from the fact that it is part-time, Community Action is very similar
to Employment Action. But Mr Ashby believes it is significant that Community
Action will be administered by the Employment Service, with individual
projects run by voluntary organisations. That means that unlike the TEC-run
Employment Action it could become the testing ground for a system of
'workfare' in which benefit recipients, or possibly just those aged 18 to
24, would have to do some community work in return for those benefits.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, yesterday denied that
Community Action was a testing ground for workfare.
One of the other schemes, Learning for Work, funds 30,000 unemployed people
to pursue full-time vocationally relevant education. However, one of the
surprise omissions from the unemployment package is that there has been no
general loosening of the rules which restrict those unemployed people
receiving income support from spending longer in education or working for
voluntary organisations, rather than being available for work. That,
however, trespasses on broader questions of what income support, received by
many people who are not unemployed, is for.
Finally, the chancellor had some good news for the disabled unemployed,
stressing that they would be given priority in most of the schemes. He also
said that in the first nine months of 1992-93 the Employment Service found
jobs for 31,000 unemployed people, 25 per cent more than the same period
last year.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Tackling the 'surplus' problem -
Advance Corporation Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE immediate impact of the change in Advance Corporation Tax will be to cut
the ACT paid on a dividend of Pounds 100 from the present Pounds 33.3 to
Pounds 26.87 in 1993-94 and to Pounds 23.35 in the tax year beginning in
April 1994.
Companies which pay dividends out of UK profits will not be significantly
affected by these changes.
The major change will be to those companies which pay dividends out of
profits they have earned outside the UK. Until now those companies have had
to pay ACT on those dividends, but since they have had no UK corporation tax
to pay on them - because in most cases they will be fully taxed in the
country where they were earned - they cannot offset them. Since ACT is not
repayable, the surplus ACT is effectively a dividend tax.
It is now proposed that dividends paid out of foreign profits - a foreign
income dividend, or FID - will still carry an ACT burden, but that ACT will
now be recoverable from the Inland Revenue if the company cannot offset it
against UK profits. This will be of great help to these companies, and will
significantly reduce their tax burden.
A consultative document will be issued on this proposal. This means that the
relief will not be introduced this year, and also implies that nothing is
being done to enable the many companies affected to recover the surplus ACT
they have already paid.
It may not be of benefit to all their shareholders however. A UK tax payer
will be deemed to have paid income tax at 20 per cent on FIDs. Basic rate
taxpayers will pay no more tax on FIDs. Higher rate UK tax payers will pay
an additional 20 per cent tax.
However, the deemed income tax will not be available for repayment to
non-taxpayers, such as pension funds, nor to overseas shareholders who are
currently able to claim a credit from the UK under tax treaties with the UK.
If this plan goes ahead, companies that pay FIDs may find their shares
become less attractive to overseas shareholders.
The existing rules have been a major disincentive to the setting up of
UK-based foreign-owned holding companies, say, to act as regional
headquarters for group companies in Europe. Instead, these companies have
been established elsewhere in Europe, to the detriment of the UK exchequer.
It is proposed that if agreement of the proposals is delayed beyond the end
of 1993, special rules will be introduced in 1994 to cover just those
companies.
In the meantime, the chancellor has moved to close a loophole exploited by
companies which have tried to use their surplus ACT by selling it to other
companies which are able to use it.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Mixed blessings for oil industry -
Petroleum Revenue Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OIL industry was caught by surprise yesterday by the extent of the
chancellor's changes to the tax regime in the North Sea. He proposed a sharp
reduction in the Petroleum Revenue Tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent for
existing field and its elimination for new fields. But he also said tax
allowances for the industry would be sharply reduced.
Few in the industry had been expecting a significant overhaul of petroleum
taxes and many producers were in disarray about whether they would lose or
gain from the move.
But the tax changes are likely to affect the way in which companies operate
in the North Sea and raise the prospect of a substantial reduction in
exploration in the area.
In spite of the fact that some companies will see substantial gains from the
changes, many North Sea operators were infuriated by the move which they
believe will place an extra burden on the industry when oil prices are low
and costs high.
Mr Harold Hughes, who heads the industry group: the UK Offshore Operators
Association, said: 'We're very concerned at the enormity of the change - it
will decrease the amount of exploration in the North Sea and add to the cost
burden the industry is facing.'
Mr Hughes said that exploration costs for many companies could quadruple as
they will be unable to write them off against Petroleum Revenue Tax. In the
past, many companies have been able to fund their entire oil drilling
programmes by reclaiming PRT they have previously paid on producing fields.
This is why the regime cost the treasury Pounds 200m in 1991 to 1992.
But some large North Sea operators such as British Petroleum which pay a lot
of PRT on producing fields will benefit from the new tax regime. City
analysts reckon that the reduction in the PRT rate from 75 per cent to 50
per cent along with other tax changes could add as much as Pounds 130m to
Pounds 140m to BP's profits.
Mr Fergus MacLeod, industry analyst at NatWest Securities in Edinburgh,
estimates that BP will make a profit of Pounds 725m this year. The PRT
benefit could increase its profits by 20 per cent next year. Shell is also
likely to benefit by about Pounds 40m a year, he estimates.
However, smaller exploration and production companies which have
traditionally written off their exploration costs against PRT will be badly
affected by the move. In addition, under the proposed changes, companies
such as Lasmo and Enterprise Oil will not be able to transfer tax allowance
benefits between fields in the North Sea so that they offset part of their
development costs for new fields against tax paid on producing fields.
The UKOOA challenged the chancellor's figures for revenue he expects to
raise from the tax changes. Mr Lamont said the changes will raise Pounds
300m in 1994 to 1995 and Pounds 400m the year after. However, Mr Hughes
believes the figues will actually be much higher.
He said it could cut down the extent to which companies want to become
involved in North Sea exploration. 'This will mean companies have to review
their commitments to the next licensing round (for oil exploration acreage)
and some partnerships could fall apart under the strain,' he said.
The North Sea last year reached a production peak of over 2m barrels of oil
a day and the chancellor is clearly hoping that the tax changes will not
deter too many companies from exploration and production.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Effectiveness of 'green' measures
questioned - Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTAL groups and economists welcomed the 'green' measures in the
Budget but were highly sceptical that on their own they would play much part
in helping the UK reach its environmental targets.
The imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and the increased taxes on petrol and
car use were presented in the Budget as green instruments which would help
the UK reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. The UK agreed at the Rio Earth
Summit last July to stabilise carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000
to help combat global warming.
Mr David Pearce, an economist at the Centre for Social and Economic Research
on the Global Environment, described the Budget as 'encouraging and
surprising. This is the first time that he - or any other chancellor - has
mentioned the environment in any significant way and that partly reflects
the advice he got from his 'seven wise men''.
However economists were cautious in predicting that the tough stand on car
use - justified by Mr Lamont because transport 'is the fastest growing
sector' of carbon dioxide emissions - would have much impact. Energy experts
rushed to point out that demand for transport is notoriously unresponsive to
price rises.
Economists are also concerned that the VAT imposition will give less
environmental benefit than expected because demand for domestic fuel is also
unresponsive to price rises. Mr Patrick Lane, from Oxford Economic Research
Associates, said: 'It might well take a much higher tax than this to have a
real impact.' He added: 'VAT is a very blunt instrument - different fuels
contain different amounts of carbon.'
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation on
Energy, said: 'On our sums, the most that the VAT imposition could do would
be to reduce carbon emissions by 2m tonnes of carbon by the time it is fully
effective - probably 1986-87.'
The government estimates that the UK needs to reduce carbon emissions in the
year 2000 by 10m tonnes from the projected 170m tonnes, and that all the
Budget measures will save 3m tonnes.
However, Mr Warren attacked as 'singularly optimistic' the chancellor's
claim that the Budget measures together with existing energy efficiency
policy would take the UK 'two-thirds of the way' towards those targets.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, said: 'The chancellor's claim
that his Budget is good for the environment is bogus. He is doing nothing to
encourage energy efficiency.'
Mr Lamont's insistence that EC-wide carbon or energy taxes would not be
imposed on the UK by the European Commission came as no surprise, as it
repeats the tough stance taken by the UK in Monday's Ecofin council meeting
in Brussels. EC officials have interpreted the stance as leaving room for a
co-ordinated set of taxes by the EC members. Despite the scepticism
expressed yesterday, the Budget's measures may be welcomed in Brussels as
the UK's contribution.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Industry welcomes increased cover -
Export Financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTERS welcomed the announcement of fresh cuts in export insurance
premium rates, and of additional export credit cover of Pounds 1.3bn over
the next three years to be made available for companies bidding for business
in developing countries where export success has led to unusually heavy
export insurance exposure.
Mr Lamont announced an average 7 1/2 per cent cut in premium rates, which
have been a target of complaints by exporters. They claim foreign rivals
gain a competitive advantage in bidding for contracts because their
governments provide export credit cover at lower premium rates.
The extra export credit cover, of which Pounds 300m will be available in the
coming financial year, with Pounds 400m in 1994-95, and Pounds 600m in
1995-96, will be added to an extra Pounds 500m of cover for 1993-94
announced last November. This will be targeted at 12 markets, which include
Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, South Africa and Malaysia, where UK exporters'
success has been hindered by country limits intended to cap the exposure of
the Export Credits Guarantee Department to any individual market.
Some exporters will be disappointed that short term export credit
reinsurance arrangements, capital investment write-downs, cuts in
corporation tax, exporters' loan guarantees and bankers' export guarantees
were not included.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the secretary of state for trade and industry,
yesterday said the moves were 'a further sign of the government's
determination to help British companies win overseas contracts.'
Mr Ian Campbell, director general of the Institute for Export, said he was
pleased that Mr Lamont had 'admitted that previous policies have led to
competitive disadvantages'.
The budget hopes to improve relations with industry and to stimulate
economic recovery by increasing exports.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Tax will hit low-income families -
Fuel and VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN INTRODUCING Value Added Tax on domestic fuel, the UK is coming into line
with most other European Community countries. Apart from Ireland, all EC
countries will now levy VAT on domestic fuel and power.
However, the chancellor's decision to charge VAT at the 17 1/2 per cent
standard rate - albeit phased in over two years - will put the UK at the top
of the league table. Around half the other EC countries charge VAT at a
reduced rate, such as 5 1/2 per cent in France and 9 per cent in Italy (1992
rates).
Under the EC rules setting the framework for national value added taxes,
members can have two reduced rate bands at or above 5 per cent. One option
would have been to have taxed domestic fuel at 5 or 10 per cent.
That would have mitigated the regressive impact of taxing this basic
commodity. According to Mr Paul Baker of the Institute for Fiscal Studies,
the increase will hit the lowest income families three times as hard as the
better-off. For the poorest fifth of households, 17 1/2 per cent on fuel
prices will add more than 2 per cent to their spending. For the richest
fifth, the cost is around 0.7 per cent of total spending.
The environmental gloss the chancellor put on the decision conceals a
further regressive element in the impact of this tax change. It will be the
better-off families which can afford to improve the insulation of their
homes and replace their domestic appliances with more energy-efficient
models.
Certainly it will put more pressure on gas appliance manufacturers to
improve the efficiency of appliances.
Analysts said the impact on the power companies would be limited since most
consumers have little choice over the amount of electricity or gas they buy.
Companies' profits and dividends are unlikely to be affected.
Some observers believe the power companies will be open to political attack
because of the increased prices, even though they were not to blame. Water
companies have been criticised by the Labour party for double digit price
rises since privatisation.
Because VAT will be levied on all fuels, little switching between fuel
sources is expected. However, in some situations - larger new properties -
gas may become more efficient than electricity, according to Mr Nigel
Burton, analyst at S G Warburg.
For the chancellor, there is, however, an important benefit in pushing up
the VAT on domestic fuel as high and as soon as possible. EC moves to
introduce a carbon tax are still some years away, but the plans under
discussion in Brussels would link increased taxes on fuel with compensating
tax cuts elsewhere.
'By bringing domestic fuel into the VAT net, the chancellor ensures that he
permanently widens the tax base,' says the IFS's Mr Baker. 'And it also
gives him the flexibility to decide what he spends the money on  - either
for tax cuts or to reduce borrowing.'
By not creating a lower VAT rate for fuel, the chancellor keeps open a
further option if deficits persist in the government's budget. He could
point to the disparity between the bulk of spending on which VAT is paid at
the 17 1/2 standard rate and the minority of essentials which remain
zero-rated.
To introduce a lower rate of 8 per cent on those goods could raise as much
as a further Pounds 5bn or more a year - a handsome banker for a future
budget.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Leading Article: French Socialists go on trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT SUNDAY'S election in France will be widely regarded as a trial of the
Socialists' record in office. On the evidence of the opinion polls, they may
lose three-fifths of their seats and the combined conservative parties will
sweep back into power with a massive majority. By the ordinary yard-stick of
democratic success and failure, such a result would appear to be a
devastating condemnation.
Up to a point, the Socialists clearly deserve to be thrown out. They have
been in power too long, they have shown themselves all too ready to resort
to the flesh-pots of political corruption, and they have failed to rethink
their traditional policies and their style in terms which would reconcile
their claims to some kind of modern socialism with the practical demands of
today's world.
But if one looks at their policy record, it is not evident that the
Socialists have done badly by the French electorate. When they came to power
in 1981, they rushed ahead with outdated left-wing nostrums, like wholesale
nationalisation and early retirement. But within two years they were forced
to backtrack and since then they have steadily pursued a modest, even
'conservative' economic policy, based on budgetary restraint and control of
inflation.
This has been a well-managed policy, which has given France above-average
growth and steadily falling inflation. It will no doubt be continued by the
conservatives after next Sunday's election. The acute problem, from a
Socialist point of view, is that this responsible economic policy failed to
prevent the rise in unemployment, which has now become inexorable under the
forces of recession.
Structural problem
It is reasonably clear, therefore, that a vast swing in Sunday's vote will
point to a serious structural problem, which can only partly be laid at the
feet of the Socialists. The problem is that the French political system is
out of kilter, largely because there is an imbalance between the large and
spreading powers of the presidency and the undervalued role of the
parliament.
Over the years this has generated a growing sense of alienation among the
electorate, which has become evident in the growth of support for the
protest parties, most notably the extreme right-wing National Front and the
two ecology parties. All told, the non-government parties could get a third
of the votes between them, but without winning many seats in parliament;
whereas the conservatives can expect a huge majority in parliament, even if
they get under 40 per cent of the vote.
Urgent priority
The disequilibrium between the conservatives' ostensible governing power,
and their much more limited popular support, will be especially flagrant
where the conservatives are divided on major policy issues, as they are on
Europe. One of their most urgent priorities, therefore, should be to
introduce some quite modest political and constitutional reforms, to restore
the balance between the institutions and rebuild popular confidence in the
system.
There can be no changing the defining characteristic of the constitution,
which is that of a mixed presidential-parliamentary system. As a system this
may seem unclear, but the central fact is that it obviously suits the French
and has provided government of above-average quality for rather a long time.
President Mitterrand's recent initiative, in launching a package of
constitutional reforms, has been criticised by the right. But it is bound to
become one of the central issues of debate by the new governing majority in
parliament, and offers a convenient opportunity for improving the system.
One option would be a shortening of the presidential term; another would be
a tighter definition of the powers of the president compared with his
government. But, however it is done, the essential requirement is for some
slight shift of authority and legitimacy in the direction of government and
parliament.

<TEXT>
In case you were wondering why Lord Howe was not around to watch the British
Budget, the answer is that he was away in Luxembourg receiving a prize for
his distinguished services in pursuit of European unity. The prize is
awarded by FVS Foundation of Hamburg in memory of Joseph Bech (1887-1975)
who was foreign minister of Luxembourg for 33 years, and was twice prime
minister while continuing his foreign office duties.
Even Lord Howe, who, as Sir Geoffrey, was chancellor of the exchequer then
foreign secretary under Margaret Thatcher, can't compete with that. But he
was very pleased to receive the prize, though slightly sorry about the date.

Abe Hirschfeld, the New York property mogul who agreed last Friday to
acquire the New York Post, may have more than met his match.
Not exactly a media darling since he spat in the face of a woman reporter
two years ago, Hirschfeld immediately sacked the editor, announced plans to
slash another 270 jobs, and then named Wilbert Tatum, controversial
publisher of a local black paper with a reputation for some pretty way-out
views, to head the large newsroom.
So yesterday it was the journos' turn to hit back with their own
unauthorised edition of New York's daily newspaper.
One profile of the new boss asked 'Who is this nut?' while columnist Jack
Newfield, who had just been given his marching orders, took another tilt at
the proprietor's sanity.
'The problem with bankruptcy courts is that they have a metal detector in
the lobby, but not a CAT-scan.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While there may be plenty of reasons for a wholesale clear-out at the top of
the BBC in the wake of the John Birt affair, there is one big reason why the
authorities should hesitate.
Nearly half of the executives on the BBC's board of management have been
replaced over the past couple of years and five of the 12 governors are due
to retire over the next four months.
Some might argue that turnover of top bods has already been too speedy for
comfort. After all, the reason for extending Lord Barnett's term as
vice-chairman to July 1993 was so that he wouldn't retire at the same time
as chairman Marmaduke Hussey.
If Hussey is forced to walk the plank, then the government will have to find
a new chairman, as well as a vice-chairman and replacements for sensible
folk like trade unionist Bill Jordan, Marks &amp; Spencer boss Keith Oates, and
thriller writer P D James.
Given the calibre of the governors remaining on the board, there is an
argument for the BBC breaking with tradition and asking at least a few of
the outgoing bigwigs to stay on.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Would Norman Lamont count as an economic indicator the number of tycoons
rummaging around in Lord Hanson's executive toy locker? He might be pleased
to hear from Colin Whicher, one of Lord Hanson's retainers, that Hanson Air
has just sold its first whirlybird of 1993.
'We are doing well if we sell 10 helicopters and 10 aeroplanes a year,' says
Whicher, who reports a notable pick-up in interest in executive flying
machines. He is particularly proud of his latest sales coup - a
state-of-the-art flying bird which has no tail rotor, hence its name, Notar.
It is so modern that it has not even been certified in the UK and is aimed
at the new breed of environmentally-conscious entrepreneur who wants to land
anywhere without flattening everything around.
True, it may guzzle Pounds 200 of gas an hour, but it's much quieter than
other 'copters and is also said to be safer - which may help keep down down
the life insurance premiums.
However, when it comes to revolutionary executive toys, the Dollars 755,000
Notar - bought by racing car-owner David Richards - is pretty small beer.
Last month Hanson Air sold its first Beech Starship - a futuristic aircraft
with its propellers back to front - to Tom Walkinshaw, another racing car
junkie.
Indeed, when it comes to being first with new-fangled machines, competition
in the air seems to be almost as fierce as on the race-track.
However, given that Walkinshaw's craft goes almost twice as fast as
Richards' chopper, and costs more than six times as much, there is little
doubt who has won the latest contest to impress. 'Dave has never been in
Tom's league,' said one old racing driver yesterday.

<TEXT>
Mr James Wood, an Englishman who heads America's quaintly named but poorly
performing Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, has suddenly found himself
thrust into one of the less enviable positions in US business.
The north-eastern supermarkets chain, usually known as the A&amp;P, has become a
prime target for the increasingly powerful US corporate governance movement,
which is beginning to have a big impact on the running of American business.
The movement, which brings together some of the largest institutional
investors in the US, tries to improve the financial performance of companies
by making their managements more accountable to shareholders.
Its muscle has been demonstrated most graphically by the recent forced
resignations of chief executives - IBM, American Express, Westinghouse and
General Motors - at least in part because of shareholder dissatisfaction
over their performance.
The movement is now in its most concentrated period of annual activism, the
so-called 'proxy voting season' of spring and early summer, when most
American corporations hold their annual shareholders' meetings.
This season is producing some of the most concerted shareholder action yet,
thanks partly to important changes by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which oversees the US securities industry, in the way 'proxy
contests' - shareholder voting battles at annual meetings - are waged.
The new rules, brought in last October, allow investors to band together
more easily, and give them greater flexibility in the tactics they use
against management.
A separate SEC change, forcing companies to reveal much more about their
executive pay practices, is giving investors a new stick with which to beat
the boards of poorly performing businesses.
The tussle at A&amp;P is a product of all this change. The Dollars 56bn New York
State pension fund, one of America's largest institutional investors,
recently announced that it would oppose the re-election of A&amp;P's directors
at the July annual meeting because of the group's underperformance. Thanks
to the SEC rule changes, it would urge other shareholders to do likewise.
The fund has no hope of victory, since A&amp;P is 53 per cent owned by Germany's
Tengelmann retailing group, which will presumably support the existing
directors. But strong backing for New York from other investors might at
least force A&amp;P to look at ways of improving its performance.
According to Mr Edward Regan, New York State's chief fiscal officer and
pension fund trustee, A&amp;P's efforts to deal with its problems are 'anaemic
and unacceptable'. Its managers, he adds, 'are guys that need a kick in the
pants on behalf of our beneficiaries'.
Three main factors lie behind the rapid rise of the corporate governance
movement, which only began its first tentative challenges to management at
the end of the 1980s. The first was the growth of institutional investment
in the 1970s and 1980s, and the decline of the small US shareowner, giving
big stakeholders immense potential clout.
The second was the 1980s takeover boom, which encouraged the managers of
weak companies to pay off corporate raiders, or erect 'poison pill' defences
around the business, irrespective of whether this was in shareholders'
interests.
The third was the rise of indexation - where fund managers invest in a
portfolio of stocks weighted according to a market index, such as the
Standard and Poor's 500, rather than trying actively to pick winners or sell
poorly performing stocks.
'Indexed equity portfolios invariably contain real dogs,' says Ms Carol
O'Cleireacain, New York City's finance commissioner. 'But one way to improve
our performance is to train these old dogs to do new tricks.' In other
words, exert pressure on management to run the company better.
Initially, companies were selected as targets on a somewhat subjective basis
 -what Mr Regan calls the corporation du jour syndrome.
One of the most important recent developments has been the adoption by
several large funds of more scientific, computer-based 'screens' to identify
poor performers.
A particularly elaborate model has just been set up by the New York state
fund, which is using it for the first time in its campaign against A&amp;P. The
three-stage screening process starts with a statistical review of a
company's performance; goes on to an examination of its corporate governance
and executive pay; and finishes with a consultant's report on the group's
long-term prospects under the existing management.
The Council of Institutional Investors, an activist umbrella organisation,
is looking at ways of sharing a similar service between all its members, so
that screening is not limited to the largest, richest funds. Ms Sarah
Teslik, the council's executive director, says screening will tend to
concentrate institutional attention more powerfully on the same group of
poorly performing managements.
But she hopes it may also help to broaden the corporate governance movement,
at present dominated by the big state employee pension funds and individual
activists, such as those belonging to the umbrella United Shareholders
Association.
Performance screens could provide a degree of statistical respectability to
help overcome the qualms of other investor groups, such as insurance
companies and mutual funds, which up to now have been wary of the
high-profile wave-making of the activists.
That said, the tactics of many activist institutions have mellowed over the
past year or so. Take, for example, the California Public Employees
Retirement System (Calpers), the largest public pension fund in America and
the most prominent shareholder activist.
In preparation for this year's proxy season, it decided to focus on 12
companies, chosen after a performance screening, which it did not
immediately name in public, and tried to get them to change through
discussions with their non-executive directors before filing proxy
proposals. In most of the cases it appears to have achieved its goals.
The main focus of concern for Calpers and many other activists, as
demonstrated by this year's resolutions, is the composition of a company's
board and its power structure. Their main aim is to curb the power of the
company's executive officers - particularly where the roles of chairman and
chief executive are combined - and give more weight to non-executive
directors.
At some companies investors are demanding that any new directors be
nominated by a committee composed entirely of non-executives; at others they
are calling for the separation of the jobs of chairman and chief executive,
or a non-executive chairman. And they are insisting that non-executives be
put in charge of director compensation at companies where this is not
already the policy.
They are getting results too: companies which two to three years ago
dismissed the activists as minor irritants are now more prepared quietly to
meet their demands and head off a proxy fight, having seen the muscle they
can command. An important demonstration was last autumn's decision by Sears,
Roebuck, the troubled retailing group, to spin off its financial services
business after two years of pressure from activist investors led by Mr
Robert Monks, a veteran of the shareholder movement.
The SEC's new rules give the institutions additional clout. 'They have very
fundamentally changed the proxy process - more so than I think even the SEC
staff realised,' says Mr John Wilcox, chairman of Georgeson &amp; Co, which
advises companies on proxy matters.
Under the old rules, if 10 or more holders of a company's stock discussed a
shareholder proposal, they were required to send a notice to all
stockholders and file documents with the SEC disclosing what they were
doing. It was a cumbersome and extremely costly process.
The new rules allow any number of shareholders to communicate orally without
these restrictions (some written material must still be filed with the SEC),
provided they are not seeking authority to cast the votes of others. They
also allow investors to announce in advance of a meeting how they will vote,
and why.
As a result, investors can now launch quick, informal proxy protest
campaigns, simply by issuing a public statement saying they will vote
against the directors of company X because of policy Y, and inviting others
to join them. That is precisely what happened at A&amp;P.
A similarly sudden protest campaign was mounted ahead of last week's annual
meeting at Paramount Communications, the media group led by Mr Martin Davis.
The public pension fund in the state of Wisconsin announced that it would
withhold its annual meeting vote for the four directors responsible for
Paramount's executive pay policy, on the grounds that the company's
'abysmal' investment performance did not justify the substantial incentive
bonuses they had paid management. And it sent notices to 150 other leading
shareholders urging them to do likewise.
The Paramount protest is one of the first fruits of the SEC's new rules on
the disclosure of executive compensation, which came into effect last autumn
amid mounting public concern that the pay of US chief executives was
spiralling out of control.
Companies must now provide a comprehensive new table disclosing the annual
salary, bonuses and all other compensation awards of its top five officers
over a three-year period and spell out stock option benefits more clearly.
The board committee in charge of compensation must also report on its pay
policies and say how compensation relates to executive performance. And the
proxy must include a graph showing total returns to shareholders over the
past five years, compared with returns from a broad market index (such as
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500) and an index of peer companies.
The protest at Paramount ended up as a damp squib - the directors were
re-elected with more than 98 per cent of the votes - but the link between
executive pay and performance is likely to be one of the hottest activist
issues over the next few months.
The ultimate test of all this wave-making is whether it leads to
significantly improved financial and share price performance at the target
companies. There is some evidence, albeit largely still anecdotal, to
suggest that it may.
If so, putting money into poorly performing companies and then agitating for
changes in corporate governance could become a significant investment
strategy over the next few years. Some investors on the cutting edge of the
governance movement are already moving in this direction. Calpers, for one,
is considering actively investing Dollars 1bn itself in underperforming
companies and putting cash in two similar outside funds.
One of these, called Lens Inc, was set up last year by Mr Monks, the Sears
campaigner, and acquired stakes in four companies with the aim of persuading
managements to improve corporate governance and change the group's strategy.
Two of them - Westinghouse and American Express - have since seen the forced
resignations of their chief executives, while the others, Sears and Eastman
Kodak, are in the throes of big shareholder-influenced restructurings. All
but Westinghouse have enjoyed strong share price performances since
initiating change, suggesting that good corporate governance may also be
excellent capitalism.
Indeed, several prominent business academics see in this trend the potential
seeds of a new compact between business and institutional shareholders,
which they have labelled 'relationship investing'. This involves an investor
making a large, long-term financial commitment to a company in return for a
say in the way it is run.
Corporate America, which complains that most shareholders are interested
only in short-term trading in and out of stocks, would get long-term
investor stability, while the institutions would get a better-run business.
The idea is hardly new (though its wholesale implementation would be). After
all, this kind of investing has long been practised by one of America's most
successful fund managers, Mr Warren Buffett.
It also has plenty of pitfalls. For example, many institutions could face
serious conflicts of interest if they became too closely involved in a
business. But at least it offers one way of ameliorating the antagonism
between the owners and managers of American business.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Leading Article: The choice over Russia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISIONS facing the Group of Seven countries now urgently conferring on
how to assist Russia may soon become both more difficult and more
inescapable. The west may have to choose between an anarchy created by
totalitarians and an autocracy run by democrats. This choice has to be made
in favour of those committed to reforming Russia.
Russia is caught in a war between a reforming government that bears
responsibility, but is almost powerless, and a reactionary parliament that
possesses power, but bears little responsibility for its use. The
constitution producing this slide to anarchy is a legacy of one of the most
centralised states in history. No less paradoxically, the forces exploiting
democracy are nostalgic for communism, while the leader battling with
parliament is the man who kept out the tanks during the August 1991 coup.
A popular referendum would, Mr Yeltsin hopes, reinforce his legitimacy as
the directly elected leader of Russia and allow him to to alter the
constitution and expedite economic reform. More power for the government
would mean suspension of a parliament that blocks its urgent measures and
subordination of the central bank and other institutions to the government's
will.
The west may soon have to choose between an obstructive parliament and a
government aiming to introduce the conditions for stable democracy,
including a market economy. It would have to choose Mr Yeltsin. It cannot
side with parliamentarians whose hard core is anti-market, anti-democratic
and anti-western. Democracies must back even authoritarian rulers if the
alternatives are worse.
Stable evolution
The larger question is this: if Mr Yeltsin imposes presidential rule, can it
work, in the sense of producing conditions for market reform and stable
democratic evolution? The answer is that he would succeed only if the
government pursued reform single-mindedly, if it took the reasons for reform
to the people in a much more effective way than at present and if the
assistance which the west is now debating were directed at alleviating the
suffering of the victims of reform.
There is no lack of voices in the centre of Russian politics which say that
President Yeltsin is already beyond 'saving' by western support; that the
country is in such an advanced state of disintegration that no central
power, presidency or congress, can lead it, and that the radical reform
strategy would be violently rejected if pushed through by an authoritarian
power.
Economic disintegration
These are substantial objections. Furthermore, the government is not the
only group with a plan for market reform: one benign effect of the past year
and a half has been that there now exists a free-market 'party' in
opposition, in which substantial figures like Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the
creator of the '500-day plan', play major roles. Time, however, is short, as
Mr Yeltsin underscored yesterday after his talks with President Francois
Mitterrand. Only an end to the debauching of the currency, combined with
continued privatisation, offers hope of averting an economic disintegration
that no democracy could hope to survive.
Russia is now disintegrating. Its regions increasingly go their own way. If
the central power continues to weaken, Russia will become ungovernable. Thus
the alternative to the effective exercise of power by Mr Yeltsin's
government is the west's chief nightmare: a nuclear-armed Russia under
xenophobic control or, worse, under no control at all.
There can be no guarantee that supporting the government will work, but the
west has too much to lose not to give vocal and effective assistance, up to
and including the point where the president concentrates authority in his
hands. If it had helped sooner and more aggressively, things might not have
reached this pass. Guarantees should be sought on early elections, a new
constitution and the firm grounding of democratic rule. But in foreseeable
circumstances, supporting Mr Yeltsin remains the west's only choice.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Letter: Hitch to contracting-out plans no red herring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Goodhart's article on the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations
('Tupe or not Tupe . . .', March 15) illustrates the problems that the
government's market-testing initiative has hit. It is ironic that some Tory
MPs are complaining that the Acquired Rights Directive is an
anti-competitive measure. One of the arguments behind its implementation was
to promote genuine competition across the Community. It is only regarded as
anti-competitive because the British government appears hell bent on
creating an offshore Taiwan in Europe.
Mr Waldegrave, minister for public service, continues to be one of the very
few trying to sell the idea that the Tupe regulations are a 'red herring'
that will have no impact on the market-testing programme.
Christopher Chope, his ex-colleague and fervent exponent of contracting-out,
is more reliable when he told a recent seminar that the European Court would
'drive a coach and horses through the competitive tendering legislation';
that he is 'working on the assumption that all contracts will be caught by
the Acquired Rights Directive'; and that he thinks 'it is a political
impossibility to get the 1977 directive amended'. The humiliating collapse
of the government's position in the South Glamorgan case ('Government admits
defeat over contracting-out case', March 16) is further evidence of the real
impact of Tupe.
This is a red herring that bites back.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Stepping in where others fear to tread: Richard Lapper
examines the rationale behind Zurich Insurance's latest deal in the UK
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior British insurance managers are prone to scratch their heads when
asked about the logic behind the latest deal in the UK by Zurich Insurance
of Switzerland, completed last week after months of negotiations.
Zurich, Europe's fourth-biggest insurance company, has taken over much of
the business of Municipal Mutual, the insurer owned by local authorities
which withdrew from the market last year. It had been hit by claims arising
from cases of arson in schools and accidents involving council employees
injured at work. Zurich is setting up a subsidiary, Zurich Municipal, to
handle the accounts of more than half Britain's councils.
On the surface, there might not seem much to commend the deal to the
financially strong Swiss group. But closer examination shows the business
logic behind the painstaking talks.
Neither side is prepared to disclose the price, but in return for what, in
the context of some recent European deals, appears to be a relatively modest
sum, Zurich has won access to about Pounds 300m a year in premium income,
and perhaps as much as 3 per cent of the entire UK insurance market.
More significantly the takeover gives Zurich the chance to develop its
innovative approach towards commercial insurance in the UK market. Rather
than the 'all products to all men' attitude favoured by traditional
insurers, Zurich focuses on the development of long-term relationships with
particular groups of commercial customers.
The company aims to provide a range of services to reduce risks and thereby
the likelihood of insurance claims. If successful the MMI deal and could
serve as a model for expansion in areas of the insurance market long
regarded by British companies as their private fiefdoms.
MMI turned to Zurich after being disappointed by potential UK rescuers. Last
year, the company stopped underwriting after posting losses of Pounds 240.3m
in 1991. A succession of UK companies examined its books and rejected any
link-up on the grounds that the risks were too high.
'We've been involved in council business over the years and we're still
paying for it,' said the manager of one UK company.
UK companies initially refused to offer even the most minimal emergency
cover to local councils without insurance. Underwriters at the Lloyd's
insurance market sold short-term cover at emergency rates. More recently,
brokers have persuaded some companies to accept council risks, at much
increased rates. 'We've picked up a few councils but we wouldn't want too
much of it. I just don't see the point in getting involved sorting out the
staff and everything,' says another senior insurance manager.
Zurich came to the rescue in October, after other options - such as the
little-known French mutual, Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires - had
evaporated. Several months of negotiations, during which Zurich carried out
a searching examination of MMI's business, have paved the way for the
takeover.
The arrangement is relatively simple: Zurich will take on to its staff the
1,500 employees of Municipal Mutual as well as all new insurance contracts.
It has bought MMI's Bournemouth offices and taken out leases on several
other properties. Through the rump of MMI, local authorities will retain
control of the reserves they have set aside to meet claims arising from old
policies and Zurich will simply administer old claims. Zurich will pay MMI a
percentage of all new premiums it earns over the next three years.
Mr Rolf Huppi, the 50-year-old chief executive of Zurich, has no doubts
about stepping into an area where the domestic market and others fear to
tread. But his enthusiasm for the deal has little to do with market share.
For Mr Huppi, the opportunity to acquire the insurance business of most UK
local councils offers Zurich an 'enormous opportunity' to develop his
company's approach to commercial insurance business.
'Very rarely do you get such a focused group of customers,' says Mr Huppi,
who has had two long spells in charge of Zurich's US operations and is
responsible for developing much of the strategy.
As well as insurance, Zurich Municipal will develop a range of customised
services for councils - from advice on how to reduce incidents such as
workplace injuries and minor road accidents to improvements in the physical
security of schools and other municipal buildings. Zurich will also advise
councils on how they can fund many small claims through self-insurance
schemes which can reduce costs.
'You have to be flexible enough to recognise that other services and
products are as legitimate as insurance products,' says Mr Eddie Hester,
general manager Zurich International (UK), the Zurich subsidiary which
originally developed this approach in the mid-1970s.
While traditional insurers sell a narrow range of insurance policies - such
as property insurance, liability insurance, accident insurance - often on
the basis of price to any customer, Zurich has adopted a targeted approach.
'It is best to focus on needs and risks of a particular group of customers
rather than trying to do everything,' says Mr Hester.
Zurich's international division, which directs its marketing to
multinationals, specialises in insuring chemical and pharmaceutical
companies. Its London subsidiary alone employs 15 loss advisers, trained as
engineers, many of whom have had first-hand experience in the chemical
industry. They provide technical advice on how companies can reduce their
risks.
Elsewhere, the group has developed profitable business in such unlikely
niches as Californian rice farmers, Wisconsin meat packers and US motor
dealers. A common feature is that Zurich aims to develop an intimate
knowledge of its customers' business.
Mr Steve Smith, chief executive of Universal Underwriters. a Zurich
subsidiary based in Kansas City, which sells insurance policies to 25 per
cent of US motor dealers, says that nearly 50 per cent of the company's
account executives have worked in motor dealerships themselves. 'People
live, sleep and breathe the customer,' said Mr Smith. Universal has taken
several measures to retain its customers. Its insurance policies are
specifically tailored, providing cover for many risks - such as possible
legal action from customers over faulty repair work - which might not be
covered in normal policies.
Universal is providing its clients with a computerised link-up with its
Kansas City head offices, which allows motor dealers to pay their premiums -
adjusted monthly to reflect the changing value of stock - and make claims
electronically. The development makes life easier for dealers but also makes
them more likely to stay with Universal.
'It makes the cost of switching very high for the customer,' says Mr Smith.
Motor dealers are also tied to Universal by being invited to become agents
to sell credit insurance and extended warranties to car buyers. Mr Smith
says dealers can increase their income significantly in some cases.
Zurich's strategy looks likely to become more popular in the industry during
the 1990s. With investment returns less reliable, insurers are likely to
come under increasing pressure to make their basic underwriting operations
profitable. The successful management and control of claims may be one of
the best ways of doing so. As insurers draw closer to their existing
customers to manage risk, they are also more likely to be able to retain
them.
These developments could pose a challenge for the increasingly 'risk averse'
UK insurers. Stung by record losses of Pounds 2bn in 1990-91, UK companies
have begun to put safety first, with the most successful company, Commercial
Union, directing its expansion towards low-risk and less-volatile life
assurance business, for example. If Zurich Municipal proves successful it
could encourage similar forays both by Zurich and by other international
groups in the UK market, further eroding the grip of UK insurers over 'big
ticket' business - the riskiest, but sometimes the most profitable.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Divide and rule: Businessmen lean towards Beijing, but the
people favour Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I've heard of people's capitalism, but this is ridiculous. On February 25
the Hong Kong government postponed publication of Chris Patten's political
reform bill, for the third time. Next day, the Hang Seng index shot up by
148.11 points. The delay in gazetting it, according to a commentator in the
pro-Beijing newspaper Wen Wei Po, 'caused great excitement among investors.
This showed that Hong Kong people wish to see Mr Patten's reform package
abandoned. . . .'
It is a strange, looking-glass world. One of the two reforms that Beijing
most strenuously objects to is the proposal to widen the franchise of the
'functional constituencies', which are to elect half the members of Hong
Kong's next Legislative Council (LegCo). Until now, many of these have been
capitalist rotten boroughs. In the business and industrial constituencies,
for instance, votes are cast not by individuals but by companies. Mr Patten
proposes to give the vote to individual company directors. And in nine new
constituencies, corresponding to broad sectors of economic activity, he
proposes that every worker should have a vote.
You might think this would appeal to communists: a measure to take some
power away from bosses, and give it to workers. But communist China is no
longer like that. It has reached the last chapter of Orwell's Animal Farm,
in which the animals looked from man to pig, and pig to man, and could no
longer see the difference. China's official slogans talk of the 'socialist
market economy', but there is little trace of socialism in the frantic
capitalist development that is now going on in China, unless it is the fact
that the local capitalist employer often combines the functions of mayor and
party secretary. All that is left of communism is the authoritarian
political structure.
Not surprisingly, then, it is Hong Kong's business community that is
vociferously ranged against Mr Patten, while opinion polls suggest that the
majority of the colony's population is still behind him. The business
community is acutely aware of the extent to which the colony's economy is
now bound up with that of the mainland. It is Hong Kong's unique position as
the privileged channel, both for Chinese exports and for foreign investment
in China, that is at the root of its extraordinary prosperity. Chinese
sovereignty holds few terrors for people who move millions of dollars in and
out of China every day. What does terrify them is the thought that Mr
Patten, by his quixotic last-minute effort to introduce democracy - in a
territory that has hitherto done very nicely without it, thank you - may
provoke Beijing into measures that will interfere with business.
Yet 'democracy' is a very grand word for what Mr Patten is trying to do, and
it is not one he himself uses. Even if his proposals were to be enacted
without amendment, only 20 out of 60 LegCo members in 1995 would be elected
in a normal, democratic way - that is, by universal suffrage in residential
constituencies. Twenty-one would be chosen by the old functional rotten
boroughs, made slightly less rotten by a gentle broadening of the franchise.
Nine would come from the new functional constituencies with mass electorates
of working people, who thereby gain representation through their profession
(an idea once associated with Italian fascism); and the remaining 10 would
be elected indirectly, by an 'election committee' itself composed of elected
officials, drawn mainly from the local district boards to be elected next
year.
China's rulers themselves are committed to introduce full democracy by
stages after their takeover in 1997. But obviously, once in charge, they
reckon to be able to control the process and keep out those leaders or
parties they find obnoxious. What worries them about even partial
democratisation under British rule is the fear that in 1997 they will find
themselves confronted with a LegCo dominated by their opponents. They have
not recovered from the shock of June 1989, when a million people in Hong
Kong demonstrated in support of the students in Tiananmen square, and a good
deal of Hong Kong money found its way to dissident organisations on the
mainland. Worse still, the same people who organized the demonstrations went
on to win 14 out of the 18 directly elected seats in LegCo in 1991.
That is still only 14 out of 60 members altogether. At present, they are
still easily outnumbered by the combined strength of the governor's
appointees and the representatives of conservative business interests.
Beijing's fear is that a broader franchise in 1995 might give them the
majority. It is probably groundless. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the main
liberal group, the United Democrats, believes his near-landslide victory in
1991 reflected partly an expression of revulsion against the Tiananmen
massacre, then still fresh in everyone's memory, and partly his opponents'
lack of organisation. Neither factor is likely to be repeated in 1995.
In any case, Mr Patten does not expect to get his package through unamended.
Either it will be modified in talks with Beijing - in which case he will
have the embarrassing task of forcing it through LegCo with business
support, against the protests of the liberals - or the conservative majority
in LegCo will themselves amend it in a way calculated to appease Beijing.
But he is determined to preserve a legislature with a degree of
independence, which he sees as the best safeguard for Hong Kong's freedom
after 1997. And he still hopes to persuade Beijing that it has to accept Mr
Lee and his friends as part of the reality of Hong Kong - unpalatable,
perhaps, but not unamenable, unless Beijing itself insists on making martyrs
of them.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Letter: Thurow view on US trade 'dangerous nonsense'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof WILLEM H BUITER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When Lester C Thurow (Personal View, March 10) makes recommendations
for US macroeconomic and trade policy, he writes dangerous nonsense.
First, there is his statement that a 4 to 4.5 per cent rate of growth is an
absolute necessity if President Clinton is to create growing job
opportunities and rising real wages for the 80 per cent male workforce that
did not participate in the economic gains of the 1970s and 1980s. We may
anticipate, or at least hope for, a one or two-year period of cyclical
recovery during which the growth rate of GDP is maintained at the 4.8 per
cent level of the last quarter of 1992. It is a pipe-dream to believe that
the US is capable of sustaining over an extended period of time an average
annual rate of growth of 4 to 4.5 per cent.
Over the period 1948-90 the average annual growth rate was just above 3.2
per cent. Even the growth rates achieved in the halcyon days of the 1950s
(with an average annual growth rate of 4 per cent) and the 1960s (with an
average annual growth rate of 4.1 per cent) were at the lower end of Mr
Thurow's range.
Furthermore, one of the consequences of the 12 wasted Reagan-Bush years has
been a weakening of the supply side of the economy. While it should be
possible to do somewhat better during the next 10 years than the average 2.6
per cent growth rate of the 1980s, it is dangerous to declare an obviously
infeasible growth rate to be a necessary condition for real wage growth and
expanding job opportunities for those who lost out during the 1980s.
Desirable feasible policies are endangered that way. Much good can be
achieved at a post-recovery average annual growth rate of 3 per cent. It all
depends on the composition of the growth.
Second, there is the statement that the US could expect a huge surge of
imports if it were to succeed in growing much faster than the rest of the
industrial world. This proposition need not be correct when the higher
growth is supply-driven. (Japan managed to grow faster than the rest of the
industrial world for decades without drowning in imports).
Even when the higher growth is demand-driven, the proposition holds only if
the source of the demand stimulus is expansionary fiscal policy or an
exogenous boost to some other component of domestic final demand, not if it
is expansionary monetary policy.
Third, there is the statement that if one looks at the relationship between
output and employment in American manufacturing, every Dollars 45bn in extra
manufactured imports essentially costs the American economy 1m jobs. For
nonsense statements like this (attributing one-way causality to a
co-movement between two endogenous variables), undergraduates properly flunk
their intermediate economics courses. What on earth is the counter-factual
policy scenario that produces Dollars 45bn in lost imports and 1m extra
jobs?
Like Mr Thurow, I would like to see a co-ordinated fiscal and monetary
expansion in the industrial world (my preference would be for monetary
expansion in the US, Germany and Japan, fiscal contraction in the US and
Germany and fiscal expansion in Japan).
Unlike Mr Thurow, I do not favour 'direct action' by President Clinton if
such co-ordinated action cannot be arranged promptly. Surely 'direct
action', taking 'whatever actions are necessary' and 'decoupling the
locomotive from the rest of the world's economic train' are code-words for
protectionism, import controls etc.
What America and the rest of the world do not need is a trade war, motivated
by screwball economic analysis and a defensive, little-America outlook. The
Japanese are good enough to produce large and rising trade surpluses. Some
part of the industrial world ought to be doing so, if the urgently needed
net resource transfers to the developing countries, eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union are to materialise.
It is of course desirable for the Japanese to abandon their protectionist
practices, in order that their trade (imports and exports) may expand,
without, however, endangering the desirable Japanese external surplus.
I fervently hope no one in a position of policy responsibility is listening
to Mr Thurow.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Letter: Older people often make better workers than the
young
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARC THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was not surprised to read of the increase in the operation of age
bars in job advertisements ('Jobseekers over the hill at 45', March 15).
Employers faced with a large pool of potential labour will invariably use
some method to reduce the cost of recruitment. An age bar is one of the
cheapest mechanisms that influences supply to the firm.
On grounds of efficiency employer behaviour may thus be seen as rational
(and to be forgiven). In terms of equity, however, employers can be
criticised for disallowing certain age groups equal access to the
competition for jobs.
My own research shows that employers' perceptions of age-related performance
are based on inaccurate stereotypes. For example, contrary to the prevailing
stereotype, older people tend to have lower turnover rates, less frequent
absence for sickness, higher commitment and better time-keeping than younger
people. Thus, employers' belief that younger people are a 'better bet' may
be ill-founded and their behaviour may actually be inefficient.
My advice to the European Commission would be that if they want to 'hold on
to employees for several years' they may find it less costly and more
efficient to employ an older person.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Arts: Whose violence is it anyway? - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are riding the crest of one of those waves of national hysteria which
periodically affect the nation when, with gleeful prodding from parts of the
old print medium (slowly but inexorably giving way before the competitive
edge of the new electronic mass media which work faster and wider, though
without the depth of print) people turn angrily on television - the thing on
which the British population now spends more of its time than anything
except working and sleeping - and blame it for the violence which has
characterised mankind since the dawn of history. Unfair? Television is only
to blame for an intensification of violence or a statistical increase? We
shall come to that.
Consider first a small but telling example from last weekend's Independent
on Sunday. The lead letter was headed 'To see the influence of TV violence,
visit a playground' and it began: 'As a teacher I come across many children
from happy homes who have television in their bedrooms and watch until
closedown. These children watch an unadulterated diet of violence, sex, rape
and torture, and the next morning act it out in the playground'. Leaving
aside the fact that there is no such thing as closedown since ITV
transmissions continue round the clock, this teacher is either a non viewer,
a liar, or so consumed by the national hysteria that he (or she, let's say
he) honestly
believes that British television transmits violence, sex, rape and torture
unadulterated. Consider last night's schedules.
BBC1 offered Neighbours, The News, the travel programme Holiday, EastEnders,
Carla Lane's new 'comedy' series Luv, A Question Of Sport, The News, and
Budget Broadcast which took us up to 9.40 when a repeat of Smith And Jones,
began. That comedy may have contained some Tom And Jerry style violence, it
often does, and there may have been more in Harry Enfield's Television
Programme which followed. The most likely candidate for a true taste of the
teacher's 'unadulterated diet' was the American television drama Glitz which
began at 10.40, since it claimed to be about a 'hard nosed Miami policeman'
confronting a 'seedy underworld'.
BBC2, ITV and Channel 4 offered similar mixtures with comedy, wildlife,
foreign reports, news and the arts all in evidence and few slots where
violence might crop up, so is that letter not truly an example of hysteria?
What other explanations are there? Teachers being what they are these days,
perhaps this one simply does not know what 'unadulterated' means, or maybe
he is thinking about the material available on satellite and cable services,
though the overwhelming bulk of their material, at least on the non-pay
channels, is similar to that on the terrestrial channels. If older.
Of course it is possible in 1993, if you are determined to do so, to find
yourself the sort of diet that the teacher describes. If you are willing to
go to the cinema, hire videos, or cough up for pay-TV movie channels via
satellite or cable (the penetration in Britain is still slight and the
number of children with pay-TV in their bedrooms must be minuscule) then you
can, indeed, find plenty of the material discussed by our film critic, Nigel
Andrews, in last Saturday's Weekend FT. But anyone who dedicates his life to
monitoring the output of British television knows that there is less
violence on the small screen today than there was 15 or 20 years ago. Were
you to make today many of the episodes of The Sweeney, Starsky And Hutch,
Target or The Professionals that were made in the mid-1970s, they would not
be accepted for screening.
So far as I can make out (and I would no more choose to watch Silence Of The
Lambs than stick my head down the lavatory) Hollywood and the video industry
are turning out more and more material in which violence is the chief
ingredient, and present for its own sake rather than a means to an end as in
Westerns or war movies. The trouble is that, thanks to the national
hysteria, television is being blamed for the nastiness of the film and video
industries.
Television is a part of the world in which we live. In news and current
affairs programmes it shows us more violence in a year than most Britons in
previous generations saw in a lifetime. Nor are the pictures limited to
factual programmes. The last episode in BBC1's recent run of its mass-appeal
Saturday evening drama Casualty became famous for showing a band of young
thugs invading the hospital's casualty department and finally burning it
down. As with most Casualty episodes this was well acted and vividly staged,
though the activities of the violent youths did seem worryingly motiveless.
Perhaps that was the point. On Sunday, Channel 4 showed the 1990 movie The
Krays which included several scenes of explicit violence involving fists and
even
swords, shot in pretty revolting
closeup.
So which way round is the 'copycat' effect working? We know that the Kray
twins and their nasty exploits are a ghastly reality. Perhaps their
behaviour in real life resulted from reading too many American horror
comics, one of the favourite culprits before television . . . but then how
did Cain come to kill Abel, too many violent papyri? We know that Britain
has suffered some appalling inner city riots in recent years, as in every
century of recorded history. These dramas are telling us about some of the
facts of life around us.
But are they also 'de-sensitising' viewers and inducing them to copy such
violent exploits? We know that the effect upon some is precisely the
opposite: the more violence they watch, the more hostile to it they become.
We know this because they are forever telling us so. In their roles as
public guardians people such as Lord Rees-Mogg and Mary Whitehouse watch
even more violent television than most of us, yet the more they watch the
more they loathe it. It seems that any causal connection is not
straightforward.
This should be pointed out each time they trot out the old 'television sells
butter so it must sell violence' routine. Doubtless they themselves eat
butter yet are not violent, so what kind of 'proof' is this? Television
commercials sell things that people are known to want by using jokes,
jingles, pictures and endorsements which the advertisers know the viewers
are predisposed to approve. So far as violence goes, television can clearly
demonstrate technique, whether in rocking and turning a car to form a
barricade or smashing a beer glass to use as a weapon. But can it make you
want to do these things? It never has that effect upon Lord Rees-Mogg, Mary
Whitehouse or me - what about you?
Perhaps it is just a small minority of suggestible youths with no war to
fight who are turned on to violence by television? But Geoffrey Pearson's
book Hooligan shows with extensive documentation that fears about the
growing lawlessness of young men, and the absurd leniency of the laws, have
been expressed by every generation back through the Victorians, who were
worried by the new phenomenon of 'hooligans', to ancient Rome and Greece
where gangs of 'Greens' and 'Blues' at opposite ends of the chariot racing
stadiums would cause mayhem.
Surely in the end we must rely upon common sense. In a country where mothers
in the street habitually smack their toddlers to induce obedience, where
children in fee-paying schools are beaten with sticks to make them do what
they are told, a country which has for centuries sent out its young men with
guns and bayonets to settle matters of international disagreement, does it
really seem likely that 50-year-old television is largely to blame if some
teenagers conclude that violence is the way to get what you want?

FT  17 MAR 93 / Arts: The Met's new 'Ariadne' - Opera in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The one success among the Met's new productions this season is almost
naughtily sure. Ariadne auf Naxos is wholly about giving the audience what
it wants: the unseen proprietor - the Viennese grandee for whom the stage
entertainment is supposedly being prepared and enacted - is in reality each
spectator in his or her seat. We ask to be amused, touched, stirred,
charmed, lulled, and Strauss does it all. So it is perfectly appropriate
that this New York version should be directed unashamedly at the musical and
dramatic pleasure centres.
Ion Marin sustains the sweet nostalgia of the orchestral part, and balances
it well to achieve a combination of richness and delicacy; there is the
right sense that what we are hearing is something precious and slightly too
small, a marvellous chamber arrangement of a symphonic score. The
opening-night cast, American except for Ragnar Ulfung as the Major Domo,
could hardly have been more suitable.
Jessye Norman had only to play herself as operatic grande dame: swift, with
what was for her an unusual incisiveness, in the prologue; statuesque and
magnificent, rolling out the long phrases without any pretence of real
suffering, as Ariadne. Ruth Ann Swenson had all the brilliance and agility
needed to complement her as Zerbinetta, but also the strength and fullness
to come somewhere near matching her. As Bacchus, it was a nice touch that we
should have a surprise, since Thomas Moser has hitherto made his career
largely in Europe and as a Mozart tenor: he proved to have all the stature
and stamina needed for this part, while maintaining a brightness and care
for tone and phrasing. Thomas Stewart, too, was neatly chosen to elicit
affection as the Music Master.
Susanne Mentzer was the Composer, and I suppose in an ideal world her voice
would be a notch bigger and descend with confidence a semitone or two
further. But one asks too much: this was a glorious performance, and
strikingly different from the Octavian she had been presenting in this
theatre until less than a week before. In Rosenkavalier there was always a
smile and a bounce in her singing; in Ariadne she showed a different kind of
youthfulness - ardour, directed energy, clear focus - and the difference was
there as much in her voice as in her stage personality. She caught the steel
of ambition that would make an apprentice artist capitulate to occasion.
But it was the production, by Elijah Moshinsky in designs by Michael
Yeargan, that seemed most conspicuously to want to please the audience, with
an aptness that would have seemed distastefully cynical in the performance
of a work by any other composer. The first act takes place in a huge
architectural cross-section to out-Zeffirelli the Met's Tosca: one sees part
of a grand stairway, the back stage of the private theatre, and the
below-stairs arrangements of the artists. There is plenty of bustle with
supernumaries. People are having trouble hoisting up a backdrop for the
performance in the theatre; the Major Domo has a swim of servants after him;
the pantomime troupe is expanded to include a rubber-limbed, juggling
Pierrot and several children as miniature Harlequins and Zerbinettas. It is
the sight of a boy Harlequin that, in a pretty moment, first hints to the
Composer that something is amiss.
No subterfuge is used to suggest that the second part of the piece takes
place in the theatre we have seen being readied in the first. Instead of a
cloth backdrop, we are treated to sliding panels, by means of which a night
sky, with the constellations figured as on an old star map, can part to
reveal a cloudscape or, for the finale, a screamingly vulgar sunset. The
nymphs glide on to the set and off again atop high built-up costumes: they
look like candles, and turn the production's irony towards campness. Ariadne
is swathed in black-purple to leave the full accent on her facial profile.
But why Bacchus should arrive looking like the Flying Dutchman is less easy
to explain, unless as a demonstration that by now in this opera nothing
matters except the projection of meaningless golden sound.
'Ariadne auf Naxos' will be broadcast live from The Met on Radio 3, Saturday
6.30 pm

FT  17 MAR 93 / Arts: Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love
 -Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Love in the time of - no, not cholera, but AIDS, sex-killings, bulimia and
answering machines. That is this play's theme, and the first thing to say is
that, remarkably enough, it gives its audience a good time.
It has the suspense of a thriller, some impressive interweaving of different
dramaturgical devices, a ready store of ironic humour, and constant
seriousness about love between friends. It is also, at the Hampstead
Theatre, well performed in this, the Traverse Theatre production that was so
successful in Edinburgh last year. I hardly care to add that, nonetheless,
the play itself is not particularly good - and I will put off saying why.
Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love, a 1990 play, is by
34-year-old Canadian playwright Brad Fraser. Set in Edmonton, Alberta, it
pivots around two room-mates, David, an actor-cum-waiter, and Candy, a book
critic. Though they once had an affair, he is gay and is cynical enough not
to be looking for love. She, by contrast, thinks she is looking for it,
whether from a handsome bartender or a devoted lesbian admirer. David's
world includes hookers, drugs and rough sex. Meanwhile, out there in
Edmonton, a rapist is killing women. It is easy for David to hear of these
murders, but he prefers not to.
We start to assume that the ripper is among the dramatis personae: which
lends a definite whodunnit tension to proceedings. But what makes the play
yet more absorbing is that it shows how dangerously touched by misogyny
other male characters are too. You see it brewing up, for example, in
Candy's bartender lover after she firsts rejects him; and later he hits her.
Yet, though this makes her reject him again, she soon finds herself hitting
her lesbian admirer. Fraser's play abounds in this kind of irony.
Repeatedly, it shows the overlaps between normal and abnormal behaviour.
David's pal Kane asks what he did last night. Drily, David replies, 'Got
drunk, fucked some guy in a park, dressed up as a cowboy, and watched some
guy beat up Benita.' Of course you laugh at this ludicrous account - the
more because you know it to be true. And the irony is compounded by the ways
we witnessed it - sometimes hearing him narrate it in the present tense.
Elsewhere other characters, suddenly spotlit, voice his thoughts, as if
becoming the complex echoes of his mind. Everything adds up to illustrate
David's own dreadful escapism, dreadful not least because he refuses to
admit that the one friend to whom he is most loyal, Bernie, may well be the
ripper.
Though the opening is too fancy, the play soon proceeds to hold its audience
in a light, firm grasp. Ian Brown's staging perfectly realises the way in
which Fraser shows us several 'scenes' at once, the way he interleaves
first-person soliloquy, third-person narration and straight you-and-me
scene-playing. Not all the Canadian accents are flawless - rare is the Brit
who can say 'How now brown cow' like a true Canadian - but this never
becomes a serious problem. All the performances, notably Dougray Scott's as
David, are assured and convincing.
So why do I say this is not a good play? Because the humour, though really
funny, is sometimes too cute, too TV-comedy pat. Because the characters seem
all to be 'types' from textbooks. Because whatever ought to make them
individual, such as the fact that Candy is a book critic, is never fleshed
out. Because Edmonton itself is never fleshed out. Because, as is obvious,
such characters as Jerri (the lesbian) and Robert (the bartender) are merely
plot devices. Because, for that matter, so is everyone else. It is to
everyone's credit that these flaws never distract you as you watch.
At the Hampstead Theatre, for a limited run

According to the people who made today's Nature programme on BBC2, Cairo 'is
known to her proud inhabitants as 'the mother of the megacities' '. You can
imagine the Egyptians, can't you, down on the street corners working the
words into every other sentence. What the programme makers mean by the
phrase is a city with more than 10m inhabitants, serving as an example of
the 'megacities' which they expect to be home for half the world's
population by the year 2000. They say that Cairo's crime rate is low, there
is no homelessness, and that it is only when western style solutions to
urban problems are imposed without thought for the environment that they
fail (7.30). Dispatches (9.00 C4) paints a very different urban portrait of
Manchester's Moss Side where the unemployment level among young black men is
85 per cent and the availability of heroin, crack and cannabis attracts
customers from 50 miles around. Guns can be bought for as little as Pounds
200 and the users may be as young as 14. BBC2's drama Mr Wroe's Virgins
about a 19th century religious weirdo moves onto 'Martha's Story' (9.25).

FT  17 MAR 93 / Arts: Sarah Walker and Sara Fulgoni - Two mezzo recitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The post-war British singers who proved themselves the equals in recital of
any in Europe are gradually handing over to the younger generation. What
they achieved looks secure. Students today are often prepared to sing in
most of the main European languages and to go and do so throughout Europe,
too.
Over the weekend two British mezzos at different points in their careers
showed what they can do at the Wigmore Hall. For Sarah Walker the occasion
marked 25 years on the London concert platform. She gave two recitals, of
which I saw the first on Thursday - a happy evening, if not as frivolous as
the programme may have suggested. Its cover showed a cartoon with the singer
as a fairy and her expert accompanist, Roger Vignoles, as a pixie sitting on
a toadstool.
Not to be outdone by any younger rivals, she sang in Italian, German,
French, English and Czech during the course of the evening. Her German, in
particular, was scrupulously clear. A substantial group of Schumann songs,
which comprised the Mary Stuart Lieder and a few favourites including a
sensitive 'Der Nussbaum', was immaculately prepared, but it is difficult to
say that they went to the heart.
On either side were a vivid account of Haydn's 'Arianna a Naxos' and some
rather camp Poulenc. But the best was Britten's A Charm of Lullabies, for
nobody could catch better their sentiment or the malevolent gleam in the
nanny's eye for the penultimate song. Wholehearted singing in Dvorak's Gypsy
Songs followed. Then came bouquets, a birthday cake topped by an iced prima
donna and the encores, including one about fairies at the bottom of the
garden. From the programme cover we should have guessed.
On Monday the Wigmore Hall played host to a mezzo at the outset of her
career. Sara Fulgoni has already attracted attention in operatic productions
at the Royal Northern College of Music and here she was appearing as winner
of the 1991 Edward Boyle Music Award. For one so young the voice is
remarkable. Like the royal velvet red dress that the tall Miss Fulgoni wore
so elegantly, it has a fullness, a richly luminous texture.
The sheer amount of tone, generously produced, was more than Gordon Crosse's
Voice from the Tomb called for; the loneliness, the frightening inner
silence of Stevie Smith's poetry was largely left unprobed. It was a clever
idea, though, to move from these poems about birds and frogs to Poulenc's Le
Bestiaire and Chabrier's rosy pigs and big fat turkeys, all done in decent
French with some aplomb.
Most promising was Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder, as the voice seems generally
happiest singing out in grand style. At first the phrasing was on the short
side; but from the third song it started to stretch out with a truly
Wagnerian span. Steven Maughan, the singer's otherwise effective
accompanist, might have done still more there to keep up with his singer's
vocal opulence. That, in itself, says much for Miss Fulgoni's exceptional
prowess.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: The world's tap seizes up -
Demand for fresh water is growing worldwide as the supply is drying up.
Bronwen Maddox begins a series exploring the quality and cost of this scarce
resource
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Water, like energy in the 1970s, will probably become the most critical
natural resource issue facing most parts of the world by the start of the
next century.
That bald and disturbing prediction, based on rising population growth and
pollution, comes from the United Nations Environment Programme. It is
contained in the survey of the world's environment, released last year.
Nor is UNEP alone in warning that water resources, which tend to be taken
for granted, are coming under strain. A recent report for the European
Commission argued just that European growth could be constrained by a lack
of fresh water caused by industrial and agricultural contamination.
But Tom Garvey, deputy director general of the environment directorate in
Brussels, speaking at this week's Financial Times European water conference,
stressed that the Commission was also increasingly aware of the high cost of
raising water standards further.
As such statements make clear, the economic and political pressures
accompanying the growing demand for water are the focus of growing worldwide
attention.
UNEP makes a good case that fresh water resources are scarce. The proportion
of the planet's water that is fresh rather than salt is tiny: only some 2.6
per cent. Nor is it easy to reach: more than 99 per cent is held as ice or
snow at the poles or is underground, and almost half the rest is locked up
in living organisms, soil and air vapour. The rest is in rivers and lakes
but poorly distributed across the surface of the world - Lake Baikal in
Siberia, roughly the size of Belgium, accounts for a fifth.
Meanwhile, demand for fresh water is rising, spurred mainly by population
growth in developing countries and by the spread of agriculture. According
to UNEP, the world's use of fresh water increased nearly fourfold in the
last 50 years to 4,130 cubic kilometres a year.
Agriculture soaked up more than two thirds of the total - the area of
irrigated land has increased by more than a third in the last two decades.
The growth in Asian demand is the fastest, and by 2000 UNEP expects Asia to
use nearly two thirds of the world's water compared with just over half now.
The increase in pollution in many countries is aggravating shortages
further. A worldwide monitoring scheme, backed by UNEP and the World Health
Organisation among other UN agencies, suggests that as many as 10 per cent
of all rivers monitored are polluted.
One of the biggest problems in both industrialised and developing countries
is contamination by agricultural chemicals. The nutrients nitrogen and
phosphorus lead to algal blooms - such as those that recently disfigured the
Venetian and Baltic coasts - which kill river life by stripping oxygen out
of the water. Organochlorine pesticides are also a concern as they
accumulate in the food chain; UN agencies report that rivers in some
developing countries such as Colombia, Malaysia and Tanzania show higher
levels than in European rivers.
Poorly managed irrigation can also lead to salinisation and degradation of
agricultural soils, and irrigation remains notoriously inefficient, with
around half of the water lost by seepage or evaporation before it reaches
the fields.
Industrialised countries have the additional problems of high levels of
poisonous heavy metals such as mercury - the rivers Rhine and Meuse are
considered to be two of the most polluted in Europe.
While signatories to last year's treaties on marine pollution and dumping
were divided about the deep seas' ability to absorb pollution, there is more
agreement that the world's fresh water cannot adequately dilute these levels
of pollution, and pollution control is needed to meet future demand for
water.
Despite these strains, some standards have improved. During the 1980s, the
number of people without clean water has declined from 1.8bn to 1.3bn in the
1980s out of the total population of some 5bn. Two-thirds of people living
in towns now have access to sanitation compared with 56 per cent in 1980.
A big worldwide dam-building programme has helped to increase supplies: the
world's rivers and lakes now feed into 36,000 large dams, half in China,
compared with just over 5,200 dams 40 years ago, of which eight were in
China. However, high population growth has held back the improvement in
sub-Saharan Africa, while conditions in parts of Latin America are also
critical, where little urban domestic waste is treated.
Pollution control in industrialised countries has also shown some success:
the Rhine and Meuse have seen concentrations of lead and zinc, arsenic,
copper and mercury fall in the past 10 years. However, Garvey said that 'in
spite of the efforts over the past two decades, it is disappointing that the
state of the aquatic environment in the Community has not improved to the
extent expected'.
There are signs in some regions that pressure on fresh water supplies is
beginning to hold back development. The UN, which estimates that water use
is now growing at less than 1 per cent a year compared with 2.3 per cent in
the mid 1970s, attributes the slowdown to shortages of water suitable for
irrigation as well as to recession.
It is also becoming clear that the cost of cleaning up and avoiding
shortages is much higher than some early estimates decades ago suggested.
The UK water industry has embarked on a decade-long programme of
improvements which may eventually cost more than Pounds 45bn in 1990 prices.
Around half of that is driven by European Community environmental
directives; water companies and ministers across Europe now ask whether some
of those standards are unnecessarily high.
The Commission's environment directorate said on Monday that it would review
almost all of its water directives this year in response to the charge that
some were set more by environmental enthusiasm than by science.
However, even extensive dam building and pollution control - if it can be
afforded - will not solve all resource problems. Many regions pursue water
policies that are inefficient or could prove hard to sustain - such as
Israeli exports of citrus fruit, or rice-growing in southern California -
purely for social or economic reasons like earning hard currency, preserving
a traditional industry or preventing migration from the countryside to the
town.
In other regions, political tensions are likely to grow over the control of
water supplies, even if ways are found to increase supplies. Nearly half the
world's land is fed by water basins that cross national borders and well
over 200 countries share important rivers and lakes.
Natasha Beschorner, in an illuminating pamphlet last year entitled 'Water
and Instability in the Middle East' for the International Institute for
Strategic Studies, comments: 'Water is a useful reminder of dependency.' She
adds: 'Israel, Turkey and Egypt . . . have little incentive to concede what
they regard as a strategic asset, namely priority usage,' although she
argues that water resources, overshadowed by the region's other political
problems, can be overstated as a source of tension.
Many have also forecast future political instability in the Central Asian
republics of the former Soviet Union. The five countries Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan share two rivers, the
Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, and the Aral sea, once the earth's fourth
largest inland body of water. The sea has lost nearly two thirds of its
volume in the past three decades as the rivers that feed it are drained for
growing cotton, which is sold overseas to raise hard currency.
Beschorner is right that prophesies of crisis from water shortages are
easily and too frequently made. However, the complexity of the problems
across both the developed and developing world supports UNEP's belief that
the question of where clean water will come from next - and how much it will
cost - will remain high on the international agenda.
The series will continue next week by examining water supply in the United
States.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Testing time for air pollution
 -Peter Knight examines new methods to gauge emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More accurate instruments for measuring air pollution, which often give
higher readings than expected, are troubling many companies which may have
to spend more than anticipated on controlling emissions.
This is especially true in the chemicals and petrochemicals sectors, which
are under pressure to reduce air pollution levels (mainly volatile organic
compounds). VOCs are the vapours given off by chemicals used in industry
such as solvents and petrol. These collect in the atmosphere and react with
sunlight to form photochemical smog and low-level ozone.
'The new measuring techniques enable businesses to assess realistically what
their losses of high-cost products are, whereas they only had estimates
before,' says Peter Woods, head of environment standards at the UK's
National Physical laboratory.
It is this precise knowledge - in some cases much higher than traditional
estimates - that is worrying refinery owners and bulk chemical
manufacturers. Governments are attempting to meet UN targets for cuts in air
pollution and these companies have to be seen to act on new information
about the extent of their emissions. However, there are often insufficient
funds to pay for the necessary improvements to factories and plants.
'The business has to make a decision about the cost of losing its products
versus the cost of saving them. If you are losing Pounds 1m a year in
product, but it is going to cost Pounds 20m to save it, then you are
probably going to wait until after the recession before you start spending,'
says Woods.
The pressure is growing because the UK government is thinking of specifying
the instruments as part of a legal obligation in the Environmental
Protection Act. This says companies must control pollution by using the
'best available techniques not entailing excessive cost'.
Joe Draper, health, safety and environment manager for Shell Chemicals UK,
says there is some scepticism about the accuracy of new instruments. 'Some
of the readings are above our conventional estimates, but others are below
or about the same. There is still a great deal of investigation needed
before we can come to any definitive statement about their accuracy.'
There are four main techniques for measuring pollution and product losses.
Simple accounting - measuring what goes in and what comes out of a process.
Point monitoring - measurements on emissions or output from specific points
in the process, such as the chimney.
Ambient measuring - catching gases in tubes and analysing them.
Remote monitoring - measuring certain gases from a distance.
Significant advances are being made in remote techniques. One of the most
important is a system called Dial, developed by the National Physical
Laboratory with funding from government and industry. Dial, a laser-based
system, measures gas concentrations up to 3km away. The system is useful in
locating unknown leaks.
'Certain storage tanks, for example, that industry thought were sound, are
now found to be leaking,' says Mike Woodfield, business centre manager at
the Warren Spring Laboratory.
This type of news worries managers who find it difficult to raise funds to
invest in a broad range of expected environmental improvements and do not
appreciate surprise information from new instruments. But Draper says if the
new instruments are right and more product is being lost, this makes it
easier to justify the cost of reducing emissions.
Woods agrees there is some scepticism, but other companies see the
instruments becoming a necessary part of their armoury to demonstrate their
levels of emissions.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Management: One step ahead of the pack - How T&amp;N handles R&amp;D
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A country mansion in Warwickshire might seem an unlikely setting for some
timely good news about British manufacturing. But Cawston House, the base of
T&amp;N Technology, is a world away from the sort of isolated rural
establishment once so beloved of UK corporate research and development
departments. This utilitarian, market-driven unit has been central to T&amp;N's
successful drive for a growing share of the global motor component business.
Technological innovation is especially vital to T&amp;N's competitiveness
because the company specialises in components which are critical to a
vehicle manufacturer's ability to make changes in the design of its engines
and braking systems. 'Our customers insist on suppliers having a particular
level of R&amp;D activity and technical reputation, before they even allow them
to bid for contracts,' says Bill Everitt, the T&amp;N board director responsible
for technology.
But it is not so much the level of this spend - examined on this page last
Friday - as its effectiveness that has helped T&amp;N buck the miserable
competitive trend suffered by manufacturers in so many British industries.
But why does T&amp;N do a sizeable part of its R&amp;D centrally, rather than making
each of its three divisions, or the 11 product groups beneath them,
responsible for all their own R&amp;D? Everitt replies unequivocally: 'Because
it's more efficient and productive to do it that way in terms of people,
knowledge, skills, equipment and - most important - speed.'
Unlike many other companies which claim spurious internal synergy, T&amp;N's
product groups really do share technology. They need similar or identical
expertise in materials, design processes, manufacturing techniques and
measurement processes - all of which are moving fast but expensively, thanks
to the quest for lighter, cheaper and reliable products.
In materials surface technology, for instance, 'virtually all our products
move against something else - they mate with it', says Alec Parker, managing
director of T&amp;N Technology. 'So we can read our advancing knowledge about
materials, lubrication and so forth across the various businesses.'
Together with the 15 per cent of Cawston's current Pounds 7m annual spend
which goes on research, this work on what T&amp;N calls 'enabling technologies'
generates about 60 patents a year. The rest of T&amp;N's Pounds 34m R&amp;D spend
goes on applications engineering, testing and other activities in the
businesses.
The close commercial relevance of Cawston's work is guaranteed by a series
of mechanisms. First, virtually all the work is funded on an individual
project basis by the product groups around Britain and the rest of the
world, rather than by T&amp;N's head office.
Second is the method of project selection. Each project is determined in
detail at an annual meeting by a mixture of specific input from a product
group's sales engineers and managing director and Cawston's knowledge of
market trends, gained via its direct meetings with leading T&amp;N customers.
The third mechanism is detailed project control. The basic document for this
is a one-page 'why sheet' on which the first item gives the commercial
'why?' of the project. Technical objectives and quantified target benefits
are also summarised, together with costs, responsibilities and a timescale
for checking the project's progress throughout the year.
Contact between Cawston and the product groups is more or less constant.
Small teams from each group are always visiting Cawston, which is also used
as a training ground for engineers to move into the businesses.
Although some of the projects are scheduled to last two to three years, they
are not just reviewed in detail each quarter, but re-justified every year.
Parker touches on every general manager's nightmare about R&amp;D when he says:
'We dislike projects which go on forever with no conclusion.' Everitt puts
it more forcefully: 'Alec's people have to do their work within the
timescale and cost that they said they would.'
This control process was in operation six years ago in some of the group's
businesses, 'but not all of them believed in the quarterly business
reviews', says Everitt. 'It's been a question of persuading everyone to do
it.'
On the productivity of development work, T&amp;N's main measure is 'the rate per
unit cost at which new products, processes and services are generated that
enhance the prospects of the company relative to the competition'. These
loose bones are given somewhat firmer flesh every year by a detailed
analysis of the rate and cost of innovation, broken into different types of
project.
Cost-benefit analyses of Cawston's work are done frequently, and generally
show a return of about twice the expenditure on it. Controversially,
however, full investment analysis on individual projects is done rarely.
Everitt says there is little point in doing so, since discounted cash-flow
analyses are so prone to error, depending on the subjective assumptions that
are fed into it. Of payback calculations, he says, 'we don't believe the
numbers'.
Instead T&amp;N takes what he calls 'a judgmental view' of the likely benefit to
the customer. This reflects acute awareness throughout T&amp;N of a principle
which many UK manufacturers used to ignore, at the expense of much necessary
investment: that a heavy 'opportunity cost' can be incurred by not going
ahead with a particular project. In addition to losing a particular sale and
valuable market share, the company may harm its hard-won innovative
reputation with an important customer, says Everitt.
'A lot of all this is to do with creating technical reputation and the
ability to collapse lead time,' he continues. 'It's the opportunity cost of
staying in business.'
A final article will examine the impact of R&amp;D on one of T&amp;N's operating
companies.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Management: A fast track to efficiency - London's Docklands
Light Railway is now being managed by the private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a novel idea for public sector railway managers. Tired of complaints
about unreliable trains? Easy: take Pounds 30m of taxpayers' money, give it
to an independent contractor and leave the private sector to put things
right.
That, at least, seems to be the thrust of the unprecedented deal struck by
London's Docklands Light Railway last week in appointing Brown &amp; Root, the
US engineering group, as its prime contractor.
Brown &amp; Root will not take over the day-to-day running of the railway. But
over the next three years it will manage the remaining stages of an Pounds
800m expansion and improvement programme. At the end of that time it must
deliver a railway that works. Its Pounds 30m fee is geared directly to
results.
The significance of the deal is that it is wholly uncharacteristic of the
railway industry. Railwaymen fervently oppose the notion that anyone should
come between them and their trains. They insist on controlling every aspect
of building and running the system, with the private sector's role limited
to that of sub-contractor and supplier.
But the Docklands Light Railway's managers are not railwaymen. Since
November 1991, they have been a team of defence procurement experts drafted
in from the Ministry of Defence. Their chairman, Sir Peter Levene, is former
head of defence procurement at the MoD. He also heads the prime minister's
efficiency unit.
When Sir Peter and his team arrived, the Docklands Light Railway was in such
disarray that the government had seized control of it from London Transport
and passed it to the London Docklands Development Corporation.
Its poor performance can be partly blamed on the fact that it was built on a
shoestring budget of Pounds 77m at a time when the government's ambitions
for Docklands were modest. When Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property
developer, proposed transforming Canary Wharf into London's third commercial
centre, the toy-town railway had to be improved.
When the government responded by authorising an Pounds 800m expansion and
upgrading of the line, the immediate effect was to make matters worse.
Already incapable of meeting the demands being made on it, the system had to
cope with being rebuilt while trains were still running. Consequently,
services deteriorated to the point of chaos.
But was there more to its poor performance than this? Today, the railway is
running 98 per cent of scheduled train mileage compared with a low of 67 per
cent before the management changeover. What caused such a drastic turnround?
Sir Peter says some simple manAgement actions produced quick results. For
example, his team discovered that the computer controlling the train
operations was overloaded. That was rectified through the seemingly obvious
action of trimming the train service.
Another step was getting to grips with the contractors responsible for
supplying track, trains and so on.
'Some of contractors were performing extremely badly,' says Sir Peter. 'The
DLR people said: 'We've written to them and asked them to do better, but
they're just not doing that.' I said: 'Well, let's stop paying them.' They
said: 'You can't do that - they'll sue.' So I said: 'Let them'.'
The result? 'Some sharp words were exchanged, but the performance of those
contractors changed overnight.'
To be fair to London Transport, it could be argued that the improvements in
the railway's performance might have happened without the change in
management. Conceivably, Sir Peter's team simply enjoyed the fruits of
action initiated by the previous incumbents.
London Transport, however, acknowledges Sir Peter and his colleagues wrought
changes. One advantage they enjoyed was the freedom to act without constant
reference to headquarters. Another was their reputation for tough dealing
with contractors such as GEC while at the defence ministry. Indeed, that was
one of the main reasons for bringing them in.
It was a logical extension of this last point that led to the decision to
appoint a prime contractor. The team is now applying the techniques of
defence contracting to railway projects, says Sir Peter. If the defence
ministry wants to order a new fighter aircraft, it does not deal with dozens
of contractors making all the sub-systems. It defines the performance it
wants, signs a contract for delivery with a single company such as British
Aerospace and leaves it to the prime contractor to deliver the aircraft it
wants.
As in the defence industry, so in transport. Sir Peter's team will no longer
deal with dozen contractors involved in the extension of the railway to
Beckton, the installation of a new control system and the supply of new
trains. That - and the integration of these parts into a smoothly-running
whole - will be Brown &amp; Root's job.
Is this the way of the future for other railway projects? Possibly. One
worrying factor, however, must be cost. Theoretically, a private-sector
contractor motivated by a performance-related fee will do a better job at
project management than a flabby public-sector body. But the Docklands Light
Railway only brings in Pounds 3m a year in ticket sales. Seen in that light,
Pounds 30m seems an awful lot to pay.
The cynical view might be that the government is prepared to nod the deal
through, hoping it will better prepare the railway for its planned
privatisation. So it might; but that, says Sir Peter, is not the point.
'The question is whether it represents good value for money. Everyone's been
satisfied that's the case, and now we are going ahead. I think we would be
criticised for spoiling the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar if, having spent
Pounds 800m on the railway, we had not spent another Pounds 30m in getting
it to work.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / People: Sutherland comes to Ross
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ross Group, the acquisitive consumer electronics and packaging company which
lost its high-profile chairman Roger Shute last June, has hired former ITT
executive Neil Sutherland as its group managing director.
When Shute stepped down because of ill-health from his non-executive
position, managing director Noel Hayes took on the additional role of
chairman while a replacement was found. Hayes remains executive chairman.
'Roger's departure was merely a catalyst. We had almost decided to bring on
another senior executive anyway,' claims Hayes, pointing out how the group
has grown since he joined in October 1989, with turnover last year at Pounds
50m, compared with Pounds 6m then.
The company was also loathe to look for a non-executive chairman - 'some
City dignitary who would charge Pounds 10,000 and arrive for six free
lunches a year'.
Instead it hopes it has found in 53-year-old Sutherland someone who both
subscribes to the company's philosophy - success by working 'longer and
harder' than the competition - and who complements existing skills on the
board. Hayes, 36, came from the City, with a short stint as senior sales
director of Kleinwort Benson Securities, preceded by positions at Citicorp
Scrimgeour Vickers. Finance director Anthony Schofield has a traditional
accountancy background.
Sutherland, by contrast, has spent most of his life in big company
manufacturing, largely concerned with consumer electronics. An engineering
graduate from Edinburgh University, he started out with Nuclear Enterprises,
before moving to Plessey.
In 1982, he joined Dubilier, working in the US as well as the UK. Three
years later he moved to ITT, where he spent eight years as managing director
of the ITT Cannon Group, supplying components and systems to
telecommun-ications, auto, consumer and industrial electronics markets.
Ross has still to dispel completely what Hayes himself has termed 'the Roger
Shute effect' whereby the share price dived following Shute's exit. It has
only partially recovered, trading in the 30p-33p range in the last couple of
months. 'I am very happy to be judged by our results,' says Hayes.
The company reports on April 8.
*****
BM Group, another company once chaired by Roger Shute, has taken steps to
strengthen its board. The construction equipment and engineering concern has
appointed Richard Miles, former chief executive of Steetley, as a
non-executive director.
It will be the most demanding role Miles has taken on since Steetley lost
out to a hostile Pounds 613m takeover bid by rival building materials group
Redland a year ago. His other activities include the non-executive
chairmanship of Bucknall Group, a construction consultancy.
Following a collapse in its performance, BM had been looking for another
experienced non-executive to support a root-and-branch review being carried
out under its new chairman Moger Woolley.

FT  17 MAR 93 / People: Baron moves to Paine Webber
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Further signs that US securities house Paine Webber is building up its
international bond capability come with the arrival of Tony Baron in the
London office as international fixed income strategist.
Baron, 42, had spent two years as chief economist of Sakura Finance
International (previously Mitsui Taiyo Kobe). Before that, he had been with
Chase as head of economics and portfolio strategy at the investment bank in
London, and earlier partner and chief economist at Laurie Milbank, the
stockbrokers purchased by Chase in 1986.
He says that while Maury Harris, chief economist of Paine Webber in New
York, is 'exceptionally good' on the US, he is there to bring the
international dimension. The idea of being 'in at the beginning of a
build-up operation' appeals to him and he hopes he will be 'used more
intensively' than he was at Sakura.
One of the few Laurie partners to see out the full four years of his
contract at Chase, Baron contrasts the 'very good atmosphere' at Paine
Webber with the 'pain of living through Chase's retreat from the securities
business'. He adds he likes the fact that energies appear to be focused on
building business 'not building personal empires' - a preference which might
surprise former colleagues who describe him as an intensely political
animal. 'I prefer not to fight,' Baron rejoins, 'but if the alternative is
watching your team die, than your get off your butt and get your hands dirty
trying to fix things.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / Jobs: Those who pay the managerial piper .. - Rude awakening
for victims of decades-long refusal to face up to a fundamental question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'STOP them making that noise,' ordered the Jobs column's wife, elbowing it
out of sleep in the early hours. Unable to hear anything - it was before we
had children - I asked which noise she meant. Her reply was my first
introduction to the experience of a haunting mystery.
'They're playing that tune Oldham on the tins,' she said.
She then lapsed into coma, leaving me lying there twitching. After all, my
failure to hear any untimely music-makers might have been simply because I
was too deeply asleep. Nor was the momentary quiet any guarantee that they
wouldn't strike up again as soon as I nodded off.
So deciding street rowdies must be responsible, since all of our neighbours
were old, I went and got a bucket of water and put it by the window. Their
next number was going to be 'Stormy weather', I vowed . . . until the
mystery took me in its grip.
What bugged me was not the unconventional instruments they had reputedly
been playing - a scaled-down steel band, perhaps - but that I couldn't
remember how the tune called 'Oldham' went. As it was named after a town, I
reasoned, it must be a hymn-tune on a par with 'Aberystwyth' ('Jesu, lover
of my soul . . .'). And I was just pondering whether it would be Christian
to pour cold water on people performing sacred music even at an ungodly
hour, when sleep supervened.
Although next morning the tins-players had gone without trace, I was soon at
the church consulting hymnals. But neither then nor since have I managed to
come any nearer to my quarry than 'Warrington' ('O son of God, eternal love
. . .'). Hence the mystery of the tune called 'Oldham' continues, and all
the more hauntingly because it has now been joined by the equally
bewildering quest for the book called 'The New Geo-Economics'.
Once again there is a clue. The Times Literary Supplement recently named not
just the book, but the author at the foot of an article he'd written. He is
Edward H. Luttwak of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington. But there was no mention of the book's publishers which, wanting
to read it, I needed to know. Nor was there any reference to it in the FT's
compendious database, and the Literary Supplement was unable to help since
the article had come in by fax and the publishers' name had apparently
fallen off the bottom.
I therefore telephoned the Washington Center, which referred me to another
number. When I called it, an answering machine referred me to a further
number. It turned out to be a second answering machine which referred me to
a third. And all it would say was that Dr Luttwak 'is out of town until May'
which comes across as barely plausible, sounding a bit like 'he's in the
bath until a week on Saturday'.
So here I am stranded, not even as near as the equivalent of Warrington,
which is a pity because his article suggested that his elusive book sheds
light on a problem now bedevilling a great many young people. While by no
means confined to Britain, it was graphically depicted by one Sha Wylie of
Southampton who, after graduating last year and applying for many jobs only
to receive rejections, has suffered the final indignity of having a request
for an application form rejected.
Understandably angry, Sha Wylie - like a lot of others similarly jobless -
puts the blame squarely on the current British government's handling of the
economy. My suspicion, however, is that the problem is rooted much farther
back, with today's unemployed graduates hit by the cumulative effects of
successive governments' neglect of a question which should have been cleared
up 30 years ago. Worse, if I twig Edward Luttwak aright, standard economic
measures are not going to provide an effective answer.
Now, unlike 'Oldham', the long neglected question will strike enduring
readers as an all too familiar tune, having last been on the order of
service only five weeks ago. The question is how an education system
increasingly focused on getting youngsters through academic-type tests and
exams is going to arrest economic decline, let alone generate Britain's
renewed prosperity.
The point was glossed over by the committee of inquiry headed by the late
Lord Robbins which in 1963 recommended the first post-war expansion of
higher education. It was apparently just assumed that enriching the
workforce with a larger share of folk educated to what is deemed a higher
level, would somehow of itself make the nation more productive as well as
civilised.
That assumption can hardly be said to have been justified by events, which
have rather borne out doubts voiced at the time by a few dissenters. They
argued that increased concentration on academic pursuits would lead
youngsters with at best middling talent for them to continue with scholarly
studies in preference to practical training more suited to their mix of
abilities.
The result would be twofold. Fewer and fewer teenagers would join the
workforce motivated to learn to do skilled jobs. More and more graduates
would join it at the age of 20-plus, believing that their degrees entitled
them to enter at a higher level even though all that most of them were
practically equipped for was clerical and administrative work.
True, that may have been sustainable as long as such work was plentiful. But
things have changed - which brings Edward Luttwak back into the act.
To judge by his article, his thesis is that while conventional macroeconomic
theories might work perfectly well in a world run by economically rational
people, the rationality of those who actually run same is less economic than
political. Hence in their urge for power, those in the developed world have
as their goal 'not the highest possible standard of living for a country's
population, but rather the conquest or protection of desirable roles in the
world economy.'
'The winners will have those highly rewarding and controlling roles,' he
adds, 'while the losers will only have the retail business and assembly
lines - if their home markets are large enough, or if fully assembled
imports are kept out by trade barriers. We have already seen that when
'transplants' replace domestic production, the local employment of manual
and semi-skilled labour may continue, but finance and all higher management,
as well as much research and development and design, are transferred back to
the country of origin.'
At which point, if he's right, it is not only the Sha Wylies of Britain who
will rudely awaken to their own sad role in the drama. The same may well
apply to older Brits whose executive-type jobs have disappeared to places
with earnings enough to pay numerous managerial pipers.
Moreover, if it is true such jobs are plentiful only in the countries of
origin of important productive enterprise, then supplies are unlikely to
return to Britain until it has a workforce with the practical skills to do
the originating. So it would seem time for the politicians to stop vesting
more costly hope in the failed academic experiment, and re-engineer the
education system from top to bottom.
Failing that, all I can suggest is that fellow-Brits join me in a hymn -
named not after a town, but for St Anne - which goes: 'O God our help in
ages past . . .'

FT  17 MAR 93 / VAT drop hits public finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP DROP in receipts from value added tax contributed to a deterioration
in public-sector finances last month.
The public-sector borrowing requirement in February was Pounds 5.4bn, Pounds
1bn higher than the market expected. The figure took the PSBR for the first
11 months of this financial year to Pounds 27bn compared with Pounds 7.4bn
in the same period last year.
The large monthly shortfall compares with a modest borrowing requirement of
Pounds 963m in February last year.
The increase in the PSBR could be explained partly by lower VAT receipts
than in the previous two months, when a new collecting system brought
receipts previously paid in February forward to January.
Central Statistical Office figures showed that VAT receipts last month were
Pounds 2.9bn compared with Pounds 4.3bn last February. In January receipts
amounted to Pounds 3.34bn, contributing about Pounds 1bn to January's Pounds
3.83bn government surplus. Excluding privatisation proceeds - mainly the
final call on British Telecommunications stock - the PSBR last month was
Pounds 5.8bn.
High government cash outlays also contributed to February's large borrowing
requirement. Although central government spending of Pounds 20bn was
slightly less than in January, it was Pounds 2.7bn higher than in February
last year. The statistical office said that in the first 11 months of this
financial year total cash outlays were 13.5 per cent higher than in the
previous year.
Income tax receipts were also lower, underlining the continuing impact of
the recession. The government collected Pounds 3.8bn in income tax last
month compared with Pounds 4.25bn last February. Corporation tax of Pounds
329m was little changed from February last year. Social security
contributions amounted to Pounds 2.87bn, unchanged on last year. The
statistical office said Inland Revenue receipts for the first 11 months of
the year were 4.5 per cent lower than in the same 11 months of 1991-92.
Social security contributions were 3 per cent higher.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Local calls cost more than abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL calls cost more in the UK than in any other large country in Europe,
north America or Australasia according to a survey of international
telecommunications prices. But the UK's international calls are the cheapest
of the 10 countries surveyed, and its trunk calls the second cheapest.
The survey, published by National Utility Services, a consultancy group,
shows that for a three-minute local call at average rate UK consumers pay at
least twice more than those in Canada, the US, Sweden, the Netherlands and
Italy.
Canadians pay an unusually high exchange line charge, equivalent to Pounds
38.78 a month. However, at Pounds 10.28 British Telecom's monthly charge is
found to be higher than those in Australia (Pounds 10.21), France (Pounds
9.57), the US (Pounds 8.62), Italy (Pounds 7.70), the Netherlands (Pounds
7.62) and Belgium (Pounds 6.76).
The survey shows UK consumers fare better in long-distance and international
calls. They pay less for international calls - Pounds 1.24 for three minutes
at average rate - than those in any of the other nine countries, and barely
half the going rate in Italy (Pounds 4.41), Italy (Pounds 2.44) and Sweden
(Pounds 2.42).
At 27p for three minutes at average rate for trunk calls, UK customers pay
less than in all nine other countries except the Netherlands (21p). Germany
and France are highest at 80p and 77p respectively.
Mr Andrew Johns, National Utility Services director, said: 'Having finally
won approval from industry watchdog Oftel to rebalance its costs and
increase exchange line rentals, it is surprising that BT has not lowered
local charges other than through volume discount schemes.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / Companies' liquidity ratio falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE short-term liquidity position of Britain's large companies deteriorated
in the final quarter of last year as falling interest rates encouraged
companies to boost borrowings and run down their bank deposits.
The Central Statistical Office reported that the seasonally adjusted
liquidity ratio for large UK industrial and commercial companies fell to an
estimated 111 per cent at the end of last year from 119 per cent at the end
of the third quarter and 121 per cent at the end of 1991. The ratio,
measuring current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of
liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year, was the lowest since
the first quarter of 1991.
The liquidity ratio for large manufacturing companies fell to 100 per cent
from 109 per cent in the previous quarter and 118 per cent at the end of
1991. The ratio for large non-UK manufacturing companies fell to 125 per
cent from 132 per cent in the quarter, but was still higher than the 123 per
cent at the end of 1991. City economists were untroubled by the apparent
deterioration of UK companies' short-term finances. Mr Leo Doyle, UK
economist of Kleinwort Benson Securities, said the figure reflected
balance-sheet restructuring as interest rates fell. It should not impinge on
companies' ability to invest using retained earnings.
Non-seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO showed that companies ran down
their short term deposits with UK banks to Pounds 22.3bn in the fourth
quarter from Pounds 24.5bn at mid-year while increasing their overseas
assets.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Catching baddies after they cross borders: Sir Brian Unwin
tells Andrew Jack how attitudes among Customs staff have changed in the
single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BRIAN UNWIN has just two weeks to switch between two of the most
significant public-service jobs in the European Community: from head of UK
Customs and Excise during the implementation of the single European market
to head of the European Investment Bank.
He seems fully prepared for the transition. 'What I do now have is this
extraordinary privilege,' he says, sitting in his office overlooking the
river Thames. 'Having broken down the borders I now have a chance to go
inside them and help make it all work.'
Sir Brian, who was at Customs for four years, argues that his greatest
challenge was removing the borders for traders as part of the single
European market and motivating his staff to back the reforms. His team had
to cope with withdrawing 1,600 staff from the frontiers.
In place of the old arrangements is a system based around greater
intelligence-gathering and the targeting of smugglers. 'There is tremendous
tradition and loyalty in Customs,' he says. 'That is a strength, but can
also be a weakness. It made it more difficult to move staff away from the
baggage benches and convince them that they can still catch baddies without
deploying everyone at the frontiers. For centuries they were there with
their cutlasses stopping things coming in.'
One of his biggest battles was to persuade people within Customs that the
removal of border controls would take place. 'It posed a threat to people's
jobs and their way of working. There was a tendency four years ago to just
wish it away.'
'I said to the staff that it is jolly uncomfortable and extraordinarily
difficult, but we have got to face up to it. Unless we plan now, we won't
have any control and we will be faced with an imposed solution which will be
less in your and the UK's interests.'
In general, Sir Brian is pleased with the results to date on the
single-market initiative. 'We have delivered the government what it wanted
by removing the borders without threatening our security.'
He believes the UK played an important role in changing the shape of the
single European market, blocking mandatory harmonisation of value added tax
throughout the EC and keeping the requirements for paperwork to a minimum.
Sir Brian says Customs was used as a model for the government's executive
agency reforms, which are now being mirrored by the Inland Revenue.
But he sees an important continuing role for central control. 'I've
developed our own model with 30 executive units. We have wide executive
functions with a central policy role and report to the chancellor.'
He believes he has made considerable progress in changing the way Customs
operates and lays particular emphasis on promoting equal opportunities -
especially the promotion of women, such as Mrs Valerie Strachan, his deputy.
She has now taken over his post.
'After working in the Treasury and the Cabinet Office, Customs seemed very
male-dominated to me,' he says. 'It still is, but things are starting to
change.'
He says the main challenge in his new job at the world's biggest
international lender will be to consolidate the institution and reflect the
new impetus it received at the Edinburgh summit. 'We are under tremendous
pressure to increase the volume of lending,' he says. 'But we must also
maintain rigorous criteria to sustain quality.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / BT rates for local calls 'high'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL calls cost more in the UK than in any other large country in Europe,
north America or Australasia according to a survey of international
telecommunications prices. But the UK's international calls are the cheapest
of the 10 countries surveyed, and its trunk calls the second cheapest.
The survey, published by National Utility Services, a consultancy group,
shows that for a three-minute local call at average rate UK consumers pay at
least twice more than those in Canada, the US, Sweden, the Netherlands and
Italy.
At December 31 1992 rates of exchange, the comparable prices were 11.5p in
the UK against nil in Canada, 5.2p in the US, 5.4p in Sweden and the
Netherlands and 5.7p in Italy. After the UK, Australia imposed the next
highest local charges (11.3p).
To compensate, Canadians pay an unusually high exchange line charge,
equivalent to Pounds 38.78 a month. However, at Pounds 10.28 British
Telecom's monthly charge is found to be higher than those in Australia
(Pounds 10.21), France (Pounds 9.57), the US (Pounds 8.62), Italy (Pounds
7.70), the Netherlands (Pounds 7.62) and Belgium (Pounds 6.76).
The survey shows UK consumers fare better in long-distance and international
calls. They pay less for international calls - Pounds 1.24 for three minutes
at average rate - than those in any of the other nine countries, and barely
half the going rate in Italy (Pounds 4.41), Italy (Pounds 2.44) and Sweden
(Pounds 2.42).
At 27p for three minutes at average rate for trunk calls, BT customers pay
less than in all nine other countries except the Netherlands (21p). Germany
and France impose the highest charges, 80p and 77p respectively.
Mr Andrew Johns, National Utility Services director, said: 'Having finally
won approval from industry watchdog Oftel to rebalance its costs and
increase exchange line rentals, it is surprising that BT has not lowered
local charges other than through volume discount schemes.'
'Should BT be allowed to maintain its policy of lower prices for volume
users, it will no longer be economical for emerging suppliers - especially
cable companies - to compete,' he added.
Sweden, included in the annual survey for the first time, is shown to have
among the highest charges of the 10 countries surveyed.
Its trunk call and exchange line rental charges are the second highest, and
its international calls the third most expensive.
The survey says the fastest evolving telecoms market is Australia's.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Clarke to meet fire unions today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF the Fire Brigades Union are due to meet Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
home secretary, this morning to discuss the future of the pay formula that
has decided the wages of their 49,000 members for 14 years.
Under the formula drawn up by the last Labour government to end the first
national firefighters' strike, their pay is linked to the upper quartile of
all male manual workers' earnings.
Last November the firemen secured a 4.9 per cent pay rise as a result of
wage comparability, but their union fears the government intends to scrap
the pay formula. Fire officers receive between Pounds 12,720 and Pounds
16,626 a year.
'The formula has kept industrial peace for 14 years,' Mr Ken Cameron, the
FBU's general secretary, said yesterday. He added that the union would warn
Mr Clarke that he faced the threat of another national strike if the pay
formula was scrapped.
The pay formula has been suspended since last November under the
government's current 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit.
Mr Cameron says the formula has already 'been unilaterally ditched' as a
result of the government's public-sector incomes policy.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Foremen at Ford strike over job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREMEN at Ford plants in Southampton and at Dagenham, east London, went on
strike yesterday in protest at the company's threat of compulsory
redundancies.
White-collar unions at Ford are due to meet the management next Tuesday to
discuss the situation following a ballot vote in support of industrial
action by the company's staff.
But a union official said yesterday that his members were 'chomping at the
bit' to strike over the compulsory redundancy issue.
Last week Ford backed down and agreed not to press ahead with any compulsory
redundancies among its blue-collar labour force as a result of improved
demand and adjustments to production targets.
But to the anger of staff, the company has so far refused to withdraw the
threat of compulsory redundancies for its white-collar employees.
Management pointed out yesterday it had announced last December that it
wanted 2,200 staff jobs to go by the end of this month and it is now only
157 short of that figure. The company said it hoped to achieve the cut in
white-collar staff it required without any need for compulsory redundancies.

FT  17 MAR 93 / DTI issues warning after investigating companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday issued a warning to potential
borrowers to be cautious about banking documents called Prime Bank Notes.
The warning follows a High Court order winding up a company called Funding
Sources International Ltd, made on a petition presented by the DTI's
Companies Investigation Board. The company was registered in Cheltenham but
had been involved in activities connected to PBNs from a private address in
north Devon.
Funding Sources International Ltd is believed to be one of several companies
investigated by the DTI after they told clients of their purported ability
to raise loans, often running into millions of US dollars. Its director, Mr
Howard Curtis, appeared before a magistrates' court in Barnstaple, Devon,
last week charged with having failed between May 20 1992 and May 23 1992 to
file adequate accounts and provide further information under the Companies
Act. Proceedings were adjourned until September 8.
PBNs are purportedly traded as collateral bank documents, against which
loans can be secured. DTI investigators found that Funding Sources
International had been requiring its clients to pay substantial fees in
advance of the purchase of the PBNs. Although advance fees were paid, no
loans were made. The DTI said: 'We urge any potential borrower thinking of
entering into financing arrangements involving PBNs to satisfy themselves
about the legitimacy of all the parties involved and that there is real
substance to any loan offer before parting with any money.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / Curbs on electricity pricing to be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFER, the electricity indus-try regulator, has indicated to regional
companies in the sector that it plans a less rigid price controls system
than some in had feared.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, has also signalled
that, as part of a shake-up of supply price controls, it will allow recs
more flexibility in their dealings with large companies.
Offer's latest thinking is outlined in a memorandum to the regional
electricity companies as a review of electricity supply controls gets under
way in readiness for change in April next year.
It will be welcomed by most regional companies, which will argue that
Offer's approach will enable them to tailor contracts more to customers'
requirements - for example, by providing long-term contracts at higher
prices to the benefit of some buyers.
Large customers, some of which have faced steep price rises since
privatisation of the electricity industry three years ago, will be concerned
it could lead to further increases.
In the memorandum to regional companies, Offer says it attaches great
importance to putting pressure for efficient purchasing on them. It believes
'this can best be achieved by restricting the scope of price control to the
franchise market'. The franchise market, where regional companies have a
monopoly in the areas they distribute electricity, is restricted to
customers who use less than 1MW of electricity in any half-hour period. From
April 1994 the threshold will fall to 100kw. Offer says regional companies
would be exposed to the 'full pressure of competition in the non-franchise
market without the inevitable complications which price control brings'.
For the franchise market, Offer proposes a yardstick approach under which a
measure would be made of average costs of units supplied in England and
Wales, excluding those covered by coal contracts signed in current
negotiations.
The franchise market yardstick would 'both provide a published source of
information and act as a trigger for further inquiry on economic purchasing
should an individual rec's (regional company) costs exceed the yardstick by
a certain amount'.
This suggests that contracts for gas between regional companies and the
independent power projects, in which many have equity stakes, will be
scrutinised further in spite of the regulator's recent endorsement of the
'dash for gas'.
Nevertheless, the yardstick approach outlined by Offer is considerably less
formal than other possibilities though to be under consideration. Under
present rules, the price of electricity supplied to all customers can rise
only by the level of inflation.

The offer is substantially more than the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit
for the public sector and twice the rate of inflation.
It is also more than the PowerGen offer of a 2.5 per cent pay rise plus

FT  17 MAR 93 / Government tells the 14 electricity companies to resolve
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has told the 14 electricity companies in England and Wales to
resolve by Friday outstanding problems on tentative contracts with British
Coal in preparation for a white paper next week, Michael Smith writes.
Its exhortation on proposed deals for 40m tonnes next year and 30m in each
of the following years will increase speculation that its coal review will
save only a handful of the 31 threatened pits.
National Power and PowerGen, the two generators for England and Wales, have
heard nothing substantial from the government for more than two weeks on
additional tonnages. This suggests the government wants a tonnage closer to
the 40m over five years which the generators have indicated they are
comfortable with, rather than the 65.5m the government originally wanted
them to take.
At most an additional 40m tonnes would save eight pits and possibly less.
In spite of the electricity companies' expectations, it is possible that the
government's timetable has slipped further in the past few days, and the
white paper, originally promised for February, will be published next month.
The cabinet is not due to discuss coal tomorrow and it will almost certainly
be required to give its approval to any plans following revelations that
many ministers were kept in the dark before the original closure decisions
last October.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Minister warns of tougher pollution penalties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY may face much higher charges for discharging polluted water into
rivers, Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said yesterday.
He told the second day of the Financial Times European Water Conference that
higher charges for companies abstracting water from rivers were also on the
cards.
'A charge based on the amount and type of pollutants discharged to water
would give a direct financial incentive for cleaner effluent,' he said.
'Those who polluted least would pay the lowest charge.'
A government report is being prepared giving the options for using financial
instruments to curb water pollution.
Present licences for discharging and abstraction, which are issued by the
National Rivers Authority, charge in proportion to pollution, but it is
allowed only to recover its monitoring costs. The NRA expects to receive
Pounds 44m for discharges and Pounds 79m for abstraction in the year to
March 1994, but new charges are likely to be much higher.
Mr Guy Liardet of the Chemical Industries Association said yesterday: 'We
are very keen to improve our performance and we are keen to play along with
government policy provided it is rational, achieves its aims and does not
destroy UK industry's competitiveness. We just ask that the chemical
industry's pollution is considered in the context of everyone else's
pollution, particularly farm waste.
Mr Maclean also said that the government would urge the European Commission,
which is reviewing all its water quality directives this year, to
accommodate more subsidiarity - allowing countries to decide some of their
water standards themselves. 'The Community should exercise a certain
humility,' he said.
Water companies should also look at charging households special high tariffs
for using water at peak times, according to Mr Chris Mellor of Anglian
Water, which covers the region likely to have the greatest shortages of
water. The supply of water at peak times was nearly double the average daily
level, he said, and supplying the peak demand could account for half of a
water company's costs.
Peak-time charges could be applied only to houses fitted with water meters.
Anglian, which has introduced compulsory metering to help cut future demand,
now has 160,000 metered customers. The present installation charges of
Pounds 145 to Pounds 185 could fall as more customers were metered, he said.
Exports of ice cubes are expected to rise, after the water used by a
producer in north-west England passed stringent hygiene tests.
The Packaged Ice Company of Fleetwood uses ordinary north-west drinking
water in quantities of up to 60 tonnes a day. Its cubes are being sold by
the Belgian-owned Multi-Frost chain of frozen food stores.
Further expansion into continental Europe can take place following
certification of water quality by the health authorities of France and the
Netherlands.
The ice-making company is a subsidiary of the 85-year-old Fylde Ice and Cold
Storage Company. The parent diversified into bulk ice cubes in 1986.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Mackay delays ruling on barristers' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, has again postponed a final decision on
whether barristers employed by the Crown Prosecution Service and in the
Government Legal Service should be given the right to appear as advocates in
the higher courts.
Last October the Lord Chancellor (pictured right) and the four senior judges
who decide such issues indicated they were not opposed in principle to
barristers in the two services having rights of audience in the higher
courts, but concluded that the CPS in particular needed more time to
overcome initial operating difficulties before taking on the extra
responsibility.
As a result the judges decided not to approve permanently a Bar Council rule
that bans all employed barristers, including those in the CPS and GLS, from
appearing in the higher courts.
They asked the Bar to consider applying this rule only until the end of 1994
so that the issue could be kept under review.
The Bar called on Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, and
Mr Gerald Hosker QC, the Treasury solicitor, to withdraw their applications
for rights of audience for CPS and GLS barristers.
The DPP and the Treasury solicitor urged the Lord Chancellor and the four
judges to disapprove the Bar's rule on the basis of an undertaking that they
would not seek to exercise wider rights of audience for a period of six
months.
The Lord Chancellor and the judges have now decided to postpone a final
decision until they are in a position to consider barristers' rights
together with the Law Society's application for wider rights of audience for
solicitors.
The Law Society applied to the advisory committee last November on behalf of
all solicitors including those employed by the CPS and GLS. The Committee is
not expected to advise Lord Mackay on the application until later this year.
The Bar welcomed yesterday's announcement. 'The Bar remains opposed on
principle to the employment of state prosecutors,' said Mr John Rowe QC,
chairman.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKING time lost in Britain through disputes and stoppages has fallen
sharply, according to figures from the EC's statistical office in
Luxembourg.
Only 34 days were lost per 1,000 employees in 1991 compared with 83 in 1990
and 1,278 in 1984.
Days lost between 1987-91 average 126 per 1,000 employees - a 70 per cent
drop compared with the period from 1982 to 86 when Britain had one of the
worst records for strikes in the Community.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Unpaid tax at Pounds 900m in 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue wrote off nearly Pounds 900m in unpaid taxes in 1991  -
an increase of 55 per cent over the previous year, David Owen writes.
The disclosure, covering the latest year for which figures are available,
came in a written Commons answer from Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial
secretary to the Treasury.
The sum written off in 1990 totalled nearly Pounds 569m, he indicated in
reply to Mr Archie Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat MP for Roxburgh and
Berwickshire.
In a separate answer, Mr Dorrell disclosed the findings of an independent
survey suggesting that one in three employed taxpayers were dissatisfied
with the service received from the Inland Revenue.
A survey conducted by Research International, a market research group in
June 1992 found that only 65 per cent of employed and self-employed
taxpayers were satisfied.
Mr Dorrell said the Inland Revenue planned to survey other taxpaying groups
to establish their present satisfaction levels and service preferences, and
to repeat the surveys at 'appropriate intervals'.

Siemens, the German electrical engineering group, claimed yesterday that its
share in a US order for 350 diesel-electric locomotives provided a firm base
for further expansion in the American railways market, Christopher Parkes
writes from Frankfurt.
The DM1bn (Pounds 400m) order from Burlington Northern Railroad, one of the
biggest rail freight carriers in the US, was the largest single investment
in the history of US railways, Siemens said.
The lead contractor will be General Motors' locomotive division, EMD, which
will build the engines. The Stuttgart-based group will earn around DM170m,
excluding income from licences granted to EMD, from the supply of
three-phase alternating current motors. The first eight 4,500 horsepower
locomotives will be delivered this year.

OMAN and India have reached preliminary agreement to build an undersea gas
pipeline capable of delivering 50m cubic metres of Omani gas a day to
industries on India's west coast, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. Gulf oil
executives say the deal will be worth around Dollars 4.5bn and could be
completed within four years.
The two states have also agreed to build two 120,000 b/d oil refineries in
India, with the Omani government partnering India's Hindustan Petroleum and
Baharat Oil.
The Oman Oil Company, an arm of the country's oil and finance ministries, is
to conduct a feasibility study on the 900km pipeline, which would have to
pass over the continental shelf off Iran and Pakistan.
Oil industry officials said a substantial part of the deal was likely to be
financed by export credits. Oman has reportedly proposed a 40-year gas
supply contract.

FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Nafta test for Clinton's team - The
conflicting demands of trade pact partners and dissident Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS President Bill Clinton's trade officials today begin their first
important negotiation - over side deals for the North American Free Trade
Agreement - they will be walking a fine line between their trading partners'
sensitivities and the stiff demands from some members of their own party.
In meetings in Washington with the Mexican and Canadian chief negotiators -
Mr Herminio Blanco Mendoz and Mr John Weekes - deputy trade representative
Rufus Yerxa will search for a formula to persuade the US Congress that Nafta
will not lure US companies south of the border with the promise of cheap
labour and weak enforcement of environmental rules.
The negotiators must, at the same time, devise an enforcement mechanism that
does not infringe on Mexican sovereignty or, even worse in US eyes, cede to
Mexico a part of US sovereignty. Many labour activists believe the US wants
no complaints filed in its courts about treatment of migrant Mexican workers
by companies or growers north of the border.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, hopes to send Nafta to Congress
this summer in time to have it implemented as scheduled next January 1. The
deal is widely supported by Republicans, but to win over enough Democrats
for passage, the president will have to persuade them that it will raise
living standards and clean up pollution on the whole continent.
Still, there will be many Democrats such as Mr Craig Merrilees, director of
the California Fair Trade Campaign, who supported President Clinton in the
election but opposes the Nafta. He believes it is impossible to 'fix' the
pact because the administration is unwilling to confront two central
dilemmas of the negotiations.
These are the wage differential and the environment. The wage difference
between Mexico and its northern neighbours is what Mr Merrilees calls 'the
main reason that Nafta exists in the first place'. If the administration
attempts to close that wage gap through, for example, strong enforcement of
labour right rules, support for the agreement will erode among corporations.
The Mexican government will also oppose raising wages because it wants to be
as attractive as possible to foreign investors.
'Mexican citizens don't have the right to petition their government,' said
Mr Merrilees. 'They don't have due process. Their constitution is regularly
violated by a regime that has been in power for 65 years.' In his view, the
question is how such a government can be trusted to uphold enforcement
promises.
The support of Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, is the most
crucial to the Nafta's passage. Just back from a trip to Mexico with Mr
Merrilees and other congressmen, he related several environmental horror
stories to the House Ways and Means committee last week, including one
involving cows, whose milk is sold in Tijuana, dying from lead poisoning.
'The current Nafta will do nothing to stem the tide of pollution that
endangers the health, safety and welfare of citizens on both sides of our
borders,' he said. 'Nor will it stem the haemorrhage of jobs to Mexico or
help recreate the link between productivity and wages by empowering the
workers through their unions and their political system.'
The Clinton solution, as defined last week by Mr Kantor would be two
trilateral councils on environment and labour, which may have the power to
investigate environmental and labour violations.
Last week Mr Kantor was suggesting that public pressure serve in place of a
formal enforcement mechanism. But, by yesterday, testifying before a Senate
committee, he was promising that the side pacts would have 'teeth at the end
of this process'. Pushed to describe how environmental clean-up would be
paid for, he talked vaguely in terms of a fund, perhaps capitalised by
government and business, or paid for through 'fees'.
If that does not convince sceptics, he has another idea, borrowed from the
intellectual property rights section of the current Nafta text. It would
require Mexico to change its law, so that citizens could appeal in Mexican
courts against decisions from administrative agencies.
The Clinton administration is also considering the possibility of using
trade sanctions as an enforcement tool. The use of sanctions - even if
Mexico and Canada agree - will not satisfy Mr Merrilees and his colleagues
in the labour and environmental movements. However, it may help bring Mr
Gephardt on board if Nafta is presented with a strong job retraining
programme and a funding mechanism, such as cross-border tax on imports,
dedicated to environmental clean-up.

The gas deal with India would give Oman a reliable local market for its gas,
proven reserves of which have doubled in the last two years to 490bn cu m.
Oman will also supply crude oil for the two refineries to be built in India.

AN advisory body to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has
accused European and US companies of violating restrictions on exporting
sensitive technologies to China.
The Centre for Information on Strategic Technology, comprising industry
representatives, said investigations of Chinese factories had identified a
range of sophisticated machine tools, exports of which were prohibited by
the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom).
In recent years, Japanese technology producers have admitted exporting
equipment illegally to the former Soviet Union and Iran, but the industry is
angry that Japanese companies should be thought less ready than others to
respect Cocom regulations.
The confidential Cistec report describes results of visits to factories in
Chinese cities by member companies, which claim to have found banned
equipment apparently from US and European producers.
Miti has supported an easing of technology export restrictions, but
officials in the Foreign Ministry are concerned that some equipment could be
used to help the Chinese army in its ambitious plans to develop high-tech
weaponry. This is a view shared by Washington.

FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC seeks to defuse procurement row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the European Community commissioner for external economic
affairs, yesterday intervened to defuse the growing EC-US dispute over
government procurement and telecommunications.
Sir Leon announced that the EC was ready to sponsor jointly with the US an
independent study to establish 'objective criteria' for the parallel opening
of the US and EC procurement markets. The decision to publicise the EC offer
was viewed in Brussels as offering Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, a face-saving compromise so that he can withdraw his threat
to bar EC companies from certain federal contracts, starting next Monday.
EC officials said the offer to sponsor an independent report on restrictions
to competition created by Buy American and Buy European legislation would
have been tabled during talks scheduled this week. But Mr Kantor's
unexpected decision to call off the negotiations thwarted the EC initiative.
Sir Leon repeated yesterday his earlier proposal to waive Article 29 of the
EC utilities directive which offers a 3 per cent price preference to
European companies, on condition that the US makes reciprocal moves to open
the US market in transport, power generation and telecommunications. The US
is understood to be pressing for a suspension of this article.
A US trade official in Washington said the offer of the study was 'very
vague at this point' so Sir Leon has been asked to put the proposal on
paper.
However, it is unlikely that the study - even if it is agreed - will stop
the imposition of sanctions on schedule. 'There are all sorts of studies
already,' the official said. But the 'discrimination' against US suppliers
has persisted.
But the British commissioner also warned, that if the US goes ahead with its
threat, the EC would view such actions as 'unilateral' and 'unacceptable'
and would follow up with appropriate responses.
The EC offer came two days before talks Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president, is due to hold with President Bill Clinton in
Washington.
Tomorrow's meeting offers a chance to defuse the escalation in EC-US trade
tensions on steel subsidies, the stalled Gatt Uruguay Round and the
procurement dispute as well as to cement a working relationship between the
two leaders.
EC officials pointed out that if Mr Kantor proceeds with his threat to bar
certain European companies from federal contracts it would be interpreted as
a slap in the face to Mr Delors.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Brazil moves closer to accord on debt: Most banks agree deal
but the IMF remains a serious obstacle

THE restructuring of Brazil's commercial debt moved a step nearer yesterday,
with financial institutions owed more than 95 per cent of the country's
medium-term bank debt agreeing the proposed accord.
The achievement of this 'critical mass' will trigger payment of about
Dollars 150m of interest owed to banks from the first half of last year. Mr
William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, which heads the Brazilian bank
steering committee, said the accord was 'doing very well'.
About 800 financial institutions, accounting for almost 97 per cent of the
Dollars 44bn of commercial debt, had assented to the restructuring
agreement, which allows banks the choice from six options, he said.
Bankers said two issues now had to be tackled:the so-called balance of the
deal, and Brazil's relations with the International Monetary Fund.
Demanding balance, Brazil has reserved its right to reopen negotiations if
too many banks concentrate on the option that would prove most costly to
Brazil, the so-called par bond. Mr Pedro Malan, Brazil's chief debt
negotiator said: 'We feel that the demand for par bonds has been a bit
excessive.'
Bankers said the deal would need 'rebalancing' but that this process would
be easier than in the recent Argentine agreement. Citibank and some other
banks had chosen to make some new loans.
The biggest problem remains Brazil's lack of progress with the IMF. A fund
delegation yesterday met Mr Eliseu Resende, the new finance minister.
An old IMF agreement is in place until August, and although the government
has failed repeatedly to meet its targets, this would formally satisfy the
requirements of the commercial debt accord. However, a new fund agreement
would release money from the IMF, World Bank and the InterAmerican
Development Bank to provide some of the Dollars 3.2bn that Brazil needs for
guarantees on instruments to be issued under the accord.
The country could use foreign exchange reserves - a healthy Dollars 20bn -
to provide a bridge until new funds from the multilateral institutions
arrive.
This is one issue the banks and government are likely to discuss in the
weeks ahead.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Second bite urged at budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is being urged to plan a second attack on the budget
deficit after his current four-year reduction plan, in an attempt to restore
competitiveness.
The Competitiveness Policy Council, set up by Congress in 1990, yesterday
called for elimination of the federal budget deficit by the year 2000 - or,
even better, creation of a budget surplus - as an essential step towards
freeing enough savings to finance an expansion in US investment.
Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics and the council's chairman, welcomed Mr Clinton's
economic programme as a first bite at the problem; indeed, the Clinton plan
draws in several areas on the council's work. 'We are saying he should have
in mind that the first four-year tranche may not be enough.'
In its second annual report, presented to Congress yesterday, the council,
which groups leaders from business, labour, government and academia, calls
for a central national goal of nearly tripling productivity growth, to at
least 2 per cent a year, by the end of the century.
That would require 'increasing national investment by at least 4-6 per cent
of GDP, or about Dollars 300bn annually at current prices,' the report says,
adding that 'most of the expansion must come from the private sector.'
If this is to be financed internally, instead of by continuing to depend on
foreign capital, the council argues, the national savings rate will have to
rise by 5-7 per cent.
'Those are ambitious goals, but we think they are doable,' Mr Bergsten said.
As some of the policies advocated by the council would involve increased
spending, the report lists options for a future round of spending cuts and
tax increases. The US current account deficit climbed back to Dollars 62.4bn
last year, with an improved surplus on services partially offsetting a
widening merchandise trade deficit and declining income from overseas
investments.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Taxing times for Puerto Rico economy: Clinton may soon end
company tax incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's proposal to eliminate a vital package of tax
incentives for US companies investing in Puerto Rico as part of efforts to
cut the US federal deficit has led to deep concern on the island and
prompted renewed soul-searching over its political future.
Mr Clinton has proposed the elimination of Section 936 of the federal
internal revenue code which allows US companies with manufacturing
subsidiaries in the US Caribbean possession to return their profits tax-free
to the mainland or to deposit profits in local banks without paying any
federal taxes on the earnings.
These deposits of about Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10.5bn) have become a pillar of
the island's financial stability and the tax incentives have been seen by
many as the main fuel for the rapid expansion of Puerto Rico's economy.
The island's rapid industrialisation over the past four decades has clearly
been helped by the incentives which, with lower wages, have encouraged
dozens of mainland companies to switch production to the island.
Section 936 has been frequently attacked in Washington and it is not
surprising that it has become a target in the deficit-cutting exercise. US
Treasury officials have repeatedly claimed that the tax breaks cost the
federal budget between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn a year.
The president is suggesting that over a five-year period Section 936 be
replaced by a 65 per cent tax credit on wages to companies which operate
subsidiaries in Puerto Rico. The proposal for ending the incentives follows
recent charges by legislators in Washington that pharmaceutical companies
have been using the tax breaks to make excessive profits through
overcharging for their products.
Puerto Rico has become one of the world's leading producers of
pharmaceuticals, accounting for about half the US market. The island's
pharmaceutical sector has not been helped by the debate in the US over the
high cost of healthcare.
Mr Clinton's proposals have fuelled party political debate in Puerto Rico
over the island's future.
The 3.5m people of the island are US citizens, but cannot vote for a
president. The island's representation in Washington is limited to a
commissioner who has no vote to influence legislation. Puerto Ricans are to
vote later this year to determine whether the island will retain its current
freely-associated 'commonwealth' status or become a state of the union.
As a fully fledged American state Puerto Rico would no longer be able to
benefit from Section 936 and Mr Clinton's proposals may strengthen the
arguments of those who support a change to full statehood, led by the
incumbent New Progressive party of Governor Pedro Rossello.
Mr Carlos Romero Barcelo, Puerto Rico's resident commissioner in Washington,
also says he favours the phase-out of the special incentives and their
replacement with wage credits.
The opposition Popular Democratic party however favours a continuation of
the political status quo and Mrs Victoria Munoz Mendoza, the party's leader,
argues that elimination of Section 936 would lead to widespread unemployment
on the island.
While they await the introduction of Mr Clinton's proposals Puerto Ricans
are looking to Caribbean neighbours for help. Previous administrations on
the island have committed up to Dollars 100m a year of Section 936 deposits
in the form of low-interest loans to business projects in other Caribbean
countries. Since 1985 Puerto Rico's neighbours have received a total of
Dollars 650m of such loans.
Mr Baltasar Corrada del Rio, Puerto Rico' secretary of state, said he
expected strong Caribbean support for the defence of the programme which he
said had helped to provide 30,000 jobs in Caribbean countries.

FT  17 MAR 93 / New Jersey setback for US gun lobby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Rifle Association, one of the most effective lobbies in the US,
now finds itself in the unaccustomed position of losing some legislative
battles over gun control.
On Monday, the New Jersey senate refused to repeal a state law which bans
the sale of semi-automatic handguns and gives the 300,000 owners of such
assault-style weapons a year in which to sell them out of state, disable
them or turn them into the police.
The New Jersey law is among the country's toughest gun control measures.
Proposed by Democratic Governor Jim Florio, it was enacted in 1990 by the
legislature, then in Democratic hands.
It seemed ripe for repeal when Republicans took over the state's two houses,
which repealed the bill last August. Mr Florio vetoed the repeal, but was
himself overruled in the lower house. Intensive lobbying by the NRA seemed
likely to induce the senate also to override the veto, but in the event it
voted 26-0, with 12 abstentions and two absentees, to sustain the governor.
A local NRA official said the fight for repeal would continue in this
November's gubernatorial and state elections. He promised to raise Dollars
100 from each of the NRA's 600,000 members in the state and to use the funds
in particular against those Republican senators who had 'betrayed' the
cause.
Instant post-mortems in Trenton, New Jersey's capital, were that the NRA had
overplayed its lobbying hand. Other factors cited included public unease
over the current siege outside Waco, Texas, of a heavily-armed religious
cult and many other instances of random violence.
Earlier this year, the Virginia legislature passed into law, again over
heavy NRA resistance, a measure limiting the purchase of handguns by any
individual to one per month, unless special permission to buy more is
obtained from the police. Virginia was one of the easiest states in which to
purchase guns.
The NRA was also embarrassed last week when it was forced to fire one of its
senior lobbyists in Washington for having spread unsubstantiated rumours
that Ms Janet Reno, the new attorney general and a staunch advocate of gun
control, had been arrested, though never charged, on suspicion of drunken
driving.
Interviewed on television, Mr Wayne La Pierre of the NRA's national
headquarters, advanced his organisation's standard line that gun control was
not the way to attack crime in the country either at state or federal level.
He argued against the pending Brady handgun control bill favoured by
President Bill Clinton and soon to be considered again by Congress, and in
favour of building more prisons and tougher jail sentences.
He was particularly critical of the provision of the New Jersey law
requiring existing owners of assault weapons to disable them or turn them
in. This, he said, meant that 300,000 citizens of New Jersey had been
branded de jure 'criminals.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / Brother's attacks pull the plug on Collor's election
ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by Brazil's former President Fernando Collor to recover his rights
to stand as a candidate in next year's elections are being thwarted by a
flood of fortune-seeking books by his vengeful younger brother and former
aides about the torrid world of drugs, adultery and black magic that
allegedly marked his presidency.
With the Supreme Court due to decide within two weeks whether to proceed
with criminal charges against the former president, removed in impeachment
proceedings over corruption charges, Mr Collor's last shreds of honour are
being stripped away by the revelations now rocking Brazil in the latest
episode in the Cain and Abel saga between the two Collor brothers.
Mr Collor has pleaded for people to ignore the damning extracts being
published in the Jornal do Brasil from a book by his brother Pedro whose
denunciations last year led to the president's downfall.
A handwritten letter from Mr Collor to the media accused his brother of
being 'sick in body and soul,' adding: 'Isn't it enough that they have taken
away my political rights, my happiness, my peace. . . for the love of God,
stop this]'
There is very little that Pedro does not accuse his brother of in his book
which he says 'will make the whole world question how such a person could
become president of Brazil.' In the first two extracts alone he claims that
while in office the president and his wife Rosane were cheating on each
other - both with men - and that Rosane blackmailed Mr Collor by threatening
to reveal his alleged cocaine addiction and wife-battering tendencies.
Pedro goes on to detail black magic sessions by the first couple and
Rosane's mother in which they jabbed pins into models of their enemies.
Pedro also claims the presidential couple sacrificed goats and chickens and
danced round them in daily ceremonies to try to ward off impeachment.
Pedro's book is not the only one doing the rounds. In 'A Thousand Days of
Solitude' by Mr Claudio Humberto, Mr Collor's loyal ex-spokesman, Pedro is
the mentally imbalanced villain who shoots at the refrigerator when he
cannot find the cheese.
Although Pedro is not regarded as the most credible source, any hope of Mr
Collor's imminent return to public life is likely to be dashed by the
revelations which have led news items throughout Latin America.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Beijing unleashes fury on Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S governor Chris Patten came under vituperative attack yesterday
in the People's Daily, newspaper of the Chinese Communist party.
Singling out Mr Patten's observation that it 'takes two to tango' in
reference to stalled negotiations on Hong Kong's future, the party newspaper
charged that 'tango dancing has made Chris Patten's head dizzy and speech
incoherent'.
'Just as Hong Kong was going on a road of peaceful transition, God knows
how, there comes a Chris Patten,' the paper said. 'We'd like to warn this
shameless politician to stop his clumsy show. Mr Patten, the tango dancer,
come back to your senses.'
Beijing has been infuriated by Mr Patten's gazetting last Friday of proposed
legislation aimed at extending Hong Kong's democratic reforms. It has
charged that this marks a betrayal of earlier agreements reached with
Britain on a smooth transition to Chinese rule in 1997.
British officials in Beijing said they were waiting for the dust to settle
on almost constant attacks levelled against Mr Patten since last Friday
before making judgments about possible diplomatic moves to quieten the
tempest.
In Hong Kong a senior official of Bank of China warned that the colony's
economy would suffer from 'the instability' Mr Patten's reforms would bring
to Hong Kong. Mr Lin Gunagzhao, the bank's deputy director, said Hong Kong's
real growth rate could be cut by up to 1 percentage point this year from the
5.5 per cent the Hong Kong government forecast in its budget.
Mr Lin said he feared the stock and property markets would be affected by
the current political uncertainty. 'The knock-on effects caused by the
influence on the property sector will spread to even wider areas.'
Mr Patten was, however, unbowed yesterday. After a meeting of his Executive
Council, or quasi-cabinet, he said the government planned to continue
working for the interests of ordinary people in Hong Kong. He said he would
continue to discuss the future of Hong Kong 'positively and constructively'.
In an implicit criticism of Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, who on
Monday launched a vehement attack on the government, Mr Patten said: 'I
don't intend to use the sort of language which is very often being used
about Hong Kong by others.'
The stock market has seen steep falls in share prices over recent days as
investors took fright at China's criticism of Mr Patten's reforms. Stock
market analysts said that in the absence of these attacks there would
probably have been a rise in share prices.
Yesterday the market recovered some of the losses sustained in trading last
Friday and on Monday. The Hang Seng Index rose 125.43 points, or more than 2
per cent, to end at 5,980.04.
Government figures also showed a strong rebound in property market
transactions in February when turnover rose 105.6 per cent from January's
exceptionally low level. Property transactions in the first two months of
1993 were 5.3 per cent up on that same period last year.

<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREAN defence officials said yesterday they had not detected any
unusual military activity in North Korea in spite of the country being
placed on a 'semi-war' footing last week.
Pyongyang took the step in response to the large US-South Korean Team Spirit
military exercise, while also withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty.
The Seoul officials said military movements in North Korea were consistent
with battle mobilisation measures taken in reaction to previous Team Spirit
exercises, which have been held since 1976.
Mr Kwon Young-hae, South Korean defence minister, told the National Assembly
that Seoul had consulted Washington on the possibility of some of the US
troops taking part in Team Spirit staying in South Korea after the exercise
ends tomorrow. But defence officials said if North Korean military activity
remained normal, this request was unlikely to be made. The US military
command in South Korea said there was no change so far in plans to take the
55,000 US troops mobilised for Team Spirit from the country.
The exercise tests US ability to reinforce its 38,000 troops in South Korea
in the case of war.
North Korea has routinely condemned such exercises as a threat to its
security and by putting troops on increased alert. Pyongyang has also used
the exercises as a pretext to break off previous negotiations with Seoul
about nuclear inspections.
The Team Spirit exercise this year coincided with the International Atomic
Energy Agency's demand that North Korea let it inspect two suspected nuclear
facilities by March 25 or face possible economic sanctions by the UN.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Supreme Court has ended a 31-year dispute by ruling that the
Ministry of Education has the right to change textbooks to ensure that a
'standardised' version of history is taught in schools.
The ruling ends a legal challenge by a former Tokyo professor whose text, A
New Japanese History, was rejected in 1962 by the ministry, essentially
because it contained a blunt assessment of Japan's military aggression in
Asia during the 1930s and 1940s.
China and South Korea have complained that the education ministry's control
over textbooks and its use of euphemism to describe wartime brutality have
left Japanese ignorant of the past.
Mr Saburo Ienaga, 79, a former professor at the Tokyo University of
Education, said the rejection of his case against the ministry violates the
Japanese constitution by allowing the government unrestricted power to
censor school texts. 'This decision makes me very angry. I think it is very
disappointing for Japan,' said Mr Ienaga, who was appealing against a lower
court decision to dismiss a Y1.9m (Pounds 11,000) suit filed by him against
the ministry.
Passages of the high school text rejected by the ministry include a
description of the Japanese army's advance as 'reckless', and comments that
'the war was glamorised'.
The Supreme Court ruled that the ministry had the right to recommend changes
or disqualify texts from school lists as long as its decisions are
'reasonable', and that its reservations about Mr Ienaga's history book were
reasonable. However, the court warned the ministry that its power to alter
texts should be used selectively.
Ms Mayumi Moriyama, the education minister, said the court's ruling was
welcome because the ministry should retain the right to determine the
content of school texts and standardise history lessons, though this power
must be used 'appropriately'.
In a 1974 ruling, the Tokyo District Court awarded Mr Ienaga Y100,000 after
judging that 19 of the ministry's 200 objections to his work were unfair.
But in 1986 the Tokyo High Court overturned that ruling.

<TEXT>
ISRAELI troops shot dead two Palestinians and wounded more than 70
yesterday, as intensified violence in the occupied territories cast a deeper
shadow over the prospects for a resumption of Middle East peace
negotiations.
The mood in the occupied territories and Israel itself contrasts strongly
with the upbeat assessment of the peace process by President Bill Clinton
and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, after more than three hours
of talks at the White House on Monday.
A spokesman for Mr Rabin said he would return three days earlier than
expected from the US to address the problem of worsening violence.
The clashes yesterday between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops
at the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza were said to be the worst since the
outbursts that followed deportation of 415 Palestinians by Israel to
southern Lebanon in December.
Palestinian negotiators insist they will not resume peace talks until Israel
makes a public commitment not to resort to further mass deportations.
Hospital officials said that two Palestinian youths, aged 17 and 18, were
killed in the Khan Younis refugee camp. Israeli troops opened fire several
times on stone-throwing Palestinians who had taken to the streets after the
lifting of a curfew on the camp. The latest clashes come against deepening
concern in Israel over attacks on Jewish civilians by individual
Palestinians.

A BOMB explosion damaged seven empty tour buses parked yards away from the
Egyptian Museum in Cairo's busiest square yesterday, one of a series of
attacks a week after Egyptian security forces launched a tough crackdown on
suspected Islamic militants, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. Tourists had
left the buses for the Egyptian Museum, , just 100 yards away. No one
claimed responsibility. It appeared a defiant gesture from Islamic militants
who have waged sporadic attacks on tourist targets for much of the past

ONE Palestinian was killed and more than 60 suffered bullet wounds in Gaza
yesterday as intensified violence in the occupied territories cast a deeper
shadow over prospects for a resumption of Middle East peace negotiations.
The mood in the occupied territories and Israel itself contrasts strongly
with the upbeat assessment of the peace process provided by President Bill
Clinton and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, after more than three
hours of talks at the White House on Monday.
A spokesman for Mr Rabin said he would be returning three days earlier than
expected from the US in order to address the problem of worsening violence.
The clashes yesterday between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops
at the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza were said to be the worst since the
outbursts which followed the deportation of 415 Palestinians by Israel to
southern Lebanon in December.
Palestinian negotiators insist they will not resume peace talks until Israel
makes a public commitment not to resort to mass deportations.
Mr Clinton said on Monday that the deportation issue had already been dealt
with and had not featured in his talks with Mr Rabin. This further angered
the Palestinians and Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman for the negotiating
team, said it was a mistake for the US and Israel to think they could just
push the issue to one side.
In Gaza, doctors said that a 17-year-old boy died after being shot in the
chest.
At least 10 Israelis and 58 Palestinians have been killed since the upsurge
in violence provoked by the expulsion of the 415 Palestinians.

FT  17 MAR 93 / China reduces deficit and increases defence spending
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S budget deficit would reach Yuan 84.4bn (Dollars 14.7bn) for 1993, a
slight decrease on the actual deficit recorded last year, Mr Liu Zhongli,
finance minister, announced yesterday. He also pledged an increase in
defence spending of 12.4 per cent to Dollars 7.5bn.
Speaking on the second day of China's National People's Congress, or
parliament, Mr Liu said mismanagement and waste in state-run organisations
and a shortfall in tax revenues had contributed to 'great financial
difficulties.'
Some two-thirds of China's state-owned industries, which account for about
50 per cent of industrial production, racked up huge losses last year,
adding to burdens on the exchequer. Last year's deficit reached Yuan 90.49
(Dollars 15.7bn), or about five per cent of GNP. The 1992 deficit
represented an increase of 24.6 per cent on the previous year.
Mr Li said total revenues this year were expected to reach Yuan 452.23bn
(Dollars 78.6bn), an increase of eight per cent over 1992. Expenditures were
projected at Yuan 472.7bn (Dollars 82.2bn), up 6.8 per cent.
This year's boost to defence spending will mark the fourth year in a row
that the military will receive a substantial increase; however, published
expenditures for the services account for only a relatively small proportion
of the actual cost of maintaining China's offensive capability.
Mr Liu also announced increased spending of about 9.8 per cent on education
and 10.8 per cent on science and technology.
Investment in agriculture will increase by 9.3 per cent.
Chinese officials also outlined planning targets for the coming year based
on anticipated growth in gross national product of 8 per cent.
Mr Zou Jiahua, the vice premier in charge of the state planning commission,
said these estimates were conservative and it was 'expected they would be
exceeded in implementation.'
Mr Zou said the demands of new investment would continue to drive the
economy in 1993. He predicted that activity would continue to be 'rather
brisk.' China registered economic growth last year of 12.8 per cent.
Mr Zou reported that in 1992 committed foreign investment in China doubled
compared with the previous year. China absorbed Dollars 11bn of foreign
funds, and approved 47,000 foreign-funded enterprises in 1992, more than the
total of the previous dozen years.
On Monday, Mr Li Peng, the premier, forecast growth in the remaining years
of the 1991-95 five-year plan of 8-9 per cent. This would enable China to
achieve its goal with time to spare of quadrupling GNP between 1980-2000.
Ministers yesterday also revealed more details of a comprehensive
restructuring of ministries and government departments to reduce duplication
and waste. A number of ministries will either go or be merged, and staff
slashed across the board.
The NPC, which will meet for the next two weeks, will endorse constitutional
changes, and approve the appointment of new personnel, including a head of
state and several vice premiers.

A BOMB explosion damaged seven empty tour buses parked yards away from the
Egyptian Museum in Cairo's busiest square yesterday, one of a series of
attacks a week after Egyptian security forces launched a tough crackdown on
suspected Islamic militants.
Tourists had left the buses for the Egyptian Museum, one of Cairo's most
popular attractions, just 100 yards away. No one claimed responsibility. But
it appeared a defiant gesture from Islamic militants who have waged sporadic
attacks on tourist targets for much of the past year - considerably hurting
Egypt's precious tourism earnings.
The explosion took place during the midday rush in Tahrir Square, scene last
month of a coffee-shop bombing which killed three. It came in the teeth of
tightened security at all Egypt's tourist centres and intensified operations
against suspected members of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the underground
Islamic group behind most recent attacks. Bus drivers in Tahrir Square said
their vehicles had been searched for bombs just 30 minutes before the blast.
An explosive device was also defused in a building housing 'foreign experts'
in a Cairo suburb, according to the semi-official al-Ahram news agency.
The US embassy on Monday called in around 40 members of the US business
community to discuss security, following a threat earlier this month by
Gama'a al-Islamiyya to attack foreign investments. The embassy stressed only
that businesses should step up routine precautions.

FT  17 MAR 93 / S African budget must address conflicting aims: The harsh
constraints on Derek Keys as he presents his plans today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Derek Keys, an accomplished bridge player and a self-acknowledged
'deal-maker', will be hard pressed to pull any tricks from the dog-eared
fiscal hand he has been dealt when presenting South Africa's budget to
parliament this afternoon.
Expectations of the country's finance minister are high. It is a measure of
the importance of today's budget that it has managed to overshadow, in
recent days, the country's normal political preoccupations.
And while taxation changes will enjoy the normal close scrutiny, the focus
of attention will be on the bigger picture. Observers are hoping Mr Keys's
first budget, and probably the National party's last, will mark a new era in
the management of government finances.
In this sense, it is the second instalment in a two-part package. Last week
saw the long awaited release of the government's economic restructuring plan
 -a 305-page document which details the dramatic changes required if South
Africa is to achieve the sort of economic growth necessary to finance the
developmental challenges it faces.
Mr Keys, former chairman of the mining house Gencor, needs to breathe some
life into an economy moribund after four years of recession, and start the
long-term task of economic restructuring.
The past months, however, have seen the minister also place considerable
stress on two other goals - reducing the deficit and stimulating growth -
which are not only in conflict with each other but, at least in the case of
stimulating growth, clash with the longer-term restructuring aims.
Reconciling these goals, stimulatory against contractionary, would be
difficult at the best of times. These, however, are not the best of times
and Mr Keys faces constraints which will severely limit his room for
manoeuvre. Chief among these are the weak state of the economy - showing no
signs of an upturn after four years of recession - and a budget deficit for
fiscal 1992-93 likely to be in the order of 9 per cent of gross domestic
product.
Perhaps the best that Mr Keys can hope for is that he presents a budget
which enjoys credibility. First, and most obvious, he will have to come up
with a credible set of numbers. Revenue and spending estimates made by the
government in recent years have been woefully inept. The challenge this time
will be to produce a deficit reduction plan which is not premised on heroic
and unachievable cuts in government spending, and pie-in-the-sky estimates
of economic growth.
Best estimates suggest the budget deficit target is likely to be R25bn
(Pounds 5.6bn), or 6.5 per cent of GDP. Less than that would not only
stretch the credulity of the bond markets, but would also risk aggravating
the current recession. The reduction is most likely to be achieved through a
real decline in government spending - cert-ainly in the consumption
component - and an increase in the VAT rate, probably to 13 per cent from 10
per cent now.
Second, he will be required to prove the government's commitment to
restructuring, as outlined last week, by making a serious attempt to
implement these goals. A good start has already been made with the
government standing firm in its refusal to offer civil servants - whose wage
bill is more than half of all state spending - a wage increase of more than
5 per cent.
Finally, and perhaps most important, his budget will have to enjoy
credibility with the African National Congress, the main black political
grouping, and its trade union ally Cosatu. Without their support - or, at
least, the absence of outright opposition - sane economic management in
South Africa is impossible. Mr Keys has acknowledged this, so it can be
expected that he will go to some lengths to put a 'human face' on the
budget, stressing its developmental as well as its growth features.
With unsurprising rhetoric, both the ANC and Cosatu have branded the budget
an 'apartheid budget'. But they have come closer to putting their finger on
a matter of real public concern in focusing on the expenditure side of the
budget. To a large extent Mr Keys has been a supply-side minister, his
efforts devoted to improving the growth capacity of the economy. In recent
months, however, a flood of revelations about government corruption and
maladministration have given South Africans the impression of a 'gravy
train' for those in state service.
Most businessmen and taxpayers would endorse the ANC's calls for performance
auditing and greater transparency in the spending of public money. The
public mood demands that Mr Keys try to show that the government is getting
value for money from its spending.
For business and consumers, while he will not shirk delivering some tough
messages, he will also be doing his utmost to stimulate confidence. Finding
this trump card, though, will test even Mr Keys's ingenuity.

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREAN defence officials said yesterday they had not detected any
unusual military activity in North Korea in spite of the country being
placed on a 'semi-war' footing last week.
Pyongyang took the step in response to the large US-South Korean Team Spirit
military exercise, while also withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty.
The Seoul officials said current military movements in North Korea were
consistent with battle mobilisation measures taken in reaction to previous
Team Spirit exercises, which have been held since 1976.
Mr Kwon Young-hae, South Korean defence minister, told the National Assembly
that Seoul had consulted Washington on the possibility of some of the US
troops taking part in Team Spirit staying in South Korea after the exercise
ends tomorrow.
But defence officials said if North Korean military activity remained
normal, this request was unlikely to be made.
The US military command in South Korea said there was no change so far in
plans to take the 55,000 US troops mobilised for Team Spirit from the
country.
The exercise tests US ability to reinforce its 38,000 troops in South Korea
in the case of war.
North Korea has routinely condemned such exercises as a threat to its
security and by putting troops on increased alert. Pyongyang has also used
the exercises as a pretext to break off previous negotiations with Seoul
about nuclear inspections.
The Team Spirit exercise this year coincided with the International Atomic
Energy Agency's demand that North Korea let it inspect two suspected nuclear
facilities by March 25 or face possible economic sanctions by the UN
Security Council.
The decision to place North Korea on a 'semi-war' footing on March 9, the
day Team Spirit began, was made by Mr Kim Jong-il, son of President Kim
Il-sung and his designated successor, according to Naewoe, the South Korean
agency that monitors North Korean news.
Mr Li Chol, North Korean ambassador at the UN in Geneva, said his country
might reverse its decision on withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty if the US permanently suspended Team Spirit, according to Japan's
Kyodo News Service.
He also said the IAEA should 'stop obeying the only superpower', meaning the
US, and that it should operate in an impartial manner.
He suggested that the IAEA had made its demand for a special inspection of
the North Korean nuclear facilities on US orders.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Japan plans second growth boost
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government will announce a second emergency package to
stimulate the depressed economy before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, visits Washington in mid-April for talks with President Bill
Clinton.
Leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic party confirmed the plan to outline
a supplementary budget before the visit. The move, which follows a Y10,700bn
(Pounds 62.5bn) emergency package of public works spending announced last
autumn, reflects the mounting domestic and international pressure on Japan
to stimulate its economy.
The Japanese economy grew by only 1.5 per cent last year, according to
official figures last week. Most companies are expecting a third year of
falling profits for the financial year to the end of this month.
Meanwhile, the US is likely to intensify pressure on Japan to boost demand
for imports to cut its ballooning trade surplus, which last month grew by
3.7 per cent from the year before to stand at Dollars 10.55bn (Pounds
7.4bn), according to government figures published yesterday.
Although a further stimulus has been widely foreshadowed, details of the
plan are far from agreed.
Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, the LDP's secretary general, said the package would
have to be worth more than last year's Y10,700bn. LDP leaders feel a higher
figure will be needed to meet foreign demands and head off mounting US
pressure over trade issues.
The finance ministry opposes such a large package. It is thought to favour a
more limited stimulus of between Y6,000bn and Y8,000bn.
The contents of the package are also far from agreed. Support for an income
tax cut, which was strongly backed by retailers, has waned over the past few
weeks.
Instead the package is likely to focus on tax cuts for housing and small
business investment, combined with higher spending on social infrastructure
projects such as hospitals and schools. Universities and schools budgets to
buy computers will be expanded, in part to help the ailing electronics
industry.
Different wings of the LDP and several ministries are fighting over plans
for government investment to upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure.
Competing plans are being put forward by the ministries of posts, trade and
industry, construction and transport. The Finance Ministry opposes
government subsidies for telecommunications investment, arguing that such
measures should be funded by NTT, the privatised telecommunications group.
The rise in Japan's trade surplus for February was mainly caused by a sharp
drop in the value of imports, which fell by 2.8 per cent, while exports fell
by 0.5 per cent mainly because exports to Europe were 14.4 per cent down on
the same month last year.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Assemble Nationale (Elections '93): Socialists to pay price
of jobs failure - Persistent unemployment is the big issue in the French
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is one overwhelming reason why France's Socialist ministers seem
certain to lose their jobs in this month's parliamentary election, it is the
country's unemployment rate, standing at 10.5 per cent in January and
expected to go higher.
This issue has occupied more broadcast airtime and filled more newspaper
column inches than any other in the campaign. All the more so because the
mainstream parties are not united within themselves on the best prescription
for unemployment - although, broadly, the right wants to cut labour costs
while the left prefers work-sharing.
Only on the extremes are simple solutions offered. Mr Georges Marchais, the
Communist party leader, plugs on for a reduction in the working week from 39
to 35 hours with no cuts in pay, while Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National
Front leader, blames immigrants for displacing French workers.
France's unemployment rate is no worse than Britain's or Italy's, and better
than Spain's, despite some calculations by the opposition. The latter claims
the true number of jobless is nearly double the 2,992,600 recorded in
January. To arrive at a total of 5m-6m French citizens 'excluded' from the
labour market, they include not only young people in government short-term
work schemes but everyone drawing welfare payments.
Yet France has special problems. One is that its unemployment rate seems to
rise just as fast as other countries' in bad economic times, but to fall far
less during good times. Its jobless rate hit 10.5 per cent in 1987, but in
the three following boom years, it fell only 1.5 percentage points, compared
to a 3-point drop in (western) Germany and a 5-point fall in Britain.
Predictably, this puts a high share (30 per cent at present) of people into
the category of the long-term unemployed, defined as those without a job for
more than a year. When he took office last April, Prime Minister Pierre
Beregovoy made a bold, not to say rash, promise to take all long-term
unemployed (some 900,000 at the time) off the dole queues within six months.
Virtually all the long-term jobless were given in-depth interviews. Some
found a place in the labour market and many others were put in training
schemes. But it was like trying to keep the Atlantic out with a mop. By
November, for every person taken off the dole, someone else had fallen into
their 13th month of unemployment.
Another black spot is youth unemployment. Of those under 25, one in five is
without a job. Part of the blame lies with France's generally excellent
school system, which reserves technical and vocational training for those
who have passed its all-round educational tests. Hence, tailoring a more
specific apprenticeship system to France's unemployment as well as
industrial needs has been a big theme of the campaign.
A study published by the Paribas bank yesterday claims that the country's
guaranteed minimum wage, known as the SMIC, is in large part responsible for
pricing the least qualified workers out of the job market. It notes that the
SMIC has doubled in real terms over the past 20 years, rising far faster
than average pay.
When he was finance minister, Mr Beregovoy suggested a lower SMIC for young
workers. But he got no support from fellow Socialists, and even the
opposition has steered away from altering the minimum wage.
But the opposition has attacked the French system of loading most of the
cost of the welfare system not on general income tax but on company
payrolls. These 'social charges' can add an extra 40 per cent to the cost
for an employer of taking on a new worker. The opposition's general thrust
has been to call for these charges to be gradually transferred to the
national budget and financed out of general taxation. But, in the short
term, the RPR Gaullists and centre-right UDF disagree over precisely how to
do this without increasing the already swollen budget deficit.
Virtually the only new Socialist theme during the campaign has been
work-sharing, the idea of spreading available work around more people. Mr
Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, has ridiculed this as unfeasible because
those in existing jobs will not accept less pay for less work. Most
Socialists, including Mr Chirac's expected presidential challenger in 1995,
former prime minister Mr Michel Rocard, have conceded that work-sharing
would mean pay cuts. But others point out that extra productivity can both
maintain pay rates and increase employment.
One result of the debate about unemployment has been initiatives by
employers, such as that by the AXA insurance company in suggesting
employment for life in return for flexible work patterns and lifetime
training.

MR Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday gave an undertaking
to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that blocked relief
convoys would be allowed to pass through Serb lines to besieged Moslem towns
in eastern Bosnia.
The UN High Commissioner, Mrs Sadako Ogata, yesterday received an assurance
to this effect from Mr Karadzic, whom she had telephoned from Geneva.
The Bosnian Serb leader, it was reported, was speaking in the presence of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
UNHCR spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs said that Mr Karadzic had also promised that
aid workers would be allowed to enter the besieged town of Srebrenica and
that the sick and wounded could be evacuated.
Combatants would also be allowed to leave, on condition that they
surrendered their arms.
However, the UNHCR had earlier said that it would not allow any convoys to
proceed to Srebrenica, after the Serbs had refused to allow them to have a
military escort or radio communications.
According to UNHCR officials, some 60,000 people were cut off in Srebrenica,
which UN relief convoys have failed to reach in 11 months of fighting and
where dozens of people a day are dying of hunger, starvation, disease and
war wounds.
In addition, thousands of refugees from neighbouring Moslem townships
captured by Serb militias have swollen the population of Srebrenica and many
are sleeping in the open air and suffering from exposure.
Mr Karadzic was due to fly to New York yesterday for peace talks with
leaders of the other warring parties, under the chairmanship of Mr Cyrus
Vance and Lord David Owen.
President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, the Moslem leader, was also reported
to have left for New York from Sarajevo to attend the peace negotiations.
Ms Sachs said that General Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander in
Bosnia, who has set up temporary headquarters in Srebrenica in an attempt to
make the Serbs let in aid, was due to have more talks later with Bosnian
Serb army commanders.
France, which has expressed full support for General Morillon, said
yesterday that getting international aid into Srebrenica was a test of Serb
will to contribute to the peace process in Bosnia.
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that continued obstacles to the
delivery of humanitarian aid to Srebrenica would be a serious blow to the UN
Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia.

FOREIGN exchange markets need a fast-track move by Europe's strong currency
countries towards closer monetary co-operation to convince them of the
feasibility of economic and monetary union (Emu), a group of senior French
economists said yesterday.
The group, assembled by the Commissariat du Plan, the French government
think-tank, issued a report calling for 'an informal Emu among the hard-core
countries' of the present European Monetary System.
This could start once the Maastricht treaty was ratified, and take the form
of 'semi-institutional' agreements by the hard-core countries to stabilise
their currency parities, the study said.
Mr Jean-Michel Charpin, senior economist at the BNP bank who presided over
the group study, said last September's monetary crisis had sown serious
doubts in the markets about Emu's feasibility. These doubts could only be
removed by a new initiative, he said. Creating a network of specially close
monetary co-operation between some EC states would not be contrary to the
Maastricht treaty, and could be achieved within the framework of the
European Monetary Institute to be set up under the treaty, the report
claimed.
The report reflects similar sentiments inside the French presidency and in
the opposition, which has pledged to give autonomous status to the Banque de
France soon after its expected election victory this month. But, in contrast
to the economists, most French politicians do not want to say anything in
public which could jeopardise ratification of the Maastricht pact in Denmark
and Britain.

SENIOR Russian officials have cautioned east European countries not to form
closer political and military ties with Ukraine, according to officials in
Kiev and western diplomats.
A senior official in the Ukrainian foreign ministry warned that in the past
few weeks conservatives had taken over Russian foreign policy making, and
had now launched a campaign to bring Ukraine back under Russian hegemony.
The change in Russian attitudes towards Ukraine comes at a time when
hardliners in Moscow have been winning political showdowns with President
Boris Yeltsin, forcing him to take a less conciliatory line to neighbouring
states than he might otherwise adopt.
This month, for example, Mr Yeltsin called on the United Nations to give
Russia special authority to police disputes in the former Soviet Union,
eliciting protests from independent-minded republics such as Ukraine and
Moldova.
'Russia's attitude toward its neighbours can now be compared to Germany's in
1939,' the Ukrainian official said. 'This is a crucial moment when the west
must realise that the consequences of a policy of appeasement are as
dangerous as they were in 1939.'
Western diplomats in Ukraine say they are concerned about the new trend. One
said Russian officials were warning east European countries 'not to bother
building large embassies in Kiev because within 18 months they will be
downgraded to consular sections.'
Mr Sergei Stankevich, a political adviser to Mr Yeltsin, recently warned
Poland to limit growing political and military ties with Ukraine. Speaking
in Warsaw last month, Mr Stankevich said Ukraine and Belarus fell within
Russia's sphere of influence and Russia was opposed to the increasingly cosy
relationship between Ukraine and Poland in foreign and military policy.
In the past three months four Polish ministers, including the prime minister
and minister of defence, have visited Ukraine. A year ago Poland was the
first country to recognise Ukraine and it has signed a number of military
and political agreements with its neighbour.
Ties are also growing with Hungary, where Ukrainian president Leonid
Kravchuk travelled this month.

<TEXT>
CONCERN about safety and environmental protection measures in the German
chemical industry intensified yesterday as parliament announced an emergency
debate on a series of accidents at plants operated by Hoechst.
At the same time, the federal Ministry of Environment ordered a government
commission to investigate Monday's chemical explosion at a Hoechst plant
near Frankfurt, which left one worker dead and another suffering from
third-degree burns.
Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, called for tougher application of
the safety controls enforced by the state-run Technical Inspection Agency,
TUV. He said: 'We have to bring in external expertise, for example by
sending in the TUV to these plants to review safety precautions.'
The German Chemical Industry Association rejected stricter controls, saying
that chemical enterprises were already making all necessary safety checks in
their plants. 'I do not think that safety standards could be increased by
external expertise,' Mr Wilfried Sahm, chairman of the association, said.
But the explosion, following a series of accidents at Hoechst plants,
amounts to a severe public relations setback for the chemical industry,
which came under attack both in the press and among politicians yesterday.
Less than a month ago, an accident at Hoechst released 10 tonnes of
chemicals into the sky over a Frankfurt suburb. Last Friday 100 litres of a
potentially poisonous solution were discharged into the Rhine.
Mr Michael Muller, environment spokesman for the opposition Social
Democrats, said yesterday that 11 accidents in the space of a few weeks must
produce some response from legislators. 'Clearly, the current security
measures are not adequate to reduce the potential danger of chemical
production,' he said. 'It is a worrying sign that Hoechst cannot give
precise information about the dangers from the emissions.'
The environmental group Greenpeace yesterday blockaded the main Hoechst
plant near Frankfurt after the company refused to allow it to take samples
of water and earth from the site.

SPAIN'S year-on-year inflation rate has fallen to 4.7 per cent, its lowest
level since June 1988, the consumer price index for January published
yesterday showed.
The January statistics, which were held over for a month while the index's
weighting was overhauled, showed a CPI rise of just 0.9 per cent. Figures
for February, which will be published next week, are expected to bring the
12-month inflation rate down to below 4.5 per cent.
Domestic inflation began to peak in the third quarter of last year: Spain's
GDP registered a negative growth over the last three months of 1992, - 0.2
per cent, and the CPI ended last year with a rise of 5.4 per cent that was
marginally down on the December 1991 figure. The markets had expected the
recession to be reflected by a fast fall in the inflation rate at the start
of this year.
Underlying inflation, which does not include the more volatile prices of
non-processed foods and energy, fell by slightly less than the headline
rate, to come down from 6.9 per cent at the end of December to 6.5 per cent
in January.
The lower inflation rate, which is a direct result of the slump in domestic
demand, has fuelled hopes for a cut in the official intervention rate early
next week at the Bank of Spain's routine repurchase tender for its
certificates of deposit. Such expectations will be all the higher should the
Bundesbank ease interest rates tomorrow.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Escudo knocked by conflicting signals: A crisis of
confidence after Portuguese central bank deputy chief's resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL'S financial markets, disoriented by contradictory signals from the
government and the central bank, lapsed yesterday into a crisis of
confidence after the resignation last Thursday of the bank's deputy governor
in an apparent policy rift with the government.
The Bank of Portugal said it had again had to intervene to defend the escudo
from speculation as the currency opened at a low Es93 to the D-mark. Heavy
central bank buying through the day drove it back up to Es92.63, dealers
said. Immediately after the resignation of Mr Antonio Borges the escudo fell
to a record low of Es94.
The crisis stems from government ambiguity about whether it intends to
maintain a policy of a strong escudo and high interest rates or it is
preparing to relax exchange-rate and monetary policy to foster faster
growth.
'The government has left the market perplexed about whether its is preparing
an about-turn in economic policy or it plans to maintain its tough stance,'
said Mr Jose Tavares Moreira, a former governor of the Bank of Portugal.
The crisis seems almost unreal. Until now, the centre-right Social
Democratic government and the central bank have worked closely together in
pursuing a strong escudo and tight monetary policy as the key weapons
against Portuguese inflation, which fell from 11.4 per cent in 1991 to 8.9
per cent in 1992.
But not everybody is celebrating. Expensive money and high export prices
caused by the strength of the escudo are taking a heavy toll in agriculture
and traditional industries such as textiles, garments and footwear. Protests
from industry are constant and farmers have tipped wine and potatoes they
are unable to market on the steps of government offices.
'These are difficulties of the transition of the Portuguese economy that
were foreseeable as soon as we joined the EC in 1986,' says Mr Miguel
Namorado Rosa, chief economist with Banco Comercial Portugues. Mr Borges at
the central bank had also often warned of the casualties that Portugal would
face when it came to transferring resources from non-competitive to
competitive sectors. He was respected for his firm line and professional
competence and appeared to have full government backing.
But doubts were raised about the government's commitment to the fight
against inflation in a speech last Thursday by Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo,
finance minister. He called the central bank to task for not listening to
the needs of the real economy and for not lowering interest rates faster.
The immediate result was Mr Borges's resignation and deep concern in the
financial markets. Was the government now going for growth at the expense of
inflation? Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, had just fueled
market suspicions by announcing an Es270bn (Pounds 1.22bn) housing programme
to wipe out shanty towns and slum dwellings that would boost the
construction industry. He admitted the programme would worsen the budget
deficit.
But the Bank of Portugal already enjoys considerable independence and it
seems clear that Mr Borges was expected to ignore the finance minister's
remarks. There are important local elections in Portugal in December and the
minister may, analysts believe, simply have been trying to make the right
noises.
The government, though, is in a bind of its own making. With the elections
in view, it cannot openly reverse its calls for lower interest rates but it
badly needs to repair the damage it has done to the escudo.
'The finance minister's speech was for consumption by worried
industrialists, farmers and commercial companies,' says Mr Namorado Rosa.
'The aim is to give the impression that the government wants to be more
flexible but in reality nothing is going to change.'
Supporting this view is the fact that Mr Miguel Beleza, governor of the Bank
of Portugal, has stayed at his post. The central bank has even edged up its
intervention rates slightly.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Union threatens German steel strike

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German steel employers association meets tomorrow to decide its next
step after the breakdown of arbitration talks with IG Metall, the country's
giant engineering union, over a wage settlement for the east German steel
industry.
The fifth round of talks unexpectedly broke down in Berlin after IG Metall
rejected a 9 per cent pay offer by the employers association. IG Metall said
yesterday it would continue to insist on a 20 per cent increase, agreed
under a programme of equalising pay between western and eastern German
workers by April 1994.
The union said it expected the employers to follow Gesamtmetall, the metal
and electrical employers association, in revoking the March 1991 contract
when it meets tomorrow. The union said if that happened it would respond
with warning strikes, followed by a ballot on a full strike if IG Metall's
20,000 members in east Germany did not receive the 20 per cent pay rise on
April 1.
Rank-and-file support for such action is uncertain. Since Gesamtmetall
revoked earlier this month the contract guaranteeing east German metal and
electrical workers a 26 per cent wage increase, several factory managers in
the region have started negotiating separate pay deals with the unions.
A foreign manager of a company which has invested heavily in eastern
Germany, said yesterday he was prepared to offer a 15 per cent increase.
'This is realistic in view of the fact that our productivity is 65 per cent
of west German levels,' he said.
IG Metall yesterday shrugged off moves towards separate wage agreements,
saying that warning strikes would reveal whether its members were prepared
to continue to pay west German prices while earning east German wages.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Socialist group in the European Parliament called yesterday for a 20 per
cent cut in EC carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2005 - a much steeper
reduction than the target the Community is already struggling to meet.
The ambitious target is part of a list of 55 environmental measures the
Socialists are advancing as a programme the EC should now take up with the
same vigour the Community demonstrated in creating the single European
market, which came into force this year.
The EC is committed to stabilising CO emissions at 1990 levels by 2000,
although Germany and Denmark have set themselves the 20 per cent cuts the
Socialists are calling for by 2005, and Belgium and the Netherlands are
aiming at 5 per cent cuts by 2000.
The 199 Socialists MEPs are the largest bloc in the European Parliament, and
one of their number, Mr Ken Collins, Labour Euro-MP for Strathclyde East in
Britain, chairs its environment committee, which has had significant
influence in shaping EC 'green' standards.
The committee is one of the most heavily-lobbied bodies in the EC,
especially by industry.
The programme calls for early agreement on the controversial energy tax
proposed by the European Commission to cut CO emissions and combat global
warming, and mandatory energy efficiency standards on a wide range of
appliances such as boilers, washing machines and cars.
It would also introduce a general duty for manufacturers to take back and
recycle 'end-of-life' products, move towards a comprehensive system of
environmental liability, and strictly enforce environmental impact
assessment on construction projects and all EC-funded programmes, in and
outside Europe.
EC environmental impact assessment rules have been an area of consistent
friction between Brussels and all member states, particularly the UK,
although the Commission has been backing away from legal action for fear of
further upset in the tortuous ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Under Maastricht, the European Parliament will get 'co-decision,' or a
legislative voice equal to the Council of Ministers of the 12 in setting
framework programmes for the environment. But it will still be consulted
only on measures with fiscal, land use, water resources or choice of energy
resources implications. Under EC rules only the commission can propose such
changes.
Mr Collins, presenting the 55-point programme in Paris yesterday, said: 'It
is now eight years since the White Paper on the completion of the internal
market, and the project is all but complete. We must now plan for the next
decade and the big idea must be the environment.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / Bundesbank cautious over rates: Solidarity pact welcome but
not reason enough for cut, says Issing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAST weekend's solidarity agreement between the German government and
opposition was a positive development, but not a reason in itself for easing
interest rates, Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the Bundesbank's directorate
said yesterday.
Monetary developments remained the main basis for such decisions, he told a
conference in Wolfsburg. But Mr Issing welcomed the pact because it spelt an
end to political uncertainty.
The central bank council would carefully examine its implications for public
sector debt and taxation levels at its meeting tomorrow. 'We have to analyse
what the result means in concrete terms for the economy,' he told reporters.
While the weekend package has been widely welcomed for its political
implications, analysts suggest that it will lead to increased government
deficits in the near-term, and point out that the direct and indirect tax
increases run counter to the Bundesbank's declared preference for spending
cuts rather than higher taxation.
Mr Issing's caution was in distinct contrast to an upbeat claim from Mr Theo
Waigel, finance minister, that circumstances for further interest rate cuts
had been improved.
Now that money supply was on course, conditions were more favourable, he
said.
Mr Waigel added, however, that he did not want to predict if, when and to
what extent rates would fall, because he did not want to speculate.
Many analysts say a cut of at least 0.25 per cent in the 8 per cent discount
and 9 per cent Lombard rates is likely tomorrow, although they agree that
last weekend's political developments will have at best a neutral impact on
the bank council's thinking.
According to Mr Issing, monetary policy was not part of the solidarity pact,
nor was it a slave to other political circumstances.
He was not sure if February's money supply figures would be available for
tomorrow's meeting of the bank's central council, but inflation was still
too high, he noted.
However, growth in the M3 measure of money supply is widely believed to be
shrinking under the pressure of recession. Inflation, 4.2 per cent at the
last reckoning, is tending to fall. While wholesale prices rose 0.2 per cent
between January and February, they were still 1.8 per cent lower than a year
earlier, the federal statistics office reported yesterday.
In January, M3 contracted at an annualised rate of 2.4 per cent, revised
from a preliminary 2.3 per cent, in contrast to the bank's target range of
4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent annual growth. Preliminary figures are usually
available around the 20th of each month.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank held to the lower rates at which it supplies
wholesale funds to the money market with the announcement of a fixed rate
tender for securities repurchase funds at 8.25 per cent.
Despite apparent tightness in the market - call money rates rose towards
8.75 per cent yesterday after 8.40-8.45 per cent on Monday - the central
bank said it believed that there was enough liquidity in the markets.
Mr Johann Gaddum, a directorate member, said that the fresh 'repo'
allocation was expected to ease some of the 'unjustified' concern in the
markets.
The bank surprised markets earlier this month when it lowered the repo rate
by almost a quarter of a point to 8.25 per cent. This was seen at the time
as a signal that the discount and Lombard rates were likely to be cut at
this week's meeting.

<TEXT>
FROM Sakhalin Island near Japan to Murmansk near Norway, Russia's regions
are weighing up the consequences of the political crisis in Moscow with less
trepidation than President Boris Yeltsin.
As Mr Sergei Shakhrai, Mr Yeltsin's chief legal adviser, met the heads of
local emergency committees, local officials interviewed in a straw poll
yesterday were sceptical about the need or likelihood of extraordinary
measures.
While the legislative and executive branches battle it out in Moscow,
Russia's 89 constituent republics and regions are demanding more freedom to
run their affairs as promised in a federation treaty signed by all parties
last year.
Under threat from a Congress of People's Deputies, Mr Yeltsin has argued
that only a strong presidency can push through radical economic reforms and
keep together a country spanning 14 time zones.
But Ms Zoya Kornilova, both a deputy and the official representative in
Moscow of Sakha, the autonomous republic which produces most of Russia's
diamonds, said the Congress had spared President Yeltsin a humiliating
defeat by banning the referendum he wants. 'He has enough powers. He just
has not used them effectively,' she said, adding that Sakha, better known as
Yakutia, could not guarantee that a referendum would obtain a quorum.
Mr Ivan Shabunin, head of the regional administration of Volgograd in
southern Russia which has forged ahead with economic reforms, dismissed a
statement by President Yeltsin's spokesman that the Congress was trying to
restore communism.
'We just need to work,' he said, supporting a statement by regional chiefs
calling for a moratorium on all elections and referendums this year and
next. 'Let those who started reforms carry them through and take
responsibility for them.'
Dr Vyacheslav Silin, deputy chief of the Murmansk regional administration,
was alone among those surveyed in sharing the president's fears: he pointed
out that if radical reforms were not allowed to succeed, regions would try
to fend for themselves and accelerate a break-up of Russia.
But he said he doubted Mr Yeltsin could count on sufficient support from
structures like the army to introduce presidential rule. With most Russians
disillusioned with politics, many regional chiefs feared that a referendum
turnout would be low.
Many are looking for change from the government of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin,
who has pledged tough financial policies combined with the removal of
special tax privileges for individual regions and enterprises.
Mr Grigory Shamin, head of the regional council of Tomsk in Siberia,
complained that last year the federal government had allowed regions only 19
per cent of revenues, but that individual regions, including Tomsk, had been
able to keep 50 per cent after lobbying Moscow.
'Why don't they just give us all 40 per cent?' he asked.
Mr Viktor Sirenko, deputy governor of Sakhalin Island, said Moscow had to
stop treating the regions 'like slaves'.

THE European Commission is expected next week to clear the way for talks on
Norway's application to join the European Community, Commission officials
said yesterday, Reuters reports from Brussels.
Adoption of an EC report at the Commission's weekly meeting next Wednesday
will mean talks can open with Oslo during a formal ceremony at the April 5
meeting of EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg.
The ceremony will be televised just as were the opening of talks with
Austria, Finland and Sweden on February 1.
Once talks are launched they should be brought quickly up to speed so they
can proceed in parallel with the other three applicants, which have already
held two rounds of talks.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Forecast of Pounds 50bn PSBR alarms City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY gave a lukewarm reaction to the Budget, with some fund managers and
brokers predicting that share prices would open sharply lower this morning.
The chancellor's forecast that the public sector borrowing requirement will
be Pounds 50bn next year caused concern. Mr Graeme Knox, managing director
of Scottish Amicable's investment managers, said: 'Mr Lamont's Pounds 50bn
PSBR forecast is horrific.'
Mr Keith Percy, head of fund management at Morgan Grenfell, the merchant
bank, said: 'The stock market will go down tomorrow. It is likely to be 50
points lower by 10am.'
The forecast budget deficit prompted a fall yesterday of 1 1/4 points in the
price of long-dated gilt-edged stock. However, sterling rose against the
D-Mark, as currency dealers interpreted the chancellor's remarks as
signalling there would not be interest rate cuts in the short term.
Banks said they had no plans to increase their purchases of gilts in spite
of the chancellor's decision to allow bank and building society purchases of
gilt-edged stock to count towards the funding of the public sector deficit.
Both Barclays and NatWest said that they had no plans to increase their
purchases of gilts.
Forecasts that share prices would fall today were prompted by the
chancellor's decision to cut the tax levied on dividends, called advance
corporation tax, from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.
Because pension funds can reclaim this tax from the government, the effect
on them of the tax cut is to reduce their income from holding shares, so
some said that they might switch into gilts.
On the basis of the new tax rate, the stock market's average gross dividend
yield would have been 3.88 per cent last night, compared with the actual
rate of 4.14 per cent.
Analysts said that the stock market might also be depressed by the separate
Budget proposal to classify dividends paid out of UK companies' overseas
profits as 'foreign income dividends'.
No tax credits would be available on these dividends, causing a further
reduction in pension funds' income.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Growth now but pain later: Lamont delays big tax increases
until next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT took a calculated gamble with Britain's finances yesterday
by leaving the economy to grow out of recession in 1993-94, postponing the
pain of big tax increases until April 1994 and beyond.
But the chancellor unnerved the City by forecasting a Pounds 50.1bn public
sector borrowing requirement for 1993-94, some Pounds 5bn higher than
expectations. This led to a sharp 1 point fall in prices for government
gilt-edged securities.
Presenting his third Budget, and the last of the traditional spring
revenue-raising Budgets, the chancellor announced:
A series of measures to help industry and small businesses.
A Pounds 230m package to provide opportunities for the long-term unemployed.
A modest extension in the range of value added tax to domestic fuel and
power, to take effect from April 1994.
Moves to increase the importance of the 20 per cent income tax band
introduced last year.
A boost to the housing market by cutting stamp duty.
A relaxation of the 'full funding' rule so that bank and building society
purchases of gilts will count towards financing the PSBR.
Increased National Insurance contributions from 1994-95.
The Budget envisages a net increase in taxation of only Pounds 490m in the
coming financial year - well below the Pounds 2.25bn tax rise expected in
financial markets.
Although his long and complex speech failed to excite Tory backbenchers
seeking a revival in the government's battered fortunes and drew withering
scorn from the opposition, the chancellor spoke as a man who intended to
stay in his job for some years to come.
Following the recent example of US president Bill Clinton, Mr Lamont
announced substantial tax rises for later years. He declared his intention
to enact as many as possible into law by August when discussion of the
finance bill must be completed. The measures announced yesterday will raise
Pounds 6.73bn in extra taxes in 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96.
Mr Lamont said that Britain would grow faster than its European Community
partners this year. He forecast that the economy would expand by 1.25 per
cent in 1993 and at an annual rate of 3 per cent in the first half of 1994.
He made clear that the government believes bank base rates, at 6 per cent,
are appropriate to current economic conditions.
Although Mr Lamont did not mention it, yesterday's Budget marked a
significant dilution of the government's earlier policy of balancing the
Budget over the economic cycle.
The Treasury 'Red Book', issued after the chancellor sat down, showed that
it was the government's objective to reduce the PSBR to Pounds 39bn by
1995-96 and Pounds 30bn by 1997-98. In five years, Britain will have a
deficit of 3 3/4 per cent of gross domestic product - more than the level
specified as appropriate in the Maastricht treaty - compared with 8 per cent
in the coming financial year.
Mr Lamont said his Budget was one for 'sustained recovery' and for jobs 'not
just for this year and for next year, but right through the decade'.
The Budget bore the hallmarks of having paid close attention to the pleas of
big industry and small businesses alike, by announcing a two-stage reduction
in advance corporation tax rates and more flexibility in the handling of
penalties for late value added tax returns and misdeclarations.
Many of the tax increases announced yesterday were designed with more than
one objective in mind. They also sought to interfere as little as possible
with the supply side of the economy.
Where he 'gave away' taxes in the coming financial year, the chancellor made
sure that there would be even bigger income flows for the government in
future years.
The chancellor, for example, used environmental arguments to justify higher
taxes on domestic fuel and petrol. He announced plans to levy VAT on
domestic fuel and power from April 1994 - initially at 8 per cent and after
a year at the full standard rate of 17.5 per cent - and to raise duties on
petrol and other road fuels by at least 3 per cent in real terms in future
budgets after a rise of 10 per cent in 1993-94.
These measures would help the UK to meet two-thirds of its target for
reducing carbon dioxide emissions under the United Nations Convention on
Climatic Change, he said. As expected, Mr Lamont froze income tax allowances
and thresholds for 1993-94, raising some Pounds 660m in the process, and
left income tax rates unchanged at 20 per cent, 25 per cent and 40 per cent.
He took modest steps to strengthen the role of the 20 per cent tax rate in
the income tax system.
The 20 per cent band will be extended by more than indexation to Pounds
2,500 in 1993-94 and by a further Pounds 500 in 1994-95 as a step towards
turning it into the basic rate of income tax.
The chancellor also reduced the tax credit on dividends from 25 per cent to
20 per cent in 1993-94 and plans to restrict the tax relief on married
couples to 20 per cent from April next year.
In moves designed to give a short-term boost to the housing market, he
doubled the stamp duty threshold for transactions on houses, land and
property to Pounds 60,000 immediately - at a cost of Pounds 220m in 1993-94
and Pounds 270m the following year.
But from April 1994, tax relief on mortgage interest payments will be
restricted to 20 per cent of the Pounds 30,000 limit compared with 25 per
cent at present. This will yield an estimated Pounds 820m in 1994-95, rising
to Pounds 870m the following financial year and cost households Pounds 10 a
month.
Smokers, drinkers and car drivers will feel the impact of the Budget
immediately. Alcohol duties, other than spirits, rose by 5 per cent last
night, putting 1 1/2 pence on a pint of beer and 5 1/2 pence on a bottle of
wine.
Tobacco duties increased by 6.5 per cent, adding 10 pence to the price of a
packet of cigarettes.
National Insurance contributions for employees and the self-employed will
rise from 1994-95 onwards, increasing government income in that year by
Pounds 1.79bn and by Pounds 2.22bn in 1995-96.
Among measures to deal with some of Britain's 3m jobless, Mr Lamont
announced plans for four pilot schemes that would subsidise employers to
create jobs for the long-term unemployed.
He also announced a number of projects to boost investment in infrastructure
with private finance. These include the Heathrow Express rail link to
Paddington Station, which will go ahead as a joint venture between British
Rail and BAA, and the Channel tunnel rail link, which is to proceed as a
joint venture between the public and private sectors by the end of the
decade.
The Budget set aside more funds to help exporters to fast-growing markets.
The need for such a measure was emphasised by the Treasury forecast that the
current account balance of payments deficit would rise this year to Pounds
17.5bn from Pounds 12bn in 1992.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Widespread anger as VAT is levied on home fuel bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, DEBORAH HARGREAVES and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE much-feared increase in value added tax on Britain's wide range of
zero-rated items was limited to a delayed increase in household power bills.
VAT will be introduced on domestic fuel and power at an 8 per cent rate from
April 1994 and at the full 17.5 per cent from April 1995.
Mr Norman Lamont used environmental arguments to justify the new levy but
was bitterly attacked for doing so by the opposition, consumer and poverty
action groups.
The change takes the UK into line with other European countries, all of
which, except Ireland, levy VAT on fuel bills.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, accused Mr Lamont of
'endangering the lives of many elderly people'.
British Gas, which has cut domestic gas prices by 20 per cent since it was
privatised in 1986, said its customers would be 'disappointed' at the VAT
burden. But it had schemes which could help people with difficulty paying
their bills, it said.
Mr Lamont said levying VAT on domestic fuel bills would encourage greater
energy efficiency in every household, helping the UK to achieve targets set
in the world environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro last year.
Electricity and gas industry analysts, however, said that the changes would
have only a limited impact on company profits because demand for household
fuel and power, seen as a basic necessity, is relatively inelastic. Energy
shares might fall, nevertheless, on sentiment, they said.
The measure would raise Pounds 950m in 1994-95, Pounds 2.3bn in 1995-96 and
Pounds 3bn a year thereafter. Social security benefits would rise
automatically to reflect the price effect of this change, the chancellor
said. The government recognised that the change would cause difficulties for
those on low incomes and would take this into account when income-related
benefits rose next year.
The average household spends about Pounds 300 on electricity and Pounds 300
on gas. Help the Aged said the average single-household elderly person spent
Pounds 8.50 a week on fuel and this would rise by Pounds 1.50. State pension
and income support should rise in line, it said.
The Gas Consumers' Council said the imposition of VAT on fuel bills was a
'punitive tax'. It said it wanted the government to make grants available
for energy efficiency improvements to help offset the burden of higher fuel
costs.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Tory acclaim tempered by worries over deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOUGHEST budget for more than a decade was last night greeted by the
government's supporters at Westminster with a mixture of weary resignation
and dutiful applause.
Backing among Conservative MPs for Mr Norman Lamont's decision to tackle the
soaring budget deficit was matched by deep concern over the scale of the
task facing the government in restoring its battered political authority.
Cabinet colleagues said the chancellor's tough package - albeit with most of
the pain deferred until next year - was designed to demonstrate that the
Treasury had restored a grip on economic policy after last year's sterling
debacle.
But a scathing Commons attack by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, dispelled
any illusions that it would bring short-term popularity. Mr Smith's comment
that it was a 'shameful budget from a cynical party' was followed by the
private admission of one minister that Mr Lamont had offered no more or less
than an 'acknowledgement of the depressing reality'.
As Conservative MPs digested the implications of a Pounds 1bn-a-week budget
deficit and the blatant reversal of their election tax pledges, one instant
judgment was that Mr Lamont had strengthened his hold on the chancellorship.
With much of the content of the second budget in November pre-empted by
yesterday's package, the consensus was that the pressure on the prime
minister to reshuffle his cabinet in July had diminished.
Mr Lamont chose also to underline his support among his party's
Euro-sceptics with two deliberate references in his speech to his
determination to keep Britain's social and tax policies out of the hands of
Brussels.
But Mr John Major's associates insisted that no decisions had been taken on
the prospect or otherwise of cabinet changes, leaving the chancellor's fate
dependent on the pace of economic recovery.
Strong support for the measures in the Budget to help industry and the
unemployed was coupled with relief on the Tory
backbenches at the decision not to risk the fragile economic recovery by
deferring tax increases until next year.
Most thought the chancellor has struck the right balance between promoting
economic growth now and persuading the financial markets that the government
has a credible medium term programme to reduce the budget deficit.
But enthusiasm for the decision to defer the extension of valued added tax,
the increase in National Insurance contributions and the reduction in
mortgage interest relief was tempered by concern over the medium term
outlook. As ministers and Tory MPs studied the fine print they were hit by
the realisation that two years of substantial tax increases will still leave
a budget deficit of Pounds 30bn by the time of the next general election in
1997.
Senior Whitehall officials sought to counter that by stressing that by
putting large tax increases in place now the chancellor had left open the
possibility of modest cuts in income tax in the approach to the election.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Three ways to stop tax savings -
Avoidance Rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR announ-ced three measures yesterday to counteract tax saving
by UK companies. All three measures will have immediate effect.
The first is to bring within the UK tax net more overseas subsidiaries
situated in low tax countries, the so-called controlled foreign companies.
Under present arrangements, overseas companies will become subject to UK
corporation tax if they pay local tax at less than half the UK rate. The
chancellor proposes that this limit should be raised to three-quarters.
As a result, many UK subsidiaries operating in such places as Hong Kong will
now become subject to UK tax. The tax burden of the UK holding company will
therefore rise.
Measures are also proposed to tax interest received by UK companies from
their overseas associated companies on an accounts basis.
Previously the interest may have been taxed when it was received, and
provided an opportunity for a group to benefit from a tax deferral on the
interest received in the UK. At the same time, the paying company was
receiving overseas tax relief when the interest was charged to its own
accounts. The proposals will reduce the attractiveness of such arrangements.
Finally, the chancellor has moved to prevent groups of companies from
benefiting from the use of capital losses in companies they have purchased
from outside the group. The Inland Revenue had previously announced that it
would not object to the purchase and use of these capital loss companies,
but the loss of tax revenue to the exchequer from the use of such companies
to reduce groups' tax liabilities has clearly caused a rethink.

in a few cases of about a half, compared with currently when the new
business car taxation structure takes effect from April 6 1994.
However, the remainder of the UK's 2m company car driver population can
expect to see their bills fall by up to a third compared with the current
tax year.
The new structure, which disregards some of the key elements in outline
proposals for reform put out by the Inland Revenue last year, will give
fresh incentive to companies to examine cash alternatives to the company car
 -at least for some categories of user.
Hardest hit will be senior executives with cars currently costing about
Pounds 19,000 and covering fewer than 2,500 business miles annually. Typical
beneficiaries will be junior executives, driving cheaper cars for more than
2,500 business miles.
This outcome is the result of a revised taxation structure under which, to
the relief of accountants, fleet managers and most car makers, the current
awkward system of scale charges - arrived at through engine capacity and
price banding - is scrapped.
In its place will come one based on a simple 35 per cent of all cars' list
prices. This level was marginally higher than proposed by the Revenue.
Drivers covering 2,500-18,000 business miles will have a discount of a third
on their assessment; drivers covering more than 18,000 a discount of
two-thirds.
This of itself might not please individual taxpayers.
But in also rejecting the Revenue's proposal to retain banding, albeit based
only on price and with a dozen bands, Mr Lamont has certainly pleased much
of the motor industry.
It should end 'tax break specials' and other market-distorting factors which
have been criticised by, among others, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
and which have arisen from price 'breakpoints', at Pounds 19,250 and Pounds
29,000, above which the assessed tax benefit rises sharply.
It is also self-adjusting, ending much of the sales-depressing market
uncertainty that in the past has always surrounded Budget time, as company
car makers, dealers and buyers have waited to see what the latest scale
charge increases would be.
Under the new system, the increase in taxation will automatically be
determined by inflation - as new car prices rise, the assessed tax benefit
will rise in proportion. In terms of the new system's long-term effects, one
important 'unknown' for the vehicle industry will not be clarified until it
has been operative for some time. Will it lead to a general company car
'downsizing' as a result of company car drivers having more flexibility in
choosing the size of their tax bill?
Should it do so on any significant scale, vehicle makers may yet come to
regret their current support for the changes. Makers of luxury cars such as
Rolls-Royce will be hurt by the lack of a 'cap' on the list price formula.
Currently, the tax charge on a Pounds 100,000 Rolls-Royce is the same as on
a Pounds 35,000 Jaguar.
When the scheme arrives, increases for company car drivers will be less
draconian than they might appear, because of the 8 per cent increase in the
scale charges under the current system announced for the 1993-94 tax year.
But Mr Lamont is stepping firmly on the least defensible company car 'perk'
 -free fuel for private motoring. The scale charge for that shoots up by 20
per cent, and out goes the 50 per cent reduction in the scale charge for
high business mileage users. Both are well above inflation, and their
introduction will mean the government then will regard company car users as
fairly taxed relative to private motorists.
This is well above current inflation, and when it comes in next month will
mean the Government then regarding company car users as fairly taxed
relative to private motorists.
Despite the uneven impact of the new regime in 1994, it is not intended to
tighten the screw of company car taxation, in real terms, any further.
There will, however, be some disappointment that the business mileage bands
were not adjusted.
Under next year's scheme, clear 'perk' car users, those covering fewer than
2,500 business miles a year, will pay tax at their marginal rate on the full
35 per cent of a car's list price. The main problem comes with the middle
band, representing around 1.35m of the total, covering 2,500-18,000 business
miles a year.
What then becomes self-defeating in terms of business costs and efficiency,
and even for the environment, is that there is then a strong temptation for
such employees to invent unnecessary business trips solely to reach the
18,000 mile threshold.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Details satisfy majority of
entrepreneurs - Small Business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEVER budget showing an understanding of the issues of concern to small
businesses, was the near unanimous reaction of organisations representing
small companies to the most wide ranging of small business budget packages
in recent memory.
For a sector of the business community which has been particularly hard hit
by recession, the chancellor's combination of tax changes, reductions in red
tape, and adjustments to business support schemes came as a welcome relief.
Mr Norman Lamont's measures showed a fine feel for the detail of the
problems which confront the small business owner within a framework which
acknowledged the importance of their contribution to the economy.
The measures covered the full spread of the small business community from
tax simplification for the self employed through to an easing of the capital
gains tax burden on successful entrepreneurs selling their businesses.
The Loan Guarantee Scheme changes took in the struggling young business
unable to match the bank manager's normal loan criteria. Cuts in export
credit insurance premiums will help the medium-sized company trying to
establish itself in overseas markets.
But set against the wide range of measures tailored for the small business,
or intended to have the greatest impact in that sector, were a number of
general measures which will have an adverse affect on small firms and the
self employed.
Increases in petrol duties and the promise of steadily rising fuel prices in
the years ahead were most unwelcome while the 1 percentage point rise in
Class 4 National Insurance contributions by the self employed from 1994 were
also met with dismay.
Turning to the chancellor's specific proposals, the steps announced to
reduce red tape were widely welcomed.
The proposed simplification of the tax system for the self employed and the
shift towards self-assessment hold out the promise of fewer night shifts
spent making the tax books balance. The small business community has
developed a wariness about the impact of attempts to deregulate so will wait
to see how the changes work out in practice.
The announcement of a consultation paper on the subject of the small firms
audit was also welcomed but the small firms audit has been debated for more
than a decade and the banks, the Inland Revenue and at least one accountancy
organisation still have considerable reservations.
more rapidly than the administration of the tax system it is the penalties
which are imposed when the business owner gets it wrong.
The announcement from the chancellor that the scope of the serious
misdeclaration penalty is to be reduced and only the larger, persistent
offenders will be pursued was particularly welcome.
The decision to give customs officers discretion to mitigate VAT penalties
depending on individual circumstances was a significant easing of what has
been widely seen as a draconian penalty system.
The decision to 'free' entrepreneurs locked into businesses which they could
not sell without incurring sizeable capital gains tax liabilities will be
welcomed by many ambitious business owners as well as by the venture capital
industry.
Providing rollover relief to entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds of a
sale in another unquoted business, should encourage the 'serial
entrepreneur,' the businessman who goes on to found a second and even a
third business.
Perhaps the most controversial move by the chancellor was to ease the
conditions of the government's Loan Guarantee Scheme. He has moved to reduce
the cost of scheme but his proposed changes will do nothing to reduce the
dependence of the scheme on the willingness of the banks to take part.
An improved loan guarantee scheme is still only a half-way house towards a
subsidised small business loan fund which the small firms lobbyists have
been calling for for several years. There is still no real replacement in
sight for the Business Expansion Scheme which expires at the end of the
year.
Pleased though they are with budget measures announced yesterday, the small
business groups are hoping for further action in this area in the November
budget.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): A chance to work out your own bill -
Assessment

   THE 8m people who receive a tax return every year
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
half of them self-employed, the others taxpayers such as directors of
companies - will from 1997 be able to calculate their own tax liabilities.
If they opt for self assessment, they will make their own calculation, then
send off a cheque to the Inland Revenue, based on how much they owe.
The Revenue will not check all these returns, but if they do, they will
charge penalties and interest on those that are found to be incorrect.
This system will not affect the basic PAYE system for people who receive
income from employment. But it will apply to all those who earn money in
other ways, and currently fill in a Schedule D and investment income tax
return. It will not affect people who claim repayment of tax on bank and
building society interest.
People who opt to have the Inland Revenue work out their tax bill, as at
present, will have to submit their tax returns six months earlier than those
who opt for self assessment.
The Treasury has been talking about introducing this system for some time,
and it has spent much of the past two years in consultations. The idea is
one that is already in use in a number of other countries, particularly the
United States.
One big change, however, that became clear yesterday, will alter the basic
tax system in order to make it simple enough for the new self assessment
approach to be workable. There will be two big changes:
All of a taxpayer's income will now be brought together on one tax form,
whether it comes from employment, freelance earnings or investment. This
means that a taxpayer will now only be dealing with one tax office.
The 'prior-year' basis currently used for self-employed income will now be
abolished, and all income will be taxed on a current year basis. This means
that tax will be paid on income from self-employment in the year in which it
is earned, rather than a year later, as at present.
There will be transitional arrangements, which will leave some people as
winners and some as losers. One year will drop out of the tax calculations,
and whether you are a winner or a loser will depend on what sort of year
falls out.
One complaint that emerged from the consultation process was that the Inland
Revenue was not proposing to allow enough time for taxpayers to prepare for
the shift to the new system. As a result, the start date has been deferred
by another year until April 1997. Further consultation is proposed with
representative bodies and employers on the details of the new system.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Leg-up welcomed by Lloyd's -
Insurance Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S decision to modify the taxation of insurance reserves marks the
successful conclusion of a long campaign by both Lloyd's of London and the
UK's insurance companies. It was warmly welcomed by the industry.
New arrangements should improve the industry's ability to insure infrequent
but severe catastrophe losses.
The most important change concerns the troubled Lloyd's insurance market.
Under new rules, Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting -
will be allowed to establish more generous tax deductible reserves to meet
future losses.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said the industry had for some time 'been urging
the government for equality of treatment with their continental competitors'
by a change in the fiscal regime. 'The better-targeted reserve would
increase Lloyd's ability to deal with the type of risk in which we
specialise.'
A new tax deductible reserve will replace the special reserve fund, which
allows Names to set aside up to Pounds 7,000 each year against higher-rate
income tax. The level of the reserve has not been changed since 1955.
According to the arrangements which come into effect to cover the 1992
underwriting year, a Name will be able to transfer up to 50 per cent of
profits to the new reserve each year, provided that the maximum value of the
funds in the reserve does not exceed 50 per cent of the Name's overall
premium income limit - the limit they can accept.
Amounts withdrawn will be made to fund losses or cash calls. Amounts
withdrawn that are not used to meet losses will attract tax.
The chancellor also conceded that there 'may be a case' for allowing tax
relief on certain types of 'equalisation' reserve, potentially extending a
similar benefit for insurance companies. Most European insurers are allowed
to establish such reserves. A consultative paper will outline options.
Mr Mike Jones, chief executive, of the Association of British Insurers, the
trade association, said: 'It is obviously a step in the right direction.
They have accepted the principle of change.'
Lloyd's has also welcomed the simplification of other aspects of Names' tax
treatment; the most important concerns rules for the taxation of gains
accruing from the capital appreciation of premium trust funds made up of
premiums earned by underwriters. The chancellor proposes to tax such gains
as income rather than capital, bringing Lloyd's into line with insurance
companies.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Mortgage lenders' fears dispelled -
Housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR'S limitation of mortgage interest tax relief to 20 per cent
from next year, and his attempt to stimulate house sales by doubling the
threshold for stamp duty, are unlikely to have a dramatic effect on the
housing market.
There had been some fear among mortgage lenders that Mr Lamont would try to
enhance his reputation as a tax-reforming chancellor by taking more decisive
steps to end the subsidy to homeowners represented by mortgage tax relief.
They feared that would stifle the nascent slight recovery in the housing
market, expected by analysts in the coming year. The number of house price
transactions is only expected to rise about 20 per cent from 1992.
Building societies were relieved that Mr Lamont made a relatively cautious
adjustment to mortgage tax relief, and tried to balance it in the short-term
with a measure to stimulate activity among first-time buyers.
The chancellor will raise Pounds 900m in 1994-95 by restricting the interest
relief to 20 per cent. Individual borrowers will face a relatively slight
increase in payments. Those with loans above Pounds 30,000 will pay about
Pounds 10 more tax a month.
Some lenders believe that, combined with the end of tax relief at higher
rates in the last budget, represents a signal that mortgage tax relief will
eventually be phased out. The length of time that would take has reassured
some.
The stamp duty adjustment was trickier measure about which to convince
borrowers and lenders. That is because the temporary abolition of stamp duty
on properties worth up to Pounds 250,000 at the end of 1991 was judged a
failure.
It did little to stimulate the housing market until close to the deadline
last year, and then the fall in transactions following the deadline was
greater than the stimulus before, causing much discontent among lenders.
Mr Lamont avoided the trap of another temporary adjustment. Instead he tried
to concentrate stamp duty reform on first-time buyers, doubling the
threshold to Pounds 60,000. That is intended to provide a steadier stimulus
to the market.
He also implemented a solution to the 'negative equity' problem affecting
people who own properties worth less than the purchase price. They will now
be able to transfer tax relief to a new property on the old loan.
Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the net effect of
the measures would be 'nothing'. He believed the measures would not affect
the likely small upward movement in house transactions this year.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Formula for future financial
turbulence - Raised forecasts for the UK budget deficit will add to jitters
in the market for government bonds, says Barry Riley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The debt mountain is getting steeper. By setting his borrowing target for
the next financial year at Pounds 50bn, some Pounds 6bn more than his
implied forecast last November, and towards the top of the range of
expectation in the gilt-edged market, Mr Norman Lamont has increased the
danger that financial turbulence will develop over the next couple of years.
Certainly the medium term outlook for public finance looks troubled.
In pulling his punches on tax in the near term - with a neutral overall
impact on revenues in 1993-94 - the chancellor has followed the line of six
of his seven Wise Men. At least as influential, however, may have been the
smoothness with which the funding task has been accomplished so far. The
jump in the PSBR from Pounds 14bn in 1991-92 to Pounds 35bn in the financial
year now ending has been financed without crisis and at progressively lower
interest rates.
But already the influence of the global bond markets has become slightly
less benign in the past week or so, with the US long Treasury bond yield
flicking up slightly from its recent 20-year low. As for UK government
securities, there was inevitably a setback last night, with falls of just
over a point at the long end.
First, however, the positive news for gilts. The widely expected relaxation
of the full funding rule duly appeared, with the introduction of a new
provision that gilts sold to banks and building societies will count towards
funding.
This appears to fall a little short of a more comprehensive concession that
all purchases of public sector debt, including for instance Treasury Bills,
would count as funding. However, it is theoretically possible that the UK
banking system, which at present has only about 3 per cent of its assets
invested in the public sector, could absorb a substantial proportion of the
coming year's gilt issues - between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 20bn, say.
As part of the flexible funding policy the market would have also liked to
see a formal target range set for the broad money supply, M4. The woolliness
and inconsistency of monetary policy therefore remains a worry.
Second, Mr Lamont has uttered an Augustinian vow that virtue will be
achieved in the medium term. He has proposed 'wedges' of new taxation for
1994-95 and later years, and on the basis that the economy picks up speed
through the mid and late 1990s the Treasury's computer has been able to
crank out some declining, although still substantial, numbers for borrowing.
If growth continues to be disappointing, of course, the problem will not
fade away as outlined. And even if all goes according to plan the burden of
debt will rise substantially: from around 40 per cent of national income at
present, public sector indebtedness is likely to climb to at least 60 per
cent in another four years.
In itself that would be no worse a position that in the late 1970s and early
1980s. But in the past it has taken several episodes of double-digit
inflation, and a ruinous credit-based boom which pushed the public sector
into temporary surplus, to control the debt burden. This time, if the
government delivers its promise of low inflation, the real cost will be much
higher.
Yesterday Mr Lamont promised inflation of 2 1/2 per cent or less (in the
bottom half of the 1 to 4 per cent target range) by the end of the present
Parliament. But borrowing at the long end of the conventional gilts market
at present costs 8.3 per cent. The implied real rate of almost 6 per cent
will impose a heavy burden on future taxpayers.
What is the tactical room for manoeuvre? First of all, the government can
now look to the banking sector. Already the banks and building societies
have bought Pounds 5 1/2 bn of gilts in the first eleven months of the
current financial year, although under the previous rule this has had to be
duplicated by funding elsewhere.
Now the authorities are in a position to pursue active selling to the banks.
But they will not normally, the Treasury says, sell gilts of shorter
maturity than 3 years. Nor will banks typically wish to buy gilts further
out than five years because the capital risk becomes considerable.
The banks will buy only if they are offered a worthwhile yield incentive and
are confident that money market rates will stay low. It is on this basis
that banks in the US have bought vast quantities of public sector debt.
In the UK, however, the yield curve is all wrong at the short end. There is
no margin between 6 per cent money market rates and the redemption yield on
three-year gilts. Either base rates must go down to 5 per cent or less, or
the authorities must pump out new short gilt issues on a 7 per cent yield
basis, which would disrupt the market. So we must wait for serious action,
perhaps until a significant drop in German interest rates allows sterling
rates to be cut too. But serious action there must be, and soon.
Who else will take up gilts? The life assurance companies have been active
buyers, but pension funds were again net sellers last year, for the sixth
year in a row. In all, investment institutions have an annual cash flow of
about Pounds 38bn a year, but that is unlikely to grow significantly, and in
the past they have never put more than about 50 per cent of new cash into
gilts.
Note, however, the attack on pension fund equity holdings through the cut in
reclaimable income tax. Is this the start of an attempt to tilt the tax
playing-field in favour of gilts? The temptation will grow for this and
future chancellors if the deficit problems prove as bad as they are now
outlined.
The other possibility is to sell debt to foreigners. Since last August
overseas investors have turned their noses up at gilts, but they might
become interested again should sterling strengthen convincingly against the
Continental currencies. Then there is the possibility of borrowing in
foreign currencies. This year the balance of payments deficit is forecast at
Pounds 17.5bn, which the chancellor claimed yesterday would be 'easily
financeable': soon his agents at the Bank of England will have a chance to
demonstrate just how facile a process it can be.
Gimmicks such as tax-free gilt plans for private investors have rightly been
shunned. The chancellor is relying on the arithmetical approach, that
whatever the size of the deficit there must be balancing surpluses somewhere
that can be tapped. But the bigger the deficit the less the likelihood that
the financing can be done without periodic crises. The higher you climb up
the debt mountain the harder you may fall.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Tax change which will move markets -
John Plender says reforms to ACT may be esoteric but will have far-reaching
effects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes in the treatment of advance corporation tax (ACT) may sound
esoteric, but they are among the most important reforms in the budget. This
is partly because anomalies in the current system greatly distort corporate
investment decisions. For many of Britain's larger companies which have
substantial tax liabilities in foreign countries as well as in the UK, the
impact of ACT incorporates a powerful incentive to incur high costs overseas
and to generate high profits in the UK. One result of this quirk, which
British multinationals have frequently brought to the Treasury's attention,
is that there is a temptation to move knowledge-intensive activities such as
research and development to foreign subsidiaries.
But Mr Lamont has used the opportunity presented by this problem for a more
fundamental reform of the tax credit arrangements that apply to companies
and shareholders. This will have implications both for the stock market, and
for the income of institutional investors and higher rate tax payers.
The ACT problem began when Britain shifted from a 'classical' corporation
tax to an 'imputation' system under the Heath government in 1973. In the
classical system, the company pays corporation tax on its profits. Then,
when it pays a dividend, the shareholder pays income tax on the receipt. The
disadvantage of this system is that the owner's profit is taxed twice - once
in the hands of the company, then in the hands of the shareholder when
distributed.
Under an imputation system this double taxation is eliminated. Today British
companies pay corporation tax at 33 per cent on profits. They then deduct 25
per cent of the gross dividends paid out, in what amounts to an advance
collection of income tax. But the deduction is called advance corporation
tax and can be offset against the mainstream corporation tax liability of 33
per cent on overall profits.
The problem of unrelieved, or surplus, ACT arises where company dividends
are larger than the mainstream corporation tax bill in the UK. In the
present recession, companies that are paying dividends out of reserves fall
into this category. But the more important group consists of companies that
earn most of their profit overseas. Since their UK tax liability is usually
reduced by the amount of foreign taxes they pay, they can find themselves
with inadequate mainstream tax against which to offset the ACT. So their
foreign profits are taxed twice, abroad and at home.
Such companies will be pleased that the Chancellor has responded to their
complaints. He proposes that dividends paid out of overseas profits should
be separately classified as 'foreign income dividends'; companies would be
entitled to a refund if the dividend payment gave rise to surplus ACT. But
no tax credit would be available to shareholders on the dividend, which
raises a question about whether dividend-conscious institutional investors
might find such shares less attractive.
The more fundamental reform suggested by Mr Lamont is a reduction in advance
corporation tax for all companies in two stages, from 25 per cent to 22 1/2
per cent in 1993-4, and 22 1/2 per cent to 20 per cent in 1994-5. At the
same time the chancellor proposed to reduce the tax credit granted to
shareholders in one go from 25 per cent to 20 per cent in 1993-4.
This is bad news for pension funds, which are exempt from tax on dividends.
Until now, as owners of companies, they have been taxed at 33 per cent on a
company's retained profit and 8 per cent - the difference between the tax
credit of 25 per cent and the corporation tax of 33 per cent - on profit
paid out as dividends. Henceforth, they will pay 13 per cent rather than 8
per cent on distributed profit. They will yield Pounds 1bn a year to the
exchequer as a result of the change.
In theory, the pension funds will benefit, in the sense that the companies
they own are expected to enjoy a cash flow benefit of Pounds 2bn from the
changes over the next two years. The capitalised value of the potential tax
relief to companies with surplus ACT problems should also, in theory,
increase the value of the shares. But actuaries value pension fund assets on
the basis of their income. And this will be reduced by the changes,
implying, other things being equal, a lower yield on equities for the
biggest group of share owners.
This could help the government's funding problems by slightly altering the
relative attractions of gilts against equities. It could equally be seen as
a backdoor way of reducing the cost of the tax reliefs granted on pension
contributions. But then the Treasury has long been keen to find a way of
clawing back some of this tax break.
The other possible losers could be bankers and brokers in the City. Finding
UK acquisitions for companies with surplus ACT problems has produced a
steady stream of lucrative fees for mergers and acquisitions specialists.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Major's second manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not so much a Budget, more Mr John Major's second election manifesto
in a year. Rather like President Clinton in the US, the prime minister and
his chancellor have collected every marketable proposal that a posse of
policy wonks could think up and put the resulting list of items forward as a
strategy for growth without inflation, a deficit-reduction plan that causes
no obvious or at any rate immediate outstanding pain (except, marginally, to
high earners), a road map for the coming three years. Running down its
centre is a broad highway. The direction arrow contains the simple words
'general election 1996'.
Taken as a whole it will do what all manifestos do. It will initially
befuddle the electorate. There was so much unnecessary detail in Mr Norman
Lamont's inordinately long and at times soporific speech in the Commons
yesterday that only the prime minister, whose personality this
Treasury-driven peroration suited to a T, could possibly have enjoyed the
occasion. I except the one good joke, at the expense of my trade, which was
when Mr Lamont expressed doubt as to whether 'sewerage and newspapers' were
'clearly among the most basic necessities of life'. Touche.
Considered in bits the Budget he read out should satisfy several
constituencies. There is plenty of material for Mr Major to draw upon
whether or not he actually remounts his election soapbox when he asks his
backbenchers, his party and the country to accept for a second time that he
is the prime minister of their choice. For although he does not have to face
the polls for another three or four years, he badly needs to regain his
authority before that.
The government's offering to the City is 'grip' - a stated and barely
credible determination to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement in
stages over the coming few years. In this Mr Major has an advantage over
President Clinton. His chancellor can put forward a finance bill this year
that will provide for all the increases in taxation promised for next year
and the year after and be reasonably sure that the bill will be passed. In
the US, where a new energy tax is central to the administration's plans,
there can be no such certainty.
Just a minute. Mr Major himself cannot be sure that his chancellor's
extension of VAT to domestic fuel and power will be well received by the
Commons. During the coming few weeks the Tory coal lobby will be asked to
swallow its disappointment at the number of pits to be saved. It may be a
bit tricky to get it to accept an impost that will discourage the use of all
fuels after April 1994. Perhaps that is why one of the government's little
birds whispered to me the other day that the prime minister had asked the
cabinet to go easy on the Maastricht rebels. Their votes would be needed,
Birdie said then, for coal closures and for any Budget measures that might
prove awkward.
We must, however, wish the chancellor well on this. It is, a decent offering
to the green lobby, and one for which all who value the environment should
be grateful. Mr Major's commitment at the Rio conference last year to
reductions of CO by the turn of the century is being three-quarters met. Mr
Lamont will have known that such would be his master's wish. The only
spoiler is that VAT on insulation materials was not simultaneously
zero-rated.
The chancellor will be hoping for other kind comments today. Safe. Fiscally
prudent. Stimulating. A Budget for the little people. A Budget for jobs. A
Budget for small businesses, for the regeneration of industry, for the
reduction of the deficit, for the greater glory of Britain. Good old Norman.
He played to the Europhobic gallery. The cheers following the few passages
in which he attacked the European Community must have been music to the
chancellor's ears last night. But will they still love him in the morning?
This depends upon events beyond the government's control. Mr Lamont set out
a list of measures designed to help the long-term unemployed. The total
expenditure - Pounds 230m - and the total number of expected beneficiaries -
100,000 - is derisory even at first sight. The number of people out of work
is 3m and rising. The long-term contingent is a third of that. This is seed
money, little scatterings here and there. It is reminiscent of Mr Clinton's
packages for the inner cities. It shows good intent, but will in itself do
little to alleviate the fear in the hearts of many families that one of
theirs will lose a job, or fail to find one.
The business measures should be welcome to those they benefit - small
entrepreneurs, house builders, companies hurt by advance corporation tax,
exporters. They too are, mostly, little alleviations, helpful in themselves,
but as nothing to the effect of, say, a return to an annual rate of growth
in gross national product of 2 to 3 per cent. There is nothing particularly
strong or unexpected in the changes in excise duty. Even the 10 per cent
increase in the price of petrol, coupled with a pledge to keep up the
pressure in later years, should provoke only ritual howls of outrage from
the motorists' organisations. We all know that we should use our cars less,
or, at least buy fuel-efficient models. The changes in company car taxation
will encourage this.
Some of the extra taxes announced yesterday may reasonably enough be derided
by Labour as betrayals, in the spirit if not the letter, of promises made
during last April's election campaign. The increase in national insurance
contributions is an outstanding example. Mr Major showed during question
time yesterday that he knows he will have to trade punches on this with the
leader of the Labour party. More to the point, the prime minister has an ace
up his chancellor's sleeve: a promise of an annual widening of the 20 per
cent tax band. This gives verisimilitude to the Tories' commitment to bring
the basic rate of personal income tax down to that level.
That pledge is one the government in general and the prime minister in
particular take very seriously. As Mr Lamont came to the paragraph about the
20 per cent band yesterday my mind flashed back to last year's campaign, in
which Mr Major spread his hands ever wider to demonstrate that that was what
the government intended to do. It is clearly a marker for the next election.
Cutting taxes for all lower-paid workers is still regarded as an election
winner, even though the new bands add peanuts to their incomes, and take a
larger number of peanuts away through non-indexation of allowances and the
increases in national insurance.
In short, the Budget is a campaign manager's handbook. It enables Mr Major
to engage the electorate in a fresh dialogue, in the manner of Mr Clinton.
Mr Lamont may attempt the same exercise. Over the coming weeks, he plainly
intends to. This is understandable. He would like to keep his job. His
speech yesterday sewed up the November Budget and most of the following two.
But Mr Lamont's tenure on his office depends upon forthcoming speeches -
upon how he performs during Mr Major's summer campaign for the reassertion
of the prime minister's own leadership. They could both be saved, if the
economy revives and floats them out of danger. But that is up to fate, a
force greater than any Budget.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): It really is an Augustinian Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In previous articles I have urged the case for a Budget along the lines of
St. Augustine's plea: 'Please God make me chaste, but not yet.' The Budget
contains measures which will raise revenue by Pounds 6.7bn in 1994-95 and by
Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96, on an indexed basis. But they will yield less than
Pounds 0.5bn - virtually nothing - in the coming financial year. The
revenue-raising measures are to be enacted in the coming Finance Bill; so
they are not in the category of so many American presidential promises to do
better in later years.
Moreover, most of the tax measures are sensible reforms in their own right -
with the exception of the lower-tier tax band. So if relaxations turn out to
be required, because of the state of the economy a change in the Budgetary
outlook or - a change in fiscal fashion, it would be very easy to reduce tax
rates without going back on the present Budget. The revenue is mostly raised
by removals or restrictions of reliefs, or abolition of exemptions. The two
most important revenue raisers are the extension of VAT to domestic fuel and
power and the increase in employee National Insurance contributions, which
is almost the same thing as an increase in the basic rate of 1p in the pound
for most taxpayers.
I should, however, break off the macro-economics to say that potentially by
far the most important innovation came in a little-noticed paragraph towards
the end. Here, Norman Lamont embraced on, an experimental basis to be tried
in three or four regions, Professor Denis Snower's proposals to allow the
long-term unemployed to transfer their dole money as a wage subsidy to a
potential employer. I receive more letters from intelligent readers on the
absurdity of paying the unemployed to do nothing rather than something than
on almost any other subject. The announcement has the same kind of long-term
potential as Nigel Lawson's embrace of 'profit-related pay' in his l986
Budget speech, which is only now beginning to take off.
It would, however, be idle to pretend that either of these measures, or both
combined, or the other labour-market measures, will be remotely sufficient
if there really is a long-term structural unemployment problem due either to
deficient demand or to changes in the labour market detrimental to jobs and
pay. The Budget speech did not really discuss these far-ranging issues -
either on a British or an international basis. The Budget Red Book does
however provide some material on which to reflect.
Nothing will stop financial readers from paying most attention to the
projections of the public-sector accounts. These show the usual hump-backed
picture. The deficit measured by the public sector borrowing requirement
reaches a peak of Pounds 50bn or 8 per cent of GDP in 1993-94. It then
gradually declines to Pounds 30bn or 3 3/4 per cent in 1997-98. In fact, the
underlying decline is somewhat better, as privatisation proceeds tail off
from Pounds 8bn in the year now coming to an end to Pounds 1bn a year in the
second half of the 1990s.
What this Budget has really done is to substitute a medium-term fiscal
strategy for a medium-term monetary one. This has been achieved by the
device christened by the Treasury as the wedge which imposes very small tax
increases in the coming year, but which build up to large amounts in the two
years following.
The main fault of the Budget speech was that it was much too long and badly
needed subbing. The strategic parts could have been highlighted very much
more; and much of the detail could have been relegated to press notices or
the Finance Bill. The chancellor will have to engage in this kind of subbing
when the new unified November Budgets start. For it simply will not be
possible to introduce yesterday's degree of tax accountants' detail into a
speech which also covers spending.
Having said all this, a closer study of the Red Book reveals a fundamentally
disquieting economic outlook. If one takes the Treasury's central
projection, it is not until 1994-95 that growth, outside the North Sea,
catches up with the present best-official guess of the growth of productive
capacity, namely 2 1/4 per cent a year. Even in the later 1990s growth is
only put at 3 per cent, leaving only a moderate and belated taking-up of the
slack. As the second table shows, the growth projections are a good deal
more pessimistic than those published a year ago. The implication is that
unemployment and unused capacity will carry on rising, at least until 1995.
Not only have growth forecasts been revised downwards, but inflation
prospects have been revised upwards. Underlying inflation is still expected
to be down to 2 per cent by the later 1990s, but it is expected to remain in
the 3 to 4 per cent band - the upper part of the chancellor's range - until
well into the middle of the decade.
In a rather interesting innovation the Treasury publishes alternative growth
assumptions for the medium term, from 1994-95 onwards. These are only half a
percentage point on either side of the central projection. But they make an
enormous difference to the PSBR projections. On the optimistic scenario the
PSBR drops by 1997-98 to 2 1/4 per cent - within the Maastricht guidelines.
On the pessimistic scenario it drops to only 5 1/4 per cent, which most
mainstream analysts regard as unsustainably high.
If the more pessimistic growth rate is due to a low underlying rate of
productivity increase, then there would be little disagreement that still
more public spending curbs and/or tax increases would be required. But
suppose low growth is instead due to deficient demand and a slack British or
world economy, as is quite possible - although not as probable as most of
the businessmen whom I meet seem to think. What would the implications then
be? Surely, in such a case, either the deficit should be allowed to run; or
retrenchment measures would have to be more than offset by a sufficient
loosening of monetary policy.
These issues are entirely dodged by the Treasury documents. Monetary policy
will supposedly be influenced by four main indicators - broad and narrow
money, asset prices and the exchange rate. But despite the 'monitoring'
ranges for the monetary aggregates, we are back to a state where the
Treasury flies by the seat of its pants and weights the four in any way it
likes, or can get away with.
I am not just making the usual teasing point. Nowadays, one should expect
two main features from any monetary strategy. These are some assurance that
demand in nominal terms will grow fast enough to avoid a prolonged
depression, but also some assurance at the other end of the range that
inflation will not be allowed to stray outside the government's own
guidelines. Neither is provided; and the reduction of the section on the
exchange rate to two brief historical sentences speaks volumes. A monetary
strategy has still not been found to replace that of the ERM - which would
in any case have had to be supplemented by a monetary strategy for all the
core member countries.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THIS, the last British Budget for revenue alone, Mr Norman Lamont's
political job was to salvage the reputation of his party and of himself. He
had to offer a credible prospect for economic recovery and a tolerable
profile for public sector borrowing in the medium term, alongside
imaginative ways of raising the money.
The mass of detail, particularly administrative detail, that the chancellor
inflicted on his audience inevitably dulled the effect. But this is not the
only reason why this Budget could do little to lift the hearts of his party,
the nation or, for that matter, investors in government bonds, even though
it should bring cheer to the boardrooms. The deplorable state of the public
finances made it unavoidably depressing. Mr Lamont might have done better -
not merely economically, but even politically - if he had made the best of
his plight by being tougher. Nonetheless, he deserves at least one cheer for
his efforts.
The central tasks the chancellor set himself were to help recovery and
tackle the deficit in the medium term. On the recovery, he has taken three
risks. First, by announcing tax increases of Pounds 6.7bn for 1994-95 and
Pounds 10.3bn for 1995-96 from an indexed base, he may discourage spending
almost as much as if those increases took effect this year. Second, by
failing to guarantee anything like a balanced budget in the medium term he
may have threatened prospects for still lower long-term interest rates.
Finally, by failing to take more decisive fiscal action he may have given
himself less room than he could to lower short-term interest rates if
needed.
Since the second and third of these risks offset the first, the balance must
be a matter of judgment. So far as the immediate recovery is concerned, Mr
Lamont may well have judged rightly. Furthermore, even if he believes that
'interest rates at their current level are consistent with the achievement
of the government's inflation objectives', Mr Lamont has room for manoeuvre
on this most important of all instruments. In addition, by modifying the
'full-funding' rule, the chancellor will allow government borrowing to
affect the growth of the money supply. Especially now that he has reinstated
a monitoring range for broad money, this must be a sensible, though belated,
change.
In his discussion of the ERM - the guiding light of monetary policy only a
year ago - he even came close to suggesting that everything was for the best
in the best of all possible worlds. The ERM had, it seems, helped to get
inflation down when that had to be done and had then spewed sterling out
precisely when it was opportune in order to lower rates. For the short term
at least, Mr Lamont must be right in this judgment. In the light of the
succession of monetary policy disasters, however, the question has to be
whether the freedom of manoeuvre the government now enjoys will be used
aggressively enough in the short term and wisely enough in the longer term.
Here the chancellor's medium-term fiscal judgment must be doubted. He is to
be commended for proposing fiscal changes that will come into effect in
1994-95 and 1995-96. That is precisely what a medium-term strategy should
provide for a country in the UK's current plight. The question is whether
budget measures that deliver a fiscal adjustment rising from 1 per cent of
gross domestic product in 1994-95 to 1.7 per cent in 1997-98 are enough.
Not only does the chancellor forecast a public sector borrowing requirement
of 8 per cent of GDP in 1993-94, but it is still 3 3/4 per cent in 1997-98.
Moreover, the ratio of net public sector debt to GDP is forecast almost to
double, to 50 per cent, by 1998. Yet this, it should be recalled, was a
government that promised not long since to balance the budget over the
cycle.
The forecasts for growth of non-North Sea GDP that underlie these fiscal
projections - 1 1/2 per cent between 1992-93 and 1993-94, followed by 2 1/4
per cent in 1994-95, 2 3/4 per cent in 1995-96 and 3 per cent thereafter -
are not particularly optimistic. Nevertheless, much can still go wrong. Just
how much is shown by perusal of forecasts made only a year ago - admittedly,
just before an election - when the PSBR was supposed to be a mere 4 3/4 per
cent of GDP in 1993-94 and 1 per cent in 1996-97.
Once the chancellor had made the bold decision to announce future tax
increases now, he should surely have gone further. Increases of 3 per cent
of GDP by 1997-98 would have given far more confidence that further tax
increases would not be needed. Further action would have been particularly
sensible for a British government that enjoys complete monetary policy
freedom once more and is headed by a prime minister who mutters about
strategies for growth. The chancellor may well find himself raising taxes
again.
In its detail, the Budget is very good in some parts, not so good in others.
It is a pity that the opportunity was not taken to announce the abolition of
mortgage interest relief altogether, which would have done much to raise
additional revenue. It is also a pity that the steady transformation of the
20p rate into a new basic rate of tax is making the structure of income tax
system more complex. It is a pity too that the increase of one percentage
point in employees' national insurance contributions guarantees further life
for what is just another - and more regressive - income tax.
First impressions are that the balance of these measures, with large
increases in revenue from VAT on domestic fuel and power and national
insurance contributions, will be regressive. The chancellor insists they are
broadly proportional, however, partly because of the restriction of the
married couple's allowance and mortgage interest relief to the 20p rate and
the changes in the treatment of advance corporation tax as well.
Unquestionably, there is much here to commend: the package of deregulatory
measures for business, for example, and the measures to relieve the burden
of surplus ACT. The Budget is cleverly green in its decision to raise the
real burden of duties on petrol. Even more important is the chancellor's
decision to raise revenue without increasing marginal rates of tax. Here he
has done far better than Mr Clinton.
In the end, however, this is a Budget with lots of good little ideas rather
than one good big idea. The exception is the decision to announce future tax
increases now, the drawback being that this action does not go far enough.
This was a competent and professional performance, but the country could
have done with something a good deal more dramatic.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): A few more ticks than crosses - Tony
Jackson assesses the impact on industry of the Budget and says the
government's conversion to the cause of manufacturing is more than rhetoric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was billed as a Budget for industry, and not without reason.
Manufacturers who sat down to listen to Mr Lamont with their shopping lists
in front of them will have ended up with more ticks than crosses. There was
more help on export credits, business rates and capital gains tax. There was
no extension of VAT on food or children's clothes. There was a list of
infrastructure projects, from the Heathrow line to the Channel Tunnel link.
Above all, there was the remarkable concession on advance corporation tax.
Granted, there was one big omission: the extension of tax breaks on capital
investment. Mr Neil Johnson, Director-General of the Engineering Employers'
Federation, complained of the 'apparent lack of understanding' of the role
of capital allowances in stimulating investment. 'This budget does nothing
to bring about the massive switch from consumption to investment which is
essential for lasting recovery'.
The same point was raised by the machine tool industry. 'We were
disappointed', said the Machine Tool Technologies Association, 'that little
emphasis was placed on improving investment in high technology. This Budget
fell short of directly encouraging UK companies to invest and to meet the
anticipated recovery'.
But this seems rather harsh. In its whole approach, the Budget shows that
the government's conversion to the cause of manufacturing goes beyond
rhetoric. There are two distinct themes. The emphasis on exports suggests
that the decline in the manufacturing trade balance has the government badly
rattled. The stress on small business shows it accepts that small and
start-up companies are the most reliable source of new jobs.
The clamour for help on export credits would have been dismissed, in the
high Thatcherite days, as a plea for competitive subsidy. There was none of
that yesterday: instead, the Chancellor went out of his way to assert that
the benefits enjoyed by UK exporters would now be as high as the average
among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
Similarly, the chorus of complaints about advance corporation tax would in
more robust days have been waved away. The level of dividends paid by
companies to their shareholders, a Thatcherite might say, is a matter for
the parties involved. If it leads to surplus ACT, the company is simply
paying too much.
But the situation had two awkward consequences for UK investment. UK
companies had an incentive to incur their expenditure abroad, as a means of
keeping their UK taxable profits as high as possible. Just as important was
the effect on foreign companies. Under the old rules, a US corporation
running factories in Germany but with its European headquarters in the UK
would be penalised, since it would pay surplus UK tax on dividends remitted
to the US. Inward investment, it appears, is now too crucial to the UK
economy for such an anomaly to be tolerated.
As for small business, the list of measures is as full as the average
entrepreneur could realistically have hoped for. The freeze on the
much-hated Uniform Business Rate has been continued for another year. There
has been an extension of the loan guarantee scheme for small companies. When
entrepreneurs sell their companies, they will be able to roll over their
capital gains tax liability if they spend the proceeds on starting a new
business: and so on.
More generally, there was collective relief in the business community
yesterday that the Budget was neutral in its impact: in other words, that
the government was not about to take risks with the recovery. As Sir Denys
Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, put it: 'it was
appropriate not to have increased the overall tax burden until the recovery
is confirmed'.
Next year, of course, might be another matter. The hard-line Institute of
Directors last night sounded a note of protest: 'we are alarmed that the tax
increases from April 1994 will be equivalent fo more than a 5p increase in
income tax. This is not sustainable, and business wants to see at least
matching reductions in public spending'.
But as the Chancellor will have calculated, a year is a long time in the
business cycle. In the meantime, it is hard to see that the government could
have done much more without having more hard cash at its disposal. Indeed,
in the matter of ACT, it showed considerable ingenuity in finding money to
hand to industry by the simple expedient of picking the pockets of the
investing institutions.
And above all, it continued to soothe and flatter industrialists. The only
way to secure growth in the medium term, Mr Lamont said, was through the
supply side of the economy. The greatest threat to recovery in the medium
term would be excessive public borrowing. Above all, he said, he would
resist job-destroying measures emanating from Brussels. 'That is why this
government will never sign the Social Chapter'.
As Lord Keynes remarked, one of the crucial determinants for getting out of
recession is the animal spirits of businessmen. How far the Chancellor has
raised those spirits will not be immediately apparent. But he could be lucky
in his timing; as he said yesterday, the latest survey from the
Confederation of British Industry suggested that confidence among
manufacturers was recovering already. At any rate, he has given the most
concrete proof to date that the government is genuinely concerned about
manufacturing. For industrialists with vivid memories of the very different
climate of the 1980s, that is quite a lot to be getting on with.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Stamp duty and tax relief
 -Housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor announced two measures which would affect the housing market.
Stamp duty threshold on new house purchases will be raised to Pounds 60,000
from Pounds 30,000 with immediate effect, in an effort to stimulate the
bottom end of the housing market. The cost of buying homes priced at between
Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 60,000 will be reduced by up to Pounds 600.
Mr Lamont announced that the rate at which mortgage interest tax relief at
source will be given will be restricted to 20 per cent. That change would
not be introduced until April 1994. At 7.99 per cent interest rates, the
change will cost Pounds 2.50 a month on a Pounds 10,000 loan and Pounds 9.98
on Pounds 40,000.
Elderly people with life annuity home income plan schemes which allow them
to draw down some of the savings invested in their houses will continue to
attract relief at 25 per cent.
Mr Ian Darby at John Charcol, mortgage brokers, said his reaction to the
proposals for the housing market was mixed.
'Raising the threshold on stamp duty should be beneficial for the first time
buyers market but the erosion of Miras, even though at today's interest
rates it means no more than a loss of Pounds 10 a month, will take it a step
back.'
He was disappointed too that there was no mention of a base rate cut to help
the market.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Investing institutions
hit - Advance Corporation Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL SHAREHOLDERS may be forgiven for finding themselves bamboozled by the
chancellor's reforms to dividends and Advance Corporation Tax.
Fortunately, the reforms will be quite painless for most investors. At
present, shareholders are paid a dividend net of basic rate tax. For 25 per
cent taxpayers that takes care of their full income tax liability, so there
is nothing more to pay.
From now on, however, the tax credit will be reduced to 20p in the pound.
That does not mean, however, that they will have to pay more income tax,
because the basic rate of tax on dividends will also be reduced to 20 per
cent. So basic rate taxpayers will notice no difference in practice. If they
currently receive a 7.5p net dividend, they will continue to receive 7.5p.
Higher rate taxpayers will however notice a change. At present, they pay
basic rate tax and they later have to pay another 15 per cent to make up
their total liability of 40 per cent.
When the change occurs, they will only have paid 20 per cent up front, and
will have to find an extra 20 per cent later. The overall bill will have
increased.
Non-taxpayers and investing institutions will also suffer. At present, they
can claim back the 25 per cent tax credit. When the system is fully in
place, they will only be able to claim the lower 20 per cent credit and will
consequently lose out.
The change will lower the gross yield on the market and will affect the big
institutions. It may diminish their appetite for holding shares and will
possibly be reflected by a fall in the stock market.
For companies, the change means that they will pay less in ACT and more in
mainstream corporation tax, but for a conventional UK company the total tax
burden will not alter.
They will, however, have deferred paying some ACT at the time of dividends
until they are due to pay corporation tax later. That will improve UK
industry's cash flow by some Pounds 2bn a year.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Few gains and some new
pain - With its focus on business, the package involves little change for
individuals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's focus on reviving the business sector meant that this was
largely a 'so what?' Budget for the individual. Such measures as were
announced were bad for most people - in particular, the introduction of VAT
on fuel and power, which will be particularly felt by the poor.
On the direct taxation side, the main impact will be the restriction to 20
per cent of reliefs on mortgage interest, the married couple's allowance and
company dividends.
A lot of the other direct tax announcements involved 'no change' - to
personal allowances, the higher rate band, the annual capital gains tax
allowance and the inheritance tax threshold. Given the steady drag of
inflation, this effectively (but surreptitiously) leaves individuals worse
off. Apart from fuel, the main indirect tax changes - on petrol, alcohol,
tobacco and others - were the sort of clobbering consumers have come to
expect from Budgets.
For the personal saver, there was little change, apart from the restriction
on BES plans involving loans. The 'dogs that did not bark' included the
inclusion of gilts within personal equity plans, a change widely expected in
the industry but which the chancellor, despite his need to sell government
securities, decided not to deliver.
However, some good news emerged. National Savings is relaunching its First
Option Bond, which proved so attractive to savers last year that the
building societies bitterly complained. The new bond will pay 6.34 per cent
gross, if held for one year. Furthermore, there were increases in the amount
of other certificates savers can hold - from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 10,000
for both the 40th fixed and the 6th index-linked issues.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Changes to NICs will bite
next year - Direct Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET'S changes to direct taxation are piffling for most taxpayers.
By expanding the 20 per cent band by another Pounds 500 from its current
Pounds 2,000, all those whose annual pay exceeds their annual income tax
allowance by Pounds 2,500 or more - a majority of taxpayers  - will receive
an extra Pounds 25 per year.
Income taxpayers also know that they have another Pounds 25 to look forward
to next year, as the band will expand by another Pounds 500.
Much worse news comes from the changes to National Insurance, which will not
bite until the 1994-95 tax year. An increase of one percentage point (from 9
to 10 per cent) in the rate at which Class I National Insurance
contributions are levied means that those earning Pounds 405 or more per
week will be worse off by Pounds 3.51 per week - Pounds 182.52 per year. An
extra 1 per cent is also being levied on self-employed contributions.
The 10 per cent band rate of NICs will be levied on any weekly earnings in
excess of Pounds 54. No NICs need be paid on earnings in excess of Pounds
405.
This means that those on Pounds 100 per week will be worse off by 46p per
week, those on Pounds 200 will lose Pounds 1.46 weekly, and those on Pounds
300 will be down by Pounds 2.46. However, while the limit remains in place,
nobody will be worse off by more than Pounds 3.51 weekly.
For the year 1993-94, nobody with two children or more will be worse off,
according to the government's figures, with those on Pounds 80 per week set
to benefit by 1 per cent per week.
In percentage terms, no one who does not receive child benefit will be
better off by more than 0.5 per cent per week. Those on Pounds 450 per week
stand to be worse off by 0.2 per cent, while those in higher income brackets
will be worse off by 0.1 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Polite financial advisers
point to neutrality - Savers and Investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHEREZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEUTRAL Budget for savers and investors was the verdict of the financial
advisers too polite to call it a dull Budget.
'Investors are not particularly damaged by this Budget,' said Mr James
Higgins of financial advisers Chamberlain de Broe, 'but it did not throw up
new opportunities either.' One which had been expected but did not emerge
was the extension of personal equity plans to shield gilts - already exempt
from capital gains tax - from income tax too.
The chancellor's decision to freeze personal allowances means everyone will
effectively be paying a little more tax. However, basic rate taxpayers have
fared marginally better than higher rate taxpayers, according to Mr Higgins.
Higher rate taxpayers will be paying an extra 20 per cent on their dividend
income from shares instead of 15 per cent.
The proposal to restrict the married couple's allowance to lower rate relief
of 20 per cent from April 1994 will have the effect of turning it into a tax
credit, according to Mr John Cole of Berry Birch &amp; Noble financial advisers.
The maximum benefit that can be derived from it will be Pounds 344 rather
than the Pounds 688 which it is worth to high rate taxpayers.
The change most likely to make a difference to personal financial planning
is the reduction of mortgage interest tax relief (Miras) from 25 per cent to
20 per cent from April 1994, according to Mr Cole.
He said he expected new restrictions on job relocation expenses to hit many
people and was surprised that a rise in national insurance contributions was
aimed exclusively at employees. Moves towards tax self-assessment from 1996
were welcomed. 'It will make life much simpler, particularly for the
self-employed.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Highest earners suffer
largest cash losses - Winners and losers / An analysis by The Institute For
Fiscal Studies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor delivered two Budgets yesterday. One was a set of tax
measures for immediate implementation, described as 'broadly neutral'; the
other was a second set which, from 1994-95, will raise substantial sums for
the exchequer.
While the measures for immediate implementation have little effect on
aggregate tax revenues, they are far from neutral in terms of their effect
on the distribution of income. This article, therefore, begins by setting
out the distributional effects of those immediate measures on households of
different types and at different levels of income. It also offers some
preliminary reflections on the likely distributional effects of the
longer-term measures.
We examine how the measures the chancellor actually announced compare with a
'do-nothing' Budget which merely increased all tax allowances and thresholds
in line with inflation and made no changes to direct tax rates. The analysis
includes all the main changes to income tax and excise duties announced for
1993-94 but does not include changes to stamp duty, business taxes or the
abolition of car tax previously announced in the autumn statement. The
results are obtained by applying the 1993 Budget measures to a
representative sample of households drawn from the Family Expenditure Survey
using the IFS computer model of the personal tax and benefit system.
The first chart shows the immediate effect of yesterday's Budget on the
annual disposable income of households of different types. The bottom line
of this chart shows that households as a whole are Pounds 43 per year worse
off. It should be remembered that this small net increase in taxation is
consistent with the chancellor's claim to have introduced a neutral package
for 1993-94 mainly because it does not take into account the cut in car tax
which some of this year's tax increases are intended to finance.
While the average effect of the Budget measures is a relatively modest loss
of Pounds 43 per year, the chart shows that this effect is by no means
uniform across different family types. The smallest losses occur among
households where there is nobody in paid employment. As well as the
unemployed households who lose up to Pounds 30 per year, this category also
includes single parents who lose about Pounds 15 per year and pensioner
households who lose up to Pounds 33 per year.
The source of these losses among the non-employed population is primarily
the changes to indirect taxes announced yesterday. Though largely unaffected
by the changes to income tax, these groups do tend to lose from the above-
inflation increases in the excise duty on beer, wine, tobacco and fuel. The
only excise duty not to be raised in line with inflation was that on
spirits, which is of relatively little importance to these low income
groups.
The larger losses are concentrated among households where one or more member
is in employment, and in these cases annual losses typically lie in the
range Pounds 60 to Pounds 80 per year. In addition to the losses imposed by
increases in the rate of indirect taxes, these groups also suffer from the
freezing of personal income tax allowances. Nonetheless, the overall impact
on these groups taken as a whole is relatively modest, amounting to less
than Pounds 2 per week on average.
The effects of the Budget measures for 1993-94 on households at different
levels of income is shown in the second chart. This collects the UK
household population into 10 groups with the poorest tenth labelled 'Decile
1' and the richest 'Decile 10'. This chart shows clearly the way in which
losses from the Budget become substantial only for the highest earners. Only
in the top 30 per cent of the population do average losses from the Budget
rise above Pounds 52 per year or Pounds 1 per week.
There are a number of reasons why those on the highest incomes suffer the
largest cash losses. The first is that they tend to use larger absolute
amounts of excisable items such as fuel and so their absolute loss from
over-indexation is larger than that for poorer households. Second, the
chancellor continued the Conservative tradition of increasing the tax levied
on users of company cars, and this will tend to hit high earners hardest.
Finally, the chancellor froze the point at which higher rate tax becomes
payable. As a result, during the coming year many of those whose incomes are
just too low to make them higher-rate taxpayers will drift into the net of
higher rate tax.
This increase in the number of higher-rate taxpayers has in fact been an
almost unnoticed revolution of Conservative tax policy during the last 14
years. Back in 1979 there were fewer than 700,000 higher rate taxpayers. In
the current financial year the total number is more than 1m higher and is
set to rise still further in 1993-94. This is the third time in four years
that a Conservative chancellor has frozen the threshold at which higher-rate
tax becomes payable. It would seem that as well as aiming to increase the
width of the reduced rate band the government is also aiming to widen the
scope of higher-rate income tax.
One of the few factors which reduces the average losses reflected in the two
charts was the chancellor's final announcement that the 20 per cent band
will be widened to cover the first Pounds 2,500 of taxable income in the
coming financial year. While this move partly offsets the effects of other
tax increases, it is however inadequate to prevent the vast majority of
taxpayers from being worse off.
Had the chancellor chosen simply to index the 20 per cent band it would have
increased from its present width of Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 2,100. Thus the
chancellor widened the band by only Pounds 400 more than was necessary to
keep pace with inflation. This measure saved a basic rate taxpayer 5 per
cent of Pounds 400, or Pounds 20 per year. It was indeed a modest step on
the road towards a 20p basic rate for all.
This then is the immediate effect of the measures announced for the coming
financial year. The effects on the distribution of income could be said to
be relatively minor, with even the richest tenth of the population losing
less than Pounds 3 per week. The same cannot be said however of the measures
foreshadowed by Mr Lamont for the coming financial years.
Of the measures promised for 1994-95 and beyond, a number will have
significant effects on household disposable incomes, and will on average
produce far greater losses than the measures for the current year. By far
the most significant in terms of its effect on household incomes is the
proposed extension of VAT to domestic fuel, first at a rate of 8 per cent in
1994-95 and then at the full 17.5 per cent in 1995-96. Given that fuel forms
a significant part of the expenditure of low-income households, this measure
taken alone could bear particularly heavily on the poor. In recognition of
this fact, the chancellor has indicated that income-related benefits will
also be increased, and it seems possible that the groups who lose most will
be those relatively low income households just beyond the scope of the
income-related benefit system.
Other measures announced by the chancellor will bear rather more heavily on
high income households. In a previous Budget, Mr Lamont restricted the value
of tax relief on mortgage interest payments so that they were worth the same
to higher-rate taxpayers as to basic rate taxpayers. From April 1994, this
process will be taken one step further with the value of the relief being
restricted to the reduced rate of 20 per cent for all homebuyers. It seems
likely that this marks a further important step on the road to the eventual
abolition of mortgage interest relief.
A second allowance to be restricted to the reduced rate is that for married
couples. This change would have had a particularly large impact on pensioner
couples who currently enjoy a higher tax allowance, but the chancellor is
also proposing some increases to pensioner allowances so that they suffer no
more than married couples below pension age. Again, it is hard to avoid the
conclusion that the days of the married couple's allowance are also
numbered.
A final direct tax measure proposed for 1994-95 is an increase in the rates
of National Insurance Contributions for employees and the self-employed.
This will affect only the non-pensioner population (since pensioners are
exempt from NICs) and will add further to the already significant increases
in taxes planned for the coming years. The losses from the measures to be
introduced in 1994-95 will make the losses produced by this year's changes
seem trivial by comparison.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Chancellor's big day moves to November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spring revenue-raising Budget, that symbol of winter's end and harbinger
of longer and brighter days, is no more.
Administrative pressures have dictated that the new unified tax and spending
Budgets, that will determine the nation's finances from 1994-95 onwards,
have to be decided well ahead of the tax year beginning on April 6.
The Treasury has announced that the first of the new unified Budgets 'will
be no later than the last week of November' this year.
The finance bill that follows that Budget will be published in January
instead of late spring, giving taxpayers and their advisers a clear idea of
most tax changes well before the date that they take effect.
Until this year, the legislative changes announced in the Budget were not
published until after the start of the tax year.
The new unified Budget will also eliminate one of the two separate income
tax coding exercises that take place early each year under the
pay-as-you-earn income tax scheme (PAYE).
In future, it should be possible to meld the annual mid-January coding with
changes determined in the Budget so that employers have to implement only
one set of coding changes in time for the start of the tax year on April 6.
As at present, governments will have to raise some taxes such as excise
duties on wines and tobacco overnight after the Budget. It is doubtful
whether these increases in the approach to Christmas will add to a
government's popularity.
There will be a problem in forecasting the economy for the year ahead and
especially in determining the public sector borrowing requirement more than
four months ahead of the new financial year.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that average PSBR
forecasting error could rise to around pounds 5.7bn with November budgets
from the pounds 4.7bn average over the past 10 years.
Budget day wil be a bigger challenge for the Chancellor, parliament and the
press. The Budget speech will be longer because it will have to include
details of the government's spending plans. The record to date is held by
William Gladstone, who spoke for four hours and 45 minutes in April 1853.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Postponing of tax rises welcomed by economists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LAMONT'S strategy of postponing tax increases to steer the economy out of
recession was given a general welcome by academic and business economists.
Professor Wynne Godley, professor of applied economics at Cambridge
University and one of the government's seven independent economic advisers,
called the delay in tax rises 'absolutely excellent'.
Prof David Currie, head of economic forecasting at the London Business
School, another of the 'seven wise men', called the Budget 'reasonably
favourable.'
He added, however: 'It was a bit light on medium-term financial strategy. It
didn't really address concern that the low exchange rate could feed through
to prices.'
Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, another of the 'wise men'
said: 'The Budget contained some unnecessarily depressing arithmetic. The
tax rises from 1994-95 on are not needed since the fiscal deficit will come
down as recovery takes place.'
Mr Andrew Sentance, economics director of the Confederation of British
Industry said: 'I would give Mr Lamont seven marks out of 10. In spelling
out a programme of tax increases, he is responding to financial markets'
concerns but is running the risk of damaging confidence in the short term.'
Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research, and a member of the government panel, said he was pleased the
Budget was 'broadly neutral'.
Mr Britton added, however, that the chancellor should have greatly increased
funds targeted to help for the unemployed while aid for industry appeared
ill-targeted. 'The funds for the unemployed are much too small. We're going
to have an output recovery, but not an employment recovery.'
By contrast, Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank, said: 'I
would have liked Mr Lamont to have been much tougher on tax es in the coming
financial year and to have eased monetary policy at the same time.'
Mr Robert Thomas, head of research at the capital markets division in of
National Westminster Bank, said: 'On balance the Budget was as good as
anyone could have expected. I was worried by the projection of a Pounds 50bn
government deficit next year.' Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ
International in London, described the speech as a 'reforming budget' which
the market would take some time to absorb.
Professor Tim Congdon, economic adviser at the Gerrard &amp; National, discount
house, and another of the seven wise men, said: 'I welcome the tax increases
but the reaction from financial markets would have been much better had they
come in straight away. The chancellor has not got the right balance between
fiscal and monetary policy.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Medium-term growth projections revised down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury has revised down its projections for medium-term growth in the
UK after taking into account the effects on industry of the recession and
the dim prospects for the world economy.
Officials are projecting average annual growth over the next four years of
2.5 per cent, slightly under 1 percentage point less than the assumption in
the Budget a year ago.
They are also assuming that, as a result of weaker economic activity than
that expected in the 1992 Budget, tax revenues will stay relatively low for
a considerable period. That is likely to keep the fiscal deficit at a high
level at least until 1997-98.
Over the next year, the Treasury is predicting a weak recovery in the UK
driven largely by increased exports and company activity, rather than any
marked increase in consumer spending. It says the international outlook is
marred by weakness in Germany but could be helped by signs of a recovery in
the US.
In an analysis of economic prospects released with the Budget statement, the
Treasury says that, as a result of spare capacity in industry, 'inflation is
assumed to fall further in the medium term'.
It warns, however, that after sterling's exit from the European exchange
rate mechanism 'there may be little progress (in inflation) over the next
two years if the current level of the exchange rate continues'.
The Treasury is forecasting growth of 1.25 per cent in gross domestic
product this year, close to the consensus estimates in the City and slightly
higher than its forecast released in the November Autumn Statement of 1 per
cent.
It is postulating a pick-up in total UK output towards the end of this year,
with growth between mid 1993 and the middle of next year of 3 per cent.
Consumer spending is thought likely to expand by just 1.25 per cent this
year, picking up only slightly to 1.75 per cent between the first halves of
this year and 1994.
Export growth is projected to pick up from an annual rate of 5.5 per cent
this year to one of 10.5 per cent by the middle of next year as sterling's
devaluation makes UK goods more competitive overseas.
Economists at the Treasury take a more gloomy view about longer-term growth
prospects than at the time of last year's Budget, which occurred a month
before the general election.
In 1993-94, it is assuming growth of 2 per cent, followed by 2.5 per cent in
1994-95 and 2.75 per cent in each of the two following financial years.
A year ago it assumed gross domestic product would rise by 3.25 per cent in
1993-94, followed by growth of 3.75 per cent, 3.5 per cent and 3.25 per cent
in the next three financial years.
Taking into account the tax-raising measures announced yesterday, government
revenues are now thought likely to increase from Pounds 229bn in 1993-94 to
Pounds 293bn by 1996-97. In last year's Budget the corresponding projections
were for Pounds 247bn and Pounds 312bn respectively.
With government spending over the medium term also set to rise faster than
projected a year ago, the government deficit is projected in the latest
Treasury statement to move from Pounds 50bn in the financial year starting
next month to Pounds 35bn in 1996-97 and Pounds 30bn the following year.
In the last Budget, the Treasury theorised that the deficit would come down
from Pounds 32bn in 1993-94 to Pounds 19bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 6bn in
1996-97.
Non-oil business investment in the UK is expected to rise modestly by 1 per
cent this year, but company profits are likely to move relatively quickly
'as demand rises, firms continue tight control of labour costs and pressure
on margins eases'.
The Treasury says that the trough in business investment as a share of gross
domestic product is likely to occur in the first half of 1994, at a level
'well above' those seen in the previous recessions in the past 20 years.
The Treasury reckons the UK's volume share of total world trade in
manufactured products will rise to about 5.7 per cent by the middle of next
year from just under 5.5 per cent last year.
It says that 'while import growth outstripped demand growth' in the UK last
year, the degree of import penetration was 'not out of line with its
long-term trend'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CROSSRAIL, the Pounds 1.7bn cross-London rail-link, could be delayed
following the chancellor's announcement yesterday that it would be a joint
venture between the public and private sectors. Work on the London
Underground-British Rail link was originally to start in 1995.
Mr Lamont also announced that the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express line (above)
and the Pounds 3bn channel tunnel high-speed rail link are to go ahead. The
15-mile Paddington-Heathrow fast link - a joint venture between BR and
airport operator BAA - will be started later this year.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: It was 'a Budget for his job' - Paul Cheeseright
hears Birmingham's view of Mr Lamont's changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EYEBALLS rolled a bit as Mr Lamont rehearsed everything which is right with
the UK economy, but four Birmingham businessmen, gathered for a Budget tea
party, heard him out in silence.
Guffaws came when the chancellor mentioned sewage and newspapers in the same
breathe. They turned into verbal sneers as he extolled the economic benefits
of the bloodstock industry.
If they took the Budget quietly it was because Mr Lamont failed to convince
them he was doing enough to foster the recovery about which he talked so
much. 'It's a Budget for his job,' said Mr Peter Thomas, chairman of
Birmingham Deposit Centre, which guards the wealth of the wealthy.
'But then it was a Budget for not damaging the economy. It's what he's not
done that matters. It's not going to damage anybody,' rejoined Mr Stuart
Neal, chairman of Team Training Services.
'What has he done which will significantly affect anybody?' asked Mr Steve
Williams, chairman of LBE Contract Tooling, an engineering company.
'He hasn't made me go out and decide to buy some new machine tools.'
Mr Robert Woolley, chairman of Frederick Woolley, a family engineering
company agreed. 'It won't make a lot of difference all round to companies
with up to 200 people in Birmingham.'
Certainly there was no feeling that suddenly there is a new dawn in the
British economy. 'Lamont's just shuffling the pack,' said Mr Williams
dismissively. 'Look at the private individual who's going to do the spending
 -he hasn't done very much at all,' observed Mr Thomas.
And local issues intruded. 'Bailing out Lloyd's, that's disgusting. What
about Leyland Daf - why aren't we bailing them out?' asked Mr Williams, who
is a firm proponent of propping up the manufacturing base.
'But it's a balance,' argued Mr Thomas. 'Lloyd's is an important factor in
British business. It's taken a real battering.' On specific measures,
though, Mr Lamont won a more favourable rating than the general criticism of
his Budget might have suggested.
'The ACT measures are very good for companies,' contended Mr Woolley, and,
if they look likely to benefit larger rather than smaller companies then, as
Mr Williams said, 'All small businesses live off big businesses.'
Although Mr Thomas felt that the steps taken by Mr Lamont on housing were
not that significant - 'he's done nothing really to help housebuilding' - he
was prepared to agree with Mr Williams that 'Lamont's concentrated his
changes in the right area,' that is, the bottom end of the market.
Changes in the taxing system for small business won qualified approval in
terms of simplification, but the notion of having to pay tax on the
corporate income of the current year, rather than preceding years, was not
seen as a good idea. 'It discourages growth steps in the small sector,'
suggested Mr Neal. 'It's an easy way of raising a few coppers for his
coffers this year,' commented Mr Williams.
Mr Thomas said: 'There was one thing that pleased me - there is an
indication about utilising the unemployed. It's long overdue. I like the
idea of prospective employers getting a subsidy.'
Mr Williams worried that the system might be exploited by the wrong type of
entrepreneur, taking on the long-term unemployed so he did not have to pay
any wages. 'On face value, the numbers seem impressive,' rejoined Mr Neal.
'But if you spread it over the country, it becomes very small.'
Celebration of the Budget, in short, did not seem appropriate. 'We're not
going to get roaring drunk on it,' said Mr Williams. If he changed his mind,
he would have chosen whisky.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: North Sea tax change surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor yesterday took the oil industry by storm with a large-scale
overhaul of North Sea petroleum taxes.
The industry had no inkling that he would propose such sharp reductions in
taxes accompanied by a virtual elimination of tax allowances.
The chancellor said he would reduce the petroleum revenue tax rate on
existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and eliminate it for new
fields.
He also said he would abolish PRT rules that allow expenditure on new
exploration and development to be set against profits of existing fields.
Mr Harold Hughes, head of the UK Offshore Operators' Association, an
industry group, said the changes would put a 'substantial burden on the
industry at a time when it is stretched economically by low oil prices and
high costs'.
The chancellor's changes will vastly simplify the tax regime in the North
Sea, cutting 300 pages of bureaucratic legislation on PRT and updating the
tax rules.
'It will be brilliant,' said Mr Tony Craven-Walker, managing director of
Monument Oil and Gas. 'It will make the system so much more simple.'
Large companies such as British Petroleum could gain as much as Pounds 130m
from the change, according to some analysts.
But the operators' association believes exploration costs in the North Sea
could quadruple. This would hit the smallest companies hardest and cut
drilling activity.
The chancellor said existing PRT rules had cost the exchequer Pounds 200m in
1991-92, rather than providing the revenue stream that was intended when PRT
was introduced in 1975. He said the changes would bring Pounds 300m into the
government's coffers in 1994-95 and Pounds 400m the following year.
The chancellor said PRT had become increasingly anachronistic since its
introduction and represented a marginal tax rate of 83 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: CBI attacks job relocations limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR'S proposal to limit tax relief from job relocation packages
offered by employers to their employees was unexpected and drew criticism
from the Confederation of British Industry.
The CBI said the changes would 'add considerably to employers' costs and
seriously affect an employees' willingness to relocate'.
Tax relief for removal expenses and additional housing costs has existed for
more than 40 years in Britain.
The Inland Revenue said yesterday the yield from the changes would be nil in
1993-1994 but provide Pounds 200m to the Treasury in 1994-1995, with a
Pounds 250m annual yield in the longer term.
Under the chancellor's changes tax relief for removal expenses and benefits
will be limited to Pounds 8,000 per move with relief available whether or
not employees sell their old property.
Tax relief for additional housing cost payments for moving into a more
expensive housing area will be withdrawn.
The proposed changes will apply to employees who begin a new job or move
with their existing employer on or after April 6 this year - transitional
arrangements will be available for employees already committed to moving.
The Inland Revenue said the chancellor's aim was to put tax relief for
removal expenses and benefits on to a statutory basis so that employers
could be given 'clarity and certainty about the scope of the relief'.
Relief is available only where it would be unreasonable to expect the
employee to work at the new location without moving nearer to it and
provided the employee disposes of his or her old home.
The Inland Revenue has also up until now allowed tax exemption for certain
payments made by employers to their employees for additional housing costs,
such as increased mortgage interest. This relief is only available for a
limited time and up to a maximum of Pounds 13,440. It will be withdrawn from
April 6 this year.
The Inland Revenue estimates that at present around 175,000 employees may
benefit from tax-free removal expenses.
About 30,000 might also be enjoying certain tax exemption from additional
housing costs.
It calculates around 100,000 employees will be liable to extra tax as a
result of the chancellor's changes, possibly increasing to 150,000 in the
1994-1995 financial year.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Industry welcomes export measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY leaders welcomed the chancellor's measures to improve the UK's
much-maligned export credit system, helping businesses win contracts abroad
in fiercely competitive markets.
Over the past two years, recession-torn manufacturers and contractors have
complained about having to compete against foreign rivals able to offer
customers better terms - especially in fast-growing markets in developing
countries - because their export credit is subsidised.
In his speech Mr Lamont said many British companies are 'sometimes at a
disadvantage in seeking business overseas'. The government had negotiated
hard over the years, he said, to secure a reduction in the subsidies offered
by other countries.
He added that, with the increases in export cover announced yesterday and in
the Autumn Statement, the annual cover for some of the fastest-growing and
most important markets around the world will have increased by more than 75
per cent in just four years.
The two important moves announced yesterday were:
a further 7.5 per cent reduction in the level of ECGD premiums, following an
average 20 per cent cut last year;
additional export credit cover of Pounds 1.3bn over the next three years, on
top of the total Pounds 700m increase for this year and next, announced in
the Autumn Statement.
The British Chambers of Commerce said the measures would be 'a major boost
to exporters'.
Mr Neil Johnson, director general of the Engineering Employers Federation,
said the export credit measures, along with the changes to advance
corporation tax and business rates, would be seen by its members as 'ticks
in the box'.
Commenting on the chancellor's assertion that the average level of premiums
paid by British exporters next year would be down to 'around the average'
paid by their G7 exporters, Mr Johnson said: 'If what he says is borne out
in practice, that is a level playing field. It is good news.'
Other business organisations, including the Confederation of British
Industry and the Machine Tool Technologies Association, also welcomed the
export credit measures.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Easing of ACT exceeds hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor's proposals to ease the burden of unrelieved advance
corporation tax on companies went further than industrialists had dared
hope.
Mr Roger Wood, head of the 100 Group of Finance Directors working party on
surplus ACT, said: 'I am delighted with what the chancellor appears to be
offering. It makes the UK a more attractive location for international
companies both UK- and foreign-owned.'
ACT is paid by companies on dividends and can be offset against UK
corporation tax. However, many companies do not pay sufficient UK
corporation tax to offset fully the ACT, meaning that they end up paying
more tax.
Many had expected that something would be done to help foreign-owned
multi-nationals which were being tempted to move their headquarters out of
the UK because of the tax regime. Mr Lamont recognised this problem with the
promised to establish a special tax regime for such companies from 1994-95.
But his second proposal, to class dividends paid out of overseas profits as
a 'foreign income dividend' came as welcome news to those companies which
earn substantial proportions of their profits from abroad. Many do not pay
enough UK corporation tax to offset the whole of their ACT liability. The
scheme is expected to reduce the annual build up of ACT by Pounds 250m.
Companies said they wanted to examine the consultative document which the
government issued before commenting in detail.
However, BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance group which made about 85
per cent of its 1992 profits overseas, said yesterday it welcomed the
consultative process. Mr David Allvey, finance director, said 'at least he's
picked up the baton and he's going to run with it'.
Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, Britain's biggest
textiles company, which makes 70 per cent of its profits overseas, said: 'It
is a positive recognition of the trap of double taxation.'
Companies said the foreign income dividends would not entitle non-tax paying
shareholders, such as pension funds, to a tax credit.
They said such shareholders may demand higher dividends or may sell shares
in companies with large overseas profits.
The move to cut the rate of ACT from 25 to 20 per cent was also welcomed, as
it will give a cash flow benefit to companies estimated by the chancellor at
Pounds 2bn over the next two years.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Car industry has mixed reaction to impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOTOR industry gave a cautious welcome to the Budget, but car retailers
warned of the impact on new car sales of the chancellor's determination to
increase the cost of motoring in real terms in every future Budget.
The Automobile Association said the government's motoring tax proposals were
'more highway robbery on Lamont's road to recovery'.
'With one hand the chancellor has taken more from the motorist in excise
duty than he needs to replace new car tax; with the other, he has made all
motorists subsidise new cars, and done little to benefit the environment or
industry.'
The AA said Mr Lamont had delivered 'a blow below the bonnet'. The average
motorist would pay an extra Pounds 60 a year which would hit the lower and
middle income motorist hardest.
Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall, said 'the increase in both fuel tax
and vehicle excise duty further increases the cost of motoring, but, on
balance, affects the cost of usage more than ownership, which is our
preferred option.'
Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, said that the reform of company car taxation was 'extremely
welcome'.
'We are delighted that the Treasury's earlier indicated preference for a
complicated system of price banding as a way of establishing a charging
scale has given way to our representations for a fixed percentage of price.'
The Retail Motor Industry Federation said the company car tax reforms were
'sensible' and would 'produce a fairer and more transparent tax system than
previously.'
The motor industry 'could rise to the challenge of developing more fuel
efficient vehicles,' said Sir Hal Miller, to compensate motorists in the
short-term for the government's plan to raise fuel duties in future by 3 per
cent a year in real terms.
There was a limit to what consumers should be asked to pay in the
longer-term.
The Freight Transport Association claimed that industry's costs had risen by
at least Pounds 230m a year with the 10 per cent increase in the duty on
diesel.
'In real terms this increase in fuel duty will mean that the cost of
operating a 38 tonne truck will go up by about Pounds 1,000 a year,' said
the FTA.
'The unremitting increase in industry's costs from raising fuel duty
annually will put us at the top of the EC road transport taxation league and
must make it more difficult for us to compete against our European
counterparts.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Rises in fuel and excise duties hit motorists
hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTORISTS were hit yesterday by increases in both fuel duty and vehicle
excise duty, while the taxation of the private use of company cars will also
rise significantly in the next financial year.
The company car taxation system will be drastically reformed with effect
from 1994-95 with the move to a system based on car list prices rather than
on engine size.
Some 700,000 drivers will face increases in their company car tax benefit
bills under the new system, in a few cases of up to 60 per cent, but the
majority of the 2m drivers who pay tax on company cars will benefit from the
reform, which will favour cheaper, smaller cars.
The government warned yesterday that the cost of motoring is set to rise in
real terms every year. It announced the intention to raise road fuel duties
on average by at least 3 per cent a year in real terms in all future
Budgets.
Mr Lamont said that this should provide an incentive for motorists to buy
smaller more fuel-efficient vehicles.
With immediate effect the price of a gallon of unleaded petrol was raised by
12p to around Pounds 2.29. The price of a gallon of 4-star petrol was up 15p
to around Pounds 2.52.
Duties on all road fuels, including diesel, were raised by 10 per cent. At
the same time the vehicle excise duty on cars was raised by Pounds 15 to
Pounds 125, an increase of 13.6 per cent.
These increases mean that the average cost of motoring, for a driver
covering around 10,000 miles a year, will rise by around Pounds 50 a year.
The chancellor said that the latest duty increases - combined with the
abolition last year of special car tax - would continue the shift of
taxation from car purchase towards taxation of car use.
The government was determined to raise fuel duties every year in real terms
in order to encourage fuel economy and to reduce the impact of the car on
the environment. The transport sector accounted for the largest contribution
to the growth in carbon dioxide emissions, said Mr Lamont.
The size of future increases in fuel duty would also take account of other
factors, such as the possible introduction of charges for motorways and
urban roads and the overall level of taxes and charges paid by road users.
Company car users face a further 8 per cent increase this year in tax scale
charges, which the chancellor claimed would finally raise company car
taxation 'to a level which fully reflects the true value of the benefit of a
company car.' The average driver of a company Ford Sierra or Vauxhall
Cavalier would pay Pounds 1.06 a week more in tax.
More importantly for the long-term the whole system for taxing the private
use of a company car will be reformed with effect from 1994/95 with the move
to a system that determines taxable benefits by the price of a car rather
than the size of its engine.
The annual car benefit will be valued at a fixed percentage of the
manufacturer's list price. Company car users will then pay income tax at
their marginal rate on that amount.
The benefit level will be set at 35 per cent of the list price with the aim
of making the reform neutral in terms of total company car tax revenues.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Sharp drop in petroleum tax rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor yesterday took the oil industry by storm with a large-scale
overhaul of North Sea petroleum taxes.
The industry had no inkling beforehand that he would be proposing such sharp
reductions in taxes accompanied by a virtual elimination of tax allowances.
The chancellor said he would reduce the Petroleum Revenue Tax rate on
existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and eliminate it
altogether for new fields.
He also said he would abolish PRT rules that allow expenditure on new
exploration and development to be set against profits of existing fields.
Mr Harold Hughes, who heads the industry group the UK Offshore Operators'
Association, said the tax changes would put a 'substantial burden on the
industry at a time when it is stretched economically by low oil prices and
high costs'.
The chancellor's changes will vastly simplify the tax regime in the North
Sea, cutting 300 pages of bureaucratic legislation on PRT and updating the
tax rules.
'It will be brilliant,' said Mr Tony Craven-Walker, managing director of
Monument Oil and Gas. 'It will make the system so much more simple.'
Monument will not stand to gain from the changes since it is not exposed to
PRT.
Large companies such as British Petroleum could gain as much as Pounds 130m
from the change according to some analysts. BP said last night that it
expected the changes to work favourably for it.
But the operators' association believes exploration costs in the North Sea
could quadruple. This would hit the smallest companies hardest and cut
drilling activity.
The chancellor said existing PRT rules had cost the exchequer Pounds 200m in
1991-92 rather than providing the revenue stream that was intended when PRT
was introduced in 1975. He said the changes would bring Pounds 300m into the
government's coffers in 1994-95 and Pounds 400m the following year.
However, Mr Hughes disputed the figures and said they would be much higher.
The chancellor said PRT had become increasingly anachronistic since its
introduction and represented a marginal tax rate of 83 per cent.
He said this gave no incentive to companies to keep their costs under
control or make the most of their investments.
Oil companies have dreamed up many ways of offsetting PRT over the years and
some production assets and even companies have been bought and sold on the
basis of the tax shelter they offer.
