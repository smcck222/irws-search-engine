FT  16 JUN 93 / Retail optimism reaches six-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILERS, wholesalers and motor traders are more optimistic about business
prospects over the next three months than at any time since February 1987, a
Confederation of British Industry survey said yesterday.
But with the pace of recovery in shop sales reported to have slowed in
recent months, after a surge earlier in the year, the CBI yesterday warned
that the strength of the upturn in consumer spending was still shaky.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said
May was the fifth successive month in which retailers reported a
year-on-year growth in sales. Yet the growth was below expectations and was
partly due to aggressive discounting.
Meanwhile, motor industry sales were slightly down in May, after rising
during the first four months of the year.
Noting that the overall volume of sales remained on pre-recession levels, Mr
Whittaker added: 'Our experience is that retailers can get over-optimistic
just as they became over-pessimistic at some stages in the recession.'
According to the CBI's quarterly distributive trade survey, which measures
business activity among 15,000 retailers, wholesalers and motor traders, 18
per cent more retailers reported a rise in sales than those who had seen
falls in May. This balance was 17 in April.
Though this was higher than May last year, when the balance had been 14, it
was below March's balance of 25, and retailers' previous predictions. The
balance of retailers predicting growth for June is 34 - the most optimistic
assessment since the beginning of the recession.
The recovery is benefiting large retailers more than small shops, the survey
said. The balance of retailers reporting an increase in sales was about 50
among those who employ more than 500 people, but it was minus 20 among those
employing fewer than 100.
There was further discrepancy between the retail sectors. Sales rose in
specialist food shops, book shops and hardware shops, measured year-on-year,
but fell in off-licences, and in shoe and leather shops. Clothing and DIY
sales were fairly flat.
The CBI said the supermarkets' expansion into the drinks market had
contributed to the fall in off-licence trade. The growth in specialist food
and book sales was partly due to the sharp fall in these sectors during the
recession.
As a further sign that sales volumes had not quite matched retailers'
optimistic predictions, fewer wholesalers reported growth in May than in
April. But with more than a third of wholesalers predicting higher sales in
the next few months, the volume of orders placed on suppliers was reported
to be sharply up year-on-year.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Increase in output squeezes liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE short-term liquidity position of Britain's large manufacturing companies
deteriorated in the first quarter of this year, indicating that growing
manufacturing production was taking a toll of their readily available funds.
The liquidity ratio, measuring current assets maturing in less than a year
as a share of liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year, was
the lowest since the first quarter of 1987.
The Central Statistical Office said the seasonally adjusted ratio for large
manufacturing companies fell to an estimated 95 per cent at the end of March
from 101 per cent in the previous quarter, and a recent peak of 121 per cent
reached in the first three months of last year.
By contrast, the ratio for large UK non-manufacturing companies increased to
132 per cent in the first quarter from 121 per cent three months before, and
was higher than the 126 per cent of March last year.
The liquidity of all large UK industrial and commercial companies was little
changed.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Extent of audit change deplored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES ARE being bombarded with far too many demands for reform of
accounting and auditing, the chairman of a group of leading finance
directors said yesterday.
Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director of Prudential and chairman of the 100
Group of finance directors, told a Confederation of British Industry
conference in London that there was a 'huge labyrinth' through which people
were struggling to find their way.
'We are concerned about the volume of material being produced and the
numbers of bodies becoming involved,' he said.
'Many chairmen and chief executives will begin to lose patience with all
this,' he continued. 'They will see time and energy being spent by
self-interested bureaucracies producing sheaves of requirements. The good
and the essential will be criticised along with the unnecessary and the
unwieldy.'
He said he had received recent documents from bodies including the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Association of Corporate
Treasurers and the Institute of Investment Management Research.
Mr Lawrence said the Accounting Standards Board should be the primary forum
for issuing standards, if balance and consistency were to be preserved.
He also criticised the proposals of the Auditing Practices Board to expand
the role of auditing. He said most corporate failures were failures of
financial reporting or basic auditing and did not require an expansion in
the scope of auditing.
He said there was a need for greater focus on the point that accounts are
primarily to communicate with shareholders, and not other potential
audiences such as employees and creditors.
'Financial reporting is essentially an exercise in practical communication,
and as with all communication should be geared to its audience and its
purpose,' he said.
He said that companies' financial reporting had been too flexible and
'innovative' in the past, and there was a need for less discretion in the
future.
He said the goal of international harmonisation of accounting standards was
well worth pursuing. But he added that there were many reporting differences
between different countries which did not need to be harmonised - but simply
understood.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Free-flights travel agent stops trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JSI TRAVEL, the company handling a free-flights promotion for the Dixons and
Currys electrical retail chains, ceased trading yesterday.
The travel company, based in Dorset, was also the agent for the Hoover
free-flights offer which was at the centre of controversy over bookings late
last year. JSI was later replaced as Hoover's agent by two other travel
companies.
Dixons, which owns the Currys chain, said last night that it had taken over
the administration of JSI and that all flights would go ahead as planned. It
said 11,000 customers had qualified for flights to 12 European destinations
under the promotion, which ended in April.
The Association of British Travel Agents said last night that JSI's
membership had been terminated last month after it had failed to renew its
bond.

FT  16 JUN 93 / 'A degree of cautious optimism is fully justified'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Extract from the chancellor's speech:
I stand before you not as a Londoner: my whole life has been spent in the
industrial Midlands, where I have acquired a deep and abiding respect for
all those engaged in the difficult business of commerce.
I strongly believe that commerce is an important civilising influence. I
also believe that too many people in this country still tend to forget that
it is commerce alone which generates the prosperity which enables government
to raise the living standards and hopes of all of the British people.
That is the key principle which will guide my hand as chancellor.
When I am judged in due course as chancellor, I should like to be remembered
as a chancellor who helped British industry and British commerce through
another difficult period and again helped in my own small way to make a
difference to the wealth-creating capacity of the nation. Or perhaps, more
simply, as a chancellor under whom the British businessman and woman and
their workforce were able to earn a better living.
As I see it, the objectives of economic policy over the period ahead are
threefold:
To keep inflation within the established target range of 1 to 4 per cent,
bringing it within the lower half of that range by the end of this
parliament.
To restore the public finances to better health and back towards balance
over the medium term.
To sustain the recovery and ensure that it is a durable one.
Those aims are complementary. We will not achieve sustainable growth and
steady recovery unless we maintain low inflation. And we cannot have a
healthy economy without healthy public finances.
I do not underestimate the task. Designing policy to deliver all three
objectives will be a formidable undertaking. But in some ways I face a
better combination of circumstances than perhaps any other finance minister
in the European Community.
A degree of cautious optimism is far from foolhardy - it is fully justified.
Above all, it is justified because of the dramatic progress we have made in
getting inflation down. My commitment to maintaining that low inflation is
second to none. And my political instincts reinforce my political duty.
I have the good fortune to have inherited a position in which inflation is
at a 30-year low. As a result, we have been able safely to reduce interest
rates to their lowest level for 15 years. I am not going to squander that
inheritance by embarking on policies which allow inflation to return.
But low inflation cannot be the sole end of economic policy. It is necessary
 -absolutely necessary - but on its own, low inflation is not enough.
Growth, employment and a better standard of living are the ultimate goals to
which every aspect of economic policy must contribute.
We politicians spell out our objectives to create a vision. The more
difficult question is how the government can best contribute to its
attainment.
Let me start with monetary policy. It is still less than a year since
sterling's membership of the ERM was suspended and a new monetary framework
was put in place. That is a very short time in the annals of monetary
history.
But one thing is already clear. The conduct of monetary policy outside a
fixed exchange rate system is very much an art, not a science. As in other
countries, including the US and Germany, discretion and judgment are
unavoidable features of policymaking.
As always, there are some who want us to name the indicator which we regard
most highly, and for movements in that lodestone to be followed
automatically by a change in the stance of policy.
I do not believe that life can ever be so simple. Since it is not, I shall
continue to follow a policy of paying regard to a range of indicators,
including the growth of both narrow and broad money in relation to their
ranges, the signals coming from movements in asset prices, and the behaviour
of the exchange rate.
As long as we remain outside the ERM - and I do not expect that the
circumstances in which we might return will apply for quite some time - it
will be essential to review, on a consistent basis, month by month, the full
range of evidence available.
The issue of an independent central bank has important parliamentary
implications and will no doubt now be the subject of more parliamentary and
other debate. I have no intention of rushing into or anticipating that
debate.
But I can say that all my decisions on monetary policy, their nature and
their timing, will be based on objective economic judgments and will be
firmly guided by the best advice I can obtain.
The thriving, growing, competing economy I want to see also depends
crucially on our ability to reduce borrowing and restore sound public
finances. No Conservative chancellor can accept for long the need to borrow
Pounds lbn a week to finance the deficit.
Debt is debt, whether the result of the recession or not. And all debt has
to be serviced. In the space of four years, government debt interest
payments are expected to rise by over Pounds 10bn - that is an extra Pounds
10bn that cannot be spent by the government on schools, on hospitals, on
training or on science.
The fact is that the recession does not account for all the deterioration in
the public finances. And I have made it clear in everything I have said
since I took office that we cannot rely on recovery alone to bring borrowing
back towards balance.
No prudent chancellor can ever regard taxation as something which can only
ever be reduced. My own instincts are tax-cutting instincts, but if we are
to keep the level of taxation down, it is essential to maintain a tight rein
on public spending.
The government has already announced measures to reduce the deficit - by
controlling spending and increasing revenue - but if I judge that further
action is necessary, I shall not hesitate to take it.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Call for levy to help meet City insurance cost rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR FRANCIS McWilliams, the lord mayor of London, has called for a national
levy on businesses to help pay for the big increase in the cost for City
companies of insurance cover against terrorist acts.
'If the country as a whole wishes to continue to benefit from the City's
contribution to the national wealth, surely the country should share some of
the costs,' he said at the banquet at Guildhall.
Last month Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company formed to
provide terrorism insurance, announced that rates would be increased - with
rises of more than 300 per cent for some large City businesses.
Sir Francis criticised 'lack of consultation' over the rate increases.
Echoing the Confederation of British Industry and other business
organisations, the lord mayor said he favoured 'a more equitable way
forward'.
He said a steering group of leading City practitioners and specialists was
being formed to put forward proposals on improving security. Proposals under
consideration included increased use and co-ordination of surveillance
cameras, increased police powers and numbers, and restricting vehicle access
to certain areas.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Small-firms market considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange is studying the creation of a second-level market
for smaller companies. It would have lower listing and regulatory
requirements.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, the exchange's chairman, said in his speech last
night that finding ways to direct capital into smaller companies was an
important task for the government and the exchange.
The exchange is said to have set up a panel to look at the creation of an
alternative to the Unlisted Securities Market, which is due to be closed in
1996.
Sir Andrew said that the simple creation of a trading exchange for smaller
companies was not enough to spur greater investment. He said the government
must alter the tax structure, which now encourages private investors to
invest in their own homes or in collective investment schemes.
'This will, I fear, require action by government to correct fiscal
distortions which penalise individual share ownership,' Sir Andrew said.
'Discriminatory tax burdens have encouraged the collectivisation of
individual savings and have given investment in house ownership an advantage
over investment in industry.'
He suggested that the government institute a roll-over rule for capital
gains tax, which would exempt capital gains from taxation if those resources
were reinvested in small companies. He stopped short of calling for outright
abolition of mortgage interest relief.
Sir Andrew said that - while it had become obvious that the withdrawal of
the Business Expansion Scheme had been made necessary by its evolution into
the 'plaything of the tax avoidance industry' - the government needed to
develop sensible alternatives to the scheme.
Institutional shareholders, who control more than 80 per cent of UK capital
available for investment, are not likely to channel funds into small
companies because they need to concentrate their resources on larger
companies, Sir Andrew said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has decided to set a ceiling of Pounds 80,000 on the prices
used in calculations for the new system of company car personal taxation.
The concession followed intense lobbying by luxury carmakers such as
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Aston Martin.
While the majority of company car drivers would benefit under the reform, to
be introduced in April next year, drivers of very expensive company cars
would have faced daunting personal tax bills.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Extra Pounds 6.4bn sought for Tube
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S heavily subsidised Underground railway could become self-sufficient
financially if the government invested an extra Pounds 6.4bn over the next
10 years, the network claimed yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes.
London Underground said the extra money, which would more than double
government investment in the network, was needed to bring the railway up to
date after decades of comparative neglect.
The network said about Pounds 8.5bn was needed over 10 years to deliver the
'decently modern metro' that London deserved. Part of this could be financed
through efficiency gains and higher fares.
It said the government would recoup the remaining Pounds 6.4bn through extra
tax revenues and reduced unemployment benefits resulting from the jobs
generated by the railway.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Ministers set to back Thorp plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THORP nuclear re-processing plant at Sellafield should gain approval if
environmental and legal questions can be settled, ministers argued yesterday
in their first formal discussions about the plant's future.
The government is likely to issue a paper in the next few weeks setting out
the case for British Nuclear Fuels' Pounds 2.8bn plant, the subject of the
most contentious environmental decision facing the government.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, yesterday wrote to Mr
John Major, the prime minister, to express 'grave concern at the national
and international implications' of giving approval for Thorp. Proliferation
of plutonium and nuclear-weapons capability heads his list of worries -
Thorp reprocesses used nuclear fuel into reusable uranium and plutonium.
The plant, which has taken nearly 10 years to build and is waiting for a
government licence to start operation, has been attacked as 'Britain's
biggest white elephant' by environmentalists. The government has been warned
by its lawyers that it could face a judicial review prompted by legal action
from pressure groups if it took a decision without further consultation.
Thorp's future appears unlikely to be brought into the review of the nuclear
power industry, due to start in the autumn. That would have postponed a
decision - originally expected by BNF in January - for months.
Yesterday's cabinet committee discussions, which Mr Major did not attend,
focused on the plant's earnings. BNF has argued that Thorp will earn Pounds
900m for the UK in the first 10 years and that each week of delay costs
Pounds 2m.
The final decision falls to Mr John Gummer, the new environment secretary,
who is a known supporter of the nuclear power industry. But several
government departments have some responsibility. The Department of Trade and
Industry is BNF's shareholder, while the Foreign Office is concerned about
relations with foreign customers.
BNF denied claims in advertisements yesterday in UK national newspapers
taken out by Japanese pressure groups. The group, Japanese Citizens
Concerned About Plutonium, claimed that the Japanese power utilities,
Thorp's biggest overseas customers, no longer wanted the plant to go ahead
because it was accumulating too much plutonium.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Iraq arms inquiry told of Saudi deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT pressed ahead with important defence deals with Saudi Arabia
in the 1980s in spite of being warned by intelligence and Ministry of
Defence officials that the country was possibly being used to divert
military equipment to Iraq, according to evidence gathered by the Scott
arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, the inquiry counsel, referred to documents
provided by British intelligence yesterday while questioning Sir Stephen
Egerton, a former UK ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
Separately, the Scott inquiry has been provided with evidence that Saudi
Arabia, together with Jordan, was identified in internal Ministry of Defence
briefing notes in 1987 and 1988 as countries 'known or suspected' of
diverting sensitive defence-related goods to Iraq.
'We have evidence of intelligence information that Saudi Arabia was being
used as a diversionary route to Iraq,' Miss Baxendale said.
In 1986 the UK signed the first of a number of major contracts linked to the
multi-billion pound Al-Yamanah defence deal. The deal is still in progress.
No direct link was made yesterday between Iraq and any of the military
equipment in the Al-Yamamah deal. However the intelligence reports raise new
questions about the extent to which the government may have breached its own
guidelines which restrict arms sales to Iraq while trading with other Middle
East countries.
In his evidence, Sir Stephen said that while serving as ambassador he was
made aware that a Saudi port was being 'occasionally used for transport of
equipment to Iraq', but that intelligence had failed to establish conclusive
evidence of defence equipment being rerouted.
'I found Saudi Arabia a very honourable country to deal in and with,' Sir
Stephen said. He added that he had asked for additional intelligence
information from an ally - believed to be the US - but this too had not
confirmed the earlier report.
In further questioning by Miss Baxendale, Sir Stephen referred to a meeting
in 1988 with a 'Saudi prince' who had angrily complained to the ambassador
about the way a contract with Allivane International, a Scottish-based
defence company, had been held up.
Sir Stephen said he knew nothing about the contract and kept away from
further meetings on the subject. 'I did not like the smell of it,' he said,
before handing the name of the Saudi prince on a piece of paper to Lord
Justice Scott.
The inquiry continues on Monday.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Timex strikers isolated from reality: How the workforce
continued Dundee's tradition of militancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Timex dispute, which came to such a devastating climax yesterday, will
do nothing for the reputation either of Timex or of the city of Dundee. But
it is likely that Dundee will have to live with the consequences for longer.
Timex may be branded as a ruthless and ham-fisted employer. But Dundee will
regain a reputation for poor industrial relations which it has had some
success in shaking off, and loses an employer which has been in the city
since 1946.
The dispute flared when Timex demanded the temporary layoff of part of its
workforce to cope with a downturn in orders.
That provoked a strike and when the workers rejected a peace plan under
which the management also hoped to end long-standing restrictive practices,
Timex fired its workforce.
It hired a substitute workforce which had to be bussed in past angry
pickets. National officials of the AEEU engineering union eventually coaxed
an offer out of Timex, under which the workforce would be reinstated with a
27 per cent cut in pay and fringe benefits. Two weeks ago it was
contemptuously rejected. It was rejected again yesterday.
Timex had been trying with little success since 1990 to win the full-hearted
cooperation of its workforce, providing bonuses, profit-sharing and giving
employees 10 per cent of the Dundee subsidiary's equity.
The sacked workforce blamed the troubles at the plant, which has lost Pounds
10m in the past six years, on the arrival of Mr Peter Hall as plant manager
in 1991. Mr Hall blamed the deterioration in labour relations on the
election of an unaccommodating union convener and deputy convener at the end
of last year. They misjudged his determination in the confrontation and led
the workforce into making fatal mistakes.
It is no secret that the national leadership of the AEEU found local
officials and plant representatives intractable and unrealistic. But AEEU
national officials believe Mr Hall should have sought their co-operation
earlier, explaining the plant's financial problems and his difficulties with
plant union leaders.
The officials point to the case of the Hoover plant at Cambuslang, Glasgow,
which was saved by a union-agreed cut in pay and conditions.
Local union officials, led by Mr John Kydd, father of the union convener at
Timex, are heir to a long tradition of union militancy in Dundee. In the
1970s and early 1980s the city became a byword for poor industrial
relations, with Timex, which then employed 7,000, one of the worst affected.
Since the mid-1980s things have improved considerably. The council has, with
the help of the former Scottish Development Agency, developed the city's
waterfront and improved its appearance. Unemployment has gradually fallen
and is now about ten per cent.
But poor industrial relations persisted. For example, Davy Corporation chose
Dundee to convert an oil rig into a production platform in 1989 but
eventually towed the rig to the Cromarty Firth after failing to win union
agreement for round-the-clock working.
As the Timex dispute continued, the sacked workforce was buoyed up by
considerable public sympathy in Scotland and support from other parts of
Britain, some from left-wing groups such as Militant. The workforce
apparently failed to appreciate the weakness of its position: it had been
replaced by other workers and was dealing with a company that held most of
the cards.
The Scottish media helped isolate the strikers from reality by their
frequently one-sided presentation of the dispute.
The image of angry pickets clashing with police outside the plant surprised
many people who thought such scenes had been banished by 10 years of
Conservative trade union legislation.
Yet, while the dispute was conducted in a highly legalistic framework,
almost all of the law pre-dates the Thatcher revolution.
Recent legislation did affect the conduct of the dispute - for example, it
forced the national union to repudiate many of the actions of its members -
but it did not significantly alter the balance of power.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Governor calls for greater freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, last
night called on politicians, academics and the City to consider how the Bank
might be given more independence while staying accountable to parliament.
In cautiously worded remarks, he suggested that thought should be given to
devising a 'form of accountability that might enable us to have the
advantages of a more autonomous central bank within the constitutional
arrangements of our parliamentary democracy'.
In what was his valedictory speech to the City before stepping down after 10
years as Bank governor at the end of this month, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he
recognised 'along with the prime minister, that any change to the current
status of the Bank of England could pose a dilemma in the UK with our long
tradition of parliamentary accountability on the floor of the House by a
minister of the crown'.
He added: 'I think all of us - politicians, academics, ourselves in the City
 -will need to consider how this dilemma might be reconciled.'
In his remarks last night he was taking up comments made by Mr John Major
last week in the Commons in which the prime minister indicated he might be
in favour of central bank independence 'were a way to be found to get the
benefits . . . without the loss of parliamentary accountability'.
However, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, made clear in his speech that he
did not intend to rush into a debate about giving more autonomy to the Bank.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Pay formula talks for firefighters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authority employers will meet representatives of the Fire Brigades
Union at the end of this month in an attempt to quell the threat of
industrial action if the firefighters' pay formula is not restored next
year, David Goodhart writes.
Firefighters are one of the few groups of workers with the muscle and,
potentially, the public support to challenge the government's 1.5 per cent
public-sector pay policy.
For this year the 1.5 per cent pay rise for firefighters is likely to be
accepted in November. Under the pay formula firefighters' pay is linked to
the upper quartile of male manual earnings and this year the outcome from
the formula will not be far above the 1.5 per cent limit.
For next year the situation could be more complex and local authority
employers are likely to give a broad hint at the meeting later this month
that they will stick to the formula for 1994.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Extra Pounds 6.4bn sought for Tube
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S heavily subsidised Underground railway could become self-sufficient
financially if the government invested an extra Pounds 6.4bn over the next
10 years, the network claimed yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes.
London Underground said the extra money, which would more than double
government investment in the network, was needed to bring the railway up to
date after decades of comparative neglect.
The sum were published as part of the Underground's campaign to secure as
favourable a settlement as possible in the public-spending round.
The network said about Pounds 8.5bn was needed over 10 years to deliver the
'decently modern metro' that London deserved. Part of this could be financed
through efficiency gains and higher fares.
It said an independent study showed that the government would more than
recoup the remaining Pounds 6.4bn through extra tax revenues and reduced
unemployment benefits resulting from the jobs generated by the improved
railway.
Once the investment programme had been completed the core network would not
only cover its operating costs, but also the cost of refurbishing and
renewing the railway.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Amec wins Pounds 55m North Sea contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILLIPS Petroleum UK has awarded Tyneside-based Amec Offshore a Pounds 55m
contract for fabrication of a 9,800-tonne integrated deck for the Judy
platform in the North Sea.
The deck will be part of the Pounds 765m Judy/Joanne oil and gas field
development.
Phillips said Amec clinched the contract against stiff international
competition.
Amec, whose Tyneside payroll has dropped from its 4,000 peak a year ago to
1,500, welcomed the order as a 'breathing space', allowing it to retain its
present shape and size while competing for more work, cutting costs and
improving performance.
The company said the Phillips order had safeguarded 500 blue-collar and 250
white-collar jobs, as well as 250 sub-contractors' posts.
Amec also announced it had won its first contract in mainland China. It will
build two accommodation modules for Phillips' Xijiang field in the South
China Sea. The contract, worth Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.8m), is a joint venture
with the Chinese Offshore Industrial Corporation.
Amec sees its China breakthrough as an important part of its drive to sell
its offshore expertise worldwide. Offshore fabricators are fighting a fierce
international battle for orders as work in the UK sector of the North Sea
dwindles, leaving large fabrication facilities under-used or empty.
Mr Arthur McQuillan, general manager of Amec Process and Energy
Construction, said the company's Tyneside facilities alone could cope with
every single piece of fabrication expected to come to the marketplace in the
coming year.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Building societies warned on rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES were warned yesterday not to offer unfair rates of
interest after a case in which a society was forced to pay compensation of
up Pounds 1,400 each to 30 investors who were offered comparatively low
returns.
The warning was issued by the Building Society Ombudsman Scheme following a
judgment in which the ombudsman decided that a society had acted unfairly
towards investors in a two-year bond that offered less than other products.
The scheme did not name the society.
This is the first time a society has been found to have acted unfairly in
offering a particular rate of return on one product even though investors
were aware that other products were offering higher returns.
The society was judged to have acted unfairly because investors were
attracted by the initial offer of a higher rate of return, but were unable
to move their money later when other products of the society started
offering more.
The judgment was disclosed in the annual report of the three building
societies ombudsmen. It said that the number of complaints against societies
had dropped slightly to 9,402 for the year to March, compared with 9,525 the
previous year.
The number of complaints this year 'certainly does not reflect badly' on the
87 societies who are members of the scheme, said Mr Stephen Edell, one of
the ombudsmen.
However, the ombudsmen said that a change in the charging structure, which
gave an incentive to societies that provoked large numbers of complaints to
settle before they went to the ombudsmen, probably curtailed the numbers.
The number of cases considered by the ombudsmen increased by 29 per cent to
1,382, and there was a 60 per cent increase in the number of formal
judgments to 630. Complaints about savers' interest rates fell by 37 per
cent to 809.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, plans to remove restrictions on
school overcrowding, according to a letter leaked by the Labour party.
In the letter, written in April to Mr David Hunt, then Welsh secretary, he
says the costs of maintaining minimum standards for educational premises 'go
well beyond any realistic prospect of the capital expenditure which is
likely to be made available for improving existing buildings'.
He says that these standards, first established in 1981, would be
'deregulated', allowing schools to put more pupils into classroom space than
they could before.
The letter continued: 'The most contentious and potentially expensive
aspects of the present regulations relate to the minimum area standards for
teaching accommodation, and these I propose to deregulate along with the
area requirements for school land.'
In a draft reply to a parliamentary question, he makes clear that the
central core of requirements for safeguard-ing health, safety and wel-fare
would be maintained. The Department for Education refused to comment on the
content of the letter. However, it said a need for an extra Pounds 2bn on
school buildings had been identified in 1986. Local education authorities
had invested this amount in buildings by the end of 1990. A formal
announcement of the government's plans is expected by the end of next month.
The letter provoked an angry response from teachers and opposition
politicians.
Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary - who leaked the letter - said:
'Mr Patten says in his letter that opponents will probably accuse the
government 'of a failure to protect educational standards'.
'He is quite correct. I do make such an accusation - and for the very good
reason that this is indeed an obvious and reckless disregard for standards.'
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, said the plans gave the term 'crammer' a whole new meaning.
'Working in slum conditions isn't going to improve either quality or
morale,' he said.

FT  16 JUN 93 / BBC halts night output growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is to scrap its expansion plans for the BBC Select subscription
service.
The corporation has invested more than Pounds 10m in the service - which
involves broadcasting subscription services to adapted video recorders at
night - but has decided that it cannot afford to develop it further.
The corporation has given assurances that it will honour existing contracts
and continue to broadcast the three subscription services created so far -
the Executive Business Club, Accountancy Television and Legal Network
Television. But no new money will be invested and no new subscription
services will be created.
Mr John Radcliffe, managing director of BBC Select, who is retiring next
month, said yesterday: 'This is essentially a matter of financial pressure.'
The BBC bought 30,000 Selector receivers from Thomson Consumer Electronics
in a multi-million-pound deal. It still has about 29,000 and intends to make
them available at a large discount. Redundancies are expected at BBC Select.
The BBC will continue to broadcast 'open access' and educational programmes
in the early hours.
The service Voluntary Sector Television was launched earlier this month.
Unlike subscription television, open access programmes are available free
and can be recorded without an adaptor.
BMH, a company set up to broadcast annual meetings and presentations of
companies, will also continue.
At one stage the BBC was hoping that it could quickly launch at least 15
subscription services - including programmes aimed at ethnic minorities,
film buffs and professional groups. But the development of such services
took longer than expected, mainly because of the recession.
Professor Graham Robinson, managing director of the Executive Business Club,
said yesterday he was disappointed by the decision. But he did not think it
would affect the development of what was a niche service. The club has a
seven-year contract with the BBC.
BBC Select was set up in the wake of government pressure on the corporation
to use the night hours or risk losing the authority to do so. The government
also wanted the BBC to explore alternative means of finance to the licence
fee.
Mr Radcliffe said yesterday the subscription technology had proved itself.
'We could not be allowed to go on costing money in the present climate,' he
said.

FT  16 JUN 93 / French private hospitals offer Britons cut-price surgery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PLANNING a holiday in Brittany this year? Why not take in an operation at a
French hospital during your stay?
French private hospital operators yesterday launched a bid to attract
non-urgent surgical cases from Britain at a presentation organised by the
French Embassy in London. Hospital directors from four parts of France
popular with British residents and tourists - Paris, Brittany, Nord
Pas-de-Calais and Cote d'Azur - outlined to medical insurers the potential
advantages of contract-ing for treatment across the Channel.
Price is the main advantage. A spell in a French hospital can often cost
about 50 per cent less than the same treatment in the British private
sector. The meeting heard of a British patient quoted Pounds 2,100 for a
cataract operation at home. The patient had the treatment in France for
Pounds 1,100.
Mr David Ashdown, a director of Western Provident Association, Britain's
third-largest provident insurer, said lower costs in France were leading to
some corporate clients seeking provision for French treatment in their
policies. WPA had obtained treatment in France for British patients
'although we have sent hundreds rather than thousands so far'.
British health insurers told the meeting they believed most clients welcomed
the convenience of local treatment and would be reluctant to travel to
France in order to help contain their insurers' costs. Three years ago Bupa,
the largest insurer, reached an agreement with the Clinique Chirurgicale de
Calais to treat British patients. But Mr Jean-Vilhelm Glud, its executive
director, said that while the hospital had treated British patients living
in France, there had so far been no demand from British residents.
The British insurers suggested that the French hospital directors should
target their marketing efforts at uninsured private patients in Britain.
Many medical procedures now involve day-surgery or very short stays in
hospital; in these circumstances a 50 per cent price difference could make
'medical tourism' attractive to patients meeting their own bills.
The meeting also agreed that keen pricing could lead to co-operation between
French hospitals and the National Health Service. Health authorities and
fund-holding general practitioners can purchase private treatment if it is
cost-effective, and some authorities have explored the possibility of
sending patients abroad. But the issue is politically sensitive and,
although NHS representatives were invited to yesterday's meeting, none
attended.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Bupa urges flexibility for private investment in NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUPA, Britain's biggest private healthcare group, is urging the government
to be more flexible in efforts to attract private capital to the National
Health Service.
Mr Peter Jacobs, Bupa chief executive, yesterday said that while he believed
ministers and senior officials wanted partnerships between the public and
private sectors, the government initiative was in danger of collapsing 'if
the private sector keeps facing blockages'.
In April the government relaxed arrangements for the use of private finance
in the NHS. This included raising from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 10m the
financial ceiling at which health service managers need Treasury approval
for contracts with the private sector.
But, said Mr Jacobs, 50 per cent of projects worth between Pounds 1m and
Pounds 10m would still be scrutinised by the government under sampling
procedures set up to monitor the new arrangements.
While it was necessary to maintain public accountability, he said, calling
in one in two projects for sampling and the potential resulting delay was
likely to prove a considerable disincentive to the private sector. He
suggested that the government should begin by sampling about one project in
six.
Bupa has begun discussions with health service hospitals and health
authorities on possible joint ventures, including a cardiac centre.
'The time has come for private-sector involvement in the NHS to move from
support services like cleaning to the core business, which is healthcare,'
said Mr Jacobs.
'We are putting a good deal of management time into this. But the government
must address the reasonable concerns of the private sector if the policy is
to succeed.'
Mr Jacobs is concerned that, if the government insists on all joint projects
going out to tender, potential private partners may be discouraged from
planning ventures with health service hospitals if there is a risk of losing
their ideas to competitors at the tendering stage.
Mr Jacobs said a stock market flotation of Bupa, now a provident
association, remained only one of a number of possibilities if it needed to
raise funds in the future.
He said: 'As insurance businesses develop they need money. We launched a
Pounds 100m Eurobond earlier this year and do not need more money at
present. There has been no decision about an eventual flotation.'
Frenchay NHS trust in Bristol announced yesterday that it is to shed 89 jobs
to help cut spending by Pounds 2.3m over the next year.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Midlands toll M-way scheme opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLICATION yesterday of detailed plans for the first toll motorway, around
the north-east side of Birmingham and the Black Country, ran into immediate
opposition from environmentalists and local residents. The protests provide
a preview of the arguments that will be voiced at a public inquiry into the
road next year.
Mr Robert Key, the roads minister, opened an exhibition in Coleshill,
Warwickshire, of plans for the motorway, which will be called the Birmingham
Northern Relief Road. He was greeted with chants of 'save our countryside,
no more roads', and comments ranged from 'shame', to 'people along the line
of this road have had a gut-full', and 'you can tell MacGregor (the
transport secretary) we don't want his rotten road'.
The objections make it inevitable that a public inquiry - the second on the
proposed motorway - will take place next year. Trafalgar House and Iritecna,
the Anglo-Italian joint venture that will build and run the motorway, hope
to win clearance for the road by 1996 and open it in 1998.
Both the joint-venture company and the Department of Transport believe the
motorway will relieve congestion on the M6, a point contested by the
environmental group Friends of the Earth. Local residents are perturbed by
the toll road's route through the green belt and the prospect of disturbance
to adjacent villages.
Trafalgar House estimates the cost of the motorway at Pounds 500m. The road
would run from the M6 east of Cannock, Staffordshire, around the conurbation
to rejoin the M6 near Coleshill, by the junction of the M6 with the M42.
Plans for the motorway have been debated since 1980. Proposals for a second
orbital toll road on the western side of Birmingham and the Black Country
are less advanced.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Many 21-year-olds fail simple numbers tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN FIVE of the UK's 21-year-olds is innumerate while one in seven is
illiterate, says research by the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit.
These people were classified 'functionally' innumerate or illiterate after a
30-minute assessment of their skills, not because they could not read or add
up at all, but because the requirements of industry have risen.
Mr Peter Davis, chairman of the unit, said: 'Even very simple jobs are
becoming more complex. Skills need to rise and the needs of employers are
rising generally faster than the people's skills.'
The unit suggested that an extra 25 per cent needed help with literacy,
while an extra 33 per cent needed help with mathematics.
The survey, the most detailed of its kind yet in the UK, broadly confirmed
previous estimates that about 6m adults in the UK have difficulties with
their basic skills, and that 40 per cent of teenagers entering further
education needed help with basic skills.
The survey showed that 21-year-olds with poor basic skills were much more
likely to be jobless - 35 per cent of men with low literacy, and 25 per cent
with low numeracy, were unemployed, in spite of 13 per cent unemployment for
the whole sample.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, addressing the unit's annual
conference in London, announced that he was granting an extra Pounds 250,000
for pilot schemes in family literacy. These mirror schemes to improve
literacy in the US.
He pointed to the unit's finding that poor literacy and numeracy correlate
strongly with poor basic skills in parents. Of those whose parents were in
the lowest attainment group, without educational qualifications, 61 per cent
had low literacy scores and 52 per cent had low numeracy scores.
If parents' skills were improved, they would be more likely to pass them on
to their children, Mr Patten argued.
He also said the adult illiteracy problem 'shows why it is essential to
press ahead with testing' in schools. He said: 'We cannot afford to wait
until our pupils become adults before we identify and tackle their needs.'
Ms Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said: 'After 14 years of
Conservative government the situation is clearly worsening. Government
policy reinforces disadvantage.'
The survey was conducted in 1991 by City University, which interviewed a
representative sample of 1,650 people born between April 5 and April 11
1970.
The study excluded dyslexics, people for whom English was not a first
language, and all those with mental disabilities.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Inner-city proposals extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday named eight further construction projects it would
like developed jointly by private and public-sector interests, and published
guidelines for companies wishing to fund and develop projects traditionally
financed by the public sector.
The eight, expected to cost a total of several hundred million pounds, are
all inner city projects in the Midlands, and in north-west and north-east
England.
They include two in Coventry and two in Rochdale as well as schemes in
Liverpool, Gateshead, Sunderland and London Docklands where 70 acres of land
in the former Royal Victoria dock are being offered for development.
Much of the land identified for development is owned by public authorities,
such as local authorities or urban development corporations.
The London Docklands Development Corporation announced yesterday that it
proposed, for its land in the Royal Docks, an exhibition centre of 100,000
square metres 'to provide London with a centre of national importance and
allow it to compete in the international exhibition market'. The proposal
attracted immediate hostility from Mr Terry Golding, chief executive of the
National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham.
The environment department guidelines, announced by Sir George Young,
construction minister, would allow public authorities to hand over land free
of payment to private developers in return for a share of future profits.
The latest schemes are in addition to a list of 21 costing more than Pounds
1bn which Mr John Redwood, then environment minister, earlier this year
identified as candidates for public/private-sector joint ventures.
These included a new airport for Sheffield, a power station for London's
Docklands and a road tunnel under the River Tyne.
Sir George said the Nunnery Square development in Sheffield, involving
Sheffield Development Corporation and the Glenlivet Property Company,
provided a good example of how public/private partnerships could work.
The development corporation would receive no initial payment for its 11
acres of land but would receive a share of the profits as the 130,000 sq ft
office development was let. On the back of the deal, Glenlivet had been able
to raise Pounds 3m from 10 private investors including pension funds,
individuals and other financial institutions. As a result, no loan finance
had been required for the development.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Chairman attacks long work hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MALE culture of long, unsociable working hours is damaging women's
career prospects, says Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey
National.
The message was echoed by Mr John Collins, chairman and chief executive of
Shell UK, who said that 'jackets over chairs' for 18 hours a day could
indicate that a company was working inefficiently.
Men in the UK work longer hours than males in any other part of the European
Community, according to research by the Equal Opportunities Commission.
Nearly 42 per cent of men work more than 46 hours a week, compared with 23
per cent in the EC as a whole.
In a speech on equal opportunities Sir Christopher plans to deliver to the
Industrial Society's women's network tonight, he is due to say: 'Up till
now, the workplace has been predominantly male-oriented. There has been a
perception that to succeed one has to be tough, to work long and erratic
hours, and to be willing to travel, to stay away from home, to move house
and even sometimes country.
'These requirements have tended to favour the hiring and promoting of men
rather than women.'
Mr Collins, who has just joined the board of Opportunity 2000, the
employer-led campaign to improve the position of women in the workforce,
said: 'I don't want to encourage a culture where people are rushing around
trying to achieve too much to the detriment of the quality of their work.
That starts with the chairman - I don't work weekends.'

FT  16 JUN 93 / Protest against ICI claim is backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Advertising Standards Authority yesterday upheld four out of five
complaints brought by Greenpeace, the environmental group, against Imperial
Chemical Industries.
The complaints related to ICI's claims about the environmental impact of
Klea 134a, its substitute for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
The rulings are a significant embarrassment for the British group. It has
invested more than Pounds 250m developing the substitute for CFCs, which are
believed to be a significant factor in the depletion of the ozone layer
surrounding the earth and will be banned by the end of 1995.
Greenpeace alleged that ICI had underplayed the extent to which Klea 134a
would contribute to global warming. ICI's claims about Klea 134a were
published last October in The House magazine, distributed to MPs and
parliamentary staff.
In spite of the ASA rulings, ICI yesterday rejected Greenpeace's demand for
publication of an apology. It said that the advertisement had been factually
correct, that any changes required were essentially semantic and that the
ASA had agreed the company had not intended to mislead.
The ASA had consulted the Meteorological Office for independent advice on
the accuracy of ICI's claims.
The ASA, an independent watchdog on printed advertising standards, supported
ICI's claim that the direct impact of Klea 134a on global warning was 90 per
cent less than that of the CFCs it replaces.
But it upheld Greenpeace's challenge to the group's claim that Klea 134a
would never contribute more than 1 per cent of the total man-made greenhouse
effect. Greenpeace maintained that Klea 134a would contribute at least 6 per
cent. ICI argued yesterday that its figures were accurate and supported by a
German parliamentary commission.
The ASA said it had discounted a report from one independent body which was
found to have contained some errors. The same source said a general problem
with the advertisement was that ICI had selected from several equally
possible scenarios the one most favourable to its own case. The ASA
described ICI as 'extremely co-operative' in the case.
The ASA also ruled that ICI's claim that 'Klea 134a is at least as
energy-efficient as any other alternative likely to be commercially
available in the foreseeable future' was insufficiently supported by
independent evidence.
ICI said yesterday the ASA had acknowledged that the technical report it had
used to make this particular adjudication was out of date. The company
argued that a recent German consumer-testing agency had shown that Klea 134a
consumed three times less energy than the most efficient propane or butane
refrigerators.
The ASA also upheld the complaint against ICI's claim that 98 per cent of
global warming comes from electricity used by refrigeration equipment. This
is true of domestic refrigerators, but not retail equipment which accounts
for more than half of CFC use.
The body also said ICI's claim that recycling programmes could prevent any
emissions was unsubstantiated.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Amec wins Pounds 55m North Sea order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILLIPS Petroleum UK has awarded Tyneside-based Amec Offshore a Pounds 55m
contract for fabrication of a 9,800-tonne integrated deck for the Judy
platform in the North Sea.
The deck will be part of the Pounds 765m Judy/Joanne oil and gas field
development.
Phillips said Amec clinched the contract against stiff international
competition.
Amec, whose Tyneside payroll has dropped from its 4,000 peak a year ago to
1,500, welcomed the order as a 'breathing space', allowing it to retain its
present shape and size while competing for more work, cutting costs and
improving performance.
The company said the Phillips order had safeguarded 500 blue-collar and 250
white-collar jobs, as well as 250 sub-contractors' posts.
Amec also announced it had won its first contract in mainland China. It will
build two accommodation modules for Phillips' Xijiang field in the South
China Sea. The contract, worth Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.8m), is a joint venture
with the Chinese Offshore Industrial Corporation, and fabrication will be
carried out at Dalian New Shipyard in north-east China.
Amec sees its China breakthrough as an important part of its drive to sell
its offshore expertise worldwide. Offshore fabricators are fighting a fierce
international battle for orders as work in the UK sector of the North Sea
dwindles, leaving large fabrication facilities under-used or empty.
Mr Arthur McQuillan, general manager of Amec Process and Energy
Construction, said the company's Tyneside facilities could cope with every
single piece of fabrication expected to come to the marketplace in the
coming year from the UK sector.
Even with the Judy order and two contracts worth a total of Pounds 100m,
which Amec won last October, the company's Tyneside yards will be running
below 50 per cent capacity. Mr Alan Scott, general manager of Amec Offshore,
said it needed to win two more significant orders this year to maintain
present workforce levels beyond the second quarter of 1994.

FT  16 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Kantor cool towards renewal of sanctions
law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, is urging Congress to resurrect
the administration's 'fast-track' trade negotiating authority without
tacking on to the legislation a renewal of Super 301, a provision much
despised by the country's trading partners.
Super 301 requires the trade representative to list 'unfair' trading
countries and negotiate away their trade barriers. It was used sparingly in
1989 and 1990 - against Japan, Brazil and India - and then it expired.
The deadlines imposed by Super 301 requiring action, or a waiver of action
on grounds of national interest, can reduce flexibility for trade officials.
They have said that the imposition of sanctions during key negotiations such
as the Uruguay Round could be highly damaging.
President Bill Clinton strongly endorsed a renewal of Super 301 during the
election campaign last year, and Mr Kantor has not retreated from that
position. However, his endorsement at a hearing on Monday was
unenthusiastic.
Although promising to 'work with' Congress on Super 301 at another time, he
was quick to imply that the administration was moving aggressively without
its help.
Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate international trade sub-committee
and a strong supporter of Super 301, told Mr Kantor he wished the
representative would 'more strongly embrace' the provision. Would it not
give him 'additional negotiating leverage' in the Uruguay Round?

FT  16 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Crossed lines over telecoms trade-off -
Contentious US-German pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S negotiators with the European Community say the affair of their
alleged 'secret non-aggression pact' with the US over EC trade sanctions is
an unnecessary, but embarrassing, storm in a teacup.
It illustrates how lines of communication within the Community can get
tangled over years of complex negotiations. It also shows how dangerous
megaphone diplomacy can be in the delicate art of trade negotiations.
There is even an element of sloppy drafting, or possibly mistranslation,
thrown in to create further crossed lines between Bonn, Brussels and other
member states. There is more than a hint that ministries in Bonn may have
failed to talk to each other.
Last week the European Commission demanded an explanation from Bonn for its
apparent refusal to implement trade sanctions involving government
telecommunications contracts against the US, unanimously agreed by the 12
member states on June 8.
The trade sanctions are token - affecting about Ecu15m (Pounds 11.85m) of
contracts - but the principle of common action is seen in Brussels as
paramount.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, retorted that Bonn would not
apply the sanctions as it was covered by an 'opt-out clause' written into
the June 8 decision. Brussels professed amazement, and Paris suspected
treachery by its closest EC ally.
The story goes back to October 1990, when Article 29 of the EC's Utilities
Directive was first agreed, giving a 3 per cent price preference for EC
companies when bidding for any government contract.
Germany insisted then a clause be inserted stating this move was 'without
prejudice to (existing) obligations of the EC and its member states towards
third countries'.
A Bonn official said: 'We stated very clearly at the time that this meant
someone who has a treaty with a third country does not need to put this
article into effect.'
The move already contained the seeds of future conflict: some English
translations said the article would apply 'notwithstanding' existing
obligations, instead of 'without prejudice to' them: the German word
unbeschadet can mean both.
The second step came in the wings of the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris,
when Mr Rexrodt stopped to chat to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative. 'It was simply an informal conversation in the sunshine
before lunch,' they say in Bonn. 'This was in no way negotiations.'
Nonetheless, Mr Rexrodt had a point to make. The US was not implementing its
own sanctions against Greece, Spain and Portugal, because they were not
implementing Article 29. So why was Washington imposing sanctions on Bonn?
'Mr Kantor said he didn't know we were not implementing the article. They
went away and checked and found it was true,' says Bonn. 'So Mr Kantor
agreed we would also be excluded (from sanctions).'
The trouble was, he went straight back to Washington, and announced the
'deal'.
The third step came on June 8, when EC foreign ministers agreed without
debate to impose EC sanctions on the US on a handful of public procurement
contracts, in retaliation for the equally token gesture by Washington to
restrict EC access to about Dollars 19m (Pounds 12.3m) of contracts there.
The same clause was inserted in the decision which was in the original
Article 29: it was 'without prejudice to existing obligations'.
'We believed everybody knew what that meant,' a Bonn official said
yesterday. 'But the others did not realise that it applied to Germany.'
Finally, the US asked for the German agreement in writing, and Bonn has
balked at that. It will only give such a statement 'in agreement with the
Commission'. In the current atmosphere, that seems unlikely.

FT  16 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Fokker launches regionaljet with orders
won

FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer 51 per cent owned by Deutsche
Aerospace, yesterday launched the production programme for its new Fokker 70
regional jet, having won Dollars 400m (Pounds 262m) of orders from Indonesia
for the new 79-seat airliner.
The launch orders from the Indonesian carriers Sempati Air and Pelita Air
Services, involving up to 20 aircraft, will also provide Pounds 70m of
business for Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group whose Tay 620 engines
power the new Fokker twin-jet airliner.
The Fokker 70, which made its maiden flight in April, is a smaller
derivative of the Fokker 100, also powered by Rolls-Royce Tays. The fuselage
and tail section of the aircraft are produced by Deutsche Aerospace, the
wings by Short Brothers of Belfast.
The new Fokker aircraft will intensify competition in the regional jet
market, which has been badly hit by the financial troubles of smaller
airlines but is now expected to recover strongly by 1998-2000.
It will compete directly against Avro International, the recently
established regional jet joint-venture company of British Aerospace and
Taiwan Aerospace.
The BAe-Taiwan venture, also unveiled at the Paris Air Show, plans to
develop a lighter version of its RJ70 regional jet, to make it more
competitive with the new Fokker 70.
Rolls-Royce, whose engines have traditionally powered Fokker jets, is now
also trying to break into the Avro RJ market by negotiating with Taiwan
Aerospace its participation in the BR700 regional jet engine programme with
its German partner BMW.
In the large end of the commercial engine market, Rolls-Royce has also
expanded at the air show its risk-sharing partners on the Pounds 400m
development programme of its high-thrust Trent engine. Lucas, UK aerospace
and car components group, is taking a 3.5 per cent share in the Trent
programme.
Bernard Simon reports from Toronto: Air Canada and McDonnell Douglas are to
study the feasibility of modernising the Canadian carrier's ageing fleet of
DC-9 jets as an alternative to replacing them with new aircraft.
Air Canada operates 35 DC-9s, and predicts that the modernisation would add
15 years to their life. The work would include new engines and avionics, and
extensive re-wiring. McDonnell Douglas would provide new warranties for the
aircraft.
The two companies said yesterday that they might open the programme to other
airlines wanting to extend the lives of their DC-9s.

FT  16 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Beijing Jeep is out of the thicket - One
of the first, and therefore 'model', investments in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FRANC Krebs, head of Chrysler's jeep project in China, is in expansionary
mode, as the Americans might say. Having weathered early storms, the
Chrysler joint venture is set for larger production runs, fresh models and
possibly a new 'greenfield' works.
This is a long way from a gloomy period in the mid-1980s when it seemed that
American Motors, the original foreign partner in the Beijing Jeep venture,
was set to walk out over payment delays and staffing disputes: not to
mention a huge cultural and professional divide between American managers
and their Chinese counterparts.
The man who helped save the AMC venture in 1986 was Mr Zhu Rongji, then vice
minister of the State Economic Commission. This is the same reformist Mr Zhu
who has now emerged as senior vice premier in charge of the economy and the
man tipped as a possible future premier.
The well documented Beijing Jeep saga*, marked something of a watershed for
foreign investors in China in the early phase of the country's economic
reform; although many of the problems that bedevilled the AMC project have
certainly not been eradicated.
Because Beijing Jeep was one of the first joint manufacturing ventures in
China it achieved 'model' status. This is probably what helped save it in
the end: desperate to attract foreign investment China could not afford a
'model' failure.
Mr Krebs is cagey about profitability, saying merely that Beijing Jeep has
been profitable for much of its nine years, and he views the period ahead as
promising in a country where demand for vehicles of all sizes and dimensions
is growing by leaps and bounds.
But problems persist, not least access to foreign exchange to pay for kits
and imported machinery at a time of rapid expansion for the Chrysler-Beijing
Auto Works joint venture (BAW is owned by the Beijing municipality).
Chrysler, which took over AMC in 1987, the year after faltering production
began in Beijing, is anxious to keep building up its stake in the local
joint venture to 50 per cent from the present 43 per cent. AMC with an
original investment of Dollars 8m plus technical assistance took an initial
23 per cent share.
Management problems have eased, Mr Krebs says, with a good working
relationship at senior level. However, Chinese middle managers, used to
operating in a strictly hierarchical and authoritarian system, are loath to
show initiative lest they be criticised for possible mistakes.
Another problem, not anticipated by AMC and Chrysler in the early days, is
job mobility. Previously, it was rare for Chinese workers and managers to
change jobs since there was little scope for competition for talent. Now, a
competitive market for skilled labour is developing and Chrysler, like every
other joint venture partner, is caught up in it. 'We tend to gold-plate
people and they leave us,' says Mr Krebs ruefully.
Beijing Jeep produces a range of four-wheel drive vehicles including copies
of primitive Russian-designed military vehicles, plus the Jeep Cherokee
which is proving a hot seller with supply barely keeping pace with demand.
The company is scheduled to produce 37,500 Beijing Jeep 202 models this
year, and 22,500 Cherokees compared with 20,000 in 1992.
Target production for 1995 is 100,000 vehicles for both models, but, as Mr
Krebs observes, the size of the existing plant is placing limitations on
growth. He believes that in time Beijing Jeep will be obliged to look at
establishing a new facility, possibly in southern China at a cost of up to
Dollars 300m.
Sensing an era of greater competition is dawning, Beijing Jeep is, for the
first time, devoting resources to advertising. In the first three months of
this year it spent more on marketing than it did for the whole of 1992.
The company has a network of about 20 dealerships and deliveries of spare
parts are being speeded up. Before, distributors would be obliged to drive
to Beijing every two or three months from outlying provinces to pick up
supplies. Now parts are being delivered 'every week or so' even to remote
areas.
Chrysler, which fell into the China market with the AMC takeover, is
congratulating itself for having a foothold in what is likely to prove a
lucrative, if highly competitive area.
With just 7m vehicles spread thinly among China's 1.1bn population, and with
more than 92 per cent of the country's roads unpaved, the future for Beijing
Jeep would seem to be secure, even buoyant.

FT  16 JUN 93 / High hopes of Brazil's latest plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S latest economic plan, the seventh in as many years and the second
in just two months, has been met by a mixture of approval and
disappointment, summed up by a cartoon on the front of yesterday's O Globo
newspaper.
It shows Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, clad in white
leather and bursting into a saloon with guns waving. But when he fires, only
a disappointing little 'pam' sound emerges.
Mr Cardoso describes the plan, unveiled on Monday night, as 'the start of a
new attitude'. The plano verdade (real plan) consists of a federal
government spending cut equivalent to Dollars 6bn and various
revenue-raising measures aimed to 'put the government's house in order'.
The plan was welcomed by business as the first to begin attacking the public
deficit, rather than interfering with the private sector. The main Sao Paulo
stock exchange index rose initially by 5.2 per cent but fell later to close
1.6 per cent up.
But there was a general feeling that the measures did not go far enough, and
would not bridge this year's Dollars 12bn budget deficit or reduce
inflation, now above 30 per cent a month.
Mr Igor Cornelsen, director of Chartered West LB in Sao Paulo, said: 'For
the first time, we have a plan aiming at the heart of the inflationary
process - the public accounts.
However, while the diagnosis is right and the medicine good, it is nowhere
near the dosage sufficient for a lasting cure.'
The plan, which needs congressional approval, has six main points.
Faster privatisation.
A crackdown on tax evasion, with offenders to be jailed for the first time.
Suspension of transfers to states and municipalities so as to make them
start repaying the Dollars 40bn-plus they owe the federal government.
Stricter controls on state banks and auditing of the Banco do Brasil and the
National Savings Bank, with possible job cuts and branch closures.
A new cheque tax (awaiting congressional approval).
Commitment to reduce interest rates.
Many economists said they would like to have seen bolder measures, such as
the announcement of a major privatisation, the closure of bankrupt state
banks or more autonomy for the central bank.
Mr Jose Lus Miranda, president of Banco Interatlantico, said: 'This plan is
just buying time to set the preconditions for a successful shock'.
Finance ministry officials argue that it is the only realistic course. In
his impassioned televised address to the nation, Mr Cardoso said: 'I'm no
superman, I'm just an ordinary citizen. I come not with promises and
illusions but the hard truth that inflation will not end from one day to the
next.'
The government has little scope for cuts because the constitution requires
that much of its Dollars 240bn (Pounds 155.80bn) budget go to local
governments, interest payments and wages. The government can operate on just
Dollars 14bn, which is where it is cutting the Dollars 6bn.
Mr Cardoso's plan is seen as the government's last chance tor curb inflation
before elections next year. He says its success now depends on widespread
co-operation.

A SENIOR Cuban official yesterday signalled his government's willingness to
discuss reparations for US properties nationalised by the communist
Caribbean country in the 1960s, agencies report from Havana and Mexico City.
Mr Ernesto Melendez, chairman of the committee on economic co-operation,
said in an interview with the Cuban magazine Contactos that such discussions
could occur as part of negotiations over normalising US-Cuban relations.
He said Cuba had 'never refused to include the theme of mutual claims in the
agenda of eventual negotiations'.
The US State Department has said 5,911 Americans lost Dollars 1.8bn by the
nationalisations, and it reckons the total to have grown, with inflation and
interest, to Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn.
At a ceremony near Havana yesterday, Cuba bade farewell to the last members
of an ex-Soviet motorised infantry brigade being withdrawn under a bilateral
accord.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Slower US inflation eases fears over interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US CONSUMER prices rose by 0.1 per cent last month, and by 3.2 per cent in
the year to May, providing further evidence that inflationary pressures are
moderating, the Labour Department reported yesterday.
Following last week's report that wholesale prices were flat last month, the
figures all but eliminated residual fears on Wall Street that the Federal
Reserve might opt for an early increase in interest rates.
Also, the Commerce Department reported the US current account deficit
declined to Dollars 20.9bn (Pounds 13.5bn) in the first quarter, compared
with Dollars 23.7bn in the final period of last year.
The improvement - which occurred in spite of a rise in the merchandise trade
deficit - mainly reflected an increased surplus on services and a rise in
net investment income.
Most analysts are predicting relatively subdued inflation figures throughout
the summer, reflecting an unwinding of distortions which had pushed up the
indices earlier this year.
If the figures remain encouraging, the Fed is unlikely to tighten monetary
policy before the autumn, in spite of its reported shift to a bias towards
raising interest rates.
Compared with April's 0.4 per cent increase, the small overall rise in
consumer prices masked big sectoral differences. Prices of energy and
clothing dropped 1 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively between April and
May. But prices of many services rose sharply, with medical prices up 0.8
per cent following a 0.6 per cent gain in April.
The 'core' consumer price index, which excludes the volatile components of
food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 3.4 per cent in the
year to May.

THE US Food and Drug Administration has warned US consumers that they should
take precautions before drinking canned Diet Pepsi, after syringes were
found in a number of cans in Washington state and Louisiana.
The product-tampering surfaced in the Seattle area, where two incidents were
reported last week. Three cans containing syringes were subsequently
reported in New Orleans. A further case, involving a can of Diet Coke,
emerged in California yesterday but a hoax was suspected.
Mr David Kessler, commissioner of the FDA which is investigating the
incidents, advised consumers to empty Pepsi into a glass or cup before
drinking. PepsiCo said it had no plans to recall products and that there
appeared to be no connection between the Seattle and New Orleans cases.
PepsiCo shares fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 on Wall Street yesterday.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Clinton makes strong defence of his record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday launched a vigorous defence of his
management of domestic and foreign affairs, claiming that his presidency was
'the most decisive you've had in a very long time on all the big issues that
matter'.
He called a press conference less than 24 hours after angrily terminating
one on Monday because he was offended by a question about the process by
which he had chosen Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to fill the vacancy on the
Supreme Court. This time he offered a joking olive branch and the first
question to the TV reporter who had so upset him.
Declaring 'there is no wavering', he cited in evidence a long catalogue of
achievements from the first budget resolution through the decline in
unemployment to aid to Russia. 'People would have said at Christmas-time
that that's a pretty good and decisive record.'
He argued he was 'confident' that recent economic progress - he cited lower
inflation and the 755,000 jobs created so far in his presidency - would
continue if Congress passed a deficit-reduction plan increasing investment
and fairly sharing the burden of sacrifice. His budget, he insisted, was
'the first taken seriously in this town for a dozen years'.
He conceded he did not agree with all the proposed changes to his package
now being considered by the Senate finance committee. But he expected the
Senate and subsequently the whole Congress to pass a bill in which tax
increases were matched by equal spending cuts. 'In the end,' he said,
echoing his campaign theme of last year, 'this is a jobs package'.
In the budgetary context, he promised announcements soon on the space
station and the supercollider, two multi-billion dollar projects that could
be cut by Congress. He appeared sympathetic to both, while allowing for the
possibility of lower funding.
He said politicians keen to promote other projects should think 'for a long
time' about reducing the US investment and qualitative edge in space,
science and technology. He particularly noted that the space station, now
subject to a less ambitious schedule, 'offers us the potential to work with
other countries,' most obviously Russia.
Mr Clinton was clearly encouraged by the overwhelming approval accorded the
Ginsburg nomination, which may even be approved by the Senate before the
summer recess. His only 'regret' about the protracted selection process were
'leaks' that may have exposed other candidates, specifically Mr Bruce
Babbitt, the interior secretary, and Judge Stephen Breyer from
Massachusetts, to more public scrutiny than should have been the case.
He had not, he said, 'hung them out to dry'.
Finally Mr Clinton reacted robustly to the derogatory remarks made about him
by Major-General Harold Campbell of the US air force in the Netherlands. The
Defence Department confirmed that the general had described him as
'gay-loving, pot smoking, draft dodging and womanising'.
Mr Clinton said: 'Personally, I didn't care, it had no impact on me. . . but
for a general officer to say that about the commander-in-chief. . . is a
very bad thing.'

charges. He was impeached last December over alleged involvement in a
kickback scheme said to have made him Dollars 51m (Pounds 33.1m). He denied
any wrongdoing and claimed the money was the remains of his campaign chest

<TEXT>
JUDGE Ruth Bader Ginsburg yesterday began a round of courtesy calls in the
Senate, amid guarded predictions that she could be confirmed as the next
Supreme Court justice before the congressional summer recess.
Her nomination by President Bill Clinton on Monday has been greeted by
widespread approval; no apparent obstacles to her confirmation have
immediately surfaced.
Even pro-choice advocates in the abortion debate, recognising Judge
Ginsburg's long career as an advocate of women's rights, have qualified
their initial reservations about her stand on Roe vs Wade, the 1973 court
ruling guaranteeing freedom of reproductive choice.
Ms Kate Michelman, head of the national abortion rights league, said she
looked forward to hearing Judge Ginsburg's explanation of a recent speech,
in which she had said that the ruling may have prolonged political
divisiveness. Ms Michelman said that the judge would represent an
improvement on the attitudes of the man she is to replace at the court,
Justice Byron White, a Catholic who generally voted for curbs on abortion.
Judge Ginsburg's reputation on the federal appeals bench as a consensus
builder, an attribute complimented by Mr Clinton, seems to have reassured
Republicans and Democrats alike.
It is generally assumed she will strengthen the divided court's centre,
represented by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David
Souter.
Even so, the process by which the president arrived at her nomination, after
an 88-day search, was still attracting criticism, as was his angry
termination of a news conference after the first question had suggested he
was prone to 'a zig-zag quality' when making up his mind.
Mr Clinton said yesterday he had no animus towards the media and, at his
latest news conference, offered an olive branch to the TV reporter who had
so annoyed him.
As for print media, an editorial in the New York Times said he was
'intemperate', the Washington Post blamed the 'running commentary from the
White House' on candidates for the court job, and the Wall Street Journal,
in typical ideological vein, wondered about 'the intellectual self-paralysis
of both Bill Clinton and modern liberalism.'

figures all but eliminated residual fears on Wall Street that the Federal
Reserve might opt for an early increase in interest rates.
President Bill Clinton said the inflation figures were part of a broader
improvement in economic conditions. At a Washington press conference he said
employment had risen noticeably in recent months and mortgage rates were at
a 20-year low.
But he warned that the economy would not continue to do well unless Congress
soon passed his deficit-cutting economic plan.
'The continuation of this trend depends on our ability to pass a strong
economic programme through the Congress which reduces the deficit, increases
investment in our future and is fair,' he said.
In a separate report the Commerce Department said the US current account
deficit declined to Dollars 20.9bn (Pounds 13.5bn) in the first quarter
compared with Dollars 23.7bn in the final period of last year.
The improvement - which occurred in spite of a rise in the merchandise trade
deficit - mainly reflected an increased surplus on services and a rise in
net investment income.
Most analysts are predicting relatively subdued inflation figures throughout
the summer, reflecting an unwinding of distortions which pushed up the
indices earlier this year. A sharp cut in tobacco prices has yet to be
reflected in consumer prices.
If the figures remain encouraging, the Fed is unlikely to tighten monetary
policy before the autumn in spite of its reported shift to a bias towards
raising interest rates.
Compared with April's 0.4% increase the small overall rise in consumer
prices masked big sectoral differences. Prices of energy and clothing
dropped 1 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively between April and May. But
prices of many services rose sharply, with medical prices up 0.8 per cent
following a 0.6 per cent gain in April.
The 'core' consumer price index, which excludes the volatile components of
food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 3.4 per cent in the
year to May.

A CANADIAN court has imposed a CDollars 2m (Pounds 1m) fine on Chemagro, a
Montreal-based insecticide company owned by Bayer, the German chemicals
group, for a price-fixing conspiracy.
This is the heaviest penalty ever imposed under Canada's competition law. It
marks the first conviction under a provision which prohibits
foreign-directed conspiracies designed to lessen competition in Canada.
The case involved sales of various chemical and biological insecticides used
in forests. Chemagro pleaded guilty to several charges of colluding with
other suppliers, both within Canada and abroad, to fix prices on supplies of
these chemicals sold to provincial governments and the private sector.
Price-fixing was orchestrated outside Canada by Bayer and Sumitomo Chemicals
of Japan. Sumitomo's case is still before the attorney-general.

THE party trailing in Nigeria's presidential election, the National
Republican Convention (NRC), has alleged rigging and called for fresh
voting, Reuter reports from Lagos.
Meanwhile, Mr Arthur Nzeribe, a millionaire behind the Association for a
Better Nigeria which wants military rule extended, said it had won a court
order barring the electoral commission (NEC) from announcing the result of
Saturday's poll.
On Thursday, the group had won a temporary injunction to delay the poll, but
this was over-ruled by the NEC.
The contest was between two millionaire Moslem businessmen, Mr Moshood
Abiola of the Social Democratic party, whose predictions of clear victory
have been borne out by results so far, and Mr Bashir Tofa of the NRC.

<TEXT>
SENIOR members of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party, who claim to be
wrestling with their consciences over political reform, yesterday grappled
physically with each other in an unseemly, unscheduled bout in Japan's
corridors of power.
In one corner were the reformers, frustrated by the LDP's reluctance to
change a scandal-prone political system, and in the other were officials who
have prospered from the present system and fear that change would threaten
their political privileges.
The two sides confronted each other outside the party room in the Japanese
parliament (Diet), and within range of the television cameras, giving
Japanese viewers a ringside seat and providing them with vivid documentary
evidence of the urgent need for political reform.
After pushing, shoving, headlocks and half-nelsons, the LDP party meeting
convened. It decided not to make a decision on political reform, passing the
responsibility to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and four other
party elders.
The argument is over whether the current multi-seat constituencies, which
are prone to manipulation by party factions, should be replaced by a
single-seat system, by proportional representation, or by a cocktail of the
two. Tougher controls are also proposed for political funding.
Mr Miyazawa, who has delegated all responsibility in the issue, is now
confronted by the need to make a clear statement either deferring reform or
extending the present parliamentary session. His colleague, Mr Seiroku
Kajiyama, the LDP's secretary-general and head-counter, has conveniently
suggested that the debate be delayed for at least two years.
But the previously favoured tactic of putting reform on permanent hold may
not work, as the Social Democratic party of Japan, the largest opposition
party, has promised to launch a no-confidence motion against the government
before the parliamentary session ends on Sunday.
Under normal circumstances, the LDP would easily have the numbers to defeat
such a motion. But a pro-reform LDP faction headed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the
former finance minister, claimed to have enough support yesterday to tip the
balance against Mr Miyazawa by abstaining from the vote.
Mr Miyazawa has said he will call an election if the LDP loses the vote, and
the SDPJ said yesterday: 'We are not afraid of an election.' Suddenly the
prime minister, who hoped to have his prestige untarnished by remaining
above the fray, may have to make a decision.

NIGERIANS waited anxiously yesterday for official confirmation that business

reports from Lagos. The National Electoral Commission said it was carefully
checking results from Nigeria's 30 states before announcing the winner of
Saturday's poll.
Leading newspapers were in no doubt, reflecting victory claims by Mr Abiola
and his Social Democratic party. 'Abiola surges ahead,' said the Daily

It said he was set for victory over the only other candidate, fellow-Moslem
millionaire Mr Bashir Tofa. Mr Tofa and his National Republican Convention
members started moves to try to get Mr Abiola disqualified on a

FT  16 JUN 93 / Cambodian secessionist leader seeks refuge
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCE Norodom Chakrapong, leader of a five-day-old Cambodian secessionist
movement, took refuge in Vietnam yesterday in a move which apparently
heralds the end of his 'autonomous zone' in the east of the country, United
Nations officials said.
A UN military observer saw the prince and his followers drive over the
border in Svay Rieng province in a convoy of 20 vehicles and hand their
weapons to Vietnamese border guards. Prince Chakrapong, a deputy prime
minister in the communist government installed by Vietnam in 1979, had
announced the secession in protest at the outcome of the UN-organised
election last month.
The ruling Cambodian People's party won only 51 of the 120 seats in a new
constituent assembly, compared with 58 taken by the royalist opposition
party Funcinpec led by Prince Ranariddh, Prince Chakrapong's estranged
half-brother. The CPP said it was the victim of 'massive irregularities' in
the polling, but UN and international observers certified the election as
free and fair.
Prince Chakrapong's attempt to defy the UN and fragment the country further
(the Khmer Rouge runs its own zone on the Thai border) was undermined by the
evident lack of public support.
UN officials, foreign diplomats and Cambodians yesterday welcomed the
retreat of Prince Chakrapong, who has long been regarded as one of the most
unsavoury members of the corrupt communist administration.
Their optimism was tempered, however, by the knowledge that the CPP
leadership in Phnom Penh initially winked at Prince Chakrapong's stance and
is still challenging the results of the election. Hundreds of terrorised
Funcinpec party workers are reported to have fled to Phnom Penh from the
east.
Members of the new assembly, convened on Monday, are supposed to write a
constitution and form a new government within three months.
Mr Hun Sen, the prime minister, is now dissociating himself from the
secessionists and was credited on Monday with persuading his brother Mr Hun
Neng, governor of the populous province of Kompong Cham, to bring it back
under central government control.
Mr Uch Kiman, a government spokesman, said yesterday that four of the seven
provinces in the 'autonomous zone' were not even aware that they had been
included.
Prince Ranariddh portrayed the issue as a political dispute rather than an
argument between princes.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Technical factors cut trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S customs-cleared trade surplus dipped slightly in May largely as a
result of temporary technical factors, according to figures released by the
Finance Ministry.
Nevertheless, the 0.1 per cent fall in the surplus in May, to Dollars 7.7bn
(Pounds 5bn), will be welcomed by the Japanese government as evidence that
the surplus is reaching its peak after growing for almost two and a half
years.
The fall may help to defuse tensions between the Japanese and US governments
during talks in the next few weeks about measures to reduce the surplus. The
talks are due to come to a head before the Tokyo summit of Group of Seven
leading industrialised countries in the first week of July.
However, news of the decline did little to stem the continued rise of the
yen against the dollar. In Tokyo trading the dollar closed at Y105.03, down
from its Monday close of Y105.20, after it had briefly touched a new low of
Y104.83 in the morning.
The yen's strength hit the Tokyo stock market Nikkei index which fell by
351.47, or about 1.7 per cent, to 20,045.88. The market's fall was a
reflection of the damage a higher yen may do to the profits of Japanese
exporters.
The yen's continued strength, combined with the stock market's fall close to
the critical 20,000 mark, will increase pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut
interest rates.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, on Monday ruled out an interest
rate cut to prevent the yen rising. However, the central bank announced
yesterday it would hold a meeting of its regional branch managers on July 5
and 6. These meetings have paved the way for a cut in the discount rate in
the past.
Mr Tadashi Okuda, chairman of the Federation of Bankers' Associations,
called on the monetary authorities to make 'timely and flexible' responses
to the yen's surge after warning that the stronger yen threatened to dash
hopes of an economic recovery.
The drop in Japan's merchandise trade surplus was because of a faster growth
of imports. Exports in May rose 5.6 per cent from the same month last year
to Dollars 26.85bn, while imports rose 8.2 per cent to Dollars 19.12bn.
Japan's trade surplus with the US fell by 2.1 per cent from the year before
to Dollars 2.77bn.
Finance Ministry officials said the fall was because of fewer working days
in May compared with the same month last year, as well as longer vacations
taken during the 'golden week' holidays. These cuts helped to reduce
exports.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, Britain's prime minister, has called a meeting of his
cabinet's Hong Kong committee for July 1 amid signs that the British
government is losing patience with China over talks about the colony's
political development.
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, will fly to London at the end of the
month for the meeting, which officials say is likely to prove significant in
determining the British government's policy towards Sino-British talks.
According to one official: 'What ministers want to know is: Are these talks
a total waste of time?'
Mr Patten's assessment is seen as pivotal in shaping the government's
attitude towards the talks. The first four rounds of negotiations produced
no significant developments and in the session which ends today little
progress appears to have been made.
A Foreign Office official said yesterday that by the time the cabinet
sub-committee meeting was held a sixth round of talks might have taken place
and 'by then we should have an idea of where they are going or not'. The
objective the cabinet committee agreed to at its meeting in April was for
Sino-British talks to be concluded by the end of July. 'This timetable
either has to be reinforced or shifted,' the official said. 'The committee
is unlikely to approve of policy being made by a process of drift.'
Next month's meeting will bring together Mr Major, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary.
It comes at a time of increasing restiveness among Hong Kong pro-democracy
groups who feel that Mr Patten is backtracking on his commitment to broaden
democracy before Britain returns sovereignty to China in 1997.
The committee, which last met at easter when Mr Patten was in London, is
however likely to approve the continuation of talks until the autumn and
then decide whether to continue or pull out and present Mr Patten's
legislative programme to the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's law-making
body.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Bankruptcy rate falls in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST fall in Japanese corporate bankruptcies for almost three years
yesterday added weight to claims that the Japanese economy is nearing the
bottom of its two-year downturn.
Corporate bankruptcies in May fell by 3.9 per cent from the same month last
year to 1,113, according to a monthly report by the Teikoku Data Bank, a
private research group. The report said the decline in the bankruptcy rate,
the first for 32 months, was a tentative indicator of a moderate pick-up in
the economy.
If May's decline in bankruptcies does mark the bottom of the recession it
means Japanese business will have escaped with far fewer failures than
during the mid-1980s.
During the weak economic patch of the mid-1980s caused by the yen's sudden
appreciation against the dollar, the business failure rate rose to about
20,000 a year. During this downturn the failure rate has not risen above
14,000 a year.
The Teikoku report will fuel the debate within Japan about whether the
recession is bottoming out. The government's Economic Planning Agency last
week announced the economy had hit the bottom, a claim which the Industry
Ministry has fiercely disputed and the Bank of Japan failed to support in
its quarterly economic survey published last week.
However, the fall in the overall rate of bankruptcies masks important
changes in the causes of business failures. The number of bankruptcies
caused by the recession rose by 33 per cent to to 676, while bankruptcies
caused by financial factors linked to the collapse of the bubble economy
fell markedly.
An ominous sign was the first appearance since 1987 of bankruptcies caused
by the yen's appreciation against the dollar, which is hitting Japanese
exporters. There were three bankruptcies in May caused by the yen's rise.
The recession is increasingly claiming larger companies, such as Hanix
Kogyo, the construction equipment maker which failed recently. The combined
liabilities of bankrupt companies rose by 15.7 per cent in May to Y661.2bn
(Pounds 4.1bn) compared with the same month last year. The average debts of
bankrupt companies were Y594m, about 21 per cent up on the previous year.
Other economic indicators published yesterday supported the Bank of Japan's
caution about the economy as long as private consumption and corporate
investment remains subdued. Sales at Tokyo department stores were 9.3 per
cent down in May compared with the same month last year, the 15th
consecutive monthly fall.
Private sector machinery orders in April fell 26.8 per cent from the
previous month to Y786.9bn, a fall of 18.5 per cent from April last year.
This brings to an end a brief revival in machinery orders in the early
months of the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAWI opposition groups yesterday claimed victory in a referendum over the
one-party rule of President-for-life Kamuzu Banda and demanded he step aside
for a coalition government of national unity, Reuter reports from Blantyre.
Unofficial counts by the United Democratic Front (UDF) which it said were
based on returns by more than half the registered voters, gave between 73
and 86 per cent of the poll to those campaigning for western-style
dem-ocracy.
In a speech to hundreds of cheering, singing supporters at his headquarters
in Blantyre, Mr Bakili Muluzito, UDF leader, formally claimed victory in
mid-afternoon.
But independent analysts cautioned that many votes remained to be counted,
particularly in conservative, remote rural areas ripe for intimidation. They
pointed to sweeping successes by Mr Banda in the central region, where his
ruling Malawi Congress party (MCP) appeared to be taking 70 per cent of
votes. The opposition seemed to be registering landslides in the south, the
most populous area, and the north.
But some United Nations monitors said privately the opposition appeared to
be heading for a convincing win.
Mr Chakufwa Chihana, newly-freed trade unionist leader of the Alliance for
Democracy (Aford), which teamed with the UDF to fight Mr Banda, told
reporters in the capital Lilongwe that Mr Banda should resign as life
president of the MCP and become the figurehead of a transitional government
to prepare for multi-party elections.
'He no longer has the support of the country. We will give him a smooth
exit,' he said. 'Banda should call on me as executive prime minister to form
a council of ministers drawn from Aford, the UDF and the MCP.'

THE TENTH round of the Middle East peace talks began in Washington yesterday
with the disclosure that President Bill Clinton and President Hafez al-Assad
of Syria have exchanged letters, presumably on the future status of the
Golan Heights.
A senior US official returning from Europe with Mr Warren Christopher, the
secretary of state, was quoted as saying that the exchanges were 'very
substantive,' but declined to furnish details.
They may cover possible US guarantees that the Golan Heights, if returned to
Syria, not be used as a base for attacks on Israel, as well as how much
territory Israel might be persuaded to give up.
The chief Syrian negotiator, Mr Muwaffiq al-Allaf, insisted yesterday that
Israel must surrender all the Golan Heights, seized in the 1967 war, or
accept responsibility for the breakdown of the peace talks.
His Israeli counterpart, ambassador Mr Itamar Rabinovich, said Israel had
told Syria it accepted 'the element of withdrawal' as part of the
peacemaking process but would not address 'the extent of the withdrawal
until certain questions are answered'.
Bilateral contacts between the US and other delegations have been frequent.
Mr Christopher conferred in Vienna, where he addressed the UN human rights
conference, with the Syrian, Egyptian and Israeli foreign ministers.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali warlord accused of directing an
ambush that led to the deaths of 23 Pakistani United Nations soldiers, will
be arrested and brought to trial if an official inquiry confirms the
allegations, the UN said yesterday.
Mr Kofi Annan, under-secretary general for UN peacekeeping operations, told
reporters: 'Whoever is found responsible will be apprehended, whether
general or foot soldier.'
The investigation ordered by the UN Security Council following the June 5
incident was continuing and if Gen Aideed were held responsible, an attempt
would be made 'to bring him in' perhaps to appear before an ad hoc Somali
tribunal.
At a press conference called to explain the bloody incident last weekend in
which many Somali civilians were killed by Pakistani troops, Mr Annan said
that non-lethal riot control methods had been considered. The situation 'got
out of control' when Somali demonstrators tried to tear down a UN barricade.

the construction crews with machine-guns, mortars and a heat-seeking
missile.
Nine men were killed in the raids which were meant to prevent the government
from bringing an all-weather road to the remote Tirah Valley, the home of
poppy fields and scores of heroin laboratories.
Officials have stopped the building work while they try to persuade local
village chiefs to guarantee the workmen safe passage.
The tribesmen of the Khyber Pass have never taken kindly to outsiders on
their territory, as the British colonial rulers discovered a century ago.
But today the weaponry at their disposal enables them to project their power
beyond the mountains lying on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
While the poppies are mostly grown on the Afghan side of the border, the
profits accrue to dealers who are mainly Pakistanis. Their fortress-like
homes dot the road along the Khyber Pass. Outside there are watchtowers;
inside, opulent houses decked in marble.
The dealers' influence reaches into Afghanistan through the guerrilla
commanders who need drugs money for buying arms and ammunition. It also
penetrates far into Pakistan, distorting the country's economy and politics.
The shock of violent incidents such as the Tirah road attacks, the swelling
population of drug addicts in Pakistan and strong pressure from the US and
other developed countries is at last forcing some officials to admit to the
scale of the drug lords' influence.
At a recent UN-sponsored drug abuse conference in Islamabad delegates from
Pakistan concluded: 'The massive inflows of money financed by drugs have
given birth to a new political situation in Pakistan. . . . The profits
generated from illicit narcotics activity have contributed to a huge black
economy, half the size of the official one.'
Poppies have been grown in Afghanistan for centuries, but never in the past
on a large scale. The tribesmen preferred marijuana, and heroin was
virtually unknown until the advent of war in Afghanistan in 1979.
But in the last decade a region which encompasses eastern Iran, Afghanistan
and Pakistan has become the world's second largest producer of illegal opium
with an estimated 1,115 tonnes last year, mostly in Afghanistan, according
to US government figures. This is well short of the 2,500 tonnes produced in
south-east Asia, including Burma's Golden Triangle. But south-east Asian
output is falling, albeit slightly: Afghan farmers are rapidly increasing
their production. This year's crop is estimated to be 20 to 50 per cent
higher than 1992's.
The initial stimulus for increasing output came from a crackdown on
opium-growing in Middle Eastern countries, including Turkey and Iran. The
war in Afghanistan then prompted anti-Soviet mujahideen guerrillas to raise
production and to invest in heroin laboratories to increase their revenues
to buy arms. The fight against communism was seen as so important that
officials in Pakistan, from where many mujahideen were supplied, turned a
blind eye to the proliferation of heroin.
Despite the Soviet withdrawal, the mujahideen groups still need money
because they are now fighting each other. Elsewhere in the country, peace
has permitted farmers to go back into their war-ravaged fields.
Mr Habimullah Khan, a farmer in eastern Afghanistan, says villagers have no
choice about growing poppies since they bring ten times as much money as
other crops. 'This year we planted more poppies than before. Next year we
will plant even more,' he says.
Moreover, the collapse of the Soviet Union has eased the drug smugglers'
transport problem. The traditional route has been south through Pakistan to
the port city of Karachi and from there by air and by boat to the rest of
the world. But the borders of the former Soviet republics in central Asia
have opened up to trade - so trucks laden with legitimate goods such as
dried fruit are being used to smuggle heroin into Russia and from Russia
into western Europe.
Dealers in the tribal areas lying on the border with Afghanistan dominate
the trade. Under agreements dating back to Pakistan's birth as an
independent state in 1947, the government's writ does not run in the tribal
areas. Instead, they are administered by tribal chiefs, who choose which
laws, if any, they will apply.
Plentiful handouts from the drug dealers ensure that anti-narcotics laws are
enforced weakly, if at all. Mr Altaf Gauhar, editor of the Muslim, a leading
Pakistani newspaper, alleges that almost all the politicians representing
the tribal areas in the national assembly in Islamabad are drug smugglers.
A frequent target of such accusations is Mr Haji Ayub Afridi, a former truck
driver turned millionaire businessman and politician who owns the largest of
the forts on the Khyber Pass. Mr Afridi's house was raided two years ago in
the course of a drugs investigation. But neither then nor later was any
evidence found linking him to narcotics smuggling. He denies any involvement
in the trade.
A study commissioned by the US Central Intelligence Agency this year found
that heroin trading had penetrated 'the highest political circles' in
Islamabad and named as a suspected drug smuggler Mr Sohail Zia Butt, a
brother-in-law of the prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif.
Alleged dealers are also active at the top of the business community in
Karachi. There are many suspected top drug dealers in investigators' files
but officials cannot act for lack of firm evidence. Western anti-drugs
experts retort that evidence is lacking because of the drug lords' political
protection. 'They are allowed to work behind screens,' said one.
Mr Ralph Seccombe, Pakistan field adviser for the United Nations drug
control programme, says the whole country is already paying the price for
permitting drug dealers to flourish. 'Pakistan has over 1m addicts. That's
6m people who are affected if you include their families. But it's 100m who
are suffering from the political and economic consequences.'

THE Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, yesterday called for a
referendum on Ukraine's constitutional structure and early parliamentary
elections.
Mr Kravchuk's proposal, which was immediately rejected by parliament but is
scheduled to be put to the vote again today, is in part a reaction to the
political demands of striking coal miners in the Donbass region of eastern
Ukraine.
Like Russia's president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, who was strengthened by Russia's
April referendum, Mr Kravchuk is playing for high stakes. He said he would
interpret a no vote in the proposed ballot, to be held sometime this year,
as a public expression of no confidence and would step down.
However, like Mr Yeltsin, the unpopular Ukrainian leader is gambling on
receiving a public endorsement which would strengthen his hand in the bitter
struggle between the various branches of government in Ukraine.
Mr Kravchuk's nemesis, Mr Leonid Kuchma, the prime minister, also raised the
stakes yesterday, suggesting that he will seek emergency powers over the
economy even greater than those he asked for - and was refused - in May.
Mr Kuchma said that the Ukrainian economy would collapse unless one branch
of government is given nearly absolute control.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's constitutional convention will adjourn today for a
10-day break during which experts are likely to try to come up with either a
compromise draft constitution or temporary rules for new elections.
President Yeltsin had earlier set the convention a June 16 deadline to
finalise a draft constitution.
However, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, announcing
yesterday that the convention would resume on June 26, said that the top
priority of the presidential camp was early parliamentary elections.
For this purpose, an electoral bloc was being formed with the aim of uniting
all the country's pro-reformist forces to win as many seats as possible in a
new parliament. Founders of the bloc include Mr Yeltsin's closest colleagues
and leaders of the radical democrat movement, and will be led by the Russian
president himself.
The president is also expected soon to order the creation of a conciliatory
commission to work on the presidential and parliamentary drafts for a new
constitution between now and next week.
Meanwhile, a number of influential delegates at the convention yesterday
began circulating a plan for a new constitution to be adopted by a
newly-elected parliament, instead of the existing Congress of People's
Deputies.
The plan includes rules for early parliamentary elections and a temporary
division of powers between president and parliament.
This temporary move would be until a new parliament adopts a new
constitution setting out all these provisions. 'An election campaign is
already under way in Russia,' Mr Gennady Burbulis, a close ally of Mr
Yeltsin, told reporters yesterday.
While recognising that the existing parliament is unlikely to adopt a new
constitution, the plan for new elections would also have to be approved by
the Congress of People's Deputies in order to be constitutional.
The Congress is unlikely to agree to its own dissolution, however, leaving
the president with the choice of violating the existing constitution unless
he can get deputies to change their mind.
A group of 315 deputies is already trying to gain signatures of another 30
deputies so it can threaten to resign and deprive Congress of a quorum
unless it agrees to vote itself out of office.

THE military commanders of the three warring communities in Bosnia yesterday
agreed on a ceasefire, to take effect today, as fighting intensified
throughout the republic.
Previous agreements, however, have collapsed almost immediately and there
was little optimism that the latest one would last.
Even as the three military chiefs met at Butmir airport in Sarajevo, fresh
clashes were reported on most battle fronts in the country.
Sarajevo radio said at least eight people were killed in Gorazde, a besieged
United Nations-designated 'safe area' in south-eastern Bosnia. Serb forces
have been on the offensive for three weeks near the town, which is the last
Moslem stronghold in the region.
Bosnian Serb forces are reportedly poised to seize Gorazde, flagrantly
violating its UN status.
Meanwhile, the UN was yesterday forced to suspend its humanitarian airlift
to Sarajevo after gunfire erupted close to incoming aircraft, officials
said. But they added that flights could be resumed today.

push for an end to deadlock

INTERNATIONAL mediators for former Yugoslavia meet leaders of the warring
parties today in Geneva in an increasingly desperate search for workable
political solutions that will end the violence in Bosnia.
Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, ack-nowledged yesterday that
there was no alternative to the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia on the
table, though it was clear there would have to be 'adjustments'.
Lord Owen, and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, for the United Nations, said they
expected the Geneva meetings to pave the way for a reconvened international
conference on former Yugoslavia, probably in the Swiss city, which would
bring together the participants in last August's high-level London
conference.
However, in Vienna, the Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, said his
beleaguered government would refuse to take part in any further big
conferences on Bosnia and urged the international community to let Moslems
defend themselves against Serbs.
Mr Izetbegovic, who was attending the UN World Conference on Human Rights,
said: 'We will ask the Security Council to accept the Vance-Owen plan as an
international document. We will not accept any more theatres of
negotiations.'
As the main representatives of the parties to the Bosnian conflict arrived
for their fresh round of talks in Geneva, Lord Owen denied that the former
Yugoslav republic was about to be 'carved up' between Serbia and Croatia.
'As far as a carve-up, the world community will not accept this. Whatever
changes take place and whatever adjustments there are, there has to be a
fair solution for all three constituent peoples - and that includes, very
importantly, the largest single grouping which is the Moslem population,' he
said.
First to arrive in Geneva were the presidents of Croatia and Serbia, Mr
Franjo Tudjman and Mr Slobodan Milosevic, bringing with them Mr Mate Boban
and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leaders of Bosnia's Croats and Serbs
respectively. UN officials said they did not think Mr Izetbegovic would be
arriving from the Vienna human rights meeting until today.
During a news conference in the Austrian capital, Mr Izetbegovic said that
the international community had tied the hands of the Bosnian Moslems by
refusing to supply them with arms.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said again yesterday that lifting the
arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems may be the only way to bring a
permanent end to the war.
Mr Clinton said that the option of lifting the arms embargo was still on the
table even though Russia, France and Britain had rejected his earlier
proposal to do so.
The Vienna human rights conference unanimously endorsed an impassioned
appeal by Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister, for immediate
action by the UN to end atrocities in Bosnia.
He called on the conference 'to stop the genocide in at least one town'. He
was referring to the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, which has been declared a
'safe area' by the UN but which is besieged by Serb forces.
Another speaker at the Vienna gathering yesterday was Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the
Russian foreign minister. He said Moscow was willing to send troops to
protect Moslem enclaves in Bosnia provided there was a clear framework and
mandate from the UN Security Council. Russian troops, however, would not be
sent to 'besieged fortresses under fire'.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, has recommended the
deployment of at least another 7,500 troops to join the 9,000 assigned to
protecting aid convoys.

   BAKU, AZERBAIJAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AZERBAIJAN'S Brezhnev era KGB and communist party chief, Mr Heidar Aliyev,
made a remarkable political comeback yesterday, winning election as chairman
of the former Soviet republic's parliament.
The election makes Mr Aliyev, 70, nominally the second most powerful leader
to Azerbaijan President Abulfaz Elchibey.
But diplomats and other foreign observers in Baku, the capital, believe that
the wily Mr Aliyev has carved himself out a significant chunk of Mr
Elchibey's power and that new elections are likely. Given the present
despondent political mood, Mr Aliyev probably would be Azerbaijan's
strongest presidential candidate.
The political and economic deterioration was demonstrated when Baku
newspapers yesterday announced that Mr Elchibey had postponed complete
introduction of Azerbaijan's new currency, the manat.
The government, which began circulating the manat on June 2, had announced
that the rouble would be invalidated on June 15, but the move now has been
delayed at least until July 1. 'We need to wait until the situation
stabilises. As soon as that happens, the reforms will take place,' said Mr
Elman Rustamov, deputy chairman of the ministry of foreign economic
activity.
On Monday the US embassy recommended that American nationals leave the
country, and many foreign businessmen, including oil company employees, have
departed on flights to Istanbul and Moscow.
It was not clear whether Azerbaijan's political upheaval was over. Mr
Aliyev's comeback was forewarned a week ago, when rebel troops seized
Azerbaijan's second city, Gyanja, and demanded Mr Elchibey's resignation.
Though the troops, led by a charismatic businessman, Mr Surat Huseynov, have
voiced their support for Mr Aliyev, they now have taken control of up to
half the Caspian Sea nation, and are within 70 miles of Baku.
Mr Elchibey, whose popularity has steadily waned since he came to power
about a year ago, has threatened to use force to defend his government. But
it is unclear how much loyalty he still enjoys in the military, or among the
Azeri population of 7m.
The key factor in Mr Elchibey's loss of popularity have been the lack of
economic improvements and a string of military defeats in the war in the
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. On Monday night ethnic Armenians from
Nagorno-Karabakh finally agreed to a brokered settlement. But at the same
time ethnic Armenian troops appeared to be encircling yet another important
city in the region, Agdam, which actually lies outside Nagorno-Karabakh.
The continued fighting was bound to put new pressure on Mr Elchibey, and
give Mr Aliyev a stronger hand ultimately to topple him.

RUSSIA is willing to send troops to protect Moslem enclaves in Bosnia
provided there is a clear framework and mandate from the United Nations
security council, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister,
reiterated yesterday in Vienna.
Russian troops, however, would not be sent to 'besieged fortresses under
fire'. Mr Kozyrev suggested a new UN Security Council resolution would be
needed to define objectives clearly.
In a separate statement made at the UN World Conference on Human Rights
taking place in the Austrian capital, Mr Kozyrev also warned of the growing
dangers of nationalism and of adopting a selective approach to human rights.
'We cannot accept references to the non-interference principle . . . when
violations of individual rights and freedom are involved,' he said.
He warned that policies of ethnic cleansing, as had happened in the former
Yugoslavia, posed a threat to democracy worldwide.
He said the lack of attention to the rights of national minorities 'risks
damaging the Baltic region and turning Europe into a zone of . . . lower and
double standards.'
In a day dominated by developments in eastern and south-eastern Europe,
conference delegates also heard a call for UN action in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
Mr Sali Berisha, president of Albania, called for the UN to place Kosovo
under UN control and declare it a neutral zone. He warned of the growing
dangers of war stemming from Serbian actions in Kosovo, whose population is
95 per cent ethnic Albanian. He called for further tightening of sanctions
against Serbia.
The conference unanimously endorsed an appeal by Mr Haris Silajdzic, the
Bosnian foreign minister, for immediate action by the UN to end atrocities
in Bosnia.
In an emotional statement that galvanised delegates, Mr Silajdzic criticised
the lack of adequate international reaction in the face of increasing
atrocities in Bosnia. He called on the conference 'to stop the genocide in
at least one town'. He was referring to the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, which
has been declared a 'safe area' by the UN but which is besieged by Serb
forces.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE United Nations must work out new rules for peacekeeping in crises like
the former Yugoslavia and Somalia, the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (Sipri) said yesterday, Reuter reports from Stockholm.
The collapse of totalitarian communism has led to civil wars which the world
body is powerless to stop at present, Sipri experts said at a news
conference to launch its 1993 year book.
Authors of the year book, considered the standard reference work on world
arms and disarmament, commented that in 1992 the UN moved towards a policy
of imposing or promoting peace rather than maintaining the status quo. 'The
problem with Yugoslavia is that there is no peace to be kept, and
enforcement activity cannot come about because there is no outside, agreed
policy,' said spokeswoman, Ms Regina Cowen-Kemp.
Sipri said the number of military personnel involved in peacekeeping had
soared last year to more than 62,000 from about 15,000 in 1991 but warned
against a tendency to see peacekeeping as a panacea for all the world's
conflicts.
'The expectations are exaggerated. Peacekeeping should be used only in the
last resort. Preventive diplomacy and crisis management are more important,'
said Mr Adam Daniel Rotfeld, Sipri director.
World military spending fell by 15 per cent in 1992 but civil wars flared in
29 different places, according to Sipri. It gave no overall figures, but
officials said industrialised countries spent about Dollars 540bn (Pounds
350.6bn) in 1992, about 65 per cent of the world total.
Mr Rotfeld said the collapse of totalitarian regimes in eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union had raised, then dashed, hopes of an improvement. He
said that 1992 had brought neither well-being nor respect for democracy and
the rule of law in former Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.
On a positive note, Mr Rotfeld mentioned the 1992 Start II treaty in which
the United States and Russia agreed to limit their strategic nuclear forces,
and the chemical weapons treaty opened for signature in Paris this year.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Italian magistrates call inquiries summit
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN magistrates investigating corruption yesterday held a hastily
convened summit in Rome to head off a squabble over conflicting
responsibilities for inquiries.
The main conflicts have emerged between Milan and Rome magistrates, but
magistrates from Bologna, Naples and Venice also attended the meeting. A
later statement referred to 'frank and loyal' discussions, hinting at some
tough talking.
The magistrates were reported to be unable to reach agreement on
responsibility for the three most important investigations in dispute. These
cover dealings behind the parcelling out of television channels between the
state and the private sector, telecommunications contracts and the
operations of the Ministry of Posts. An appeal court will probably have to
establish investigating responsibility.
There was only partial agreement on the probe into construction of the Rome
metro.
As the 16-month investigations into corruption and illicit financing of
political parties evolves, the cases are becoming increasingly intertwined.
Normally magistrates establish competence over a case if they initiate the
investigation and it then remains largely within their geographic area. But
the same names are cropping up in different places as the inquiries spread
through Italy.
Milan magistrates - a more homogeneous group with better technological
back-up and less subject to political pressure - have set the pace from the
start. They have sought to press their authority to the limit, to the dismay
of Rome magistrates.
Matters came to a head on Monday when Rome magistrates advised three senior
politicians - including Mr Giorgio La Malfa, the former Republican leader -
they were under investigation for alleged corruption relating to
telecommunications contracts and the awarding of television frequencies. Mr
La Malfa claimed he had already received similar notice from Milan.
Rome magistrates also appeared to ignore a deal cut in April between the
management of Fiat and Milan magistrates.
Mr Ugo Montevecchi, former chief executive of Fiat Engineering, had already
voluntarily appeared before Milan magistrates and been questioned for 10
hours. In spite of this Rome magistrates ordered his arrest on Monday for
the alleged payment of bribes relating to Culture Ministry contracts. Rome
magistrates argued it was difficult to be party to an arrangement concluded
by Milan magistrates which might involve plea bargaining.

EUROPEAN Community ministers today have their first chance for detailed
debate on ambitious plans to open all telephone calls to competition by 1998
 -and possibly their last chance to agree a deal on funding for the
promotion of advanced television services in Europe.
Telecommunications ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, are set to discuss the
European Commission's proposed deadline of January 1, 1998, for full
liberalisation of domestic and international calls.
Commission officials say the plan is supported by an influential quartet of
Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands, but several smaller member
states may press for a delay.
Meanwhile, advocates of an EC wide-screen and high-definition television
(HDTV) strategy are pinning their hopes for a deal on the replacement of the
hardline Mr Edward Leigh as UK minister responsible for telecoms in last
month's ministerial reshuffle.
To the irritation of the Commission, and of the Dutch and French
governments, British opposition, spearheaded by Mr Leigh, has helped force
changes to the original HDTV strategy. Mr Leigh has been replaced by Mr
Patrick McLoughlin, a former junior employment minister, who will have to
decide whether to accept compromise plans for Ecu228m (Pounds 180m) of EC
funding up to the end of 1996.
British diplomats have played down the change in minister, pointing out that
Mr Leigh himself accepted the substance of the plan at the last ministers'
meeting in May, while insisting that the UK could not sign up to a plan

Officials from Belgium, which will take over the EC presidency in July, have
already indicated that if a deal is not struck today, they see little room
for improving the current compromise to meet British objections.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Hope raised for German interest rate reduction

FOREIGN exchange dealers believe the Bundesbank may cut short-term interest
rates at its council meeting tomorrow after one of its leading members said
German money supply might have fallen within acceptable targets last month.
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank directorate member responsible for
credit market operations, said yesterday in an interview with AP-Dow Jones
news agency that M3 growth might have moved within the bank's target range
of 4.5-6.5 per cent on an annualised basis. In the first four months M3
expanded at a seasonally adjusted and annualised 7 per cent.
Dealers speculated that slower money supply growth could give the Bundesbank
its first opportunity in more than a month to cut rates at its council
meeting.
The news helped the dollar close more than a pfennig up on the day, at
DM1.6375, while sterling gained 1.25 pfennigs to close at DM2.4925.
In Paris yesterday, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president,
congratulated France on having lower interest rates than Germany, due to its
better inflation record. He told the Senate France had relative 'economic
and monetary stability, while in Germany we cannot boast the same stability
in prices' - an indication of continued Bundesbank concern about Germany's
inflation rate, which is a couple of points above that of France.
But Mr Schlesinger said the Bundesbank had at least 'kept the D-Mark stable
for 40 years and intends to go on doing so'.
He quashed any speculation that the German and French central banks might
establish a close bilateral link. An independent Bank of France has been
approved by the National Assembly, and action by the Senate is awaited.
Lengthy and close co-operation between the French and German central banks
had taken on a 'particular dimension' during the franc crisis, but this
needed no further reinforcement beyond the links that bound all European
Community central banks, Mr Schlesinger said.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Unification changes the place of women in the new German
home: Judy Dempsey finds women in the east feel they have paid a high price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'UNIFICATION has not been kind to the women of eastern Germany,' says Ms
Barbara Pfeiffer. In 1989, demonstrations in her home town of Leipzig
spawned the people's revolution which brought down the Berlin Wall. Two
years later Ms Pfeiffer lost her job when the chemicals factory where she
had worked for 25 years closed down.
Ms Pfeiffer, however, was sufficiently determined - and lucky, she says - to
find a part-time job with a local construction company. Many women, who have
borne the brunt of the surge in unemployment in eastern Germany since
unification, have not been as fortunate.
The official April unemployment total of 15.4 per cent hides the extent of
the problem. Including those on job creation and training schemes and those
who only have part-time jobs, about 30 per cent of the workforce are without
full-time work. Two thirds of the unemployed are women.
By contrast, East Germany guaranteed employment to more than 90 per cent of
women, who accounted for 49 per cent of the labour force in 1989. 'The
regime needed us,' explains Mrs Pfeiffer. 'It wanted to show there was
equality under the communist system and it wanted us to work because many
had fled before the Wall went up in 1961. We also needed the money, even
though we were paid less than men,' she adds.
Although the chemical plant where she worked turned out low-grade products,
health standards were almost non-existent, and few employees were motivated
by a management chosen for their loyalty to the communist party, 'it was a
job,' says Ms Pfeiffer.
The state's abundant provision of child-care made it easy for women to work.
Until 1989, 80 per cent of children under three had a creche place, 95 per
cent of pre-school over-threes attended kindergarten, more than 80 per cent
of those aged six to ten received day-care after school, and 90 per cent of
children attended cheap holiday camps.
There are fears that the number of kindergartens will soon be reduced. 'Some
people complained that the kids would be indoctrinated by the stupid
communists,' says Ms Gaby Schwartz, a 37-year-old East Berliner. 'But the
child-care system in western Germany appals me.'
In the western states, 2.3m children compete for 600,000 partially
subsidised state child-care places. Generally, however, many women employ
nannies, or stay at home with the children.
According to the federal ministry of women and youth, there is an
overcapacity of kindergartens in eastern Germany. 'About 120 places exist
for 100 children. The local communes will have to decide where to cut back.'
It said east German women would in future have to pay for child care.
Such a move would come on top of the scrapping of the former East Germany's
generous child benefits. Unemployment - and the abolition of those benefits
 -has slashed the birth rate from 2.5 children per family to 1.3, as low as
in western Germany and one of the lowest in Europe.
Unification has also impinged on the former East Germany's liberal abortion
laws. 'In the old days, women in eastern Germany had one big freedom:
abortion on demand. We could not understand why it was illegal for West
Germans to have abortions,' says Helga Kokoschka, an unemployed 28-year-old
mother of two children.
Abortions were a common form of birth control, as in all of eastern Europe.
Yet East German women saw abortion on demand not in ethical or moral terms,
but as a political issue where women had complete freedom of choice. 'The
state never dared interfere. This was our one area of freedom,' says Ms
Pfeiffer.
Thus the German constitutional court's ruling last month that abortion
should remain illegal and only available under certain conditions has
angered many east German women. 'The new unified state is imposing its will
on us,' says Ms Pfeiffer. 'Our choice to work and control our own lives have
disappeared.'
East German women have had difficulties coming to terms with the multiple
challenges of unification. Ms Eva Kolinsky, professor of German studies at
Britain's Keele University, who is studying the position of women in Leipzig
since 1989, says an entire generation of women have lost out as a result of
unification. 'Those in mid-career, in their 30s or early 40s, will find it
very difficult to re-enter the labour market,' she says.
Ms Kolinsky is hopeful, however, for the next generation. 'More women are
attending university. They see qualifications as the key to entering the
market, when it picks up,' she says. 'But the price has been high. An entire
generation has lost their social status in the new Germany.'

FT  16 JUN 93 / SPD leaders ready to support sale of Telekom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leadership of Germany's opposition Social Democrats intends to support a
government plan to privatise Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned telecoms
monopoly, and circumvent opponents within its own party ranks.
Mr Hans Bernrath, leader of the party's team which negotiated the
privatisation plan with the government two weeks ago, said SPD members of
parliament would not vote on the plan, but would simply be canvassed on the
issue.
SPD politicians favouring the privatisation fear that a formal vote could
result in the parliamentary party rejecting the plan by a narrow majority.
The planned informal poll will enable the government to start drafting the
bill, which it is intended to put before parliament by October.
The decision follows intense negotiations among SPD parliamentarians over a
privatisation agreement signed between representatives of the SPD and the
government on May 28, after a year of difficult negotiations. The government
needs opposition support in order to change the constitution to pave the way
for privatisation.
The plan is to create a state holding company under which three independent
joint stock companies would operate: Deutsche Telekom, the telecoms
monopoly, the Post Office and the Postal Bank.
However, it has yet to gain support among many SPD parliamentarians, some of
whom fiercely oppose the outright privatisation of Deutsche Telekom and of
the postal services.
As with other privatisation projects in Germany, the future of Deutsche
Telekom now depends on the ability of the SPD parliamentarians to overcome
their internal divisions. A large number of them oppose privatising Deutsche
Telekom on the grounds that a private company would no longer fulfil its
obligations towards poorer and less populated regions. They are also
representing the views of the post and telecoms union which fears losing
members.
The telecoms ministry, for Its part, has offered to keep a 50 per
cent-plus-one share stake in Deutsche Telekom, ensuring the state some say
over its management. The government also argues that creating a holding
company will ensure maintenance of union power.

FT  16 JUN 93 / California attacked on unitary taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA'S system of a unitary tax based on the worldwide income of
multinational companies came under criticism from a senior official of the
UK's Inland Revenue at the Financial Times' international tax conference in
London yesterday.
Mr Leonard Beighton, deputy chairman of the Inland Revenue, said
California's approach could only have 'arbitrary and bizarre' results. His
comments follow the threat of retaliatory action against Californian
companies with UK operations by the chancellor of the exchequer last month
if the state does not lessen its demands.
He said the Revenue had written to these companies to assess the extent of
tax credits of which they would be deprived, but stressed it hoped instead
for co-operation.
Mr Beighton stressed the importance of maintaining internationally agreed
tax principles, especially the importance of the arm's length principle of
taxing companies by the profits made in a country and not on worldwide
income.
Mr James Mogle, a partner with US lawyers Sutherland, Asbill &amp; Brennan and
former international tax counsel at the US Treasury, told the conference
that Congress had not so far taken the British threat seriously. But he
warned that any attempt to impose retaliatory action would be seen by
Congress as an attempt to over-ride the arrangements negotiated in the
current US-UK tax treaty. That could jeopardise other treaties.
Mr David Carr, from the European Commission's financial institutions and
company law directorate, said the EC was pursuing plans to extend proposed
tax directives to cover enterprises resident and subject to corporate tax in
any member states, with progress expected 'before too long'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATRA, the French car and aerospace company, yesterday lost a long court
battle against a large state aid package approved by the European Commission
for a rival joint venture created by Ford and Volkswagen, Reuter reports
from Luxembourg.
The European Court rejected its appeal against Brussels' decision in
mid-1991 to allow the Portuguese government to give Ecu547m (Pounds 432m) to
the Ford/VW venture in Setubal, south of Lisbon.
The court said the Commission had done all that was required of it in
investigating the case under Community rules on state aid. About
three-quarters of the aid is money which Portugal received from the
Commission in EC development funds.
VW and Ford are teaming up to build luxury, family-oriented vans that will
rival Matra's Renault Espace model. Such vans, which can carry up to seven
people, are seen as one of the main growth markets in the motor sector.
Matra argued that a tie-up between VW and Ford was not needed for either to
penetrate the market niche and that consumers would gain nothing from an
alliance that risked damaging competition.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Bundesbank praise for France on interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, yesterday congratulated
France on getting its interest rates lower than those in Germany thanks to
its better inflation record.
He told the French Senate in Paris that France had relative 'economic and
monetary stability, while, alas, in Germany we cannot boast about the same
stability in prices', an indication that the Bundesbank remains concerned
about the German inflation rate which is a couple of points above France's.
But he said the Bundesbank had at least 'kept the D-Mark stable for 40 years
and intends to go on doing so'.
However, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, another influential member of the
policy-making Bundesbank council, said a slowdown in the pace of German
money supply expansion could give the central bank room to lower interest
rates.
In an interview with AP-DJ Mr Gaddum, the directorate member responsible for
credit market operations, said he could not offer any indication about the
money supply figures for May. But 'money supply developments (in May) could
indeed move back within the corridor in line with the economic cooling-off',
he said. 'We will wait and see if the money figures provide us with room to
manoeuvre.'
He declined to comment on the present extent of manoeuverability nor the
pace at which rate cuts should be undertaken.
In Paris, Mr Schlesinger firmly quelled any speculation that the German and
French central banks might establish some specially close bilateral link,
following independence for the Bank of France which has been approved by the
National Assembly and now awaits action by the Senate.
He said the long-time close co-operation between the French and German
central banks had taken on a 'particular dimension' during the past year's
franc crises, but this needed no further 'reinforcement' beyond the links
that bound all European Community central banks.

Mr Ferdinando Ventriglia, long-standing chairman of the Bank of Naples, was
yesterday advised he was under investigation for alleged illicit financing
of political parties. The move by Naples magistrates is the first time a top
member of Italy's banking community has become involved in the corruption
scandals.
The investigation also concerns Mr Paolo Cirino Pomiconi, former finance
minister and one of the city's most powerful Christian Democrat politicians,
who has already been linked to at least three other important inquiries.
Naples magistrates are following up some L300m (Pounds 133,000) alleged to
have been paid by the Bank of Naples for a rugby championship sponsored by
the Naples sports asscociation, Polisportiva, of which Mr Pomicino was
president until last May.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Davignon attacks EC leaders for 'timidity' over jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VISCOUNT Etienne Davignon, one of Europe's most powerful industrialists, has
launched a scathing attack on EC political leaders. He accuses them of being
too timid to deal with the unemployment crisis.
Mr Davignon said in an interview with the Financial Times that European
industry should consider adopting American-style labour market flexibility
to strengthen manufacturing against competition from Asia and the US.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, will make a
personal presentation on the EC's failure to create new jobs at the EC
summit in Copenhagen on Monday.
Mr Delors is said to be ready to tackle the sensitive issue of whether
Europe's welfare state is indirectly contributing to low growth, but
reluctant to disavow the Maastricht treaty's social chapter.
Mr Davignon, a senior member of the European Commission in the early 1980s
and now chairman of Societe Generale de Belgique, the biggest holding
company in Belgium, said he was worried about industry polarising along
free-market and protectionist lines in the EC. Instead, it was necessary to
adopt a new approach to job creation, with more short-time working and
flexible hiring and greater attention on small businesses.
'This is a very tough message,' he said, 'but if you look at history in the
US, the jobs and growth have not come from large companies such as General
Motors, IBM and Exxon.'
Behind Mr Davignon's intervention lies a fear among European industrialists
about the risks of a social explosion caused by low growth, rising
unemployment and a crisis of business confidence.
'You see it in our companies,' he said. 'If you want Dollars 300m for
lay-offs and restructuring, you get approval in 15 seconds. But if you go
out and buy something, your share price goes down.'
According to Mr Davignon, Europe's leaders have failed to respond properly
to two historic shocks: German unification and the collapse of the Soviet
empire. Instead, they have applied a philosophy of 'business as usual'.
He argued that EC leaders' approach to the collapse of communism was flawed
and 'totally lacking in imagination'.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Clarke puts stress on growth and living standards:
Chancellor tells of abiding respect for those engaged in 'the difficult
business of commerce'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE put his stamp on economic policy last night by identifying
himself with commerce and saying he wanted to be remembered 'as a chancellor
under whom the British businessman and woman and their workforce were able
to earn a better living'.
In an anxiously awaited speech to the City of London, the new chancellor
made no changes of substance to economic policy. But, setting a new tone, he
emphasised that his goal was to raise living standards, and he stressed the
importance of growth as well as low inflation.
Observing that 'we cannot rely on recovery alone to bring borrowing back
towards balance', he made clear that he would take a tough line on public
spending and would not shrink from further measures to reduce Britain's
Pounds 50bn annual budget deficit.
He recalled that the government had already taken steps to reduce the
deficit by controlling spending and increasing tax revenue. 'But if I judge
that further action is necessary, I shall not hesitate to take it,' he
added.
Speaking after a day that brought news of a further strengthening of
manufacturing output and steady if unspectacular growth in retail sales, Mr
Clarke gave a moderately upbeat assessment of the UK economy.
Britain was more fortunate than many of its EC neighbours, he said. While
signs of recovery were 'mixed and in some cases muted', he declared 'the
momentum for growth is clearly there'.
Mr Clarke set three objectives for economic policy that could have been
taken from any recent speech of his predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont. He
promised:
To keep inflation in its target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent, bringing
it within the lower half of the range by the end of the parliament.
To restore the public finances to better health and towards balance 'over
the medium term'.
To sustain the recovery and ensure that it lasts.
Those aims were given a special spin that reflected his life 'in the
industrial Midlands', where, he said, 'I have acquired a deep and abiding
respect for all those engaged in the difficult business of commerce.'
'It is commerce alone which generates the prosperity which enables
government to raise the living standards and hopes of all the British
people. That is the key principle which will guide my hand as chancellor,'
he said.
While underlining that low inflation was 'necessary - absolutely necessary',
Mr Clarke emphasised that it could not be the sole end of economic policy.
'Growth, employment and a better standard of living are the ultimate goals
to which every aspect of economic policy must contribute,' he said.
In giving a broad outline of policy in his first Mansion House speech, Mr
Clarke broke with the recent practice of Tory chancellors who have used the
occasion to talk in detail on monetary policy. After referring to himself as
a 'pro-European', he made clear 'it would be quite some time' before it
would be right for the UK to return to the European exchange rate mechanism.
On fiscal policy, his 'own instincts are tax-cutting instincts' but he said
a tight rein on public spending would be essential if the level of tax were
to be kept down.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Timex to close Dundee plant by Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMEX yesterday abandoned its fight to preserve its electronics plant in
Dundee and announced that it would close by Christmas.
The decision followed the rejection by local union leaders of the company's
offer to reinstate the sacked workforce on lower wages and conditions. It
provoked a furious reaction among union leaders and opposition politicians.
Mr Mohammed Saleh, Timex's US vice-president for human resources, said the
plant's financial position had become 'impossible to sustain'. He laid the
blame squarely on the local unions, saying: 'They did everything possible
not to help us keep that plant going.'
Mr Saleh announced the company's decision after a final two-hour meeting
with local officials of the AEEU engineers union and two conveners of the
sacked workforce in a last attempt to settle the 20-week dispute which began
when Timex sacked its 343-strong workforce after a strike.
At the meeting, the employees reiterated their rejection of terms negotiated
by national AEEU officials under which the sacked workers would be offered
their jobs back subject to tests of suitability and the imposition of a 9.8
per cent pay cut, with a reduction in fringe benefits.
The closure of the plant, which was set up in 1946 and now assembles printed
circuit boards, marks the failure of long-term efforts by Timex to make it
profitable. Mr Saleh said Timex had lost Pounds 10m since 1987.
It also indicates Timex's failure to keep the plant going with the
substitute workforce hired after it sacked the original employees.
Timex now wants to go to the conciliation service Acas to negotiate an
orderly rundown and the proposal will be put by unions to a mass meeting on
Thursday. But union leaders in Dundee have said they will not support it.
Yesterday Mr John Kydd, district organiser for the AEEU, said: 'I am
absolutely sure in my own mind Timex engineered the dispute.' Mr Gavin
Laird, the union's general secretary, said it was 'a great tragedy for
Dundee and the UK. We regret we did not know how serious a position the
finances were in and that we were not involved before. If we had put forward
our proposals earlier they might have worked'.
He said that the trade union laws had not helped - they had stopped the
trade union having discussions with the company within a 90-day period.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, is understood to have worked behind the
scenes to prevent a closure, offering government help for training to
persuade Timex to stay. He also fought in cabinet committee to prevent
Dundee having its development area status downgraded.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Cash calls on Names deferred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN a dozen Lloyd's of London syndicates are to postpone part or all
of their calls for cash, thereby softening the impact of record losses on
the Names who provide the insurance market's capital.
The market expects to report next week losses of up to Pounds 2.8bn for
1990, its latest underwriting year.
Syndicates delaying calls for cash from Names include Cater Allen 190,
Barder &amp; Marsh 62, Janson Green 79, Bankside 197, Methuen 483, BPC 920, and
Davies 1021. Sturge Holdings, the market's biggest agency, said last weekend
that a number of syndicates it managed would take similar action.
Mr Julian Crispin, chairman of Sedgwick Underwriting Agents, one of the
largest members' agents at Lloyd's, said: 'Some Names will be able to defer
all cash calls for 12 months. It is a very satisfactory development.'
The change is possible because although syndicates must make a full
provision against potential claims, payment is sometimes not made for many
years. Sturge said it had negotiated an arrangement with its bankers whereby
they would provide a contingency line of credit if payment became due
earlier than expected.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that five agents may not be prepared to continue
managing syndicates into 1994, three of them as a result of disagreements
over elements of the Lloyd's business plan introduced in April.
Charman Underwriting Agency, Knightstone Holdings, Christofferson Heath,
Atrium Underwriting, and Hardy all gave notice to members' agents before the
end of last month.
Several of the agencies are opposed to the imposition of an across-the-board
maximum agency fee of 0.5 per cent.
Mr Roger Heath, chairman of Christofferson Heath, which manages two of the
market's largest motor syndicates, said his agency faced a sharp fall in
income as a result of the changes to the fee structure.
The agency charges Names a fee of 1.75 per cent to help it meet higher
expenses associated with motor underwriting.

Last year the venture sold and installed Alnas pumps in North America,
Germany, Russia, North Africa and the Middle East.
In addition, Ramco extended its interests in the former Soviet Union through
its participation with Pennzoil in the 1.4bn barrel Gunashli field in the
Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea. The company announced yesterday it
would be extending this partnership to the Azeri and Chirag fields.
Ramco has also begun work on a new oil and gas development in the Tyumen
region of western Siberia in a joint venture with a group of US investors.
The company said its work in Azerbaijan had placed it in a unique position
for a company of its size.
Earnings per share dipped to 1.88p, against 2.39p, and the company declared
a dividend of 1p - down from 2p.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Beverley at Pounds 63,000 after
reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BEVERLEY Group, the engineering concern formerly known as Petrocon, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 63,000 for 1992 against losses of Pounds 2.57m.
Turnover was ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 19.3m, against Pounds 18.3m.
During the period the company failed to acquire James Wilkes in a
hostile bid and underwent a capital reconstruction. The
the Clydebank Engineering offshoot went into members' voluntary
liquidation at the end of last year and Gorseline has been sold.
Mr Colin Robinson, chairman and chief executive, said that manufacturing
division was trading satisfactorily with quotation activity at record
levels.
Extraordinary charges of Pounds 339,000 (Pounds 2.15m), related to a payment
under an on-demand performance bond, losses on the sale of Gorseline and
costs incurred in the Wilkes bid. Retained losses were Pounds 73,000 (Pounds
4.52m).
The final is passed. An interim of 0.625p was the only dividend in the
previous year.

shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STEYR-Daimler-Puch Machinery, the Austrian arms and vehicle maker, is
expected to make an operating loss of at least Sch100m in 1993, chief
executive Mr Rudolf Streicher told the company's annual meeting, Reuter
reports from Vienna.
'We expect a triple-digit loss (in millions of schillings),' Mr Streicher
said. Only two of the 13 companies Steyr controls - Steyr Mannlicher and
Steyr-Daimler-Puch Spezialfahrzeug - had delivered a positive result so far
this year, he added.
He declined to give full details of first-half performance ahead of the
presentation of final half-year results in July.
Steyr is 71 per cent owned by Creditanstalt-Bankverein.
However, Mr Streicher said that Steyr, which had a 1992 net profit of
Sch17.5m (Dollars 1.53m) in figures which were consolidated for the first
time, had suffered a further turnover loss so far this year.
Group turnover was down in the first four months by 30 per cent at Sch3.9bn
against a year earlier.
Only the Eurostar minivan joint venture, being operated with Chrysler Corp
of the US was on target, with turnover running at Sch2.7bn during the first
five months.
Wholly-owned subsidiary Steyr-Daimler-Puch Fahrzeugtechnik has been worst
hit, with turnover down 56 per cent so far this year - in line with the fall
in turnover at the company in 1992.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PowerGen and NRG in eastern
German mine agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S PowerGen, and NRG of Minneapolis, the Anglo-American consortium
which has sole negotiating rights until next month for Mibrag, the giant
brown coal fields in eastern Germany, has secured a mining partner for the
open-cast pits.
The agreement, forged last weekend between the consortium and Morrison
Knudsen, the Idaho-based mining experts, means that PowerGen and NRG, whose
main interests are in utilities, will be in a position to tap the efficiency
of the mines.
The mines, which are expected to produce between 15m and 20m tonnes a year,
are being sold by the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising eastern
German industry. PowerGen and NRG won sole negotiating rights for the mines
last January after a decision by the Treuhand to put Mibrag out to tender
the previous month. The consortium's purchase of Mibrag is linked to buying
a share of a 800 Mw plant at Schkopau, near Leipzig.
'We really are pleased to have Morrison Knudsen on board. They will optimise
the efficiency of Mibrag,' said Mr Peter Jones, managing director of NRG'S
project development arm. It is expected that Morrison Knudsen will hold a 33
per cent stake in Mibrag after it has been sold to PowerGen and NRG. The
consortium's new mining partner, however, will not take over the daily
mining of the pits - which will continue to be carried out by Mibrag
employees - but will instead focus primarily on planning and strategy.
PowerGen and NRG are evaluating Mibrag's assets, which range from pits and
power generation, to wax works and lines for producing briquettes.
Before 1989, Mibrag employed more than 54,000 people, but that has fallen to
below 16,000 after reduced capacity. The mines have already a viable
commercial basis because they have signed coal contracts, spread over forty
years, to supply an annual 15m tonnes to Schkopau, and Lippendorf, a large
1,600 Mw power plant.
Yesterday Treuhand officials said they were increasingly confident that the
Anglo-Americans would acquire Mibrag.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Survey of Retail Chain Management (5): Food stores keep
their cool / Profile of Lo-Cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW-COST distribution of chilled and other temperature-controlled products
has become an increasingly important feature of retail chain logistics.
A series of food safety scares during the late 1980s and the subsequent UK
Food Safety Act of 1991 helped to highlight the importance of establishing
and adhering to strict operational standards for the distribution and
storage of temperature-sensitive food.
Faced with those pressures and the ever-present need to achieve greater
efficiency and cost-savings, retailers have increasingly turned to third
party specialists to run their so-called 'cool chains'. One such agreement
is the award of a five-year contract by the Argyll Group's Lo-Cost retail
chain to Wincanton Distribution.
The agreement covers the warehousing and distribution of 300-400 different
ranges of chilled foods - typically cheese, butter, other dairy products and
meat - and fresh produce to 300 stores throughout the UK. A purpose-designed
156,000 square foot dedicated warehouse at Solihull, West Midlands, was
acquired by Wincanton specifically to service the Lo-Cost contract. Around
one-third of the warehouse is being used for chilled storage and those
facilities now handle all Lo-Cost's centralised distribution of chilled
products.
Supporting the centralised distribution centre are three outbase centres in
the south-west, south-east and north-west of England, a fleet of 16
vehicles, and a workforce of around 100 people. Before the agreement,
Lo-Cost had primarily relied on chilled product manufacturers to deliver
directly to its branches around the UK. It also used one small contracted
operation.
Now, most manufacturers deliver goods into the Solihull centralised
distribution centre, although some products are collected from the
manufacturers by Wincanton using vehicles returning from delivery runs to
the Lo-Cost stores.
'That backhaul operation is still fairly limited but it is growing. The
advantage is it enables us to maximise the use of the distribution fleet,'
says Mr Mike Burbage, managing director of Wincanton Distribution.
Communication between Lo-Cost, its suppliers and Wincanton is now
increasingly an EDI (electronic data interchange) function. Individual
stores relay their orders to the Solihull distribution centre via handheld
terminals.
Goods held at the centre are called up from stock while details of goods not
held at the distribution centre are passed on to the relevant manufacturers
who deliver to Solihull. Wincanton then consolidates the products into
individual store orders and organises the distribution of consignments.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Placing to raise Pounds 15m will value
Metrotect at Pounds 26m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METROTECT Industries yesterday revealed plans to float via a placing of
ordinary shares later this month. It is raising Pounds 15m, the maximum
allowed by the Stock Exchange without a general offer to investors.
The issue will value the company at about Pounds 26m.
It also announced sharply higher profits for the year ended March 31.
Metrotect, which manufactures and supplies plasticised materials and
products to protect underground and underwater pipelines reported pre-tax
figures up from Pounds 679,000 to Pounds 2.27m on turnover doubled to Pounds
22.6m (Pounds 11.4m).
Of the Pounds 15m, some Pounds 8.25m will be from the sale of stakes held by
existing shareholders.
These include the management and 3i and County NatWest Ventures, which
backed the management buy-out from BPB Industries in April 1990.
The management team - which numbers 11 people, led by Mr Brian Thomas, and
is unchanged since the MBO - is selling one third of its collective holding.
The balance of Pounds 6.75m will be used to repay debt and to rationalise
and simplify the share structure into one class of ordinary.
This will leave the company with about Pounds 1m net cash, which will go
towards working capital requirements.
Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker, has issued the pathfinder prospectus.
Metrotect said that overseas markets accounted for about 90 per cent of its
sales.
The directors said the order book was encouraging. A contract has just been
won to provide coating materials for 540 miles of pipeline from Hainan
Island to Hong Kong.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Heywood Williams expands in US - Dollars
65m spent on building products and automotive components group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEYWOOD WILLIAMS, the building materials group which sold a large part of
its UK glass business to Pilkington earlier this year for Pounds 95m, plans
to use some of the proceeds to acquire a specialist building products group
in the US.
The Huddersfield-based group is paying Dollars 53.25m (Pounds 35m) in cash
to acquire LaSalle, a US-based distributor of building products and
furnishings to the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle markets.
Heywood will also repay up to Dollars 11.75m of LaSalle's borrowings on
completion.
Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, Heywood's chairman, said the acquisition, which is
subject to shareholders' approval at an extraordinary meeting on June 30,
represents 'an exciting development for the group'.
He added: 'The company has an impressive management team, is performing
extremely well and operates in markets which should show strong long-term
growth.'
Last year LaSalle reported operating profits of Dollars 6.4m, almost double
the Dollars 3.3m recorded the previous year, on turnover ahead to Dollars
117.7m (Dollars 98.4m).
Three quarters of its business comes from supplying the fast-growing US
market for factory-built housing.
Manufactured housing sales represented about 15 per cent of the overall US
housing market last year when 210,000 units worth Dollars 5.7bn were sold, a
20 per cent increase over the previous year.
The US recreational vehicle industry also grew by more than 20 per cent in
volume terms and was worth an estimated Dollars 4.4bn last year.
The planned acquisition will substantially strengthen Heywood's presence in
the US providing its existing Creation Windows subsidiary with a nationwide
distribution network.
Creation Windows and LaSalle will have a combined annual turnover of more
than Dollars 200m across a broad range of building and automotive markets.
The acquisition was foreshadowed in March when Heywood sold its UK and Irish
glass processing and distribution business to Pilkington.
At the time Mr Hinchliffe said that after paying off debts, the net cash of
about Pounds 65m would be used to fund acquisitions and expand its remaining
businesses.
The deal will leave Heywood with about Pounds 25m in cash. Mr Hinchliffe
said he expected it would be spent on another acquisition, probably in the
UK, by the end of the year.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Close call as discontent grows - Voting
time nears on Heron's debt plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, have little time left
to consider the proposals for restructuring its Pounds 1.4bn of debt.
On the face of it, they have a simple choice. Vote in favour of a plan to
repay creditors out of asset disposals over several years or see the company
go into liquidation. The latter alternative, the 220-page document from the
company says, would give creditors significantly less and at a later date.
Yet as the deadline approaches - meetings start in London on June 28 but
some proxies and claims had to be in by yesterday - there seems to be a
rising tide of discontent among some creditors.
Yesterday First Eastern Developments, a Bermudan based property consulting
company, gave details of its concerns, first revealed in an advertisement in
the Financial Times last Friday which called on creditors to join together
to consider opposing the scheme.
FED is a private group headed by Mr Simon Shane. He ran a UK property group
called Equitable Debenture and Assets Corporation, which was sold to British
Land in 1985 for Pounds 20m. FED claims to be owed Dollars 1.7m by Heron,
and is an affiliate of Stratagem Development Corporation which is suing
Heron in New York.
Mr Shane asserts that creditors do not have enough information to make an
informed decision and suggests more information would be forthcoming if the
schemes were rejected. He would like to see an up-to-date property
valuation, trading results for the year to March 1993, and detailed cashflow
projections.
He suspects that there have been intra-group transactions since the last
published accounts, for the year to end March 1992, which might have given
banks an edge over other creditors.
Even creditors intending to vote in favour of the proposals complain of a
lack of information, such as trading results and property valuations, but as
one put it, 'to some extent you have to believe what Heron and its advisers
tell you because it is so complex'.
Mr Shane's criticisms follow those of Mr Gary Klesch, a bond dealer who
claims to speak for 10 per cent of the bondholders and has also called for
rejection of the proposals.
Much has also been made of letters written in mid-May to bondholders by the
lead managers to the Swiss franc bond issues. They sent bondholders the
Heron document with a covering letter in mid-May. The letter - which put
forward the main pros and cons of the deal - drew letters from Mr Ronson to
the chairmen of the banks who felt that the banks had been less than fair.
SG Warburg Securities, one of the lead managers, said yesterday that the
letters were neutral. 'We are in a situation where we should not give
advice, submitting an offer on behalf of Heron. It always remains to the
investor to make the decision.'
However, others note that a letter from Deutsche Bank, which lead a D-Mark
bond issue, to its bondholders was 'more neutral'.
Heron's advisers say that rejection of the schemes would almost inevitably
lead swiftly to bankruptcy proceedings. Mr Shane and Mr Klesch think this
could be as good, or even better, for creditors. Mr Shane says 'insolvency
proceedings would ensure administration directed at maximising value for all
creditors with freedom from conflicts of interest'.
But Heron's advisers say that liquidation would be an extremely complex
affair, likely to ignite a volcano of litigation as different classes of
creditors fight for their rights.
The problem lies in Heron's complex structure. While the head office
division has debt, including all the bonds, of Pounds 524m it has assets of
only Pounds 8m. The UK property division, by contrast, has assets of Pounds
465m and debts of Pounds 298m. The Spanish part has debt of Pounds 90m and
assets of Pounds 223m.
Liquidation, judging by other recent large cases such as BCCI, could also be
a costly process, on top of the Pounds 50m Heron has already sunk in
restructuring fees.
The schemes need to be approved by 75 per cent of votes cast by value, and
by 50 per cent by number of voters. It is looking a closer call than can be
comfortable for Heron.

THE Ticketing Group, which operated as a joint venture between Expedier and
Wembley until January of this year, when Expedier bought out its partner's
50 per cent holding and changed its name, has announced results for
Expedier's last trading year in its previous form.
Expedier had interests in furniture hire, sporting services and a ticket
reservation operation.
Pre-tax losses for the year to end-December 1992 amounted to Pounds 2.15m,
down from Pounds 5.37m previously. The retained loss, after extraordinary
losses of Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 4.33m) totalled Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 9.65m).
Loss per share came to 2.4p (11.6p).
The activities of the company are now concentrated on retail ticket sales
and event management services through the First Call and Keith Prowse ticket
agencies as well as Space Time Systems, the computerised box office system
supplier.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Cash calls on Names deferred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN a dozen Lloyd's of London syndicates are to postpone part or all
of their calls for cash, thereby softening the impact of record losses on
the Names who provide the insurance market's capital.
The market expects to report next week losses of up to Pounds 2.8bn for
1990, its latest underwriting year.
Syndicates delaying calls for cash from Names include Cater Allen 190,
Barder &amp; Marsh 62, Janson Green 79, Bankside 197, Methuen 483, BPC 920, and
Davies 1021. Sturge Holdings, the market's biggest agency, said last weekend
that a number of syndicates it managed would take similar action.
Mr Julian Crispin, chairman of Sedgwick Underwriting Agents, one of the
largest members' agents at Lloyd's, said: 'Some Names will be able to defer
all cash calls for 12 months. It is a very satisfactory development.'
The change is possible because although syndicates must make a full
provision against potential claims, payment is sometimes not made for many
years. Sturge said it had negotiated an arrangement with its bankers whereby
they would provide a contingency line of credit if payment became due
earlier than expected.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that five agents may not be prepared to continue
managing syndicates into 1994, three of them as a result of disagreements
over elements of the Lloyd's business plan introduced in April.
Charman Underwriting Agency, Knightstone Holdings, Christofferson Heath,
Atrium Underwriting, and Hardy all gave notice to members' agents before the
end of last month.
Several of the agencies are opposed to the imposition of an across-the-board
maximum agency fee of 0.5 per cent.
Mr Roger Heath, chairman of Christofferson Heath, which manages two of the
market's largest motor syndicates, said his agency faced a sharp fall in
income as a result of the changes to the fee structure.
The agency charges Names a fee of 1.75 per cent to help it meet higher
expenses associated with motor underwriting.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Strike-hit Timex president resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER HALL, president of Timex Electronics, the Dundee company embroiled
in a bitter industrial dispute, resigned yesterday. His departure was widely
seen as making a settlement slightly easier to reach but union officials
said they were not expecting an early solution.
Last night Mr Mohamed Saleh, Timex Electronics' head of human resources in
the US, was due to meet AEEU engineering union officials and leaders of the
sacked Timex workforce in Dundee. It was the first time since February that
Timex had met local union leaders, though the company has had long
negotiations with the union's national officials.
Mr Hall was said by the company to have resigned for personal reasons and
left the plant. The printed circuit board assembly factory is being managed
by Mr John Dryfe, a Scot who is chairman of Timex Electronics in the US and
was once manager of the Dundee facility.
The Timex dispute is in its fifth month. The Dundee plant had 340 hourly
paid workers, 80 per of them women, until the entire workforce was sacked in
February. Since then the company has been bussing in replacements.
Earlier this month the strikers contemptuously rejected peace terms
negotiated by the union, which said the terms represented a 27 per cent cut
in pay and benefits.
Mr Hall had become a hate figure for the sacked workforce. His departure is
seen as a victory by the strikers and could make it easier for them to
accept terms from Timex management.
But there was no sign last night that Timex was prepared to change its
position, while leaders of the sacked workforce said their position was
unchanged. Mr John Stewart, a member of the strike committee, said: 'We
don't believe there will be an early settlement.'
The strikers want to win back their jobs on conditions similar to those
under which they were working before they were sacked.
They believe pressure is mounting on Timex - partly because of the damage
the company's image is suffering - and they accept that the closure of the
plant is a possibility. Mr Stewart said: 'Timex's attempt to maintain
production with the replacement workforce has been a dismal failure.'
Timex has insisted that production is being maintained and that it needs to
increase its workforce to meet new orders.
David Goodhart in Zurich writes: Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU,
welcomed the news that Mr Hall had left Timex and said it was a 'necessary
but not sufficient condition for finding a resolution' to the dispute.

FT  15 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Unitas falls to
FM512m loss in first four months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 15th June 1993) appended to this article.
A DOUBLING of loan losses plunged Unitas, Finland's second-largest banking
group, deeper into the red in the first four months. However, credit
write-offs appear to be reaching a peak and should not exceed last year's
total.
Unitas reported pre-tax losses of FM512m (Dollars 93.9m) - almost twice the
level in the same period of 1992, when losses reached FM266m.
Write-offs on credits and guarantees rose by just over 100 per cent to
FM845m, from FM419m. However, the portfolio of non-performing credits fell
by FM268m from the end of 1992 to FM8.57bn at the end of April. Of this
total, some 18 per cent is accounted for by the trade, restaurant and hotel
sectors, 12 per cent by property and 10 per cent by the construction
industry.
Mr Vesa Vainio, chief executive, said the result for the year would show
some improvement on the FM7.2bn loss in 1992, when credit losses tripled to
FM3.3bn. But he warned the result would remain 'severely negative'.
Mr Vainio predicted that Unitas, the holding company for the Union Bank of
Finland, would achieve its strategic objective of avoiding takeover by the
state, a fate that has already befallen two Finnish banking groups.
Due to a fall in its risk-weighted assets to FM127.3bn from FM130.4bn at the
end of 1992, the group's capital adequacy ratio under BIS calculations was
down only marginally to 11 per cent from 11.1 per cent.
Unitas said that even without the FM1.7bn in preferred capital it received
from the government last year, its capital adequacy ratio would be above the
international minimum of 8 per cent.
Net interest income rose 7.5 per cent to FM686m. There was also a 38 per
cent rise in other income to FM697m. However, group operating expenses rose
6.4 per cent to FM881m.
CORRECTION
The Financial Times yesterday incorrectly reported the 1992 result for
Unitas, the Finnish bank. The company returned a loss of FM2.7bn (Dollars
491m).

FT  15 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) Insider dealing trial abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 15th June 1993) appended to this article.
THE INSIDER dealing trial of Mr Alton Byrd, a former account manager with
the stockbroking arm of Svenska, the Swedish bank, was abandoned yesterday
because a crucial witness was too ill to give evidence.
Mr Byrd, who is also a British international basketball player, and his two
co-defendants, Mr Roger Wilcocke, a director of a shop-fitting company, and
Mr Graham Shear, a London solicitor, were all formally acquitted of the
charges against them. No evidence had been presented at their trial, which
started last Tuesday.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which brought the prosecution, denied
the trial's collapse was caused by faults in insider dealing legislation,
which has proved notoriously difficult to enforce.
The collapse was caused purely by the absence of a material witness, the
department said. The new insider dealing legislation being drawn up would
not have made any difference in this situation, it added.
Mr Edmund Lawson QC explained to the Old Bailey jury why the department was
dropping the prosecution. He said that Mr Vincent Donohoe, a director of
International Media Communications (IMC), a video and entertainment company,
and the 'insider' from whom it had been alleged Mr Byrd obtained
price-sensitive information, would be unable to give evidence.
Defence lawyers would therefore be unable to question him on issues such as
whether he had passed on the information concerned to people other than Mr
Byrd.
The judge, Mrs Anne Goddard QC, had ruled it would be unfair for the
prosecution to proceed in the circumstances, Mr Lawson said. The proper
course was for the jury to be instructed to acquit the three men rather than
leave matters in a state of 'permanent limbo' by leaving the charges on the
file, he added.
Mr Byrd had faced four charges of communicating unpublished price-sensitive
information while being a prohibited person and one charge of procuring
another person to deal in shares, all contrary to the Company Securities
(Insider Dealing) Act 1985. Mr Wilcocke and Mr Shear had faced single
charges of insider dealing. All three had denied the charges.
Mr Lawson had originally alleged that in early 1990 Mr Byrd passed on
unpublished, price-sensitive information about IMC to his co-defendants when
the company had been in financial trouble and its share price had fallen. Mr
Lawson alleged that Mr Byrd passed on the information that buyers were set
to take over the company and invest in it - information, he said, that was
likely to boost the company's share price.
Mr Wilcocke and Mr Shear had both bought IMC shares and sold when the price
rose, Mr Lawson had said.
CORRECTION
IN YESTERDAY'S report of the collapse of the trial in which Mr Graham Shear,
a London solicitor, was acquitted of insider trading, we incorrectly
reported that Mr Edmund Lawson QC, prosecuting counsel, alleged that Mr
Shear bought shares in International Media Communications, a USM-quoted
company, and sold them after the price rose. In fact, Mr Shear had sold his
shares at a loss after the share price had dropped.

A GROUP of British business executives is visiting Cuba for talks on trade
and investment opportunities in such fields as tourism, the oil industry and
bio-technology, Reuter reports from Havana.
'We are particularly interested in the Hispanic Caribbean. . . we see
opportunities for economic development,' Baroness Young, a former
Conservative minister and the delegation leader, said in Havana.
The 14 executives in the group were to have talks with Cuban trade officials
during their three-day stay on the communist-ruled island. Britain's
Caribbean trade advisory group organised the visit.
Mr Raul Taladrid, a vice-president of Cuba's state committee for economic
co-operation, told Lady Young that Cuba was interested in increasing its
trade relations with Britain.
Asked about Britain's attitude to the US trade embargo against the country,
which the Cuban government says hinders trade and investment from other
countries, Lady Young said: 'The British government's position is that we
have trade relations with Cuba and are interested in building them up'.

RUSSIA should start planning a national stock exchange system now before the
market is fragmented by the spontaneous proliferation of stock exchanges
across the country, according to a report financed by the European
Commission.
The report, by consultants Garside Miller Associates and solicitors Norton
Rose, also makes a series of recommendations to protect investors from
fraudulent practices likely to emerge with the market's rapid growth.
Although few company stocks are traded at present, their number is likely to
grow rapidly as the government sets about trying to privatise about 6,000
state-owned enterprises this year alone. Existing rules and a proposed
securities law which has yet to be adopted by parliament do not, for
instance, prohibit 'market manipulation' - the practice of trading solely to
induce others to buy or sell an investment.
With Russia on the verge of its first takeover battles, the report also
calls for rapid implementation of a takeover regime and more stringent
disclosure requirements.
Because Russia spans 10 time zones, and existing exchanges are in fierce
competition with each other, the Russian Stock Market Development Plan
recommends the US model of linking competing exchanges in one common
regulatory system.
Such a system would include provisions such as different computer systems
being compatible. It would also institute common dealing rules and
self-regulatory bodies to help police the market - although self-policing
would have to be reinforced by an independent state agency.
The alternative system of a single stock exchange with different branches
simply could not be implemented in Russia, although the report hopes that
competition will eventually reduce the excessive number of exchanges - 80
are now registered with the authorities.
The report also warns of external risks to the securities market, such as
the weakness of the banking system. It recommends that authorities urgently
put together new and more extensive capital adequacy regulations to limit
the risk of trouble in the banking sector spilling over into banks'
securities operations.
As the report notes in its dead-pan fashion, 'there is little respect for
the rule of law in Russia'. But it stresses the need for one international
agency, such as the World Bank's International Finance Corporation to
co-ordinate help so it is not wasted. For this purpose, it suggests the
development of a 'map' of the state of development of the market and
external aid to it.
The report, available in Russian and English, can be obtained upon written
request to Mr E Freyer, EC Co-ordination Unit, Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel,
Berezhkovskaya Nab. 2, 121059 Moscow, or by sending fax to Ms Gerlinde
Niehus at EC Commission in Brussels (fax 2951432).

FT  15 JUN 93 / US urges rules on exploitation of cheap labour
</HEADLINE>

A SENIOR official in the Clinton administration yesterday called for
stronger international labour regulation 'so that businesses cannot play one
country against another in the search for ever lower wages'.
Mr Jack Otero, deputy under-secretary of labour, speaking at the
International Metalworkers' Federation congress in Zurich, also said that
the International Labour Organisation, whose conventions are meant to
establish minimum standards, needed 'strengthening'.
Many labour organisations in the developed world are hoping that the US
administration will play a more interventionist role in regulation, but Mr
Otero would not be drawn on whether a social clause was required in any Gatt
trade agreement. He did, however, emphasise that the US Labour Department
was keen to see greater pressure on Malaysia, to allow full union rights in
the electronics industry. Malaysia, where many multinationals now operate,
has become a test case for international regulation.
A Gatt social clause was strongly supported yesterday by Mr Marcello
Malentacchi, IMF general secretary, who said that workers in the Third World
should not be unfairly penalised by companies and governments as they
entered the world's trading system. He adds that the challenge facing
policy-makers is to increase the living standards of people in the globe's
South without destroying jobs and living standards in the North.
'We do not seek to lay down wages, which will vary according to the level of
development of the country concerned, but we do consider that all the
workers of a country have the right to form unions, to negotiate and to go
on strike. Labour standards must be established so that worker exploitation
is not the primary focus of economic competition,' he said.
Mr Malentacchi said that the ILO should be the obvious agency to draw up a
social clause for Gatt, but questioned whether the organisation had the
'vigour' to do so. 'It is, for example, the World Bank that is drawing up
labour codes for African countries such as Mali and Senegal. It is not a
banker's job to draft labour law any more than it is the ILO's task to write
banking laws.'
Mr Owen Bieber, president of the American United Auto Workers, warned that,
without a proper social clause, the pending North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) would intensify pressures for downward harmonisation of
wages and working conditions - 'exactly the opposite of what should occur'.
The disparity in wages of US and Mexican auto workers is as much as 20:1.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Italy's telecom corruption probe widens: New arrest drags
state-run group Stet further into the scandal
</HEADLINE>

ITALY'S huge Stet public sector telecommunications group has been dragged
further into the political corruption scandal with the arrest yesterday of
Mr Francesco Silvano, managing director until earlier this month.
The detention of Mr Silvano, who gave himself up to Milan police, takes the
investigations into the telecommunications sector a further rung up Stet's
management ladder. Earlier arrests had involved executives of Stet
subsidiaries.
Telecommunications have become one of the most active areas of investigation
as magistrates pursue a number of leads involving contracts with the former
ASST state telecom agency. Inquiries are also believed to be proceeding on
suggestions that some telecom companies may have rigged bids. Last month,
police arrested Mr Luigi Montella and Mr Salvatore Randi, managing directors
of Stet's Sirti and Italtel subsidiaries.
Sirti handles network engineering while Italtel, in which AT&amp;T of the US has
a 20 per cent stake, is responsible for equipment manufacturing. The
chairman and managing director of Stet's small AET subsidiary have also been
detained.
Separately, Rome magistrates made three arrests following allegations of
corruption at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The inquiries
involve ASST, formerly controlled by the ministry, and broadcasting.
Magistrates also warned Mr Giorgio La Malfa, former leader of the Republican
party, and Mr Oscar Mammi, a senior Republican MP and ex-posts minister,
they were under investigation on allegations of receiving illicit funds and
illegal funding of political parties.
One of the three men arrested, Mr Giorgio Medri, was a Republican MP and
senior party official until last year. The arrests and warnings follow
recent leaks that the posts ministry was a big source of funds for the
political parties via kickbacks on telecommunications contracts and the
reorganisation of broadcasting frequencies. Mr Davide Giacalone, a former
assistant to Mr Mammi, is believed to have told magistrates L9bn (Dollars
6m) in kickbacks was paid between 1987 and 1990 to Mr Mammi. It is further
alleged that two of the three arrested men demanded kickbacks from a small
company, Federal Trade Misure, commissioned by the posts ministry to advise
on the frequency reorganisation. The allocation of such a complex and
sensitive task to an unknown company has already attracted the attention of
magistrates.
In another line of investigation, magistrates arrested Mr Ugo Montevecchi, a
former managing director of Fiat's Impresit construction arm, on allegations
of corruption and rigged bidding for contracts. The arrest marks a blow for
Fiat, which has been gradually returning to normal after the detention of a
number of top executives in recent months, most of whom are now back at
work. Mr Montevecchi had already been interrogated by Milan and Turin
magistrates investigating other leads in the corruption scandal.
The latest allegations reportedly refer to kickbacks from Fiat Impresit to
politicians for restoration projects at Italian museums.

FT  15 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: BET active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in business services group BET rose to a hefty 13m, its highest
daily total for more than six months after the board confirmed market
expectations of a cut in the final dividend.
Total dividend for the year to March 1993 is to be 3.25p, compared with 6.5p
last year. Losses were sharply reduced to Pounds 9.8m, against Pounds
448.4m.
With the dividend cut already discounted by many in the market the shares,
after dipping to 103p, rose to end a net 3 ahead at 111p, assisted by the
strong market trend and a robust presentation. Analysts, however, remain
sceptical about prospects for profits growth this year and one said: 'The
jury is still out on this one even though the management has done all the
right things to restructure the company.'
Modest, if unremarkable, confidence surrounded most food companies.
Cadbury-Schweppes enjoyed the added filip of favourable weekend press
comment to move up 6 to 465p, having fallen back from a high of 469p in a
volume of 2.9m. Unilever put on 13 to close at 1044p and Dalgety added 7 to
reach 450p. United Biscuits increased its price by 1 to 389p while Kwik Save
slid the opposite way to lose 4 at 736p after a sell note.
The official launch in the US of its anti-inflammatory asthma drug Tilade
triggered a surge of exceptionally heavy activity in Fisons shares.
Turnover of 11m was the heaviest single-day's business in the stock since
early-April when the Fisons share price tumbled almost 13 per cent after the
company cancelled further development work on another asthma drug,
Tipredane.
Fisons' stock price touched 163p early in the session before slipping back
to finish 6 1/2 higher on balance at 161 1/2 p.
As well as the buying prompted by Tilade's US launch, dealers said there
remained a strong undercurrent of takeover speculation surrounding Fisons,
which last week dropped out of the prestigious FT-SE 100 Index. Prominent
among a number of big names said to be monitoring Fisons' progress is
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group. SmitKline 'A'
moved up 6 1/2 to 436p on good turnover of 1.9m.
BT shares gave a positive response to news of the pricing of the first and
second instalments of the BT3 issue along with details of investor
incentives. The shares forged ahead 10 1/2 to 423 1/2 p on turnover of 5.9m
as the hardcore marketing of the issue to international and domestic
investors got under way.
Fall-out from the DIY price battle was blamed for the decline, against the
day's trend, in Kingfisher shares from 590p to 586p. Kingfisher, which owns
the B&amp;Q chain, was pitted against an aggressive pricing campaign from Texas
Homecare over the weekend.
Analysts also fear for the long term health of DIY - especially after
Ladbroke Group yesterday told its shareholders that Texas's performance had
disappointed in recent weeks.
'The underlying trend is pretty weak,' said one stores specialist.
The combination of tough pricing and fears for overall DIY strength is a
potent one for Kingfisher, which is estimated to derive 35 per cent of its
profits from DIY. Another analyst said the dip was also partly attributable
to a general slide in consumer spending.
Elsewhere in companies with a DIY interest, WH Smith 'A' slipped 4 to 439p
and Boots, which shares the Do It All venture with Smith, relinquished 2 at
435p.
Hefty switching out of Barclays and into National Westminster saw the latter
move ahead 7 to 475p and the former ease 2 to 465p. Vague bid speculation
continued to drive TSB, which closed 4 harder at 195p on 5.5m traded.
A Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation triggered keen demand for Commercial
Union, 11 stronger at 597p.
East Midlands Electricity, the first of the regional electricity companies
to report preliminary results, set a high standard by lifting the dividend
by 14 per cent. The shares climbed 6 to 456p. Specialists said the 'recs'
offered much less regulatory risk than other utilities.
North West Water shot up 16 to 468p as marketmakers scrambled to cover short
positions and to accommodate special cum scrip dividend buying.
After seeing light trading, property companies fell victim to some
nervousness in the final hour or so of the market. British Land retreated 9
to finish at 311p and MEPC lost 3 to 422p.
British Gas shrugged off worries about the recent weakness in oil prices and
moved up 4 1/2 to 297p following a buy recommendation issued by Kleinwort
Benson Securities. Turnover in the stock reached 4.7m shares.
Kleinwort's oil and gas team said fears over the forthcoming Monopolies and
Mergers Commission report 'are already discounted', pointing to the yield
relative which is close to a five-year high.
'Unregulated upstream assets are set to provide significant growth, leading
to a progressive rerating of the shares which, on a 6 per cent-plus yield,
are attractive,' Kleinwort said.
Bass moved ahead 21 to 488p and Allied-Lyons rose 15 to 545, both in
moderate dealings. After falling back slightly towards the end of trading,
Grand Metropolitan put on 7 at 418p in a volume of 2.4m.

FT  15 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shell in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another slide in international crude oil prices, down more than Dollars 1 a
barrel to around Dollars 17.60 since last week's Opec meeting in Geneva,
brought renewed pressure on the oils sector, with the exception of Shell
Transport.
Marginally easier during early trading, Shell rallied strongly during the
afternoon as the company gave what one oil sector analyst described as 'a
powerful and impressive' presentation to London investment specialists.
Shell delivered a similar message during the past two weeks to a number of
high-powered European and US institutions, which saw the share price race up
to a record 630p.
The group was said to have emphasised again its determination to carry
through a policy of cost-cutting and portfolio rationalisation. 'The company
is seen as adopting a ruthless attitude to all its divisions; perform or be
prepared to be slimmed down, sold off or chopped,' said an analyst who
attended the meeting.
At the close Shell stood 5 higher at 625p after 2.4m turnover. Other leading
oils were hit by the slide in crude prices. British Petroleum declined 4 to
310p, apparently affected by profit-taking from the US, where some of the
income funds that bought the shares aggressively last year were said to be
'top-slicing'. Turnover in BP was a hefty 9.3m.
The two leading UK oil exploration and production stocks also encountered
selling. Enterprise Oil lost 2 to 474p and Lasmo, turfed out of the FT-SE
100 Index last week, eased further to 160p.

FT  15 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca pressures continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES over the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue continued to overshadow the two
classes of Zeneca stock, in spite of highly encouraging news that one of the
group's key new drugs, Zestril, had been approved for distribution in the US
by that country's Food and Drug Administration.
Zestril is used in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Zeneca 'old'
shares managed a minor improvement at 617p after relatively high turnover of
4.2m, while the 'new' nil-paid stock settled a penny easier at 17p. There
were suggestions in the market that moves to relax US rules on trading in
Zeneca shares by marketmakers involved in the rights issue may well be
successful.
Marketmakers at firms involved in the issue are at present precluded from an
'active' trading role in Zeneca shares if the stock price falls to within 10
per cent of the 'rights' price in the five days prior to the close of the
offer.
ICI surged ahead 16 to close at a record post-Zeneca demerger high of 707p.
Turnover was a hefty 5.9m shares and said to have been boosted by keen local
and US buying interest.

FT  15 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Futures drive equities to testing
point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NERVES WERE drawn as tight as piano wires on the UK equity trading desks
yesterday as the London market tested the higher end of its trading range
amid heavy arbitrage dealings between blue chip equities and stock index
futures. The FT-SE 100 Index closed at 2,885.5, a gain of 23.7 points
bringing it to the very peak of existing investment confidence, and leaving
the market poised on the edge of uncertainty.
UK stocks were also responding to renewed optimism on interest rates ahead
of tonight's important Mansion House speech in the City of London by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. A cut in rates in
France, hard on the heels of the similar move in Italy on Friday, raised
hopes in London that the new chancellor might seize the opportunity to
reduce UK base rates soon, if not tonight.
Strategists also pointed out that the wider political backcloth might have
become more favourable for equities, in spite of the uncertainties
overhanging the position of Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. Political
commentators in the UK press have suggested that the government, and the new
chancellor, are focusing on cuts in public expenditure and that increases in
taxation are regarded as less likely.
But traders warned that much of yesterday's business in equities was driven
by arbitrage activity spurred by the expiry this Friday of both the FT-SE
100 June future contract and also the range of stock index options.
Trading volume in equities was slow to develop until the futures markets got
into their stride; Seaq turnover was still under 90m shares at 10.00am. By
the close the total had reached 500.1m shares, against 528.9m on Friday when
retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.17bn.
At best, the Footsie reached 2,891.6 yesterday, only about 2.2 per cent
below the peak attained at the beginning of March. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index,
although driven less strongly than the Footsie yesterday, rose 10.3 to an
all-time peak of 3,213.2.
Caution was expressed by several market strategists, who pointed to this
week's heavy list of UK economic data. While there was little immediate
response to the news yesterday that factory gate output prices had risen by
an annualised 4 per cent in May, London markets still have to face the
latest data on UK industrial production, today, and retail sales, wages,
unemployment, money supply and the retail price index, all due this week.
Further doubt over yesterday's upsurge in share prices was cast by clear
signs that the marketmakers had been 'caught all the wrong way', as one
dealer expressed it. They were trying to sell the June stock index future
and buy the underlying equities from one another just when, unfortunately,
all their rivals wanted to do the same to them.
Amid this confusion, it was hardly surprising that many analysts continued
to warn against the high valuations now showing in the UK equity market, in
tandem with a somewhat unimpressive round of company results in the past
fortnight.
While the stock market may hang fire today as it waits for the chancellor to
address the City dignitaries, the Footsie is likely to be tested strongly
when equities open on Wednesday.

FT  15 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading

<TEXT>
A TECHNICAL squeeze in Footsie futures sent the June contract sharply ahead,
breaking out of its recent trading range ahead of its expiry on Friday,
writes Joel Kibazo.
Futures opened in a subdued mood but gathered momentum from early buying,
amid talk of a possible reduction in British base rates to follow a similar
move in France.
Although it had little in the way of firm offers, June was soon squeezed
forward, pulling the underlying cash market higher.
Producer price index figures (PPI) in line with forecasts only served to
increase demand and the contract broke through 2,900.
The day's high of 2,904 was reached just after 2pm, with sentiment boosted
by a firm UK gilts sector.
Dealers said there had been some arbitraging between the cash and futures
markets and there was also a significant amount of rolling forward into the
September contract, which takes over as the forward contract on Monday. A
strong premium to cash was maintained throughout the session.
Following a bout of profit-taking, June finished at 2,895, a 10-point
premium to cash. Volume in the contract was 11,964 lots, while just over
5,000 were dealt in the September contract.
In contrast, the traded options remained dull, with a total of 24,215 lots
dealt, compared with Friday's 26,314 contracts.

FT  15 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei under pressure as
yen reaches a further high

THE YEN'S rise to a new post-war high soured investor confidence and share
prices lost ground on futures-led selling, in the thinnest trading for three
months, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Volume fell to 250m shares, its lowest since March 3. A total of 645.7m
shares changed hands last Friday on futures-led trading. The Nikkei average
lost 103.60 to 20,397.35 after a high of 20,560.08 in the morning session
and a low of 20,351.47 in the afternoon.
Declines led advances by 737 to 276, with 172 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks shed 1.58 to 1,659.46. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.50 to 1,246.06.
The dollar closed at Y105.20, up Y1.12. Uncertainty over the effects on
corporate profits unnerved investors, who remained on the sidelines.
Meanwhile, research divisions of leading Japanese brokers revised down
profits forecasts for the current year to March due to the recent strength
of the yen.
Most forecasts, however, are based on an exchange rate of around Y110 to
Y114 to the dollar. Daiwa Research Institute said a rise of Y1 against the
dollar would depress pre-tax profits on an all-industry basis by 0.4 per
cent.
Exporters were hit by the higher yen, with Toshiba, the day's most active
issue, falling Y16 to Y714 and Hitachi dipping Y4 to Y865. However, electric
power utilities, which import fuel, were among the top gainers, the sector
rising by 1.7 per cent. Tokyo Electric Power advanced Y70 to Y3,860.
Daiei, the supermarket chain, announced that it will absorb three affiliated
retailers: Chujitsuya, listed on the Tokyo SE first section, Uneed Daiei,
listed on the second section of the Osaka SE, and the unlisted Dainaha.
Trading was suspended for the three companies.
Ichiken, a construction company belonging to the Daiei group, surged ahead
Y110 to Y1,110, and other retailers advanced on hopes of similar moves in
the industry. Matsuya appreciated Y33 to Y780.
The higher yen encouraged hopes of lower interest rates. Banks firmed on
hopes of wider profit margins, with Industrial Bank of Japan gaining Y10 at
Y3,040 and Bank of Tokyo Y40 at Y1,510.
Konami, the video game maker, climbed Y160 to a year's high of Y4,510 on
hopes of strong earnings. The com-pany's move to change the minimum trading
unit of its stock to 100 shares from 1,000 also encouraged investors.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 151.59 to 22,934.59 in volume of 11.6m
shares.
Roundup
THE MUTED share price tone in Tokyo was mostly echoed in the Pacific Basin
region, where Hong Kong and Australia were closed for public holidays.
SINGAPORE was led down by banks and shipyards as spillover selling from last
Friday dampened trade. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 10.42 to
1,842.63, losers including UOB Foreign, DBS Foreign, Sembawang Shipyard and
Sembawang Maritime.
Volume expanded from 227.95m to 311.18m shares. Malaysian stocks continued
to see active trading amid strong over-the-counter speculative buying in
selected issues such as Renong and Idris.
KUALA LUMPUR eased back after last Friday's high on Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's visit to China, and the market's projection of lucrative deals for
Malaysian companies.
The KLSE composite index closed 3.13 down on the day at 743.16 after setting
an intraday all-time high of 753.54 which, as in Singapore, was reflected in
speculative activity in smaller Malaysian companies. Volume climbed from
635.9m to 808.2m shares.
SEOUL fell for the fourth consecutive session on profit-taking in thin
trading, the composite stock index weakening 6.39 to 759.47 in turn-over
down from Won644.06bn to Won596.95bn.
TAIWAN's weighted index dropped 43.87 to 4,177.20 as turnover fell to
TDollars 11.7bn, its lowest in a full session since January.
Conflict within the ruling Nationalist party ahead of local government
elections at the end of this year, and an official investigation into
irregular stock trade, continued to hurt sentiment.
KARACHI marked Pakistan's budget day with the KSE index 1.27 higher at
1,183.73, but, in BOMBAY, last week's depressive kerb trade phenomenon
continued.
Indian brokers reported no buy enquiries at all as the BSE index closed
436.36 lower at 2,357.64, and as major blue chips fell around 1 per cent
further on the kerb.
BANGKOK defied the general trend in the region, ris-ing strongly across the
board in active trade following Sat-urday's parliamentary defeat of the
opposition's motion of no confidence in the gov-ernment.
The SET index ended 15.10, or 1.8 per cent, higher at 868.24 in turnover of
Bt7.40bn, the biggest daily trade in four months.

FT  15 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets cautious ahead of
CPI data
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended marginally firmer yesterday as dealers and investors
braced themselves for the second set of important inflation data in three
days, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 9.68 up at 3,514.69. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 edged up 0.45 to 447.71 and the Nasdaq composite gained 3.22 at
696.41. Volume on the New York SE was 216m shares, while falls and rises ran
almost neck and neck at 952 to 945.
After Friday's promising producer prices report for May (the producer prices
index was flat for the month), which helped assuage fears that a resurgence
in inflation would force up interest rates, the markets opened in a broadly
positive mood. Further gains in Treasury prices, which pushed bond yields
lower, also helped to improve equity investor sentiment.
The advance in stocks, however, was modest, and the Dow struggled all day to
post double-digit gains in light trading. A fear of trading ahead of today's
consumer prices data was behind the markets' subdued showing.
Although analysts are forecasting that the consumer prices index for May
will have risen by only 0.2 per cent, dealers and investors were aware that
a surprisingly strong CPI number could derail both stocks and bonds.
Eastman Kodak jumped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 53 3/4 in volume of 2.36m
shares after the company unexpectedly announced plans for a meeting with
investors and analysts today. Kodak did not explain why it was calling the
meeting, but analysts speculated that the company may announce some form of
restructuring.
Technology stocks, which have been see-sawing wildly in recent trading
sessions, were mixed in heavy trading yesterday. Hewlett-Packard climbed
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 87 1/2 , Compaq advanced Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars
55 7/8 and Motorola put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 84 5/8 , but Unisys eased
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 11 1/4 and IBM declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 52.
US Surgical fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 in volume of 2.67m shares
as investors got the first chance to respond to Friday's forecast by the
company that because of declining sales it will post a loss in the second
quarter of the year, compared with a year ago profit of 58 cents a share.
Johnson Products forged ahead Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 on the
American Stock Exchange after Ivax announced that it was buying the company
for somewhere between Dollars 61m and Dollars 73m. Johnson, however, said it
may consider other offers.
Canada
TORONTO recovered from slight weakness to end a fairly quiet day of trade on
a mixed note. The selection of defence minister Kim Campbell to replace
outgoing Prime Minister Brian Mulroney eased some political worries, traders
said. Gold issues, which have led the market over the last few months,
turned round from midday softness to end firmer.
The TSE 300 index put on 5.7 at 3,872.2 but declines narrowly led advances
by 363 to 332. Volume contracted to 46.5m shares. Yesterday's turnover was
boosted by a block trade of 5.4m Talisman Energy shares.
Newbridge Networks declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100
per cent stock dividend. The shares surged CDollars 4 3/4 to CDollars 110
1/2.

JOHANNESBURG saw a decline in gold shares on worries that the bullion price
was due for a correction. The index lost 89, or 5.4 per cent to 1,562, as
industrials shed 6 to 4,590 and the overall 45 to 3,904. Vaal Reefs fell R15
to R275.

FT  15 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe offsets declines in US and Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S senior equity markets showed solid gains last week, counteracting
negative movements in Finland, Norway, Sweden and Spain. Elsewhere in the
world, falls in the US and Japan - the former unnerved all week by unfounded
worries regarding a rise in inflation - helped to push the FT-Actuaries
World Index slightly lower.
Commenting on the situation in Europe, Mr Andrew Bell, a strategist at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, remains cautious. He believes that, while
the underlying feeling is for further rate cuts, the likelihood is that, in
the short term, falls will only offset more bad monetary news.
On a 12-month view, he forecasts German interest rates at around 4 per cent;
but he sees no alteration from the present 'salami slice' approach,
employing incremental cuts rather than aggressive reductions.
This latter point is taken up by the broker UBS, which observes, in its
latest global research weekly, that the Bundesbank is trying to bring down
short term rates 'in such a way as to not undermine its own credibility and
that of the D-Mark . . . With inflation remaining well above its medium term
objective and fiscal policy out of kilter, an aggressive easing would look
like panic'.
Spain eased over the week following the re-election of the Socialist
government. Goldman Sachs notes that investors should expect short term
underperformance since many market participants had been forecasting a
victory for the Partido Popular.
While reducing its short term weighting in Spain, Goldman remains overweight
on a 12-month view, given what it calculates as the market's current 35 to
40 per cent undervaluation.
Malaysia featured among rising Asian markets on hopes of trade deals with
China as Mr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, prepared to visit Beijing.

FT  15 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses feature mixture
of performances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES produced a varied performance yesterday, especially where the
peripheral markets were concerned, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN got little support from Friday's after hours discount rate cut, as
attention remained firmly fixed on Ferruzzi and Montedison. Rumours over the
weekend suggesting that two candidates had turned down invitations to head
the group's restructuring programme added to the general mood of despondency
as the Comit index ended 4.45 lower at 527.44.
Montedison was suspendedyesterday after a fall of 14 per cent to L840.
Attempts to fix the prices were later aborted as unofficial trading saw the
stock quoted as low as L750. Ferruzzi sank another L73, or 10 per cent to
L659.
The banking sector was another loser on an initially negative reaction to
the repeal of legislation preventing banks from taking stakes in industry.
This had been long expected as part of the government's privatisation
process, but commentators noted that it had come at a bad time: there were
worries, they said, that banks might be forced into taking stakes in
companies to which they were already exposed, rather than making new
investments.
As a result two of the banks on the list for early privatisation saw sharp
falls: Credito Italiano by L158 to L2,535 and BCA by L204 to L5,038.
PARIS had already discounted a 25 basis point repo rate cut towards the end
of last week, so reaction to yesterday's event was muted. The CAC-40 index
advanced to a day's high of 1,928, before drifting back to close 3.59 lower
at 1,916.84. Turnover was moderate at FFr2.2bn.
Expectations that a joint venture between Matra Hachette and Cap-Gemini
Sogeti would land a US airforce order saw their respective shares gain
FFr3.50 and FFr3.00 to FFr123.50 and FFr190.70.
Peugeot, which announced plans to raise up to FFr2bn on the bond market,
advanced FFr6 to FFr527.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index rose 1.3 to 108.4. Lehman Brothers forecast
that interest rates in the Netherlands, now the lowest in Europe, 'will
remain below those in Germany for the foreseeable future'.
Hoogovens continued to improve following last week's gains, yesterday
putting on Fl 1.60 to Fl 33.70 while another cyclical, DSM, rose Fl1.60 to
Fl 86.20.
Interest in cyclical stocks has developed following a Goldman Sachs note in
which Mr Philip van den Berg forecasts that they will outperform the market
by 5-10 per cent over the next 12 months, estimating that cyclicals are
presently undervalued by about 30 per cent.
FRANKFURT continued to pursue its technical rally, the DAX index closing
11.00 higher at 1,691.98.
Turnover rose from DM5.8bn to DM5.9bn. There were sizeable individual gains
in Siemens, DM8.80 better at DM627.30 as dealers said that the electricals
giant had lagged behind the market recently, and in Lufthansa, up DM4.40 at
DM107.90.
But as on Friday, the outstanding sector gain came in carmakers. BMW rose
DM10.50 to DM483.50 and Daimler by DM10 to DM597.50.
Ms Deborah Boys, technical analyst at James Capel in London, said that
between two and three weeks ago the sector was approaching the historic lows
it had seen in 1988, 1991 and 1992. 'If it had broken below previous lows,'
she said, 'we would have been looking at a major downgrading involving a
large sector of the market, and investors were not prepared to accept this.'
ZURICH continued its consolidation, the SMI index dropping 14.1 to 2,294.2.
Chemicals saw profit-taking, with Sandoz certificates, down SFr60 at
SFr3,170.
BRUSSELS rose on hopes of a Bundesbank interest rate cut this Thursday, the
Bel-20 index ending 10.89 higher at 1,224.44 in volume of 809m shares.
The video screen producer, Barco, rose BFr95, or 6.3 per cent to BFr1,595.
However, the interest rate sensitive majors also moved well, Electrabel
rising BFr90 to BFr5,880 in a strong utilities section and, in banks,
Generale de Banque putting on BFr140 to BFr7,800.
VIENNA extended last week's pickup with a gain of 1.5 per cent, the ATX
index closing 12.46 higher at 850.19. The market was led up by Verbund,
Austria's national electricity supplier, which leapt by Sch40, or 7.3 per
cent to Sch590 on aggressive buying by a foreign investor.
WARSAW went limit up instead of limit down, excess demand forcing the bourse
to suspend trade in 11 stocks as the WIG index jumped 253, or 9.6 per cent
to 2,890.8. Because of the suspensions, turnover was the lowest in three
months at about 42bn zloty.
ISTANBUL responded to the appointment of Mrs Tansu Ciller as prime minister
with a 10.5 per cent gain in the market index, up 925.16 to 9,760.67.
Ms Nur Pekin of Schroders in London said that the market was enthusiastic
about the appointment since Mrs Ciller had been responsible for legislation
earlier this year which had encouraged equity investment, and had led to a
rise in the market index of some 136 per cent since the start of the year.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar/yen breaks new ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN moved to another post-war high against the dollar in early European
trading yesterday following the lack of any visible progress in the
US/Japanese trade talks at the weekend, writes James Blitz.
In Monday's Asian trading, the dollar came under intense selling pressure,
moving from around Y106 at the start of the session to around Y105.20 by the
close in Tokyo.
Shortly after London opened, the dollar moved down to Y105.00 and stayed at
that level for much of the day. As trading in the UK capital drew to a
close, it was again under pressure, touching Y105.02: there was no sign of
intervention from the Federal Reserve throughout the day. In New York,
however, the dollar improved to end at Y105.10.
The most obvious reason for yesterday's move was the lack of substantive
success in the US/Japanese trade talks at the weekend. The US has pressed
Japan to set an explicit target for cutting its huge trade surplus with the
US, but the lack of any agreement led dealers to think that Washington would
press ahead with its dollar depreciation policy.
Mr Mark Austin of Midland Global Markets in London believes the pressure on
the US currency results from the huge quantity of dollars which Japanese
exporters are still holding on to, and which they have not yet hedged.
Mr Austin believes that these companies have refrained from selling dollars
in the hope that the yen might reverse its rise. But as the Japanese
currency continues to appreciate, these dollars are being sold.
A strong view in the market is that Y100 is now within sight. At least one
dealer was prepared to bet yesterday that a clear break of Y100 might even
cause a new round of panic among Japanese investors, forcing the dollar down
much further.
But some European investors think the yen has reached such high levels that
it is risky to buy the Japanese currency from here. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of
research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, believes it is particularly
expensive for European dealers to climb on board the yen bandwagon, now the
currency is at Y64.71 to the D-Mark.
With so much attention on the yen, there was little scope for dealers to
push European currencies very far. The dollar was stuck in range trading
against the D-Mark, with the market awaiting this week's consumer price
inflation data in the US, and the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday.
The dollar ended at DM1.6240, against DM1.6255. In New York it finished at
DM1.6285.
The franc held at FFr3.363 per D-Mark in spite of another cut in French
interest rates. Sterling was  1/2 pfennig up at DM2.4800. Mr O'Neill expects
the pound to move sharply after Mr Kenneth Clarke's keynote Mansion House
Speech today. 'With little happening on the European crosses, the speech
will get more attention than it deserves,' he said.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Bundesbank ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of France yest-erday cut both of its most important interest rates
on a day which underlined how European monetary policy is decoupling itself
from the Bundesbank's strategy, writes James Blitz.
The French central bank lowered its intervention rate by 25 basis points to
7.25 per cent, and its 5 to 10-day lending rate by the same amount to 8.25
per cent. The move was France's eighth reduction in interest rates in two
months.
The move was widely anticipated by the market and had virtually no effect on
French cash and futures prices. But the importance of yesterday's move was
that it followed a long period in which the Bundesbank had kept interest
rate policy on hold, amid a weakening of the D-Mark in the European exchange
rate mechanism.
That potential weakness of the D-Mark yesterday encouraged two other central
banks to make important announcements.
The Portuguese authorities cut their mop-up rate by 75 basis points to 11.25
per cent. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank chief, was also
reported as saying that he would like to lower his country's interest rates
as soon as possible, and would not necessarily follow the Bundesbank.
French short-term interest rates have been below those in Germany for
several weeks now. The French intervention rate, for example, was some 35
basis points below the German repo rate, while three-month French francs
were yesterday afternoon some 22 basis points beneath three-month D-Marks on
the bid side.
Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the French budget minister, said there was still room
for a decline in French rates, even if German rates remain on hold. Mr Jean
Michel Charpin, chief economist of BNP in Paris, said there was a chance
that the three-month spreads could widen in the near future. But, further
out, he expected the rates to converge again as the D-Mark and French franc
remained tied to a parity.
Sterling markets were quiet in the run-up to Mr Kenneth Clarke's first
Mansion House Speech today as chancellor. Three-month money eased to 5 7/8
per cent yesterday from Friday's 5 15/16 per cent, following a small Pounds
500m shortage. The September short sterling contract rose 2 basis points to
finish at 94.17.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold destined to remain asset
of last resort - The central banks deny their actions will disrupt the
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL banks are unlikely to change their basic attitude of considering
gold as a reserve asset of last resort, delegates to the Financial Times
World Gold Conference were told yesterday.
Mrs Agnes Van den Berge, head of foreign exchange at the Banque Nationale de
Belgique, also ruled out the possibility of the central banks disrupting the
gold market by their actions.
Last year, Belgium sold 202 tonnes of gold, raising BFR61.5bn, (Pounds
1.2bn) and lifting its foreign currency reserves by 30 per cent, and also
cutting the share of gold in its total reserves to about 50 per cent.
'This level corresponds to the proportion of gold in the total reserves of
the principal neighbouring countries, and this change in the composition of
the reserves will facilitate the participation of the Bank in the process of
European monetary unification,' said Mrs Van den Berge.
Gold accounts for about one quarter of total international reserves compared
with 58 per cent in 1980. Holdings, however, have been stable but their
dollar value has fallen considerably.
At the same time, foreign exchange reserves have increased.
Mrs Van den Berge said that in addition to the traditional role as a last
resort, gold would be increasingly be used as collateral against borrowing:
'Because credit and counter-party risk is becoming a major concern in
financial markets,' she said.
Gold was also seen as a means of diversifying reserves. By lending it out in
the form of gold instruments, such as swaps, it had become a potential
interest-earning asset.
Mrs Van den Berge could not foresee a big change in official gold holdings:
'I do not rule out, however, that the uneven distribution between central
banks will become more equal. Furthermore, central banks will manage their
stocks more actively in order to earn a return on it.'
Dr Ercan Kumcu, vice-governor of the Turkish central bank, said Turkey had
no plans to buy or sell from its reserves, which stand at 126 tonnes.
'We think that the present volume of gold reserves is the right size, not
more and not less than the amount that should be kept when compared to the
total foreign exchange reserves of the country,' he said in a speech to the
conference.
The increasing uncertainties facing the mining industry in North America
were highlighted by Mr Neil Westoll, a senior vice-president of Lac
Minerals, of Canada: 'In many ways, the governments in North America have
turned their backs on natural resources because of pressure from
environmental and land-use groups,' he said.
Over the last decade, environmental costs had risen significantly. A recent
survey of 10 of the 16 biggest mining groups in Canada showed that
reclamation costs had risen from CDollars 1m (Pounds 500,000) in 1986 to
CDollars 250m in 1991. Prosecutions for environmental offences were also
sharply up.
While the industry had increased productivity per-man-shift by 45 per cent
since 1989, and cut costs 16 per cent, it was worried by the prospect of
continually-changing legislation. In the US, for example, royalty and tax
proposals could drop the rate of return on a mine below acceptable limits.
South Africa, still the biggest gold producer in the world, had benefited
from the lower gold prices of recent years by developing a leaner and fitter
industry, said Mr Bobby Godsell, president of the South African Chamber of
Mines and an executive director of Anglo American.
His positive assessment of South Africa's political future was shared by Mr
Richard Menell, finance manager at Anglovaal. But Mr Menell believed it
would take several years of stability under any new government, plus high
gold prices, to attract the finance for major new deep goldmines.
Development of such a mine involved capital costs of up to USDollars 1bn,
and a lead time of five to 10 years before a positive cash flow emerged, he
said. The political risks and the risk of a lower gold price were too high
to attract long-term investors at the moment.
South African production would fall from 620 tonnes to 500 tonnes by the end
of the century, he predicted. This level could be maintained for some years
but very few mines had secure lives beyond 2010.
'Therefore, in order to maintain long-term gold output, new projects must
commence development by the year 2000,' he said.
Gold production from the Pacific Rim would rise to 470 tonnes by the year
2000 from 400 tonnes last year, said Mr David Tyrwhitt, consulting geologist
and a director of Normandy-Anglo-Asian.
The main growth would come in Indonesia from 44 tonnes to 78 tonnes and
Papua New Guinea, which could reach 120 tonnes if the Lihir project went
ahead and Bougainville re-opened. Last year, Papua New Guinea produced 74
tonnes.
THE FT Gold Mines Index is to be relaunched in an improved form later this
year, it was announced yesterday.
Whereas the existing index, started in 1955, is based on London Stock
Exchange dealings in 21 South African gold mine shares, its replacement will
include many of the important US, Canadian and Australian groups and will
not be restricted to London dealings.
It is expected to represent just over half the western world's gold mine
output.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reform changes the face of
Albania's farming sector - Meat and dairy production has risen at the
expense of cereals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPARED WITH what happened in other parts of Albania, Mr Abdyl Shehi thinks
the privatisation of Peza collective farm went well.
'Some people who weren't satisfied with the share-out vandalised the
irrigation equipment, and now they try to move in and cultivate other
people's land. But we're lucky because there hasn't been any violence,' he
says.
Mr Shehi and his family own a one-hectare (2.47-acre) holding, considerably
less than the Albanian average of just under two hectares. But he has better
access to a market than other farmers: there is a daily bus to Tirana where
his wife sells their produce - potatoes, onions and spinach - in the bazaar.
More than 90 per cent of agricultural land and livestock has been shared out
among workers on collective farms in the two years since Albania officially
abandoned Stalinist self-sufficiency.
Land distribution, however, is still under dispute in the mountainous north
of the country, where most land is of poor quality. Although pre-communist
titles were considered void under the privatisation law, some villagers have
tried to claim back their old holdings by attacking the new owners.
Privatisation has brought a 30 per cent increase in milk and meat production
since 1991 as farmers built up flocks of sheep and goats, a form of
husbandry neglected in the communist period. Cows owned by the collectives
were handed over to individual farmers. But a shortage of feed and high
rates of disease have reduced their numbers, according to the agriculture
ministry.
The switch to subsistence farming, together with the breakdown of the state
distribution network for seeds and fertiliser, meant, however, that
production of cereals dropped by almost 60 per cent in 1991-92.
Albania has relied on food aid, mostly provided by the European Community,
for two successive winters. While wheat production this year is forecast to
rise 20 per cent to about 320,000 tonnes, another 300,000 tonnes will still
have to be imported.
Large-scale production of cereals is unlikely to resume until the land law
is reformed, allowing villagers to sell their holdings and create larger
farms. Meanwhile, efforts are being made to help improve output by
introducing market mechanisms to Albanian agriculture.
The US Agency for International Development has backed a project to develop
a market in fertiliser. A total of 30,000 tonnes of fertiliser, provided by
the International Fertiliser Development Centre, was sold through auction to
more than 150 would-be dealers.
More than half the bidders were unemployed agronomists who lost their jobs
when the collective farms were privatised. Much of the fertiliser, urea and
phosphate for winter wheat and summer crops, was sold direct to farmers with
a profit margin for the dealers of more than 100 per cent.
'We've made businessmen of many of the staff from the collective farms. The
fertiliser dealers will be well placed to market other inputs like seeds,
pesticides and machinery,' says Mr Ray Diamond, who headed the IFDC project.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US wins round in Canadian hog
war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time in three attempts US pork producers last week won a round
in their ongoing fight for tariffs on hogs from Canada, but they continue to
criticise the dispute settlement process established by the US-Canada Free
Trade Agreement.
A binational panel last week upheld duties imposed on Canadian hogs after
the US International Trade Commission found that Canadian subsidies to its
hog farmers injured US producers.
The panel found that the subsidies did injure US producers during the period
from April 1, 1989 to March 31, 1990.
Mr Charles Harness, a spokesman for the US National Pork Producers Council,
said he was pleased with the decision, but that his organisation continues
to have problems with the process.
'We think the (dispute settlement) process needs some reworking so a panel
cannot overrule US law,' Mr Harness said.
In 1989 a panel reversed tariffs imposed on pork products entering the US on
the grounds there was not substantial evidence that the imports were causing
injury to US pork producers.
In 1992 another binational panel ruled there was not substantial evidence to
uphold tariffs on live hogs for a period from 1988 to 1989.
Canadian pork producers said they will probably not challenge the decision.
'While we do not agree with the result we will live with it in this case,'
said Mr Tom Smith, president of the Canadian Pork Council.
Mr Smith said the period under investigation was a particularly hard one for
Canadian pig farmers and therefore they did receive relatively large
subsidies.
He said the subsidies are much lower and a panel reviewing later periods
would be unlikely to find that US pork producers were injured by Canadian
subsidies.
Generally Canadian producers are satisfied with the existing dispute
settlement process, but the panel had strong criticism for the warring
parties.
It chastised all involved for failing to comply with their obligation to
file the correct documents promptly.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gold market has turned higher in the past two months for good
fundamental reasons, Mr Robert Guy, director of NM Rothschild, told the
conference. Central bank sales were seen as less of a threat and the mining
industry was more confident.
Investors had been slow to react but they had returned to the market and
appeared unconcerned by the fall in physical demand. The gold price,
however, was low enough to attract more demand once buyers were used to the
level, said Mr Guy.
Mr Brian Marber, an independent technical analyst, said gold met all the
criteria for a bull market. He suggested it would end only in the event of
the afternoon fix on the London bullion market falling below Dollars 339.60
a troy ounce (the level at which it stood when the one-month average started
to rise) 'in which case a test of the March low at Dollars 326.10 would be
likely to follow'.

INDONESIA IS setting fire to hundreds of tonnes of aromatic nutmeg in a
desperate attempt to boost world prices, a trade ministry official said
yesterday, reports Reuter from Jakarta.
Oversupply on the world market had for some years depressed the value of the
spice, he said. Indonesia produces 70 per cent of the world's supply of
12,000 tonnes a year and Grenada the remaining 30 per cent. Indonesian
traders are trying to decide what to do with the 5,000 tonnes in stocks they
hold. Last week exporters set fire to 300 tonnes of the spice and sent
prices up Dollars 50 (Pounds 32.40) to Dollars 600 a tonne.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bullion prices ebb after rapid
rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOLD'S PRICE dropped by Dollars 7.20 a troy ounce to close at Dollars 363.95
in London yesterday, just 7 per cent above the Dollars 340 level where it
languished in late April before a concerted effort by investors Sir James
Goldsmith and Mr George Soros boosted the market.
But many analysts suggest gold is simply pausing for breath after its hectic
rise and eventually will continue upwards. 'Gold is still in pretty good
shape. We expected some consolidation after its meteoric rise,' said Mr
Graham Roberts, director of mining research at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of
the Banque Indosuez Group. He said gold would reach Dollars 380 to Dollars
385 an ounce by the end of the summer and be at Dollars 400 'within 12
months. But I can't go along with those who suggest Dollars 450 or Dollars
500 is achievable.'
Yesterday's near-2 per cent fall in gold's price in Europe followed volatile
trading in New York late on Friday when it was driven down by
options-related selling, which triggered further selling by investors
wanting to cut their losses.
Sentiment was also affected by the release of US producer price statistics
for May, indicating inflationary pressures in the States were easing.
Mr Roberts pointed out that Dollars 362 an ounce was an important technical
support point for gold and if this was breached, the next solid support was
at Dollars 355. 'But if it goes below Dollars 350, then we are back at
square one.' He said the greatest danger to a further price rise was that
producers might start to sell gold forward again because they were
disappointed that the fast upward momentum had not been maintained.
Conditions in the gold market washed over to other precious metals
yesterday. Consequently, silver's price closed in London 14 US cents, or
nearly 3.5 per cent down, at Dollars 4 a troy ounce, while platinum
experienced a drop of Dollars 4.25 an ounce to close at Dollars 382.50.

Base metal trading was extremely slow today at the London Metal Exchange,
and only COPPER swam against the ebb tide of prices. Three months delivery
copper moved above Dollars 1,850 a tonne in late trading, and dealers said
the market looked set to test overhead resistance today. There was
speculative support below current levels, they said, and short-covering was
likely to appear on any dips. The months TIN managed to clamber back above
the recent 20-year low of Dollars 5,150 a tonne, which was equalled early in
the day, but seemed destined to break lower, as producer resolve to limit
exports was weakening, dealers said. ALUMINIUM prices also fell back,
although support appeared to have been found at Dollars 1,170 a tonne, for
the three months contract. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA
futures extended earlier losses during the afternoon session amid
disappointed long liquidation after the recent failed attempt at an upside
break-out. Robusta COFFEE futures tested both ends of the current trading
band, finishing at the upper end of the range.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Survey of Retail Chain Management (8): US takes the
cut-price lead - Neil Buckley discusses new formats in the money-conscious
1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHILE the UK may be the envy of Europe for the efficiency and quality of its
food retailing, the US still leads the way when it comes to new retailing
ideas. Several innovative US formats are now crossing across the Atlantic.
All are discount formats, reflecting the move towards lower-margin retailing
in the 1990s, and could have a big impact on Europe's existing retailers.
The first is the warehouse club, the fastest-growing format in US retailing
in the past 10 years, with between 50 and 100 outlets opening each year.
Total sales had reached more than Dollars 34bn last year.
Warehouse clubs are huge sheds - at between 100,000 and 150,000 square feet
they are four or five times the size of a typical grocery superstore - which
sell a limited range of 3,500 to 4,000 lines at bargain prices in no-frills
surroundings. Profit margins are pared to the bone, but the clubs make money
by shifting huge volumes of goods. And they charge an annual membership fee
of Dollars 25 to Dollars 30.
Warehouse clubs could eventually spread across Europe with the UK the first
to experience the format, because it is often used by US retailers as a
testing ground prior to a full assault on continental Europe.
The club culture is the opposite of that of many UK retailers, which have
concentrated their efforts in recent years on increasing operating margins.
'When these two cultures clash, it will be very, very interesting to see
which one wins,' says one retail expert.
Despite delays in obtaining planning consents, Costco, the third-largest US
operator, plans to open warehouse outlets at Trafford Park, Manchester, and
Thurrock, Essex.
Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the UK cash and carry chain, has taken space at Wednesbury
in the West Midlands and on the Valley Park development in Croydon, south
London.
And, most recently Littlewoods, the privately-owned retailing and football
pools organisation, has formed a joint venture with Price Club Canada, a
subsidiary of the second-largest warehouse club operator in the US, saying
it aims to open at least one warehouse club in the UK this year.
But many retail experts are sceptical about UK and continental Europe
warehouse clubs' ability to keep costs low enough and volumes high enough to
secure adequate rates of return on investments.
Factory outlet malls are another US format heading for Europe. These have
grown almost as rapidly in the US as warehouse clubs, to 270 in less than 10
years, with another 160 in the pipeline.
Again, the UK could be the testing ground. There are more than 1,100 small
factory clearance outlets in the UK, selling goods cheaply, either because
they are cutting out the middle man or they are selling factory over-makes,
end-of-line or returned stock. A relatively new concept is grouping such
outlets together in a large mall.
The idea was pioneered in the UK in the late 1980s by the Hornsea Retail and
Leisure Park in Humberside. This is where manufacturers including
Aquascutum, Laura Ashley and Wrangler are able to sell goods at about 30 per
cent below high street prices.
Hornsea attracted more than 800,000 visitors last year, and other developers
are keen to harness the format's potential. At least three groups, including
Value Retail, a consortium of US and UK developers; Prime Group of America,
Richardson Developments and Tarmac consortium; and UK developer Factory
Outlet Shopping Centres, plan to open factory outlet malls in the UK and
continental Europe.
Again, some commentators are sceptical about factory outlet malls' prospects
in Europe. Despite the growing price awareness among shoppers, the appeal of
buying out-of-season fashions from out-of-town malls is largely untested.
But high-volume discount retailing has been only one of two important trends
in US retailing in the late 1980s. The other is the growth of speciality
retailers known as category killers - highly-efficient operators which sell
a wide range of goods within a narrowly-defined consumer market at discount
prices, usually from low-cost edge-of-town superstores.
Their aim is to kill off the competition in their product category.
Category killers have already arrived in the UK. Toys 'R Us is the
best-known example, and has revolutionised the UK toy industry, building a
20 per cent market share and leading to the demise of many small, specialist
chains. The US chain has recently announced plans to move into Belgium and
Switzerland.
There is also Ikea - not another US store, but a Swedish furniture and home
furnishings chain operated on the category-killer principle.
It has been highly successful in a number of European countries and has slow
but steady expansion plans.
Another example is PC World, the computer superstore concept brought to the
UK by Jan Murray, chairman of Vision Technology Group. Mr Murray recently
sold the company to Dixons, the UK's largest electronics retailer which aims
to open up to 30 PC Worlds within three years.
What the next retailing import from the US might be is less clear. Some
commentators believe it could be large, discount variety stores similar to
those run by Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer. But high land costs
could prevent these operating effectively in the UK.
Industry analysts believe that in the long run the nature of shopping could
change radically, with customers buying more and more products from the
comfort of their own homes.
Mail order and home shopping currently accounts for between 3 and 6 per cent
of all retail sales.
But many believe its share will gradually decline, because mail order's
traditional advantages - availability of credit, convenience, home delivery
and low prices - have been eroded by the developments in high street
retailing. And despite home shopping advantages , it seems shoppers still
prefer to buy their goods in the shops.
'The long-term trend is definitely down,' says Mr Richard Hyman, director of
Verdict, the UK retail market research group.
Others believe new technology such as interactive video systems, and
computer systems to process orders automatically, will eventually enable
customers to choose goods from TV screen catalogues - orders and payments
are carried out by tapping into a key pad.
Indeed, home shopping made easy could divert sales from the high street,
sparking off potentially the biggest revolution yet in the retail industry.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Survey of Retail Chain Management (7): Market shows signs of
stabilising - Vanessa Houlder examines how some sections of the property
sectors are bucking the downward trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL property remains a tenant's market. The lengthy recession, together
with the surge in development in the late 1980s, has created a glut of empty
premises and a steep decline in rental values.
Nonetheless, there are tentative signs that the market is stabilising.
Moreover, some segments of the market such as food stores and retail
warehouses have bucked the downward trend.
Tenants are forcing up rents and facing fierce competition to obtain
suitable sites and planning consents.
Variations between different parts of the retail property market are
striking. Over the two years to February 1993, rental values of town centre
shop units and out-of-town shopping centres fell by 8 per cent and 1 per
cent respectively, according to research group the Investment Property
Databank.
By contrast, the rental value of retail warehouses rose by more than 6 per
cent over the same period. Indeed, the buoyancy of the retail warehouse
sector has been one of the most notable features of the property recession.
This has been due partly to a limited supply of space since retail warehouse
units are rarely built without a letting agreement from a tenant. At the
same time, growing requests from retailers to take space away from the town
centres on sites that are visible, accessible and have ample car-parking
space has boosted demand.
This trend, which gathered momentum during the 1980s, was led by the
supermarket groups, along with stores selling do-it-yourself equipment,
furniture, and home furnishings. In fact the trend has continued with
traditional high street retailers, including Comet, Currys and Halfords,
opening out-of-town units.
Demand from tenants may soon begin to stimulate development of some of the
16m sq ft of retail warehouse parks that now have planning consent.
According to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors, there are 'clear signs of
interest' in retail park development beginning to re-emerge.
The same cannot be said for any significant renewal in development of
shopping centres, a market that is currently in the doldrums. Just over 2m
sq ft of shopping centre floorspace was under construction in December 1992,
down from more than 7m the previous year, according to Hillier Parker. And
more than 1m sq ft of shopping centre floorspace originally scheduled for
completion during 1991 and 1992 failed to open.
Indeed shopping centre development is likely to remain subdued. Hillier
Parker expects it 'to take at least two or three years' for the shopping
centres opened since the onset of recession to be filled up.
The future of out-of-town shopping centres does not simply depend on a
revival of demand from retailers. It also depends on the outcome of a debate
between those who believe out-of-town centres are complementary to the needs
of town centres and those who believe they are highly damaging.
The government's policy on out-of-town shopping centres was updated last
October, when the Department of the Environment issued a new planning policy
guidance note, known as PPG6. The guidance note emphasised the need to
revitalise town centres, rather than promote large out-of-town stores.
It said that regional out-of-town shopping centres 'would not normally be
appropriate' if they seriously jeopardised investment in nearby town
centres, or unless there was likely to be a significant growth in population
or retail spending.
The difficulty in assessing these factors was recently highlighted by the
government's decision in March to approve the development of the Trafford
Shopping centre, the first regional shopping centre in the north-west of
England.
The decision was strongly criticised by local councillors, town centre
retailers and property owners who claimed that 1m sq ft of new shops on the
outskirts of Manchester would further damage business in the city.
But the Trafford Centre may turn out to be the last regional shopping centre
to be granted planning consent - most of the country is now within reach of
a regional centre, with the exception of the south-west of England.
The arguments on regional centres also apply to other types of out-of-town
stores. For instance, 'club warehouses' and factory outlets  - the US-style
discount stores which are beginning to take root in the UK - are seen as a
potential threat to town centres by many retailers.
Supermarket groups are also at the centre of the debate about out-of-town
shopping, since they are continuing with ambitious programmes to open
out-of-town superstores.
Similar criticisms to regional shopping centres apply - the growth of
out-of-town food stores is hastening the demise of local shops. The number
of grocery shops has fallen in the last three decades from more than 100,000
to 40,000.
Such criticisms may increase as the large supermarket groups target smaller
towns. Chesterton, the chartered surveyors, says that the proportion of
large new food stores located in small towns has increased from less than 10
per cent in 1990 to about 25 per cent today.
Finding suitable sites is a growing constraint on the supermarket groups'
expansion. Moreover, the difficulty in securing suitable sites is a severe
obstacle for newcomers to the market, such as Aldi and Netto, discount food
retailers, attempting to gain ground in the UK.
'It is clear that the newcomers have encountered greater-than-foreseen
difficulites in obtaining suitable sites and planning consents in a highly
competitive property market,' says research companyCorporate Intelligence
Group.
Indeed for the retail sector as whole, intense competition for premises is
now the exception rather than the rule.
But UBS, the brokers, believes it unlikely that retailers in general will be
looking to take additional space in preparation for an upturn in consumer
confidence. 'Whereas the late 1980s saw a 'race for space', the emphasis now
is one rationalisation and the restoration of profit margins', it says.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Survey of Retail Chain Management (2): On the way to
unmanned check-outs / A look at the latest information technology available
to supermarkets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMERS passing through a check-out at most big supermarkets spark off a
chain of stock-taking, ordering, invoicing and payment activities in which
they and the check-out operator are the only human elements. Many retail
industry specialists believe that in the next decade the human element could
be reduced to the customers. Ultimately even their physical involvement
could be eliminated.
Computer technology and the trading information it provides have helped make
some of the most advanced users - Marks and Spencer, J Sainsbury, Tesco and
Safeway - the top four retailers in terms of operating profit per square
foot of shop floor space.
Tesco, for example, captures data about sales of individual items as those
sales are made. Scanners at check-outs and other sales points record the
data from bar codes. Overnight a central computer telephones each store
computer to collect the day's data. This brings stock files up to date and
computer programs then decide whether new orders are needed. Programs also
work out the deliveries needed the next day by each store.
All the leading chains now use electronic data interchange (EDI): the
exchange of business documents such as orders and invoices over
telecommunications lines between computers.
Tesco, an EDI pioneer, now trades electronically with more than 1,200
companies of all sizes, representing more than 95 per cent of products on
its shelves. Half these suppliers send their invoices to Tesco by EDI. Tesco
has also used EDI to forge close business relationships with a quarter of
them, sending 13-week sales forecasts to help them schedule production and
reduce stocks - thus keeping their own costs and prices down.
The benefits over the past six years have been so great that Tesco no longer
measures them against the costs.
'We've reduced stock levels yet improved stock availability and sales; cut
lead times on orders; cut administration; and improved communication with
our suppliers,' says Mr Dave MacInnis, stock management director.
'The EDI costs are absolutely negligible. They are covered by our savings on
the phone, fax and mail. That means we have all the business benefits for
nothing.'
The daily gathering of sales data on each store means orders can be placed
on Tesco's eight warehouses as close as possible to the time the items will
be sold. Supermarkets therefore need only minimal stocks, so they have more
space for sales shelves.
All this is made possible by the simple gathering of data at the check-out.
The next step for retailers could be to eliminate the people who operate the
bar code scanners and let the customers unwittingly become unpaid data entry
operators.
This is already happening in unmanned petrol filling stations in parts of
the US and Scandinavia. The system accepts a card and switches on the pump.
It records the account details and the amount of fuel taken, thus capturing
both payment and stock control data.
Such schemes have raised interest in the idea of unmanned check-outs in
supermarkets, with customers inserting money or payment cards in a machine
and passing their purchases through a scanner.
Unmanned check-outs are still very much in their infancy, with only a
handful of pilot trials in the US.
The ultimate step would be to remove not only the check-out operators from
the shops but also the customers. They would shop from home using computer
terminals, typically based on the family television set equipped with a
keyboard and connected over the domestic telephone line to a retailer's
computer. Systems based on videotex systems such as the UK's Prestel have
been set up but they have not had mass audiences.
Neither shoppers nor retailers really want home shopping, according to Tony
Naudi, a consultant at Martec International, a retail industry research,
consultancy and training firm based in Taunton.
'The technology is there but trials have never got anywhere,' he says.
'People like going to the shops and handling the goods. More important,
retailers want them in the shops: a large percentage of items are bought on
impulse, so the more a retailer can get customers to handle his goods, the
more chance he has of selling them.
'In addition, the proportion of older people is increasing and for many
going shopping and mixing with other people is one of their few sources of
companionship.'
A compromise between going shopping and using home shopping technology is
starting to emerge.
The development of multimedia systems, combining text, video and sound on a
personal computer, has seen the introduction of units which customers use
themselves, typically by touching the screen to call up information. This
might include details of products on show in the store or which can be
ordered, or information about warranties, special offers and credit
facilities.
The Sears chain is a pioneer in this field in the UK. Seven of its nine new
Pride &amp; Joy stores for expectant mothers are equipped with IBM PS/2 personal
computers with touch-sensitive screens which act as electronic catalogues.
Many products are physically on display, so customers can see and handle
them, but the multimedia catalogues enable stores to show and describe big
items such as nursery furniture in strongly promotional ways without needing
expensive floor space: each store is no more than 2,000 square feet. The
terminals also advise on things such as what to take to hospital and how to
decorate a nursery.
The technology is available today for all these possibilities. But there is
no clear picture yet of what - if anything - will replace the daily social
visit to the corner shop, the weekly trip to the supermarket or the family
outing to the furniture superstore.
'There are many projects going on and retailers are interested in anything
that helps part consumers from their money,' says Tony Naudi at Martec
International. 'But retailers are very hard-nosed business people: unless
something increases sales, they will not take it up, no matter how clever
the technology might be.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / Survey of Retail Chain Management (4): New challenge for big
brands - Factors underlying the growth of private labels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW ISSUES have excited as much controversy in western consumer goods
industries recently as the growth of sales by retailers of private-label
products and the implications for branded manufacturers.
In one sense the issue is not new. In the US and much of western Europe,
private-label ranges have long had a share of the grocery market. However,
several developments have lifted the phenomenon further up the industry
agenda.
The most dramatic was the decision in April by Philip Morris, the world's
largest tobacco manufacturer, to slash the US price of Marlboro, hitherto
considered one of the world's strongest brands, in an effort to stem loss of
market share to the cheaper private-label cigarettes.
Though the nature of the product and Marlboro's previous policy of raising
prices much faster than inflation made this a special case, it focused
attention on the wider private-label challenge faced by other branded
consumer goods producers.
The recession has also boosted private-label products by making consumers
more price-conscious. Though some observers see this as a cyclical phase,
many others believe it is driven by structural changes in the consumer goods
sector and by a longer-term switch in consumer attitudes.
A third factor has been the success of large UK retailers such as Marks &amp;
Spencer and J. Sainsbury in developing private label into a category which
competes not only on price but also increasingly on quality and
sophistication.
In response to this other supermarket groups, notably groups in continental
Europe, have eyed enviously the handsome profits which British chains have
earned from this formula.
But behind the private-label trend lies a much broader shift, under way for
at least two decades.
As the retail trade has grown more concentrated, it has steadily gained
power at the expense of manufacturers, the biggest of which once dominated
it completely.
The speed and characteristics of this shift in power differ between
countries, reflecting a wide variety of local economic, social and business
factors. So, too, does the nature of the private label business and the
retailer strategies underlying it.
In the US and most continental European countries, private-label has
traditionally held a dowdy, bargain-basement image and has classically been
applied to commodity items which sold largely on price.
According to McKinsey, the management consultants, the retailers' main
motive behind their use of private labels has often been 'vindictive', to
eliminate small competitors and curb the power of branded manufacturers.
At the other end of the scale, leading British supermarkets derive a much
higher proportion of their sales from private label - more than half in
several cases - than their counterparts abroad.
They also view the private label business as a means to increase their
margins, differentiate between products and enhance the power of their own
brands.
In the process, they have not just captured sales from manufacturer brands,
but have asserted growing strategic control over the development, quality
standards and marketing of the products they sell.
The assertive lead taken by UK retailers has several origins:
Marks &amp; Spencer's success in building a 100 per cent private-label business,
first in clothing and later in food.
Historically high commercial property prices, which have stimulated
retailers to seek new sources of profit to cover the cost of their
investments.
Development by leading retailers of highly efficient, centralised
distribution systems which have greatly expanded their control over the
supply chain.
Heavy investment in electronic point-of-sale and ordering systems to enable
close monitoring of sales patterns. Lack of competition from the small
quality food retailers common on the Continent, where they are often heavily
protected by regulation.
It is unclear how far other countries can follow profitably the pattern of
the UK trade, when the combination of influencing factors does not exist:
the only chain outside the UK to have successfully taken private-label
up-market is Loblaw's of Canada.
However, several other non-UK retailers are trying. In the US, Wal-Mart, the
big discount retailer, recently launched a range of private-label foods and
drinks designed to compete directly with manufacturer brands, while in
France similar moves are being led by Carrefour and Auchan.
At the same time, the structure of food retailing is being increasingly
attacked in Europe by hard discounters, such as Germany's Aldi, which offer
a narrow range of products at exceptionally low prices.
It is too early to judge whether increased competition from the hard
discounters will prompt conventional supermarkets to respond in kind or to
defend themselves by moving further up-market. But either way, the
private-label challenge promises to confront branded manufacturers with
increasingly difficult choices, not least because Aldi and some other hard
discounters sell predominantly private-label goods.
At present, manufacturers are divided on how to respond. A few international
brand leaders, such as Kellogg's, Coca-Cola and Mars, refuse to make
private-label products at all. Others, including Unilever and Nestle, do so
on a limited basis, largely to fill spare capacity.
Britain's United Biscuits, in contrast, has built a large specialised plant
for private-label production, which generates about a third of its total UK
sales. And many other smaller companies are dedicated exclusively to
private-label production.
For some manufacturers, the decision to produce private label is dictated by
weak market positions, which make it the only way to maintain sales volumes.
But for the stronger companies, the choice involves a delicate calculation
of advantage. If they make private-label products, they risk weakening their
own brands by setting up direct competitors.
But if they refuse to do so, they risk turning away profitable business
which will be snapped up by competitors.
How this balance is struck in fact depends on a wide variety of factors,
peculiar to individual products and companies. Furthermore, evidence
suggests that many multinationals do not yet have a clear and consistent
policy across Europe.
However, given the recent growth of private-label, and the changing
relationship between retailers and manufacturers which underlies the growth,
making the right choice seems likely to be of increasing importance to
branded producer strategies.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Survey of Retail Chain Management (6): Pace of expansion
abroad quickens - Cross-border trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILING has long been one of the more fragmented of the world's
industries. But now at last it is becoming more international as retailers
look outside their home markets for acquisitions and alliances.
Indeed, the pace of cross-border expansion seems to have accelerated this
year.
Tesco, the UK's second-largest food retailer, has acquired the 92-store
Catteau chain in northern France, while Kingfisher took over Darty, France's
largest electrical retailer. Outside the EC, Migros, the Swiss co-operative,
has taken a dominant position in the Austrian grocery market through the
acquisition of 112 Familia supermarkets from the Zumtobel group, and a joint
venture with Konsum Osterreich, Austria's largest supermarket group.
Rewe, Germany's largest grocery retailer, has taken a stake in UK grocery
chain Budgens, while Toys 'R' Us, the US speciality retailer, has announced
moves into Belgium and Switzerland.
But retail experts say the sudden acceleration in cross-border alliances and
acquisitions is an illusion created by the high number of deals concluded
this year. In fact, many retailers have been pursuing cross-border
opportunities for several years.
Ahold of the Netherlands, Aldi and Tengelmann of Germany, and France's
Promodes and Carrefour have already increased the proportion of sales
outside their home countries to more than 30 per cent.
Mr Robert Clark, director of Corporate Intelligence Group, the UK retail
research group, predicts that increasing numbers of retailers will expand
abroad. His group has identified between 60 and 80 US companies with firm
plans to move into Europe.
Many leading European retailers, he says, are 'crawling all over'
neighbouring countries looking for opportunities. But he adds that large UK
retailers - despite deals struck this year by Tesco and Kingfisher - are
generally conspicuous in their lack of activity abroad.
'If they are not careful, UK retailers could get left behind,' he warns.
And the pressures on retailers to expand overseas are building. The
near-saturation of many core markets means they either have to use their
retailing skills to diversify into different sales formats or product areas
within their home country, or move into foreign markets.
But it is easy to underestimate the difficulties involved in expanding
abroad. Successful retailing is a delicate balancing act, involving the
delivery of the right goods and services to the local customer at the right
price. Diverse tastes, cultures, and even climate mean the demands of
customers vary considerably throughout Europe.
The need to provide different products to various markets can also mean
cross-border expansion does not always lead to economies of scale, or
increased buying muscle with suppliers.
And different legislation on areas such as opening hours, planning
restrictions, VAT and minimum wages, can make operating conditions very
different.
Ms Rosanne Murison, a retail expert with the Boston Consulting Group in
London, says the key to international retailing success is first to 'act
local', making sure the new venture is viably positioned in the local market
and responsive to that market's needs, and then to 'think global', realising
economies of scale where possible.
It is vital to conduct exhaustive research into customer demographics,
tastes and pricing attitudes, and into competitors and sites.
After some notable past failures there is evidence that retailers have
learned the need for a cautious, calculated approach to overseas expansion.
Tesco, for example, is using the relatively small Catteau acquisition to
gain experience of operating in France. Rewe may be using its stake in
Budgens in a similar way.
Migros is expanding initially into areas bordering Switzerland, where
customers' tastes are similar to those in its home market, and has chosen as
partner a diversified co-operative similar to itself.
Forming an alliance can be an attractive option to small and medium-sized
companies lacking the financial muscle to acquire businesses or establish
new operations abroad.
The UK's Institute of Grocery Distribution says there are four types of
alliance. The first is purchasing-based alliances, designed to improve the
buying power of members and develop new sourcing opportunities.
An example is Eurogroup, made up of Belgium's GIB, Switzerland's Coop
Schweiz, Germany's Rewe, France's Paridoc, and Vendex of the Netherlands.
Another category is the development-based alliance, which is an agreement
between two retailers to co-operate on a project. It has often been used by
a retailer keen to enter a new national market - for example, the venture
between Tengelmann of Germany and Superal of Italy. Tengelmann supplied
management experience and know-how so that Superal could consolidate its
presence in Italy.
A third category is the skills-based alliance, which involves retailers
sharing experience of different markets to their mutual benefit. An example
is Belgium's GIB Group and the UK's J. Sainsbury, which developed the
Homebase chain using GIB's experience in the DIY market and Sainsbury's UK
presence.
Another form is the multifunctional group, which combines elements of the
other three types. Chief among these are the European Retail Alliance - made
up of the UK's Argyll, Ahold of the Netherlands and France's Casino, and
Associated Marketing Services, which includes the ERA members plus seven
retailers from Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and Spain.
But several retailers, including Belgium's Delhaize, the UK's Tesco and
Tengelmann of Germany, have avoided buying alliances, often because of the
risk of being tied to partners who might become take-over targets in
overseas expansion plans.
But despite the difficulties and teething problems, the new wave of
internationalisation, especially through cross-border alliances, looks set
to be one of the most important retailing trends of the 1990s.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Survey of Retail Chain Management (3): A fresh direction in
logistics - Distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISTRIBUTION and the broader function of logistics are now firmly
established as a critical area of retail chain management.
In fact, claims Mr Angus Clark, systems and distribution director of food
retailer J Sainsbury, 'a policy for logistics is clearly a prerequisite for
building a retail business in any sector of the market today.' Retailer-led
logistics development over the past decade has, in turn, put great pressure
on manufacturers.
'To do business with retailers now, manufacturers not only have to have the
right product, best quality and competitive prices, they also have to be
able to respond quickly to customers' requirements and provide sound levels
of service,' says Mr Clark.
Many UK retail industry distribution systems, particularly in the food
retailing sector, are enormous operations. Sainsbury's, for example,
processes products from more than 1,000 suppliers through 20 depot
locations. Some 1,000 lorries distribute 11m cases a week to 335 stores.
Within this network, there are more than 17,000 commodities and more than
65,000 individual stocking points. 'The longest lead time for meeting orders
from the stores is 48 hours. But over 80 per cent of the volume is delivered
within 24 hours of it being ordered. The supply chain now operates 24 hours
a day, 364 days a year,' Mr Clark said at a recent seminar run by
distribution company Exel Logistics.
The biggest change in retail sector logistics over the past couple of
decades has been the move to centralised distribution centres. In the case
of food retail, those centres are often centres which can handle
temperature-controlled products and ambient temperature goods.
Previously, manufacturers tended to deliver direct to the local depots or
even the stores of their retail sector customers. Such operations were known
as 'push' systems - driven by the suppliers. Now, manufacturers' deliveries
are increasingly made into a central distribution point run by the retailer
or a contractor working on behalf of the retailer. The retailer, and the
contractor when employed, controls the final distribution through to the
stores.
The establishment of centralised distribution networks has involved heavy
investment by retailers and their distribution service contractors. Much of
that investment has been phased in but some companies have opted - or been
forced to opt - for more dramatic change. ASDA Stores, for example,
developed a centralised distribution system at the start of the 1990s
costing Pounds 170m over two years. Six fully composite centres were built
and commissioned, together with a slow moving ambient centre and a
transhipment operation.
Who is best-placed to run the retail industry's distribution systems is
still being debated.
Some retailers have opted to bring back in-house parts of those operations
which have for some time been contracted out to third party specialists.
Other retailers, though, are heading in the opposite direction and seeking
to establish closer, wider-ranging partnerships with distribution service
providers.
Such developments are confirmed by the Research Services Department of the
Institute of Grocery Distribution in a 1991 study focusing on the
involvement of third party specialists in the distribution operations of
leading multiple stores. According to IGD, third party penetration of
leading stores ranged from 35-45 per cent for ASDA, J Sainsbury and Tesco
and 60-65 per cent for CRS, Gateway and Safeway, to 85-95 per cent for
Iceland, Kwik Save and CWS, and 100 per cent for Wm Low and Grandways.
While the debate continues on handling distribution in-house or contracting
out, retail industry observers agree other trends will continue to be
influential.
In the words of Mr Irving Nixon, managing director of Worldwide Chain Store
Systems International, in a paper presented at an IGD conference in London
earlier this year: 'Central distribution will continue, with fewer, larger
units delivering more frequently to stores with full vehicle loads. And
retailers' systems will continue to be further integrated to embrace all
products in the store, from the warehouse right back to the supplier.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / Survey of Retail Chain Management (1): Customers call the
tune - A new price-sensitive and more sophisticated consumer is emerging in
the 1990s. Faced also with increased competition from new shopping formats,
retailers are investing in sophisticated new distribution and sales analysis
systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RETAILING might be the world's second-oldest profession, but it has become a
sophisticated business. As John Beaumont, chief executive of the UK's
Institute of Grocery Distribution, puts it: 'For the retailer, the business
is no longer about selling what you buy, but about buying what you sell.'
The days are gone when retailers did the best deals they could with
manufacturers, and then hoped customers would buy what they had to offer.
The wide choice of products now available - with too much floorspace chasing
too little business in many markets - means customers call the tune. If they
cannot get what they want at the price they want, accompanied by the level
of service they require, in one shop, they will take their business
somewhere else.
Customer-led retailing is one of the trends underpinning the way the sector
operates. But there is another important factor: many UK retailers believe a
new price sensitivity and sophistication among consumers will make the 1990s
a very different decade from the high-spending 1980s.
The increase in consumer awareness is said to result from the longest and
deepest recession experienced in Britain and much of the rest of Europe
since the second world war and has left some deep scars on consumers, now
more cautious and thrifty about what they buy and where they buy it. And the
more cautious consumer is expected to survive the recession.
Many retailers believe the pattern of shopping in Britain over Christmas and
New Year is evidence of this.
Shoppers last year left gift-buying to the last possible moment, hoping for
dramatic price reductions. Then in January they descended on the sales in
droves to make other purchases that they had delayed for months previous in
the pursuit of bargains.
All this is bad news for retailers. The recession has made recent years'
trading tough enough.
And a whole cadre of UK chains, including Asda, Burton, Storehouse, Next and
Laura Ashley, have additional problems of their own, brought about by
over-expansion, over-borrowing or other strategic mistakes during the
consumer boom of the late 1980s.
Even though these chains are now turning the corner, and the UK economy is
showing the first, faltering signs of recovery, the outlook for retailers is
tougher than they may have hoped.
'My view is the high margins that UK retailers have secured in the past are
not sustainable,' says Jim Hodkinson, international development director at
Kingfisher, one of the UK's largest retailing groups.
'The consumer still wants the choice, the range and the service, but at the
same time he wants to know when he goes into a store that he is going to get
a good price. He wants to shop with confidence.'
Moreover, the new price consciousness among consumers has coincided with,
and will be sharpened by, the rapid growth of the discount retailers.
Discounters aim to cut costs down to the bone, often by selling limited
product ranges from no-frills stores in secondary locations, and limiting
their investments in technology to the bare essentials. They compete by
keeping margins and prices as low as possible and make their money by
shifting large volumes of goods.
New discount formats from the US are now being imported into Europe, and Mr
Hodkinson believes they will threaten not just UK retailers' margins, but
even the lower margins common across continental Europe.
Europe has already witnessed a massive growth in discount food retailing,
with chains such as Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and France's Ed all
successfully expanding outside their home markets.
But, as a recent report by Verdict, the UK retail market research company
predicts, discounting is likely to be a main force not just in the food
sector but in other retail sectors such as clothing, electricals and the
variety stores.
Hypermarkets, selling a wide range of goods at very low prices, are already
well-established throughout France and are spreading into other markets such
as Spain.
But they will soon be joined by the new arrivals from the US, which include
warehouse clubs selling between 3,000 and 4,000 lines from baked beans to
car tyres in no-frills environments from enormous sheds.
Then there are factory outlet complexes, which group together stores selling
manufacturers' excess production and end-of-season products at discount
prices. Another group is the so-called 'category killers', efficient
specialist retailers, selling from edge-of-town superstores. Category
killers aim to kill off the competition in their particular product sector
by offering greater choice and low prices.
Price competition with other formats poses a significant management
challenge to the large established retailers. If they are to continue to
offer the advantages of choice, quality, convenience, and a more amenable
shopping environment, while remaining competitive on price, they must
achieve the maximum efficiency at every point along the supply chain, and
squeeze the most out of their substantial investments in technology.
Many large chains have already set up centralised distribution networks,
where manufacturers deliver goods to regional warehouses rather than to
individual stores. Final distribution is carried out by the retailer or a
third party contractor. Retailers who have not taken this route will likely
follow suit to enhance their competitive edge.
Most large chains are now using scanning technology at the check-out. And
many link this system to computer systems which automatically re-order goods
as they are sold.
But it is finding other ways of exploiting to the full the potential of that
sales information that will be key to success.
One important application of the information is in direct product
profitability analysis - calculating the contribution to profitability of
each product in a store, taking into account transport and storage costs and
other overheads connected with that product.
The idea of DPP is to optimise the return on each product by determining its
space allocation according to its profitability.
Most retailers use DPP analysis in some way, but it is already being
replaced as the buzzword for the 1990s by 'category management'.
This involves dividing a store's products into different categories (a large
grocery superstore may have 400 or more categories) and managing each of
those categories like small businesses.
DPP, market research and other information is then used to decide the
correct mix of brands - and what shelf space to allot to each brand - on a
store-by-store basis. This process is said to maximise the profitability of
the overall category and at the same time meet customers' demands.
As Safeway, one UK grocery chain which is introducing category management,
puts it: 'The most important objective is to focus on customers at the store
level, which will yield improved financial results.'
A vital ingredient in category management is the sharing of information
between manufacturers and retailers - something which may alter the
relationship between the two during the 1990s.
But many manufacturers are still reluctant to give away too many of their
secrets to what they perceive as the 'other side'.
But getting the most out of category management means that the two must work
together, because the manufacturers still know more about their category
than the retailers do, and retailers know more about their stores and
customers.
Another major challenge for retailers, as their home markets become
increasingly competitive and approach saturation, will be to find new
opportunities, either through diversification, or by exporting their format
into a new market.
Despite the difficulties, the pace of cross-border expansion and the
formation of international retailing alliances is quickening.
Corporate Intelligence Group, the market researchers, says it has identified
more than 60 US retailers which are planning to expand into Europe, and the
movement is unlikely to be all one-way.
Large European retailers, meanwhile, are spending increasing amounts of time
investigating other European markets. The 1990s may be the decade when
retailing becomes a truly international business.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Paris rate cut brings futures market to
life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A CUT in French short-term interest rates enlivened the European government
bond markets yesterday, raising hopes that other countries would follow suit
shortly.
The Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 25 basis points to 7.25 per
cent and reduced its repo rate. However, the move had little effect on
short-dated French government bonds which had discounted the move.
The longer end was relatively stable with the yield on the 10-year OATs
maturing in 2003 falling 6 basis points to 6.94 per cent.
Most of the activity took place in the futures market as the 10-year June
futures contract on the Matif broke through a resistance level and rose 36
basis points to hit a new high at 118.66.
The futures contract continued higher in after hours trading.
THE FRENCH move refocused attention on the narrowing spread between
long-dated French and German yields. German bonds performed well as many
investors considered that the spread with France and other countries was too
tight. Optimism that the Bundesbank will find it easier to cut its Lombard
and discount rates - currently at 8.5 per cent and 7.25 per cent
respectively - at the next council meeting on Thursday, provided an added
lift.
Some economists are factoring in a quarter percentage point cut on Thursday
preceded by a slight reduction in the repo rate - currently at 7.60 per cent
 -on Wednesday.
The market was further buoyed by international buying and September bund
futures rose 0.16 points to 95.04.
UK government bonds took heart from the French rate cut and received an
extra lift from encouraging economic data and the successful take-up of a
Bank of England gilt tranche.
The positive yield curve flattened slightly and the September gilt futures
rose  1/4 to 104.27.
The announcement of a 4 per cent rise in producer prices was in line with
expectations and soothed some nerves over inflationary trends.
In addition, the Bank of England's offer of a Pounds 700m tranche of stock
at 8 3/4 per cent, maturing in 2017, was sold out.
Ultimately, however, the market was waiting for the outcome of the new UK
chancellor's Mansion House speech on the economy last night.
HIGH yielding bond markets were still attracting interest with Italian
government bonds very firm following Friday's interest rate cut.
The Italian bond futures contract for September rose nearly 0.40 to 10.19,
partly as a result of the half-point cut in the discount rate but also as a
result of the general appetite for high yielding currencies.
Spanish bond futures rose 0.86 to 96.45 and Portuguese bonds closed higher
on the day.
The latter were set to continue their rise after the central bank cut its
intervention rates by 0.75 point and the monthly inflation figure was
unchanged at 0.5 per cent. January 1993 five-year 12.5 per cent bonds closed
Es25 higher at Es10,255 and April 1993 seven-year 11.875 per cent bonds
closed up 31 at 10,116 escudos.
IN Sweden, another high-yielding market, government bonds closed relatively
unchanged as investors took profits following an auction of two-year and
six-year bonds.
Ten-year yields ended flat at 8.58 per cent while at the shorter end,
two-year yields were unchanged at 7.54 per cent.
US Treasury prices were flat-to-lower in subdued trading yesterday as
investors and dealers awaited today's consumer prices data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 103
27/32 , yielding 6.818 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 31/32
, to yield 4.124 per cent.
The long end retreated later in the day from its early gains as speculative
traders responded to a rebound in gold prices by selling bonds.
Trading was light because players remained cautious about the second half of
the May inflation numbers - the consumer prices data.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: French yields gain pace on
German counterparts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest cut in French short-term interest rates has generated fresh
interest in the possibility that long-term rates will finally fall below
their German equivalent.
If that happens, the effect on European monetary stability could be
profound.
The possibility of a shift is not new. Waiting for French and German
long-term bond yields to cross has been like watching sailing ships on the
horizon. The two countries' yields have been creeping towards each other
since German unification in late 1989 and economists waiting with their
telescopes on the shore line are still divided over whether they will
collide, pass each other or drift apart.
However, the story has gathered pace and credence in the past few months. It
built up at the beginning of last week when Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the
vice-president of the Bundesbank, said that French interest rates could
comfortably drop lower.
It gained a wider audience via Mr George Soros who has acquired the mythic
status of a guru having already sent the pound plunging, gold soaring and
property shares up.
The international financial speculator popularised what might have seemed a
dryly academic argument when he pointed out, in an open letter to The Times,
that because the French have lower inflation than Germany and a large
savings surplus they are bound to end up with substantially lower long-term
interest rates. Afterwards, French bond prices rose sharply.
Yesterday, the French central bank cut its short-term intervention rate by
25 basis points to 7.25 per cent, prompting a sharp rise in 10-year French
bond futures on the Matif.
Now, some economists say it could be a matter of months rather than years
before the two countries' long-term yields cross over. The yield spread
between France and Germany has halved over the past months to around 20
basis points. Ms Phyllis Reed, economist with BZW, believes that 10-year OAT
yields will fall below bund yields within the next six months.
Already, French short-dated yields are comfortably below their German
equivalents - three-month money is at 7.25 per cent while Germany's is at
7.47 per cent - but the position is reversed at the two-year maturity level.
Economists are debating two questions: will a crossover at the long end be
sustainable and does it mean the Franc becomes top currency, at least in
Europe, replacing the D-mark as the anchor in the ERM?
Ms Reed, though confident about the change, is cautious about the impact.
She sees it principally as a signal that other European economies will be
able to ease rates independently of Germany rather than following its lead.
She feels that although the D-Mark will become a weak currency it will
remain as Europe's economic anchor.
Others argue that France is in a different position from Holland which has a
10-year bond yield some 60 basis points below the equivalent German rate.
There, the guilder is seen as a surrogate bund without the downside of
unification costs. Also, the country's lower inflation figure of 2.3 per
cent against Germany's 4.2 per cent makes Dutch bonds more attractive.
At SG Warburg, economist Mr George Magnus believes that the yield spread
will tighten but cannot come round to the idea of lasting crossover. The
narrowing of the spread has, after all, been helped by the post-election
honeymoon and Mr Soros. The French economy is far from perfect with
unemployment threatening to hit 12 per cent.
He argues that a significant change in French-German official interest rates
and bond yields, could have fundamental implications in Europe if it became
established.
'If the Germans lose their role of anchor currency in Europe it would cause
serious turbulence,' he says. 'It would be symptomatic of something going
seriously wrong in Germany and if that happens the European Monetary System
breaks up. If the EMS breaks, the single market goes and if that goes, all
hell breaks out.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Banks lend Pounds 80m to
property group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON &amp; Cambridge Properties, the privately-owned investment property group
based in Dudley, West Midlands, has arranged an Pounds 80m loan from a
syndicate of eight banks led by Svenska Handelsbanken of Sweden.
Bank financing of property investment on this scale has been rare since the
UK market turned down after the increase in values during the 1980s. The
equity market has tended to be the main source of funding, through a series
of rights issues for companies either strengthening weakened balance sheets
or seeking funds for expansion.
It is estimated that there are now only 40 banks willing to lend to property
companies, compared with 150 during the 1980s.
Mr John Davis, managing director of LCP, suggested that while banks were
wary of property development, some were willing to lend on well-let
investment properties.
The LCP loan is for five years.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Bonds: GMAC's issue price seen as aggressive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION in the Eurobond market focused on an aggressively-priced deal for
General Motors Acceptance Corporation yesterday.
GMAC, which is General Motors' financial services subsidiary, launched a
Dollars 300m, five-year bond deal with a coupon of 6.25 per cent and priced
to yield 105 basis points over the US Treasury bond.
Several houses claimed that lead manager Morgan Stanley had priced the deal
very aggressively and in the course of the afternoon, the deal traded
outside fees at 99.10 and the yield spread was quoted at 117 basis points
over Treasuries by a couple of traders.
Some co-managers were seen dumping the bonds, and Morgan Stanley was forced
to buy the bonds back to support the deal. However, by late afternoon the
price recovered somewhat and Morgan Stanley cited a yield spread of 108-109
basis points.
The only other substantial deal, in an otherwise uneventful day, was a
Dollars 150m collared floating-rate note for Citicorp. The 12-year deal has
a coupon of six-month Libor minus 0.125 per cent (six-month Libor is
currently 3.5 per cent), and there is a floor of 6 per cent and a cap of 10
per cent.
Citicorp, rated BAA3/BBB+ on its subordinated debt, last launched a collared
FRN in April this year and joins a steady stream of bank names in this
particular sector of the market including BankAmerica, Goldman Sachs,
Merrill Lynch, and Bankers Trust.
Kidder Peabody, lead manager, said demand was for higher floors. The bonds
will be swapped into plain FRNs as the collar portion is detached.
With so little activity in the market, there was some speculation about
imminent deals. Osaka Gas is rumoured to be looking at the dollar and
sterling sectors, while the European Investment Bank was reported to be
looking at the yen bond market.
The International Swap Dealers Association said yesterday that it plans to
change its name to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association,
subject to approval from members.
The trade association represents participants in the Dollars 4,000bn
over-the-counter market in swaps and options.

STANDARD AND POOR'S has downgraded the credit rating of Sony, the Japanese
consumer electronics company, from single-A plus to single-A due to the
company's sluggish business outlook both on the domestic market and
overseas.
The international credit rating agency cited as reasons for the downgrading
the weakening of Sony's earnings in the past two years, the gloomy outlook
for its business in the face of continued weak demand in Japan and Europe,
the strong yen and the lack of products that are likely to be highly
successful.
In the year to March, Sony reported a 57 per cent decline in pre-tax profits
to Y92.6bn (Dollars 869m) on sales of Y3,993bn, up 1.6 per cent.
The company is forecasting a 2 per cent decline in sales and a 6 per cent
drop in pre-tax profits for the current year due in part to higher interest
charges.
Sony is the latest of a number of Japanese electronics companies which have
had their credit ratings downgraded in recent months.
The continuing slump in consumer spending in Japan has been compounded by
the adverse effect of the yen on the profitability of many electronics
companies which depend on exports for a high proportion of their revenues.
S&amp;P said that although Sony's capital structure did not deteriorate in the
fiscal year that ended on March 31, debt leverage has been relatively high
since the acquisition of Columbia Pictures (now Sony Pictures Entertainment)
in 1989.
Sony Pictures Entertainment's subordinated rating has also been downgraded
to A- from A.

COLES MYER, the Australian retailer, has sold for NZDollars 128.2m
(USDollars 69.6m) its remaining 38.1 per cent stake in Progressive
Enterprises, the New Zealand supermarket operator it bought in 1988 then
floated in March last year.
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said the buyer was Foodland Associates,
the Western Australian supermarket group, at NZDollars 2.00 a share.
Mr Bartels said funds raised from the sale would be used to expand Coles
Myer's remaining interests in New Zealand which included the Kmart and
Katies chains and retail property investments.
'Maintaining a minority interest in Progressive Enterprises does not sit
well with our future strategy in New Zealand where we are committed to
expanding strongly in the non-food retail sector,' he said
Mr Bartels said Foodland was already a significant participant in New
Zealand supermarkets, owning the Rattray and Countdown chains.
He said two of Coles Myer's four directors on the Progressive board would
step down immediately and the other two would step down on completion of the
sale which required approval from New Zealand regulatory authorities.

ROTOREX, the biggest US compressor manufacturer, plans to build a Dollars
40m joint venture plant in Shenzhen, southern China's Special Economic Zone.
The company expects to sign a formal agreement next month with a Shenzhen
air-conditioning factory.
'We're completing feasibility studies,' said Mr Stewart Pei, vice-president
of Rotorex, 'but we're certainly turning our attention from the US, our old
market that is saturated, to China, a new market with a huge potential.'
Rotorex's Shenzhen plant would produce 1.5m compressors a year. The
Maryland-based company also plans to sell 200,000 compressors, worth Dollars
20m, to China this year.
'We've licenced three air-conditioner manufacturers in China,' said Mr Pei,
'but we want to do more.' The three plants with Rotorex technology are in
Nanjing, Guangzhou and Zhuhai, in China's booming southern coastal region.
As living standards have improved in recent years, sales of air-conditioners
have grown steadily. China has now 177 home air-conditioner plants
producing, in 1992, 1.52m sets, 155 per cent more than the previous year.
More such plants are emerging across the country.
China imports 1.5m compressors a year, mostly from Japan and the US.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kyotaru shake-up chief quits

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXECUTIVE who transferred from Fuji Bank, the Japanese commercial bank,
to oversee the restructuring of Kyotaru, a leading restaurant operator, has
resigned after an apparent policy disagreement.
The dispute is one of an increasing number between Japanese banks and
clients over the adoption of tough measures to reduce debt and streamline
operations in line with bank recommendations.
Kyotaru said Mr Takeru Yamazaki, who transferred from Fuji Bank to become
vice-president of the company, had resigned for 'health reasons'. However,
the bank says he resigned because Kyotaru insisted on a
'self-restructuring', giving him little room to exercise influence.
The restaurant operator had agreed with its banks to reduce outstanding
debts from Y62bn to Y40bn (Dollars 375m) through the disposal of property
assets, the sale of three US subsidiaries, and the closure of 30 family
restaurants in Japan.
Kyotaru was forced to cover its losses following its guarantee of Y15bn in
loans for an affiliate, Edo Fudosan, which invested unsuccessfully in stocks
and property. In the year ended in December, Kyotaru reported a net loss of
Y12.2bn.
Fuji Bank, which holds a 4.8 per cent stake in the company, had taken a step
typical in Japanese restructurings by sending Mr Yamazaki, a former director
at the bank, to Kyotaru three months ago.
The disagreement between Kyotaru and Fuji Bank follows the dismissal of bank
advisers by Azabu Building, a developer with Y700bn in outstanding debts,
after they urged the sale of assets including a Hawaiian hotel particularly
cherished by Azabu's former chief executive.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Daiei to absorb three affiliates
as demand slides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DAIEI, Japan's largest supermarket chain which is known for its aggressive
expansion, has announced it will absorb three retail affiliates in next
March, pushing annual sales up to Y2,590bn (Dollars 24bn) and widening its
lead over Ito-Yokado, the country's second largest retailer.
The decision comes as Japan's retailers are being hit by a plunge in
consumer demand and increased competition from discount chains and
convenience stores.
The move is expected to accelerate the pace of rationalisation within the
country's complex retail and distribution sector, lowering prices of
consumer goods, including imports. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister of the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, yesterday welcomed the move,
adding that the retail sector would no longer be able to enjoy growth as
strong as in the past.
Daiei will absorb Chujitsuya, Uneed Daiei and Daihana, three smaller
regional supermarket chains. Daiei will issue a total of 167,951,000 new
shares for the merger, alloting 12 Daiei shares for 10 Chujitsuya shares,
and nine Daiei shares for 10 Uneed shares. Daihana, a wholly owned
subsidiary, will transfer its assets to Daiei.
The company will be the first retailer to have a national network from
Hokkaido, the island in the north, to Okinawa in the south.
Mr Isao Nakauchi, president of Daiei, said the merger will lead to a more
efficient operation, through integration of merchandise purchasing,
distribution networks and personnel. He said the company will promote
imports and lower prices.
Daiei bought 41.9 per cent of Chujitsuya, which has a large network in the
Tokyo area, in March last year, from Shuwa, the stock and property
speculator, which was facing severe financial difficulties.
However, the rapid growth of its complex corporate structure has made the
company's true financial state unclear. Among its many acquisitions, the
company bought 34 per cent of Recruit, the publishing and real estate
concern last year.
Meanwhile, Daiei's announcement prompted the Tokyo Stock Exchange to halt
trading in Daiei and Chujitsuya shares, while trading in Uneed, listed on
the second section of the Osaka Securities Exchange, was also suspended.
Ichiken, a construction company in the Daiei group, however, surged Y110 to
Y1,110.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: AECI, Sasol merge petrochemical
and plastics interests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AECI and Sasol, South Africa's two biggest chemicals groups, are to merge
some of their petrochemical and plastics interests and form a company with
an annual sales of more than R2.5bn (Dollars 784m).
The proposed merger combines Sasol's feedstocks with downstream converting
companies in AECI, which is 38 per cent owned by ICI of the UK. It will
produce an integrated and diversified plastics group able to compete
internationally.
The initiative is an attempt to improve the companies' competitive position
against the background of weak international petrochemical markets and the
prospect of increased competition in the domestic market as tariff barriers
are lowered.
Mr Mike Sander, managing director of AECI, said: 'It takes us from being an
inwardly focused group to a manufacturing entity that can be very, very
competitive internationally.'
Mr Paul Kruger, managing director of Sasol, said the venture was a logical
step in Sasol's strategy of adding value to its feedstock strength by
expanding its interest in the polymer business.
Apart from being attractive in itself, the venture offers Sasol a market for
additional ethylene.
The proposed merger will allow the new company - to be owned 60 per cent by
Sasol and 40 per cent by AECI - to embark on a project converting AECI's PVC
from carbide feedstock to ethylene feedstock.
Sasol produces feedstocks such as ethylene, propylene and polypropylene
which are used in the production of downstream products such as
chlor-alkali, PVC, polyethylene and cyanide by AECI.
Mr Kruger said the deal was not anti-competitive as the two companies were
not in competition.
It was 'a combination of strengths, not a combination of products to
eliminate competition in the market place'.
AECI confirmed yesterday that discussions were under way, following the
ICI/Zeneca demerger, 'to review ICI's position in the businesses operated by
AECI with a view to aligning ICI's interest in AECI more closely with ICI's
international business strategy.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: SEC study could bring equities
trading shake-up - Patrick Harverson examines the US regulation issues which
the Market 2000 review is considering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUCTURE of equities trading in the US could soon face a shake-up if
Market 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission's year-long study into
the regulation of the country's stock markets, packs anything like the punch
of its predecessor.
The last comparable study undertaken by the SEC, the government agency that
administers US securities laws and regulates financial markets, was
completed 20 years ago and led to the 'May Day' revolution of 1975, which
abolished fixed brokerage commissions and forever changed the way business
was conducted on Wall Street.
The SEC's division of market regulation, which is compiling Market 2000,
hopes the review will be ready later this summer, although it may be delayed
by the arrival of the new SEC chairman, Mr Arthur Levitt, who has yet to be
confirmed in his job by Congress.
The study's recommendations will be considered by the agency's five
commissioners, who will decide whether to introduce regulations based on its
findings. Congress may then amend the US securities laws in line with any
reforms.
The motivation behind Market 2000 dates from the changes introduced in 1975.
The SEC hoped then that the competitive forces its reforms unleashed would
lead to the evolution of a single national market system through which all
stock trades would be routed, and which would be accessible to all
investors.
While many of the changes introduced in 1975 have benefited the securities
business - trading volume has risen steeply, new financial instruments and
trading methods have proliferated - the competition that the reforms
unleashed produced a fragmentation, not a centralisation, of US stock
markets.
Today, share orders are executed in an array of different arenas. While many
investors buy and sell stocks in the traditional way - through brokers who
place their orders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange - others
trade via brokers who execute orders on electronic over-the-counter markets.
Also, some bigger investors trade directly with broker-dealer firms, while
others prefer to bypass the intermediaries and exchanges altogether and buy
and sell directly with each other.
The growing multiplicity of trading forums has had a profound effect on the
NYSE, the country's largest stock market. Its share of trading in US stocks
has been under attack from a growing band of competitors. They include:
Nasdaq (the electronic broker-dealer market run by the National Association
of Securities Dealers).
Smaller registered exchanges such as the American Stock Exchange; regional
stock markets such as those in Cincinnati and Philadelphia.
Privately-run computerised trading systems that offer investors an
electronic trading forum free of dealers and other intermediaries.
The NYSE has also lost business to the London Stock Exchange, which trades
US shares before New York opens and which imposes less strict disclosure
requirements on brokers and institutions than is the case in the US.
Competition has been the prime reason for the way the NYSE's grip on
domestic equities trading has weakened. In 1981, 75 per cent of trading in
all US stocks was handled by the NYSE. Today its share of the business has
dropped to a little more than half.
Quite simply, brokerage firms and institutional investors have turned to
other markets or systems where the absence of expensive trading floors and
market-makers means trades can be completed more efficiently and for less
cost.
This sort of fragmentation is leading to the emergence of a two-tier market
with one level for the big players and another for the small investors: and
it is a development which is of concern to the SEC.
In many ways, a two-tier market already exists. Powerful institutions enjoy
the benefits of fragmented markets by using their money and power to keep
transaction costs down, and to gain access to intermediary-free computer
trading networks.
Additionally, institutions can trade where they do not have to disclose all
the details of their activities. The Posit system, run by the Californian
broking house Jeffries &amp; Co, is one example, and the London Stock Exchange's
Seaq International system, another.
As for smaller investors, they lack the sophistication, technology and
capital to access the cheaper electronic systems, and have to use
traditional markets where execution can be slower and more expensive. Even
if their orders are directed by brokers to some of the newer trading arenas,
it is mostly done without their knowledge or without attendant cost
advantages being passed on.
The SEC is approaching the issue of market fragmentation gingerly. The
agency will not say what it hopes its Market 2000 study will achieve.
Instead, the SEC says only that it has been addressing a number of issues in
detail, among them: fragmentation of trading; market liquidity; the
execution of trades; the emergence of privately-run computerised trading
systems; and the relative regulatory burdens on the different markets.
Above all, the SEC wants to look again at the regulatory framework that
supports equities trading.
Much of the regulatory structure dates from before the 1970s, when trading
stocks in the US was a simple process.
In the intervening years, the SEC has failed to develop an overall
regulatory strategy. The agency admits that its approach to regulation has
not been well organised. Mr William Heyman, former director of the SEC's
division of market regulation and a guiding force behind Market 2000,
describes the study as 'an effort by the staff to look comprehensively at
things which in the past we have been looking at piecemeal'.
Among the regulatory issues the study is tackling, the most contentious is
the future of NYSE Rules 390 and 500. The former limits NYSE member firms
from trading listed stocks away from the exchange, the latter makes it
difficult for companies voluntarily to remove their stock listing from the
exchange.
The NYSE's competitors have lobbied for abolition of both rules, claiming
they give the exchange an unfair advantage.
Although there is no indication that the abolition of Rule 500 would lead to
a rush of companies away from the NYSE, the exchange nevertheless fears that
some companies might leave and list their shares on Nasdaq, home to such
corporate giants as Microsoft and Apple Computer.
While the NYSE is under fire over rules 390 and 500, it is on the attack
over other issues. It is highly critical of the practice employed by trading
systems and over-the-counter marketmaking firms of paying brokers a fee
(usually between one and two cents a share) for directing customer orders
their way.
This 'payment for order flow' is used by trading firms and systems to bring
in business that might otherwise go to the NYSE. Madoff Securities in New
York is one of the biggest payers for order flow, luring large amounts of
business from brokers in exchange for a payment and a promise of quick order
execution on its in-house stock trading system. On a good day, Madoff
handles as much as 10 per cent of all trading in NYSE stocks.
Not surprisingly, the NYSE wants the SEC to ban payment for order flow,
arguing that in accepting payments to route customers' orders to a
particular firm or system, brokers are not necessarily finding the best
execution price for their customers.
Until the SEC rules on the issue, the NYSE is defending its share of trading
by offering rebates to brokers who bring small trades to the exchange. Mr
William Donaldson, the NYSE chairman, said he hoped the rebate offer would
'at the very least, arrest further order erosion, and at best, accomplish
repatriation of order flow'.
The NYSE has also challenged what it claims are unevenly distributed
regulatory costs. It says that while it is forced to comply with a wide and
costly array of SEC regulations, rival electronic trading systems bear a
lighter regulatory burden. The NYSE would like to see these systems
regulated as fully as the established exchanges. For their part, operators
of systems say they should be regulated differently because they handle only
a fraction of the business handled by the NYSE.
What are the chances of the SEC heeding the NYSE's requests, or those of its
competitors? From the start the SEC singled out Rules 390 and 500 as
important issues for review in the study, so neither is likely to survive in
its present form.
While abolishing the two rules would hurt the NYSE, the pain of the blow
could be softened. As for the broader issues of fragmentation, and the
two-tier market, the SEC's task will be still more difficult. Although, the
agency is reluctant to intervene, it is under increasing pressure to do so.
As the agency's Mr Heyman says: 'Ultimately, the market participants will
look to the SEC to resolve these seemingly intractable issues.'

<TEXT>
APPLE Computer yesterday announced US price cuts and customer rebates in a
move that could spark a price war in the personal computer industry. Over
the past 18 months, prices of PCs in the US have declined by nearly 50 per
cent.
Last week Apple's share price fell sharply when the company predicted lower
than expected second-half earnings because of price cutting. Apple was
trading yesterday at Dollars 44 5/8 .
Apple lowered US retail prices on selected computers by between 6.8 per cent
and 12.6 per cent, and by as much as 26 per cent on some peripherals.
The company also announced a promotion with 'On-the-spot rebates', giving
customers cash rebates of Dollars 50 to Dollars 350 on the purchase of a
selection of Macintosh computers and Apple scanners and printers.
For example, a Macintosh IIvx 4/80, middle of the product line desktop
computer was reduced from Dollars 1,899 to Dollars 1,659. Purchasers will
also get a Dollars 150 rebate, until September 30, bringing the effective
price down to Dollars 1,509.
'Momentum for Macintosh products remains strong - unit shipments increased
35 per cent in the first half of our fiscal year,' said Mr Bob Puette,
president of Apple USA. 'And, we're committed to accelerating that
momentum.'
Yesterday's moves mark the second time in two months that Apple has reduced
prices. In May, the company lowered the prices of some of its computers by
up to 16 per cent and cut some printer prices by 29 per cent.

CAISSE de Depot, which manages Quebec's public pension funds, is buying 22.5
per cent of Univa, Canada's second biggest food distributor.
It is buying the shares from Mr Bertin Nadeau, a Montreal entrepreneur, for
CDollars 171m (USDollars 134m). The deal increases Caisse's shareholding in
Univa to 36 per cent, including shares it already owns. However, it is
looking for an investor group to buy part of this.
Caisse is paying CDollars 8.50 a share, or slightly more than the recent
stock market level. It is not required to make a follow-up offer. Mr Nadeau,
through his Unigesco holding company, owned 26 per cent of Univa. He was the
biggest single shareholder and was chairman of the Univa board.
Including 2.2m Univa shares that Unigesco is transferring to the Ontario
Teachers Pension Board to satisfy a CDollars 25m debenture exchange option,
Mr Nadeau is effectively receiving CDollars 196m.
In February New York investment bankers Blackstone Group offered CDollars 11
each for all Univa's shares in a takeover worth around CDollars 1bn. This
was withdrawn following opposition from the Caisse.
E. M. Warburg Pincus, another New York investment group, also bid CDollars
8.85 a share for Mr Nadeau's 26 per cent, but withdrew at the last moment.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank combines US
securities units

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's biggest banking group, announced yesterday it was
combining its US securities activities into a single subsidiary, Deutsche
Bank Securities.
Previously, Deutsche Bank's securities operations in the US were divided
between three units: the Wall Street equity research and brokerage firm CJ
Lawrence, the international securities and asset management businesses of
Deutsche Bank Capital, and the Treasury market primary dealership Deutsche
Bank Government Securities.
Under US banking and securities industry regulations, the businesses of CJ
Lawrence and Deutsche Bank Capital were kept strictly apart, preventing the
German bank from co-ordinating its activities between the two units, and
hindering the overall development of its securities business in the US.
The new subsidiary, however, will operate under Section 20 of the
Glass-Steagall Act, which allows banks to engage in corporate securities
dealing and underwriting activities if revenues from these activities do not
exceed 10 per cent of the company's gross US-based revenues.
Mr John Rolls, Deutsche Bank's chief executive officer in North America,
said the reorganisation was to ensure that a co-ordinated strategy for its
US securities operations could be developed under one roof. He said the
regulatory restrictions involved in having two key units, DBCC and CJ
Lawrence, operate under separate banking and securities laws had been
burdensome.
He said: 'The brick wall between DBCC and CJ Lawrence was becoming
untenable.'
The newly-united Deutsche Bank Securities will take aim at the rapidly
expanding market in cross-border securities, underwriting, broking and
dealing. It hopes to help feed the growing appetite of US investors for
European securities, and benefit from the growing interest in US stocks
among European investors.
Mr Rolls said the US operations of Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment bank
100 per cent-owned by Deutsche Bank, would not be affected by the
reorganisation.
Deutsche Bank Securities will be based in New York, with about 500 staff. It
will be run by Mr James Moltz, currently chairman and chief executive of CJ
Lawrence, and Mr Horst Risse, head of DBCC.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Investors sue Merrill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of foreign investors is suing Merrill Lynch for more than Dollars
86m. They allege they were misled over the riskiness of an international
mutual fund sold by the big US securities house.
The suit, filed in a San Diego court by individual investors and investment
companies from Mexico, Liberia, Israel and the British West Indies, revolves
around two of Merrill's mutual funds - the Short-Term World Income Portfolio
and the Short-Term Global Income Fund - which invest in a variety of
short-term foreign debt securities.
According to the suit, the two funds were broadly similar, yet the foreign
investors in the World fund were not adequately informed in the prospectus
of the risks, while the US investors in the Global fund were told of the
riskiness of their fund's investments.
Merrill Lynch emphatically refuted the allegations. In a statement, the firm
said: 'There were no misrepresentations to World fund investors and there is
absolutely no merit to this lawsuit.'

IVAX, a rapidly-expanding US holding company formed from the merger of three
pharmaceutical and chemicals companies, yesterday agreed to buy Johnson
Products in a deal valued between Dollars 61m and Dollars 73m.
On Wall Street, shares in Johnson Products, a health care products group,
jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 , while Ivax edged Dollars  1/8
higher to Dollars 25 1/4 after a delayed opening.
The planned deal is subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory
and shareholder approval and confirmation that the transaction qualifies for
accounting treatment as a pooling of interests.
Johnson Products' majority shareholder has agreed to vote for the takeover
unless the company's board accepts or recommends a better offer before July
29.
In Europe, Ivax has expanded rapidly. Efforts to extend its marketing
network and product range includes the Pounds 22m (Dollars 33.8m)
acquisition of Waverly Pharmaceutical, a privately-owned UK contract
manufacturing group, and the purchase of Harris Pharmaceuticals, a generics
maker.

MARRIOTT Corporation, the US hotels and food services group, is to take a
Dollars 32m charge against its second-quarter earnings, to reflect more
accurately the net realisable value of assets being 'held for sale'.
Marriott said the after-tax, non-cash charge followed discussions with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of the talks, Marriott will
now determine the net realisable value of all assets held for sale on a
property-by-property basis.
It had previously calculated the figure using a property-by-property
analysis for its full-service hotels, but an aggregate basis - by hotel
brand - for its other middle and economy-market hotel properties.
Marriott has also called its annual meeting for July 23, when it will ask
shareholders to vote on its controversial 'de-merger' plan. Marriott wants
to spin off its hotel management business, leaving the property assets and
the bulk of the group's heavy debts in the ongoing company.
This has angered bondholders, and some have taken legal action.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Carmakers' prophet shows the
road ahead - Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez shares his vision for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING to the prophet Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the European
car industry will go the same way as steel and shipbuilding unless the third
industrial revolution gets under way soon.
According to Mr Lopez, the engineer, the seeds of revolution number three -
the successor to the steam-powered loom and the moving production line -
have already been sown in the vast factory halls of Volkswagen's German
works.
And if Mr Lopez the long-sighted manager has his way, a second crop of
radical changes in manufacturing methods will soon be sprouting on a new
green-field site in northern Spain.
Adeptly swapping all three hats in his first full-scale outing yesterday, Mr
Lopez totted up the components of the impending crunch. International
investment plans in motor manufacture, most notably Korea's proposals to
raise output from 2m to 7m cars a year, would burden the world with more
than 10m cars' worth of excess capacity by the end of the 1990s, he said.
In Europe, all the trends, especially cost structures and imports from Japan
and Japanese transplants in the US and England, were going in the wrong
direction.
Mr Lopez flashed up a graph showing all German motor makers' input costs
rising dramatically - except for one. The line for Adam Opel, his former
employer, clearly demonstrated his ability to reduce costs and keep them
moving down.
If the battle for the motor industry were lost, European manufacturers were
fated to become second-class citizens, he said.
Not to fear though; VW had chosen to fight and to win. Promising quantum
leaps, powered by a concept dubbed Continuous Improvement Programme Squared
(KVP2), Mr Lopez unveiled a graph showing VW's future performance bouncing
in a series of dramatic loops way above the steadily-rising trend line
established by the Japanese. The time-scale axis was void of numbers.
To clear any doubts, he flashed up more charts and figures. Since he joined
VW in mid-March he and his team have set up and completed 114 one-week
workshops in which teams of freshly-inspired workers had already unleashed
part of the power of KVP2.
Average results from these projects have so far shown a 30 per cent
improvement in quality. Productivity was up an average 28 per cent. Lead
times have been reduced by 37 per cent, stock requirements by 34 per cent,
and the necessary working space by 29 per cent.
As a prize example, he selected the piston pre-assembly shop in the
Salzgitter works, where productivity was already up 67 per cent and the
workforce was operating in 60 per cent less space. Even as he spoke, 41
further workshops were under way and 53 were planned for next week.
However, apart from some generalities about 'spirit, ascendant values,
protagonism', he divulged few details. He was giving little away which might
benefit competitors. He was, rather, sharing his vision of himself as a
committed European, en mission searching restlessly for new inefficiencies
to be rooted out, while bidding to soften some of the harsher impressions of
his manner and methods disseminated by the media.
It was naive to believe that a 30 per cent improvement in productivity could
lead to 30 per cent fewer jobs, he claimed.
His whole concept was founded on the principle that if VW offered customers
cars stuffed with enhanced value, at prices the market could bear, they
would buy more cars and the company could employ more people.
Similarly, the man known as the 'strangler' out of respect for his rigorous
ways with component makers, claimed that far from reducing the number of the
group's outside suppliers, their numbers might even grow from around 10,000
now to as many as 30,000 under the beneficient impact of KVP2.
While this appeared to be at odds with other official statements from within
the VW hierarchy, Mr Lopez showed himself to be a man unafraid of a little
fudge.
On the issue of his bizarre defection from GM this spring, he claimed Mr
Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, and he had been brought together before
Christmas by 'a supplier'.
Earlier statements from Mr Piech to the effect that he had been approached
directly by Mr Lopez were 'a misunderstanding', a spokesman explained.
But he was quite clear on the reasons for his arrival at VW: on March 8 at
Adam Opel, he discovered that GM had different ideas for his ultra-lean
dream plant for a dream car in the dream location of his Basque homeland.
'I lost my enthusiasm and willingness when I realised they would not make it
in the way I would like,' he said.
'Mr Piech promised me nothing, but he believes manufacturing can be improved
by my ideas. I am confident we will have this plant.'

A GROUP of foreign investors is suing Merrill Lynch for more than Dollars

The suit, filed in a San Diego court by individual investors and investment

Merrill Lynch emphatically refuted the allegations. In a statement, the firm
said: 'There were no misrepresentations to World fund investors and there is
absolutely no merit to this lawsuit.'
Merrill said the investors ignored the full disclosure of currency and
hedging risks in the prospectus, which met all international standards.
The investors suing Merrill are seeking to have their suits, which are
claiming unspecified damages of at least Dollars 86m, certified as a single
class action.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Caisse de Depot buys further 22%
of Univa
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAISSE de Depot, which manages Quebec's public pension funds, is buying 22.5
per cent of Univa, Canada's second biggest food distributor.
It is buying the shares from Mr Bertin Nadeau, a Montreal entrepreneur, for
CDollars 171m (USDollars 134m). The deal increases Caisse's shareholding in
Univa to 36 per cent, including shares it already owns. However, it is
looking for an investor group to buy part of this.
Caisse is paying CDollars 8.50 a share, or slightly more than the recent
stock market level. It is not required to make a follow-up offer. Mr Nadeau,
through his Unigesco holding company, owned 26 per cent of Univa. He was the
biggest single shareholder and was chairman of the Univa board.
Including 2.2m Univa shares that Unigesco is transferring to the Ontario
Teachers Pension Board to satisfy a CDollars 25m debenture exchange option,
Mr Nadeau is effectively receiving CDollars 196m. He will use the proceeds
to meet Unigesco debt payments due over the next year.
In February New York investment bankers Blackstone Group offered CDollars 11
each for all Univa's shares in a takeover worth around CDollars 1bn. This
was withdrawn following opposition from the Caisse.
E. M. Warburg Pincus, another New York investment group, also bid CDollars
8.85 a share for Mr Nadeau's 26 per cent, but withdrew at the last moment.
Laurentian, the financial services group, has negotiated a CDollars 130m
five-year line of credit with National Bank of Canada, National Westminster
Canada, and Credit Lyonnais Canada to be used partly to repay a CDollars 70m
preferred issue.
BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, is selling BABN, an
international lottery ticket manufacturer, to one of Canada's
fastest-growing commercial printers for CDollars 47m. The disposal completes
nearly all BCE's divestment of non-telecom activities.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Italian insurer's fate seems
sealed - Fondiaria's L1,058bn rights issue may be too late
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST night's surprise announcement of a L1,058bn (Dollars 715m) rights issue
by Fondiaria, the big Florentine insurer controlled by the troubled Ferruzzi
group, looks unlikely to satisfy analysts who are forecasting that the sale
of the company is inevitable.
The fresh cash, via a two-for-one rights issue at L6,500 for each new share,
will help restore Fondiaria's finances. The group lost L578bn lost year and
reported borrowings of L2,368bn.
However the depth of the crisis facing the Ferruzzi family and the listed
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, which posted record losses of
L1,519bn and total borrowings of about L31,000bn, suggests big changes are
inevitable now that Ferfin's fate is in the hands of its bankers. For many
observers, Mr Arrigo Bianchi di Lavagna, Fondiaria's new managing director,
is preparing it for the block.
Even if disposal is not a foregone conclusion, Fondiaria must be turned
around. With Ferruzzi struggling for survival, Fondiaria must start paying
dividends again.
Much of the borrowing came under Mr Alfonso Scarpa, Fondiaria's former
managing director, who oversaw an ambitious but ill-fated expansion into
insurance abroad and diversification at home. Fondiaria invested about
DM1.21bn (Dollars 744m) in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, Germany's
second-largest insurer, in which it had a 21 per cent stake. It also had a
holding in the linked Volksfursorge (Vofu) life group as part of an
ambitious expansion plan.
Last month Fondiaria sold its shares in AMB and the subsidiary controlling
Vofu. The disposal will net about DM1.18bn, less than the original
investment and a hefty loss when interest payments on the money borrowed to
buy the shares are taken into account.
Untangling the German commitment means Mr Bianchi di Lavagna can turn to
some of the domestic loss-making ventures into which Fondiaria diversified.
These included clinics and hotels. In both cases, Fondiaria not only bought
the properties but also took management responsibility. Moreover, much of
the diversification was financed by borrowing. The clinics and hotels are
now for sale,
Stripped of the loss-makers, the priority will be to improve earnings at the
core insurance business. The Fondiaria group made underwriting losses of
about L473bn last year. Losses were heaviest in third-party motor policies,
where Italian insurers have taken a battering as state-regulated tariffs
have failed to keep up with the cost and quantity of claims.
Mr Bianchi di Lavagna has two strategies to deal with the motor side. First,
tariffs must rise to cover losses - which will be possible after
liberalisation in July 1994. Second, Fondiaria must reduce the share of
third-party motor insurance in its portfolio. It now has about 13.5 per cent
of the Italian market for third-party motor cover - more than double the
share of its nearest competitor.
Third-party cover generates about L8.4bn in daily premiums for Fondiaria.
But competition is likely to keep profits under pressure, forcing Fondiaria
to broaden its product base.
Many observers have already discounted Mr Bianchi di Lavagna's success in
turning the group round. The focus has shifted to the group's fate after his
medicine starts working.
Finding a single buyer for the group would probably maximise the return for
Ferruzzi and the family of Mr Camillio De Benedetti, the Italian financier
who died earlier this year. They jointly control Fondiaria through the
quoted Gaic holding company.
But Fondiaria will not come cheap. With aggregate premiums of L6,102bn last
year, the group would give a foreign insurer an enviable position in the
Italian market, widely believed to have the highest growth potential in
Europe.
Failing that, a break-up is the obvious solution. Ironically, that has been
made easier due to the 1990-91 restructuring by Mr Scarpa, who reorganised
the group into a holding company with three main subsidiaries.
The biggest, La Fondiaria Assicurazioni, had premiums of L1,859bn last year.
Milano Assicurazioni had L1,402bn, while La Previdente had L1,289bn. Each
could be an attractive buy in its own right.
Two of the three have big individual investors, which look like obvious
bidders. Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's largest bank, owns
about 27 per cent of Milano, while GroupAMA, the big French mutual insurer,
has 20 per cent of La Fondiaria Assicurazioni. San Paolo is already working
closely with Milano on a range of insurance and banking products; it is also
one of Ferruzzi's biggest bank creditors. GroupAMA could also be tempted by
Fondiaria.
Many observers expect Generali, Italy's largest insurer, to buy at least
part of Fondiaria. Mediobanca, the merchant bank leading the five-bank
committee of Ferruzzi's biggest creditors, is also a leading shareholder in
Generali. RAS, Italy's second-largest insurer, which is owned by Germany's
Allianz, could also be a suitor.

<TEXT>
MR VICTOR Bischoff, chief financial officer of Sandoz, has left the Swiss
pharmaceutical and chemicals group 'by mutual agreement'.
Mr Bischoff, who led the formerly secretive group's moves towards greater
transparency and involvement in international capital markets, is the third
senior executive to leave in recent months.
Mr Max Link, formerly head of Sandoz' pharmaceutical division, has left to
head another drug company, and his successor, Mr Rolf Soiron, has also moved
on.
Their departures come at a time when the group appears to be preparing for
the succession to Mr Marc Moret, the autocratic 69-year old chairman.
Mr Moret announced in March that he would step down as president of the
executive board, but would carry on as chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr Daniel Wagniere, head of the group's US subsidiary, is to succeed him.
'This would appear to be further shake-out from the recent top-level
changes,' said Mr Peter Smith, pharmaceuticals analyst at brokers James
Capel in London.
Sandoz declined to give any reason for Mr Bischoff's departure.
He joined the group in 1987 and became a member of the executive board in
1990.
Landis &amp; Gyr, the Swiss electro-mechanical engineering group, yesterday said
that Mars Electronics International, a unit of Mars Inc, had acquired the
assets, trade marks and technology of its Sodeco Cash Management Systems
unit, Reuter reports from Zug.
Landis &amp; Gyr said its Sodeco unit employed around 80 people, and had annual
sales of SFr30m (Dollars 20.7m).
A company spokesman was not immediately available to comment on financial
details of the transaction.

THE DANISH government is preparing to sell off a large minority stake in
Tele Danmark, the state's monopoly telephone company.
Mr Arne Melchior, communications minister, said the government was prepared
to reduce its present 94 per cent holding in Tele Danmark to 51 per cent
within the next 12 months.
The company was formed in 1991 through the merger of five regional telephone
companies. The shares were yesterday suspended on the Copenhagen stock
exchange at DKr170 (Dollars 27).
Plans to sell off shares to the public have been delayed several times by
political difficulties.
The shares currently carry two conditions which mean that the share price
does not reflect the value of the group. This has made them unattractive to
private investors.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: UBS faces legal challenge from
largest shareholder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BK VISION, the Swiss financial securities investment company, has launched a
legal challenge against new by-laws of Union Bank of Switzerland that would
enable the bank to raise capital without offering prior rights to
shareholders.
BK, which was set up in October 1991 by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank group, is
already the largest single shareholder in UBS with a 15 per cent stake.
BK's policy is to take an active interest in the strategic policies of the
financial comp-anies in which it holds stakes and to protect the interests
of shareholders if the need arises.
It jostled recently with UBS over its decision to sack Mr Christoph Blocher,
a BZ group ally, from its board, but chose not to make a stand on that
matter.
Mr Ebner, who is BK's chairman, said yesterday that the argument over the
by-laws was less likely than the Blocher case to become emotional. Moreover,
if BK did not take it up, then it would forfeit its credibility as a
responsible shareholder.
UBS enacted resolutions at its AGM in April, taking advantage of provisions
in last year's revised Swiss companies law enabling companies to create
authorised capital that could be used for 'important purposes' at any time
for up to two years.
The new law also enabled companies to create conditional capital for use
indefinitely in convertible or warrant issues.
In both cases, there was the possibility of issuing the shares without
offering shareholders their normal priority subscription rights.
BK is claiming that the law requires such resolutions to cite a purpose for
which the authorised shares are to be used, such as a specific acquisition.
UBS made no specification, but its by-laws already say that such shares
could only be used for takeovers or financing takeovers.
BK also claims that the decision on whether or not to waive shareholder
rights cannot be delegated from the general meeting to the board of
directors.
UBS acknowledged that the new companies law 'left several points of law
open' and welcomed the opportunity for early clarification by the courts.
It argued that 'a narrow interpretation of the new legislation would do
insufficient justice to the practical needs of today's companies and the
specific situation of the capital market'.

FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Investors rush to sell Ferruzzi
stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S troubled Ferruzzi group yesterday took another mauling on the stock
market yesterday as investors rushed to sell their holdings in the
debt-laden company.
The Milan stock market failed to make a price in Montedison, Ferruzzi's main
industrial subsidiary, after a torrent of sales. Stock in the Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company fell almost 13 per cent to L662.3 from
L760.1 on Friday, while opening prices for Montedison showed a 10 per cent
collapse to L880 from L975.
The drop in values has wiped about L2,000bn (Dollars 1.35bn) off the
capitalisation of Ferfin and its subsidiaries in the past week as investors
reacted to revelations of the group's L31,000bn borrowings and decision to
hand its fate to a group of banks.
Last week, Mr Enzo Berlanda, chairman of the Consob stock exchange and
companies watchdog, defended the decision not to suspend Ferruzzi group
shares following conflicting reports about its indebtedness.
Mr Berlanda argued that suspending Ferruzzi group shares in Milan would have
been pointless without similar action by supervisors on other stock markets
where parts of the group are quoted. Montedison shares trade on five
European bourses, apart from Milan, as well as in New York.
The banks involved in the Ferruzzi rescue talks, which include Istituto
Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Banca di Roma, Credito Italiano and Banca
Commerciale Italiana, have all declined to comment on the negotiations, in
spite of the growing pressure for a statement as a result of the share price
collapse.
Shares in some of five banks forming the group's creditors' committee have
suffered, with stock in Mediobanca, leading the rescue talks, falling 5.7
per cent to L15,350 yesterday.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Stratagem to retain Firstpoint subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRATAGEM GROUP, the investment holding company, has ended talks on the
disposal of its Firstpoint computer maintenance company.
The group said that a number of companies had expressed interest in buying
Firstpoint, but in view of the improving results it was to be retained. Its
figures are now to be consolidated from March 1.
Stratagem reported the decision along with its figures for the six months to
February 28 when pre-tax profits were Pounds 272,000 (Pounds 221,000
losses).
Firstpoint, which was not consolidated because of the talks, showed profits
of Pounds 588,000 (Pounds 526,000) before tax and management charges, which
totalled Pounds 300,000 and were included in Stratagem's other income of
Pounds 621,000 (Pounds 594,000). Stratagem also had a surplus on disposal of
investments this time of Pounds 69,000.
Earnings per share were 2.2p (3p losses) and the company has begun paying
interim dividends with a payment of 1.5p.
Stratagem also said it was changing its brokers from Kleinwort Benson
Securities to Panmure Gordon. Mr Bernard Kerrison, chairman and chief
executive, said the move was intended to improve the marketability of the
shares as Panmure was geared more towards smaller companies.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Armed with a recipe for healthy growth -
Baxters of Speyside has expanded rapidly in recent years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAGGY Highland calf dozes in the sunshine. The river Spey sparkles blue
in the distance. Piped bagpipe music rings out from loudspeakers as visitors
trickle from a restaurant into a row of shops, one of them a restored 19th
century grocery.
All this is happening outside the production plant of Baxters of Speyside,
maker of high quality soups and preserves, near the little town of Fochabers
in Morayshire, north-east Scotland. The visitor centre, which gives 180,000
people a year a free tour of the factory, followed by a chance to buy cans
of soup and jars of jam, is a key part of the company's marketing effort.
'The visitor centre makes them remember Baxters' products,' says Ms Audrey
Baxter, the family-owned company's managing director. 'It is also a Pounds
1m business in its own right.'
Baxters has expanded rapidly in recent years: its sales doubled from Pounds
18m in 1987 to about Pounds 35m last year, and Ms Baxter expects them to
double again in the next five years. It employs about 650 people.
Though the company is still a relatively small food producer it has
established a niche for its range of premium foods in the ruthlessly
competitive UK food retailing sector. Its products are sold by all eight of
the big supermarket chains, which account for 70 to 80 per cent of the UK
food market, and it quotes independent research showing that it makes the
UK's top selling brands of premium soups, branded jams and some other
products.
Baxters of Speyside has been a famous name in soups since shortly after the
second world war when Mr Gordon Baxter, Ms Baxter's father, developed a
business, founded in 1868 by his grandfather.
Gordon Baxter had a talent for marketing, and his wife, Ena, devised some of
the company's most successful recipes such as its Royal Game Soup.
Last summer Gordon Baxter, now 75, handed over as managing director to his
daughter, remaining chairman. (His two sons also have senior posts in the
business). Audrey Baxter, who is married to a local businessman, joined the
company in 1987 after working for Kleinwort Benson in London.
'This business has taken off in the past six years,' Ms Baxter says. Until
her arrival, she says, it was 'run on instinct.' She drew up the company's
first three year plan 'so that everyone knew where they were going,' and
took charge of marketing, later becoming commercial director.
The polarisation of the food market over the past eight years with its
concentration in the hands of a small number of retail groups has presented
big opportunities to any food manufacturer who can command shelf space. Ms
Baxter says that Baxters has been able to achieve this partly because its
brands command premium prices which 'deliver profitability for the
retailer.'
'The two forces which drive us,' she says, 'are marketing and innovation.'
Baxters' greatest asset is its brand, which is nurtured through editorial
coverage, especially in women's magazines. Baxters advertises nationally on
TV and has an annual advertising budget of Pounds 2m. It exploits its base
in rural Scotland and benefits from the trend towards healthy food.
As for innovation, Baxters' chefs are continually developing new products to
satisfy the supermarket chains. The company offers vegetarian soups, and
will launch fresh soups sold in cartons in September. The drive is to
attract younger consumers, after the company found that many of its
customers, who are predominantly in the ABC1 social group, were aged between
45 and 60.
Baxters has rationalised its exports, which account for about 15 per cent of
turnover. Instead of exporting to about 60 countries and 'diluting our
efforts,' according to Ms Baxter, it now concentrates on six main markets,
led by Ireland, North America and Germany.
Baxters maintains contact with the big retailers on two levels. The family
handles dealings with their top executives - Gordon Baxter may invite them
to salmon fishing on the Spey. Detailed operations with retailers in England
are handled by Food Brokers, a sales company, but this will end in November
when Baxters introduces its own 14-person sales force. It already has its
own sales force in Scotland.
One threat to Baxters is that retailers, envious of the margins the brand
can command, will increasingly challenge it with their own products under
their labels. Ms Baxter says that Baxters already does own label
manufacturing for unnamed retailers but says this accounts for less than 15
per cent of turnover.
'I don't regard own label products as a threat to us, they're just
competition,' she says. The other challenge is to continue successfully
repeating the formula of marketing and innovation.
Though profit figures for the whole group are not readily available, Baxters
of Speyside, the main subsidiary, made an operating profit of Pounds 3m on
sales of Pounds 29.2m in the year to May 1992, a margin which food analysts
say is good by industry standards.
Baxters is 98.6 per cent owned by the Baxter family, who were recently said
by the Sunday Times to be worth Pounds 60m, based on a notional valuation of
the company.
'We have no debt at the moment, and as a family-owned company we can plough
much more of our cash back into the business than a quoted company,' says Ms
Baxter. Expansion, she says, should be funded internally.
The issue of whether the company might be taken over has been developed into
part of Baxters' marketing mystique. So far it has refused 172 takeover
offers and Gordon Baxter says his reply to persistent suitors is: 'I'll
leave a note for my executors to contact you if there is a change of mind.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Airtours buys Hogg Robinson retail side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the UK tour operator that narrowly failed to acquire rival Owners
Abroad earlier this year, is to pay Pounds 25m for the retail business of
Hogg Robinson.
Added to the Pickfords travel agencies bought last September, the 214 Hogg
Robinson branches will give Airtours 550 outlets, second only to Lunn Poly
in the UK.
Airtours expects at least Pounds 5m of benefits in the first full year. This
will be derived from increased commissions charged to tour operators and
from the introduction of Hogg Robinson's foreign exchange facilities
throughout the Pickfords branches.
The purchase continues the process of Airtours becoming a vertically
integrated company within the holiday industry. Had Airtours successfully
bid for Owners Abroad, the group would still have expanded its retail chain.
Airtours raised Pounds 49.5m through the issue of convertible shares at the
time of the failed bid. With interest rates at current levels, the deal
would immediately enhance earnings per share, said Mr Harry Coe, finance
director.
Airtours has use of the Hogg Robinson and Pickfords names until 1995 and is
therefore expected to change the name of the entire chain.
Lunn Poly has about 20 per cent of the market; Pickfords and Hogg Robinson
Leisure will have about 12 per cent, ahead of Thomas Cook with 8 per cent.
Mr Coe said that Pickfords' commissions were on average one percentage point
higher than at Hogg Robinson and would be increased.
Hogg Robinson also came with a highly developed information technology
system. As a result Airtours would not need to spend so much upgrading the
Pickfords systems. The total systems cost was now expected to be no more
than Pounds 2.5m.
Airtours share price rose 5p to 323p.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Strong Frontera sales behind IBC Vehicles'
return to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBC VEHICLES, the UK-based 60/40 joint venture between General Motors and
Isuzu, staged a strong recovery in 1992 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.2m
against losses of Pounds 28m in the previous year.
The company, formed in the late 1980s from the former loss-making Bedford
van operations in Luton, more than tripled turnover to Pounds 426m, compared
with Pounds 133.7m.
Production was more than doubled to 48,452 (20,932) vehicles as a result of
the successful build-up of output of the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera four wheel
drive leisure utility vehicle.
The ranges produced by IBC are based on Japanese technology from Isuzu and
Suzuki. GM holds minority equity stakes in both companies.
GM has, however, decided to halt production of the Suzuki-derived range of
microvans at IBC from the end of June following a collapse in demand.
Production of the small vans has plunged from 21,500 in 1989 to 5,652 last
year, and output has been cut to only 1,790 in the first half of this year.
Vauxhall sales of the Rascal van in the UK dropped last year to only 2,478
from 8,274 in 1990.
The market for Japanese-designed microvans has shrunk dramatically, and GM
is hoping that it can meet residual demand through the forthcoming launch of
its new Corsa high-roof van.
As the Rascal is withdrawn other competition is coming into the market,
however, with the launch by Daihatsu of its Italian-built Hijet microvan,
which is being assembled at a joint venture plant at Pontedera, Tuscany with
Piaggio of Italy.
GM is planning to keep the Midi panel van in production at IBC at least
until 1995-96, but it is in negotiations with other vanmakers in Europe
about collaboration on a new vehicle range to replace the ageing Midi in the
second half of the 1990s.
The future of the IBC operation is now tied closely to the production of
four wheel drive leisure utility vehicles; output of the Frontera is planned
to increase from 31,436 last year to 42-45,000 in 1993.
The company has reached agreement with trade unions for the introduction of
a third shift at the plant, if this can be justified by higher demand for
the four wheel drive vehicles, which have succeeded so far in defying the
steep fall in demand for new cars in western Europe.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Drummond tumbles Pounds 3.4m into the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATIONAL difficulties arising from the integration of acquisitions and
the introduction of new equipment, as well as the effects of recession, were
behind a fall into losses at Drummond Group.
The company, which makes fabrics and associated products for the clothing
industry, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 3.38m after net
reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.6m in the year to end-March.
The outcome compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.14m last time and was
struck on turnover down from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 45.6m.
Profits at the operating level were Pounds 116,000 (Pounds 2.03m).
Losses per share were 22.63p (4.59p earnings). There is no dividend; in
1991-92 a total of 1.5p was paid.
Mr Stefan Simmonds, chairman, said the integration of Crowthers and
Courtauld Woollens, and Armatex, the group's man-made fibres division, had
taken longer to achieve than expected, while the re-equipping of the worsted
operation with modern plant had yet to show results.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Former SD-Scicon chief returns to computer
roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PHILIP Swinstead, founder and chief executive of SD-Scicon, the systems
company, until its acquisition by EDS of the US two years ago, yesterday
signalled his return to the computer industry with the purchase of a
controlling interest in a small USM-quoted consultancy.
He has become the chief executive and largest shareholder in Comac, a
computer personnel company, through the purchase for Pounds 720,000 of a
19.4 per cent stake.
Samuel Montagu, SD-Scicon's adviser during the protracted takeover battle
with EDS, bought 10.52 per cent and a further 16.35 per cent was placed by
James Capel.
The shares were acquired from HIT Investments, a subsidiary of Hillsdown
Holdings, the foods group, which has been disposing of some of its
peripheral investments in recent months.
Comac made pre-tax profits last year of about Pounds 450,000 on turnover of
some Pounds 10m.
Mr Swinstead founded and guided Systems Designers to several years of
unbroken growth until disastrous fixed price contracts and a troublesome
merger with Scicon brought losses and the sale to EDS. He has been unable to
return to the business before now because of a non-compete clause in the EDS
deal.
He said yesterday that he was returning to his roots. Comac was in much the
same position as Systems Designers in the 1970s.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Fisons launches asthma drug in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the healthcare and scientific instruments group, yesterday began
marketing Tilade, an asthma treatment, in the US.
'This is Fisons' last throw of the dice to remain a viable pharmaceutical
entity,' said Mr Paul Woodhouse, drugs analyst at Smith New Court. 'They
have to make this launch work'. The company is co-promoting the product with
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
The groups aim to position the product for those with mild asthma who use a
bronchodilator, such as Ventolin, more than three times a week. Whereas
bronchodilators help improve symptoms, Tilade is designed to treat the
underlying inflammation.
Fisons is co-promoting Azmacourt, RPR's inhaled steroid medicine, which is
designed for patients using bronchodilators more than three times a day.
US doctors have been reluctant to prescribe inhaled steroids because of
potential side-effects.
'The group has a window of opportunity to establish this drug before safer
second-generation inhaled steroids come on the market,' said Mr Woodhouse.
Tilade was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January, but
Fisons waited for the results of a further clinical trial to show it was
more effective than Intal, its other asthma treatment.

'This is Fisons' last throw of the dice to remain a viable pharmaceutical

The company is co-promoting the product with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and is
marketing Tilade with a combined sales force of 800 people.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Drummond Pounds 3.4m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATIONAL difficulties arising from the integration of acquisitions and
the introduction of new equipment, as well as the effects of recession, were
behind a fall into losses at Drummond Group.
The company, which makes fabrics and associated products for the clothing
industry, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 3.38m after net
reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.6m in the year to end-March.
The outcome compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.14m last time and was
struck on turnover down from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 45.6m.
Profits at the operating level were Pounds 116,000 (Pounds 2.03m). However,
this comprised profits of Pounds 658,000 (Pounds 814,000) from discontinued
operations. Continuing operations incurred losses of Pounds 542,000 against
profits of Pounds 1.21m.
Losses per share were 22.63p (4.59p earnings). There is no dividend; in
1991-92 a total of 1.5p was paid.
Mr Stefan Simmonds, chairman, said the integration of Crowthers and
Courtauld Woollens, and Armatex, the group's man-made fibres division, had
taken longer to achieve than expected, while the re-equipping of the worsted
operation with modern plant had yet to show results.
The sale of Stroud Riley, the South African subsidiary, to Chargeurs
Textiles has now been completed and gross proceeds of Pounds 3.7m have been
received.
Gearing after the disposal is 66 per cent. In conjunction with the sale,
Drummond has secured overdraft facilities untill April 30 1994 on terms
which the board considers satisfactory.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: 92% take up for Saatchi rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAATCHI AND Saatchi's Pounds 73m rights issue was 92 per cent taken up.
Directors were 'pleasantly surprised' at the relatively high take-up,
particularly since more than half of the group's shares are held outside the
UK.
The group plans to use Pounds 36.5m of the proceeds to reduce bank debt;
Pounds 19m will go towards acquiring minority interests in European
advertising subsidiaries; Pounds 10.5m will be used to strengthen the
increasingly important media buying businesses; and Pounds 7m will be used
to invest in new information technology.
The issue was fully underwritten by SG Warburg and UBS. The largest
institutional investor is the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, with 8.99
per cent prior to the issue.
Saatchi shares dipped 1p to 165p yesterday.
British Airways announced yesterday that 92 per cent of its 1-for-4 rights
issue was taken up by shareholders at 245p a share. The balance was placed
by the underwriters at a net premium of 45.418p a share. BA shares closed
last night up 2p at 294p.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Second half recovery helps Kenwood rise 4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENWOOD APPLIANCES, the household appliance company, yesterday reported
slightly higher than expected profits for the year to March 31, the first
since the company came to the stock market last July.
Pro forma pre-tax profits, adjusted for the benefits of the flotation,
increased 4 per cent from Pounds 9.29m to Pounds 9.62m. Actual profits,
taking into account interest costs of Pounds 1.84m, were Pounds 8.39m.
After a poor summer, which led to an embarrassing profit warning three
months after going public, second half profits recovered strongly helped by
sterling's devaluation.
Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, said the UK economy also improved, as had
Kenwood's share of overseas markets. 'I think all of that's pretty
encouraging,' he said.
He said sales to continental Europe, which account for about a third of the
total, should continue to improve despite mounting recession in Germany and
France. Kenwood hoped growth would come from new products, helped by
sterling's competitiveness.
Turnover increased 10 per cent to Pounds 101.6m, lifted by UK sales of new
products like kettles and hair dryers. However, another new product, a water
filter, performed poorly despite heavy marketing costs.
One-off costs linked to the flotation and the acquisition in November of
Tricom, the Hong Kong-based manufacturer, depressed operating margins
slightly. Operating profits increased 7.6 per cent to Pounds 10.3m. Kenwood
used the Pounds 39.5m raised by the flotation to reduce debts and the
company moved to net cash of Pounds 146,000 by the year end.
Earnings were depressed by a higher tax charge and fell 6 per cent to 17.8p
per share. A recommended final dividend of 4.35p makes a total of 5.85p.
COMMENT
The stock market's nerve was strongly tested at the time of the profits
warning, but those with strong stomachs have been rewarded and the shares
closed yesterday up 10p at a record 321p. Forecast profits this year of
Pounds 11m put the shares on a multiple approaching 16, already a premium to
the market. Kenwood is a quality company with promising new products coming
through. The Hong Kong acquisition should allow more manufacturing to be
brought in-house, thereby improving margins - although plans to attack the
Chinese market should be treated with circumspection. The currency factor
should give comfort if a European price war develops later this year.
Despite the attractions, Kenwood's short exposure on the public stage
suggests investors may prefer to wait for a longer track record before
chasing the shares any higher.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: East Midlands Elect lifts dividend 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAST MIDLANDS Electricity set the scene for high dividend rises among
regional electricity companies when yesterday it raised its distribution by
14 per cent.
Analysts had expected East Midlands, the first of the recs to announce
results for last year, to offer one of the lowest dividend rises.
'We might be looking at 14 per cent plus for all of them now,' said one.
For the year to March 31, East Midlands reported pre-tax profits up 3.4 per
cent at Pounds 155.1m on turnover ahead 1.7 per cent to Pounds 1.57bn.
The final dividend was 13.78p, making a total of 19.5p, paid from earnings
of 53.3p, up 6.4 per cent.
Mr John Harris, chairman, said this year's dividend did not mean that the
company would necessarily provide increases at the same level in future. He
saw no risk of being penalised by the regulator for the dividend rise.
'We have demonstrated we are one of the lowest-cost operators in the country
and we are reducing tariffs in real terms,' he said.
The City applauded East Midlands for its attack on costs. Mr Harris said the
restructuring of its core electricity business, which involves cutting
operating divisions from 13 to seven, would reduce operating costs by Pounds
10m a year when fully implemented.
Electricity supply and distribution made operating profits of Pounds 179.6m,
up 16 per cent. However, energy services incurred an operating loss of
Pounds 4.9m against a profit of Pounds 1.8m. Mr Harris admitted not all the
contracting businesses had performed as well as expected.
Mr Harris said retailing had a much improved second half but profits were
Pounds 200,000 for the year compared with Pounds 1.3m. He said there was a
chance of further alliances following a merger this year with Yorkshire's
retail operations.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alpine directors seek to allay pension
fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS OF Alpine (Double Glazing), the window company which ceased
trading at the end of May, are seeking to allay fears over pension
contributions by inviting employees to discuss individual options with a
representative of Allied Dunbar, the assurance group.
In a letter received by pension contributors this weekend but dated June 9,
Mr Robert Pollock and Mr Robin Speirs, chairman and chief executive of
Alpine, cite a meeting to be held yesterday. However, they failed to include
either the time or place for the meeting.
The letter also states that 'the Allied Dunbar representative has been in
discussions with members'. It is understood, however, that formal talks with
Allied Dunbar broke down several months ago.
'The company has never implemented proposals presented by us some months
ago,' Allied said.
Mr Pollock and Mr Speirs inform pension contributors that following Alpine's
trading difficulties, contributions had been transferred from a 'separate
trust bank account' to a client account at the company's solicitors,
believed to be London firm, Beveridge Ross and Prevezers. The funds would be
held pending a decision as to how contributors wished to proceed, the letter
states. About Pounds 50,000 is in the client account, according to Mr Grant
Jones, Alpine's receiver.
The funds had initially been held in a trust account, Mr Pollock and Mr
Speirs state in their capacity as trustees, pending resolution of a dispute
with ADT Trustees.
Trustees of the pension fund at ADT, the company which previously owned
Alpine, had refused to transfer funds in 1992 following Alpine's purchase
out of administration with the backing of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands
entrepreneur.
ADT trustees said Alpine had never presented an approved pension plan to
which funds could be transferred. Deferred pensions or individual transfers
have since been arranged for eligible employees.
Alpine's creditors are due to meet in London this afternoon to vote on
whether the company should be liquidated.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: BT sale discounts scaled back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has scaled back incentives for retail investors in the sale
of its remaining 21.9 per cent stake in BT.
The public is being offered 10p off the first and second instalments set at
150p and 140p respectively. This compares with 15p off the first two
payments in the last government sale of BT shares which were set at 120p and
105p.
SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator, said the incentives were
less generous to reflect the fall in interest rates since 1991.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said one of the
aims of the offer was to 'demystify share dealing' through the use of share
shops.
More than 1.8m people have registered for the sale, taking the total,
including BT employees and existing shareholders, to more than 4m. However,
a number of the 150 share shops have expressed concern that the government
is promoting its own share information office at the expense of share shops.
Mr Dorrell said: 'Everyone tends to want to see things better than they are
. . . but the share shops have understated the scale of their own success.'
The Treasury has underlined its commitment to competition within the
institutional offer in a letter to the the top 500 institutions around the
world.
They have been told that the allocation of new BT shares will not be
affected by which global manager, including Warburg, through which they
choose to deal. The same rule applies to regional managers dealing with all
other institutions not on the top 500 list.
In previous privatisations institutions have suffered in allocations if they
did not deal through the bookmaker.
The first instalment in the international offer, which will be more than the
150p sought from retail investors, will be announced on June 29. The second
and third instalments will be the same for all investors, with the last
being determined by the price big investors tender in the international
offer.
The minimum application for retail investors will be 120 shares. The
incentives are on allocations of up to 1,000 shares or 1,500 if investors
opt for the 1-for-15 share bonus after three years.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced losses in manufacturing and increased profits in tools and trading
enabled Chillington Corporation to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 955,000
for 1992, against Pounds 646.000.
The company has returned to the dividend list with a proposed final of
0.25p. Last year only the interim of 0.5p was paid.
However a provision of Pounds 1.27m against possible losses from the closure
of the property and investment division left retained losses of Pounds 1.28m
(Pounds 777,000).
Turnover for the company, which also has interests in plantations, was
Pounds 44.4m (Pounds 48.6m). Losses per share came out at 0.2p, compared
with 2.4p.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: BET pins hopes on final phase of three-year
turnround plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TURNING business service companies around is like pushing peas up hill with
your nose,' said one analyst yesterday after BET reported further
provisions, a reduced final dividend and more pre-tax losses for the year to
end-March. 'It is going to be slow.'
Mr John Clark, chief executive, appears to agree. He is banking on the third
year of his three-year turnround programme to generate greater profitability
from a business that he says will shrink further to about Pounds 1.5bn of
sales.
According to Mr Clark there is nothing wrong with the markets. The UK
business services market is currently worth Pounds 40bn and will grow to
Pounds 80bn by the end of the century. Comparable figures for the US are
Dollars 800bn and Dollars 1,200bn.
The problem is that BET is getting no help from the UK economy, which if no
longer deteriorating is not improving at any great rate. 'We are seeing much
higher utilisation and higher rates (in plant hire),' says Mr Clark. That is
the most optimistic he can be about any of his business areas.
The question Mr Clark will have to answer for the markets over the next year
is whether there are enough businesses left to allow BET to resume growth.
Last year's divisional figures make sober reading.
The textiles division contributed 24 per cent of trading profits from
continuing operations. But sales fell 25 per cent, partly because of
deconsolidation of the French business, but also because of lower margins in
the UK. There was also a Pounds 15m restructuring cost.
As a result textiles - which employs 55,000 of the 100,000 people in the
group - accounted for Pounds 25m, or 47 per cent of the reduction in trading
profit.
The UK accounted for nearly two thirds of textile services. BET described
this market as facing 'particularly challenging conditions . . . in the
leisure, retail, hotel and heavy industrial sectors'.
Cleaning services produced 15 per cent of profits from continuing
operations, but this was sharply lower after 'severe pressure' on margins,
particularly in new business.
Security services made almost unchanged trading profits - about 14 per cent
of group profits - but the division suffered from a decline in military
spending. In the UK, where three quarters of the division's sales were
generated, the electronic security businesses continued to make good
progress, BET said.
Plant services saw sales fall slightly, but pressure on margins again hit
trading profits, which fell 18 per cent and were responsible for 11 per cent
of the total decrease in group trading profit. Distribution and plant
services were also down.
Catering and facilities management, both start-up businesses, showed rapid
growth in sales and profits and may hold one of the keys to future growth,
according to analysts.

Rentokil, the property and environmental services company, has extended its
offer for Securiguard, the guarding and cleaning company until June 18.
By the first closing date on Friday, Rentokil had received acceptances
representing about 1.35 per cent of Securiguard's shares.
Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman of Securiguard, urged shareholders to continue to
reject the offer, which he described as 'ridiculously low'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST COSTS at Ladbroke are continuing to rise, according to Mr Cyril
Stein, chairman of the hotels, racing and property group.
Addressing shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting, Mr Stein blamed the
rise on high interest rates in Europe, a reduction in interest receivable
and the devaluation of sterling.
The group received elections for its enhanced scrip alternative in respect
of just over 1bn shares, representing 92 per cent of the equity.

FT  15 JUN 93 / GE Capital secures lower price on GPA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GE CAPITAL will be able to exercise its option to take control of GPA Group
for less than Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m), according to a draft prospectus
circulated to shareholders.
The option price is Dollars 100m less than lenders to the Irish aircraft
leasing group were expecting when the prospective deal between the two
companies was signed last month.
It reflects the tough negotiating stance of GE Capital, the financial
services arm of General Electric of the US, which under the terms of the
deal can choose to exercise its option as late as March 31, 1997. The US
group has also agreed in principle to buy Dollars 1.35bn of GPA's aircraft.
GPA advisers believe there has been no real deterioration in its trading
position over the last month.
GE Capital's option price is for 65 per cent of the group. It could rise to
80 per cent if key GPA shareholders fail to underwrite an additional loan of
up to Dollars 150m, which is partially convertible into equity. However, GPA
remains confident some shareholders will join in the deal.
GPA has already started to seek irrevocable commitments from its core
shareholders to vote in favour of the agreement with GE Capital before its
extraordinary general meeting in August. The group needs the support of
holders of 75 per cent of its shares.
Directors of GPA, meeting at their Shannon headquarters in the Republic of
Ireland, yesterday approved the repayment of Dollars 122m of medium-term
notes due on Wednesday after deciding that the group's working capital
requirements were satisfactory.
GPA's 138 lenders have been asked to extend their waivers of breaches on its
banking covenants to the end of July. The request comes in a document from
the group which also contains the final draft bank implementation agreements
on the restructuring of GPA's Dollars 5.2bn borrowings.
The key lenders hope to finalise the bank agreement by early August. GPA
hopes to have its results for the year to March 31 in a final form by the
end of June.
The accounts are expected to contain hundreds of millions of dollars of
provisions to cover the cost of restructuring, lost deposits and falling
aircraft values.

FT  15 JUN 93 / SEC lifts restrictions on Zeneca share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDERWRITERS of Zeneca's Pounds 1.3bn rights issue will be able to trade
normally in the shares over the next few days after the US Securities and
Exchange Commission changed its decision on restrictions.
The SEC had previously said that underwriters would only be able to trade
'passively' in the last five days before the June 21 close, starting today.
But this limitation, which had raised fears that the underwriters would not
be able to support the share price, has been removed.
However, the SEC has said that the US marketing syndicate, which was seeking
buyers for the new shares in Zeneca, the bioscience group demerged from
Imperial Chemical Industries this month, had to stop operations as of last
night.
The syndicate was satisfying demand for shares by buying nil-paid Zeneca
shares in the UK market.
The syndicate can still operate outside the US. Zeneca's brokers declined to
comment on how successful the US syndicate had been. News of the SEC's
change of heart came after the market closed with Zeneca's shares up 1p to
617p, and the nil-paid down 1p at 17p. The rights issue is priced at 600p.
Zeneca yesterday announced the US Food and Drug Administration had approved
Zestril for the treatment of congestive heart failure.
The licence is for those patients not responding adequately to diuretics or
digoxin, a medicine extracted from foxgloves. There are between 2.3m and 3m
sufferers from the disease in the US, according to the American Heart
Association.
Both Merck's Vasotec and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Capoten have already
received licences for this indication.
Sales of products based on Zestril were Pounds 294m last year, an increase
of 31 per cent on 1991.
The company said growth continued during the first quarter of this year.

FT  15 JUN 93 / BET reduces dividend after Pounds 9.8m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services company, yesterday cut its final dividend after
reporting another year of losses and continuing downward price pressure in
its main markets.
Pre-tax losses in the year to the end of March were Pounds 9.8m on sales of
Pounds 2.18bn.
The figure was struck after further provisions for the cost of stripping out
all management layers between the profit centres and head office and also to
cover further asset value write-downs.
Mr John Clark, chief executive, said that in spite of the losses, the group
had now put its balance sheet on a sound footing after the repayment of all
its auction market preferred stock.
The way was now clear for a return to profitable growth.
He warned, however, that BET still needed to cut costs at the operating
level - where margins have continued to slide - as the group still faced
falling prices and pressure from competitors, who were prepared to sell
purely on price.
BET would still need the last year of its self-imposed three-year
'turnaround programme' to establish the right mix of businesses and to bring
profitability up to that which some competitors were achieving.
As expected by the market, BET chose to cut the final dividend.
The final payment will be 1.25p, bringing the total for the year down to
3.25p from 6.5p.
The loss per share was 4p compared with a 63.3p loss last year.
The pre-tax loss for 1991-2 of Pounds 448.4m included nearly Pounds 600m of
provisions for goodwill write-offs and losses on disposal or termination of
underperforming operations.
This year Pounds 33m of provisions covered reorganisation of management and
installation of management control systems.
Combined with a unified reporting and accounting procedure introduced last
year, head office now had a clear picture of what was going on at its 80
profit centres.
In addition BET wrote off Pounds 42m from the value of assets, including
Pounds 10m off the value of property to be sold imminently.
BET said these provisions completed 'the major retrenchment activity'.
The group also chose to write off Pounds 21m of advance corporation tax,
raising the tax charge to Pounds 15.5m, in a move which will give the group
a normal tax charge in the years to come.
BET shares rose 3p to 111p.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UPS rethinks its deliveries of red ink from Europe: Nikki
Tait analyses a shake-up at the world's biggest package delivery group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Parcel Service, the world's biggest package delivery company, is
rethinking its European strategy.
'We're going through the kind of appraisal we've never had time to do,'
admits 'Oz' Nelson, UPS's chairman.
The motive is simple. UPS, a privately owned company handling almost 3bn
packages a year and clocking up annual revenues of Dollars 16.5bn (Pounds
10.7bn), has spent the past eight years buying up local delivery firms
across Europe. The 16th and final transaction, the purchase of Carryfast in
the UK, was announced in June last year.
Although most of the deals were modest, UPS's total European investment,
including revamping the acquired facilities, is thought have topped Dollars
1bn.
Its reward, however, has been a steady flood of red ink. In 1992, 'foreign'
operations lost Dollars 276.2m before tax. This stretches the cumulative
deficit for the last three years to Dollars 795.8m.
UPS does not split out its international businesses, but it does confirm
that the bulk of these losses are in Europe.
Ominously, the company has abandoned its long-held aim of achieving
profitability in the region by 1994.
'Maybe we'll get there in 1996,' says Mr Nelson.
UPS is not alone in losing money hand-over-fist on a European delivery
business. Federal Express, UPS's Memphis-based rival, was obliged to abandon
its attempt to establish an intra-European delivery network last year, after
operating losses mounted to more than Dollars 100m a quarter.
The retrenchment cost 6,600 jobs and produced a one-off charge of Dollars
254m.
Most analysts attributed these problems to a serious mismatch between supply
and demand. The two US giants were drawn to Europe because they believed
that a unified European Community would accelerate the development of
pan-European businesses and create a related demand for speedy, reliable
cross-border delivery services.
To an extent, this has happened. UPS, for example, signed a contact earlier
this year with General Motors' European distribution network for the
overnight delivery of repair parts for Opel and Vauxhall cars.
But in general the pick-up in cross-border volume has been slow to emerge.
The overnight intra-European market has been put at fewer than 200,000
packages per day, for example, against 2m-3m sent around the US.
Federal's retrenchment removed one competitor from the market but other big
firms - notably Brussels-based DHL, Australia's TNT and UPS - continue to
battle for these thin pickings. In short, there is overcapacity.
But now, in what appears to be a shift of approach, Mr Nelson suggests that
UPS no longer sees its salvation in an increase in cross-border demand.
'There's just not a lot of business,' he admits. 'But if we can make the
domestic operations (in Europe) profitable, all the rest will eventually be
gravy.'
This is where the rethink is concentrated. There is little UPS can do about
Europe's recession, but it may be able to work on localised management
problems.
These stem partly from UPS's corporate culture in the US. It is one of
America's biggest private companies, owned principally by its managers and
supervisors. It has, for years, prided itself on running an immensely
efficient delivery operation, sending its ubiquitous brown vans to every
corner of the US.
But, until recently, UPS concentrated on delivery rather than selling the
service, which in turn led to strict work-rules and a rather conformist
culture. The company employed efficiency experts, for example, to determine
how fast drivers should walk, how they should carry the packages, handle van
keys, and so on.
By contrast, UPS's marketing department consisted of half a dozen people.
The company also clung to listed delivery rates long after competitors, such
as Federal and Airborne Express, wooed corporate customers with discount
offers.
Attempts to impose the same corporate approach in Europe have not always
gone smoothly.
In Spain, for example, where UPS purchased a package delivery company called
Cuallado in 1990, there was a costly one-month strike by drivers last year.
The drivers' grievances centred on US-style working conditions: they were
unhappy about UPS's no-smoking rules and its uniform requirements.
In France, meanwhile, UPS lost some top management when executives retired
shortly after the Prost Transport acquisition. In Italy, it simply misjudged
the competition: delivery by the Italian post office is very cheap.
'Anyone who can wait two or three days is not going to pay our rates,'
admits Mr Nelson.
UPS says that it learnt two decades ago, when it first tried to build a
German network from scratch, that foreign operations have to be run locally.
Although top management has now changed at the Spanish, Italian, and to an
extent at the French operations, Mr Nelson says the company still employs
relatively few US nationals in Europe.
But he is equally emphatic that these local managers, with the Atlanta head
office, need to make a thorough assessment of prospects.
How radical the conclusions may be is a moot point, but it seems some
serious reshaping may be on the cards. For example, in Italy, Mr Nelson is
mulling over the possibility of turning the business into a courier service
'when we grow up there'.
He is also insistent that much of the solution in Europe needs to be
marketing-driven, giving the operations more support through the regional
headquarters in London. This mirrors the changes which he has just pushed
through in the US.
At the end of the day, UPS's weaknesses may be its strengths. The company
has long pockets, a solid balance sheet, a large profitable US business, and
 -because of its private status - no pressure from Wall Street investors. It
also invites European managers into the ownership structure, giving them a
vested interest in success.
Asked to confirm that UPS will not repeat Federal Express's retrenchment, Mr
Nelson says: 'We don't walk away. We may tackle it differently.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / VW to build low-cost car plant

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN has started talks with a consortium of Spanish banks and
industrial companies on plans to build a factory to make 'the cheapest car
in the world', Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the German group's
production director, said yesterday.
'We are now in a period of analysis. We should be able to have a very clear
picture by 1995,' he announced. 'I am confident that we will have this dream
plant.'
The project for a plant in his Basque homeland had been proposed to SEAT,
VW's Spanish subsidiary, by a consortium including the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,
the Banco Central Hispano, the Mondragon industrial co-operative, and
Iberdrola, Spain's biggest electricity utility.
He shrugged off warnings from General Motors, his former employers, that
further legal action may follow if VW went ahead with the project, which
seems closely modelled on an idea he and his colleagues generated while with
the US group.
'We live in a free continent, and we are all free to develop ideas and make
goods which we consider best for markets. We will do so if we want and no
one can tell us otherwise.'
The Spanish consortium is believed to have offered to build a factory with
capacity for up to 200,000 cars a year in Amorebieta, near Bilbao, to be
operated by VW and bought from the consortium at some unspecified date.
While Mr Lopez suggested in answer to questions that this was his ideal
project, a separate written statement, attributed to Mr Lopez, said VW
wanted only a 'production laboratory' on a greenfield site to test
revolutionary assembly methods under real operating conditions.
While Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, recently confirmed that the
company needed a cheap, bottom-end model in its range, Volkswagen will face
severe political problems if it opens up significant new capacity in Spain
while cutting back output in Germany.
Capital investment plans for the vehicles business have been cut to around
half the original planned level for this year - just DM6bn (Pounds 2.4bn).
One of the main victims of the squeeze has been a new, greenfield plant in
Mosel, eastern Germany.

FT  15 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was always a safe bet that the yen would appreciate in 1993. The size of
Japan's current account surplus and the intensity of US displeasure meant
the currency could hardly respond in any other way. The more difficult
assessment is to decide when enough is enough. The yen has risen by more
than 15 per cent since the start of the year, a move whose deflationary
impact more or less wipes out the effect of the last two stimulatory fiscal
packages. As the stock market becomes edgy over growth prospects, pressure
is bound to mount for another rate cut and more fiscal pump priming, which
might be seen as a fitting gesture from the hosts at next month's economic
summit.
That, though, may overstate the extent of the authorities' alarm. Japanese
exporters know how to cope with a sharply rising exchange rate. The Bank of
Japan has been intervening actively, but it has hardly been in a hurry to
cut rates. There is no guarantee either that lower rates or another
stimulatory package would boost consumption enough to make a big dent in the
current account surplus.
More important to the exchange market may be the course of trade
negotiations with the US, in which Japan is fighting a rearguard action to
escape the imposition of quantitative targets for imports. Were Japan's
resolve to falter, the yen could fall back again: a trade agreement with the
US would give Washington less reason for talking the currency up. A rate
cut, by contrast, could be seen as confirmation of the currency's inherent
strength.

FT  15 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: East Midlands Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Deciding to borrow Pounds 150m at an interest rate of 12 per cent near the
top of the interest rate cycle looks pretty rum, even without the benefit of
hindsight. Doubly so when the Eurobond in question now accounts for more
than East Midlands' total net debt and the company is locked into the deal
for 25 years. Sadly, the financing decision is typical of East Midlands'
accident-prone progress outside its mainstream electricity business - most
notably in the poorly performing contracting and retailing operations. It
must be some relief to shareholders that prospects in coal mining are now so
poor that East Midlands has all but abandoned its ambitions there.
The basic electricity business is a gift which the most inept management
would find difficult to destroy. But regulatory reviews will squeeze
returns. Supply generates little profit, so Offer's current review should
not dent share prices. The subsequent distribution review is more important.
Attempts to massage profits down by retaining costs are unlikely to fool
Offer, so East Midlands' decision to cut now looks sensible. Still, even if
the average regional electricity company's price cap is tightened from
RPI+1.5 to RPI-6, the RECs generally could still probably manage annual
dividend increases of 8 per cent between 1995 and 2000. Much of that,
however, would be at the expense of dividend cover. Fund managers may be
nervous about shrinking mainstream earnings when quality diversification
profits have proved so hard to come by.

FT  15 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: BET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BET's dividend is shrinking in line with its business. Sales are below the
level of five years ago, with talk of more disposals to come. Operating
profits last year were less than half those reported for 1991-92. Since it
now transpires that asset valuations - and therefore depreciation charges -
have in the past been surprisingly inconsistent across the group, previous
profits are not entirely comparable. But the balance sheet has equally
dictated the dividend cut. Capital and reserves have halved in the last
three years.
While the new management deserves credit for averting a debt crisis, the
reduced size of BET's balance sheet limits its options for growth. There is
little scope for additional borrowing if gearing is to be held down. An
acquisition which required goodwill write-offs would take another bite out
of shareholders' funds. A rights issue to finance an acquisition would solve
both problems, but BET cannot justify another appeal to shareholders on the
basis of good intentions alone. Since the shares closed yesterday just 1p
above the price at which rights were offered in July, it was wise to resist
so much as an enhanced scrip dividend.
That leaves BET to fund organic growth out of cash flow. Having spent two
years squeezing working capital - not to mention the dividend and capital
expenditure - at least its cash generation is strong. But breaking into
higher-margin businesses from scratch will be a slow process.
Meanwhile, the pricing pressures which have squeezed margins in less
capital-intensive areas such as contract cleaning show no sign of easing.
Without relief from that quarter, BET has little hope of establishing itself
as a growth stock.

FT  15 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Understanding Mr Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise of nearly 30 points in the FT-SE 100 index at one stage yesterday
suggests markets may be expecting too much of tonight's Mansion House
speech. Though the gain was basically driven by the futures market, it was
attributed to expectations that the new chancellor would kick off with a cut
in interest rates. That would be hard to justify.
The latest producer price figures show inflation remains subdued but it is
not exactly falling either. More significantly, Mr Clarke is hemmed in
politically, both by his predecessor's criticism of the way the last rate
cut decision was taken and by the opposition of the Bank of England.
Indeed, he may not be ready to launch any particular policy initiatives
after such a short period in office. But the policy debate has assumed a new
intensity since Mr Lamont's departure. Two strands are worth noting: first
the notion has surfaced that accelerating growth may be enough to sort out
the PSBR, and second there is a view in some quarters that a strong exchange
rate is a good way of curbing inflation. Such an approach to the PSBR may be
the easy political way out, but it would quickly reveal itself as flawed. If
a strong exchange rate were also part of the picture, talk might then turn
to how far interest rates would have to rise rather than when they would
come down.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Branson suggests frequency swap to end Radio 4 row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Branson of Virgin Group has proposed to the BBC a swap of radio
frequencies that might end the growing row over the fate of Radio 4 on long
wave.
The BBC has run into serious difficulties over its plans to launch a new
24-hour rolling news service on long wave and restrict Radio 4 broadcasts to
the FM frequencies.
This would cut off a much-loved radio service to those in the UK who do not
have an FM radio or who live in areas which cannot receive FM. In addition,
hundreds of thousands of listeners in continental Europe would no longer be
able to listen to Radio 4 on long wave.
Mr Branson has his own problem. In April he launched the UK's first national
commercial pop station - Virgin Radio 1215 - on medium wave, a frequency he
believes is hardly suited for music because its sound quality is poor
compared with FM.
With his eye on the BBC's FM frequency, he has met Mr John Birt, the BBC
director-general, to suggest a grand swap of frequencies.
Under the Branson proposal, the BBC would get Virgin's medium wave
frequency, which Mr Branson argues is more appropriate for speech than
music. In return, Virgin would get the coveted FM frequency.
The BBC could then run its planned news services on medium wave, which is
easily available all over the UK, and Radio 4 could continue on long wave
and be audible on the Continent as it is now.
The BBC confirmed last night that Mr Birt and Mr Branson had met, but
refused to go into detail. In practice, the BBC has a number of options.
It could, for example, simply switch its proposed rolling news service to
FM, leaving Radio 4 on long wave.
The Virgin chairman plans a meeting next week with groups campaigning to
keep Radio 4 on long wave. He will outline his proposals to the national
heritage select committee on the future of the BBC next month.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Timex threatens to shut plant: Union official fears '90 per
cent likelihood of closure' by year-end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT last night threatened to close the strike-hit Timex Electronics
plant in Dundee by the year-end if there was no settlement on a return to
work.
Mr William Lesslie, a former AEEU engineering union deputy convener at the
plant, said after talks with management that there was a '90 per cent
likelihood of closure by Christmas'.
The talks involved Mr Mohamed Saleh, the company's head of human resources
in the US, union officials and leaders of the sacked Dundee workforce.
Earlier Timex Electronics disclosed that its president Mr Peter Hall had
resigned for personal reasons. His departure was widely seen as making a
settlement slightly easier to reach but union officials said they were not
expecting an early solution.
Mr John Kydd, divisional organiser of the AEEU, said the company had
effectively demanded the union accept virtually the same package the sacked
workforce rejected earlier this month. He said the two sides were 'poles
apart'.
'We believe there is a future for Timex at Dundee with reasonable wages and
conditions,' Mr Kydd said. 'We are prepared to compromise, the company is
not.' Talks are due to resume today with little hope of agreement being held
out.
It was the first time since February that Timex had met local union leaders,
though the company has had lengthy negotiations with the union's national
officials.
The printed circuit board assembly factory is being managed by Mr John
Dryfe, a Scot who is chairman of Timex Electronics in the US and was once
manager of the Dundee facility.
The Timex dispute is in its fifth month. The Dundee plant had 340 hourly
paid workers, 80 per cent of them women, until the entire workforce was
sacked in February. Since then the company has been bussing in replacements.
Strikers this month contemptuously rejected the peace terms negotiated by
the union, which said the terms represented a 27 per cent cut in pay and
benefits.
The strikers want to win back their jobs on conditions similar to those
under which they were working before they were sacked.
They believe pressure is mounting on Timex - partly because of the damage
being inflicted by the long-running dispute on the company's image - and
they accept that closure is a possibility.
Mr John Stewart, a member of the strike committee, said: 'Timex's attempt to
maintain production with the replacement workforce has been a dismal
failure.'
Timex has insisted production is being maintained and that it needs to
increase its workforce to meet new orders.
David Goodhart in Zurich writes: Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU,
welcomed the news that Mr Hall had left Timex and said it was a 'necessary
but not sufficient condition for finding a resolution'.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Re-peg to D-Mark, Europe told: Currencies move urged by BIS
to prevent rise of protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BASLE

<TEXT>
EUROPE must re-peg its currencies to the D-Mark to head off growing
protectionist pressures, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the
Bank for International Settlements, said yesterday.
Speaking after the Basle-based bank's annual meeting, Mr Lamfalussy said the
present arrangement, in which Britain and Italy were no longer in the
European exchange rate mechanism and the currencies of Sweden, Finland and
Norway were floating, was 'not sustainable in the longer term'.
In a gloomy annual report, the BIS, owned by 32 central banks mainly in the
industrialised world, said the gradual recovery under way in developed
countries was unlikely to bring high unemployment down sharply.
The report highlighted difficulties caused by slow growth and high
government deficits in many advanced nations, together with the 'enormous'
potential for conflict in the slow progress of Uruguay trade round talks.
In linking the ERM turbulence of the past year with trade, Mr Lamfalussy was
underlining how some nations in the ERM - notably France - believed
devaluation of the pound and lira enabled the UK and Italy to boost growth
at the expense of other European nations by helping export competitiveness.
Mr Lamfalussy said devaluation of several European currencies in the past
year could 'cause problems' among their trading partners.
'If someone could prove to me that floating currencies are compatible with
relatively stable real exchange rates then my argument wouldn't hold - but
in the past this hasn't happened,' he said.
The BIS said this year would see 'further declines or at best a levelling
out' in the economies in continental Europe, while signs of recovery in the
US remained 'fragile'.
In unusually strong comments on those out of work, the bank said:
'Especially in continental Europe, where 40-50 per cent of the unemployed
have been without work for 12 months or more, unemployment constitutes a
structural problem which cannot easily be resolved through faster output
growth.'
The report laid the blame for high unemployment on 'high minimum wages and
social taxes which raise labour costs, inflexible wage structures and real
wages, restrictive work regulations and low labour mobility'. It warned that
'effective solutions become more difficult as time passes and the long-term
unemployed progressively lose contact with the labour market'.
In view of the wide gap between government spending and borrowing in many
countries, the BIS said 'very few' nations could boost economic activity by
fiscal means.
Only Ireland and Japan of the main developed countries were likely this year
to avoid an increase in the ratio of overall government debt to gross
domestic product.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Clipping the banks' wings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE present economic cycle much of the world economy has suffered from
asset price inflation, followed by falling asset prices, stress in the
banking system and worries about the capacity of banks to finance economic
recovery. The price of such instability, in the shape of lost output and
jobs, is all too apparent, especially in the English-speaking economies, in
Scandinavia and in Japan. Hence the topicality of the question raised in the
annual report of the Bank for International Settlements: can a recurrence be
prevented?
The answer clearly hinges on the extent to which this was an exceptional
occurrence relating to one-off changes in the financial system. And at first
sight it is tempting to attribute the present problems to specific upheavals
in the workings of the financial markets.
In most developed countries, banks in the 1980s were subjected to a host of
deregulatory shocks, ranging from the abolition of exchange controls to the
lifting of quantitative controls on bank lending. This agenda, which
embodied the growing conviction on the part of policymakers that banks
should behave more like profit-maximising firms than socially conscious
utilities, was an exceptionally potent formula for racking up bad debts,
especially against a background of sharply rising share and property values.
The problems were compounded by moral hazard. Deposit insurance gave little
incentive for depositors to assess the creditworthiness of banks.
Re-regulation
It seems unlikely that such a tidal wave of regulatory change will be
repeated in short order. The current trend is anyway towards re-regulation,
not least in the form of the BIS's own capital adequacy rules. But there are
nonetheless grounds for thinking that a repeat performance cannot ultimately
be ruled out, the most important of which relates to the the central banks'
activities as lenders of last resort.
The readiness of central banks to provide liquidity to markets and
institutions helps ensure that there is no repeat of the depression of the
1930s. But it also introduces a generalised form of moral hazard by
socialising risk and facilitating speculative financing. At a more basic
level, the concessionary financing that accompanies bank support operations
is not without wider cost. While it insulates the bank creditors from loss,
it further weakens discipline.
Low inflation
At the macro-economic level, the remedy is a firm anti-inflation commitment.
But as the BIS itself points out, this can pose difficulties for the
authorities. In Japan in the late 1980s speculative excess co-existed with
low inflation. It could not have been curbed without an unwelcome
contraction in the real economy.
That leaves prudential supervision as a counterweight to a more competitive
financial environment. But while theoretically appealing, the practice is
more difficult. There is, for example, a tendency for supervisors to act
pro-cyclically, instead of counter-cyclically - witness how the BIS's
capital requirements were introduced just in time to encourage a credit
crunch. And innovation tends to wrong-foot the watchdogs.
But if instability in banking is endemic, there remain obvious priorities
when it comes to cleaning up the mess. The most pressing one now is a rapid
recapitalisation of the banking systems where the capacity to extend credit
has been impaired. In the UK and the US this is being achieved with the help
of a steep yield curve, whereby banks can borrow at low short-term interest
rates to invest in longer-term higher-yielding paper, including government
IOUs. In Scandinavia it has been achieved with the help of more direct
government support.
But in Japan, where the gap between short and long interest rates is narrow,
the authorities have been slow to impose the requisite balance sheet
restructuring. Given the size of the Japanese economy, that is a growing
worry for the rest of the world as well as the Japanese themselves.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA, CAMBODIA, Angola, now Somalia. At no time in its 48-year history
have the demands on the United Nations to resolve regional conflicts,
contain civil wars and save lives been so high. Nor has there ever been
greater readiness to blame the UN when peace-keeping or peace-making
operations go wrong.
It is not, however, the UN that should be blamed for failure to bring peace
to the Balkans, or even for the tragedy of errors now unfolding in the Horn
of Africa. Its leading member states - and in particular the five permanent
members of the Security Council - would do better to examine their own
responsibility for what has happened in Bosnia-Hercegovina and in Somalia,
and to ask what lessons can be learned to ensure that future international
humanitarian and peace-making efforts do not go so badly awry.
The record is far from all bad. In Cambodia, for example, the UN has in
recent weeks overseen a remarkably successful multi-party election. While
that, too, appears to have run into difficulties, with the ruling party
rejecting the results, the UN transitional authority has done as well as
could have been expected in facilitating the process. The UN should now
focus upon helping to secure a constitution and legitimate government, if
necessary deploying the powerful sanction of withholding recognition. But it
will in the end be for Cambodians to make democracy work.
Uncharted waters
Somalia, like Bosnia, presents a much more uncomfortable case, taking the UN
into uncharted waters. For what started as a well-intentioned if belated
military intervention with the aim of feeding a starving populace has become
a bloody melee in which UN forces risk ending up at war with the people they
are trying to help. The US, which led the 'humanitarian invasion' last
December, is now expending its energies in bombing the facilities of a rebel
warlord, Pakistani peace-keepers in fire-fights on the streets of Mogadishu.
The chances of restoring order or effective government are more remote than
ever.
In helping to bring Somalia to this pass, the UN powers made a number of
fundamental errors. First, Washington failed to think clearly about the
purpose or implications of its military role at the outset. George Bush's
decision to send a large force to feed Somalia was one of the last acts of a
defeated president. His administration did not co-ordinate its actions
properly with the UN. Its purpose was always to feed the maximum number of
Somalis in the shortest possible time, then allow Mr Bush's successor to
hand the country over to a broader-based peace-keeping force. American
troops were not ordered to disarm Somalia's lawless militias. Washington
also paid insufficient attention to the root cause of the country's
problems: the collapse of any form of administrative authority. Without a
serious effort at political reconciliation, encompassing a broad swathe of
Somali society, intervention could never be more than a palliative.
Urgent action
The UN's current difficulties stem directly from these blunders. Its own
efforts to foster negotiations among Somalia's warring factions were
hopelessly ineffectual. They attributed undue importance to the warlords and
did not include a wide enough cross-section of what is left of Somali civil
society. When they came to nothing, UN forces were left with no clear
mission beyond continuing to fill empty stomachs, and with decreasing
authority to carry it out. Confrontation with a warlord ambitious to fill
the vacuum was only a matter of time.
Urgent action is now required from the UN Security Council to prevent the
situation from deteriorating further. As in Bosnia, member states face a
stark choice: either re-engage with the country on a new, more carefully
considered basis, or pull out. In Somalia the former course means nothing
short of taking the country under temporary UN trusteeship, with all the
political responsibilities that entails - combining concerted diplomatic
action to restart reconciliation among Somalis and a stiffened military
presence with the aim of disarming the militias. It is a tall order, but it
is more palatable than the international humiliation and Somali suffering
which would follow withdrawal. In Bosnia, where negotiated three-way
partition seems the least terrible outcome, the stakes are higher. For the
UN, however, the underlying lesson is the same.

Who's going to win the next Booker prize? No, not the literary prize for
fiction, but the number two slot at the Booker food giant when chief
executive Jonathan Taylor, 57, steps into the chairman's suite later this
week.
Presumably, Taylor is not going to upset the City by combining the role of
chairman and chief executive, especially given Booker's lacklustre
performance in recent years and Taylor's keenness to spend more time on good
works, such as raising money for Oxford's Bodleian Library.
Barry Skipper, chief executive of food distribution, and finance director
David Turner are the obvious internal candidates. But they have been around
for years and Booker could do with a bit of fresh blood at the top.
Let's hope that Taylor doesn't fluff his first big decision in the chair.

Good to see a spot of aviation romance surfacing amid the industrial gloom
at the Paris Air Show. The European Airbus consortium has dispatched one of
its latest craft on a record-breaking run.
A four-engine A340 set off from Le Bourget yesterday on a round the world
tour. Flying east, its first and only port of call will be New Zealand,
which should be reached in just under a day.
If all goes well it should be back at Le Bourget on Friday. Airbus has had
to cut the number of passengers from 273 to just 20 but it did not have to
sink to towing its showpiece to the end of the runway to save fuel, as
Boeing did when they attempted a similar feat with its non-stop 747-400
flight from London to Sydney.
Airbus hopes its marketing ploy will interest high-rolling customers with
global ambitions. The Sultan of Brunei, for instance, has already bought a
second-hand Lufthansa A340 for his personal use.
The French secret services, which have been known to venture that far
afield, might also be interested by the A340's first non-stop flight to
Auckland, if they ever needed a craft for another quick get away.

Health secretary Virginia Bottomley has an easy way of spotting when husband
Peter, one of the looser cannons on the Tory back benches, is going to cause
trouble. He comes down to breakfast sporting his splendid Transport and
General Workers' Union tie.
Yesterday was no exception. Suitably attired, Comrade Bottomley attended the
launch of a TUC-led campaign against a particularly blatant union-bashing
amendment which has suddenly surfaced in the employment bill, due to be
debated in the Commons today.
With much reference to Tolpuddle Martyrs, Bottomley easily outshone John
Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, in the depth of emotion he showed in
favour of trade union rights and contempt for anyone who dared tamper with
them. Stanley Baldwin might have sympathised, but it can hardly have gone
down well with the current generation of Tory bosses.
As for the TGWU, Britain's biggest blue-collar union, it is not making a big
thing about its new star campaigner. 'He's not our most illustrious member,'
sniffs an official. 'That would be the Queen Mother. She wanted to become an
honorary bummarree (porter) when she visited Smithfield market, and she was
issued with a T&amp;G card there and then.'

If there are any gamblers left among the Buba-watching fraternity, the
guessing game as to who will be number two to Hans Tietmeyer, due to take
over as president of the German central bank this autumn, is still wide
open.
The previous favourite, Reimut Jochimsen, appears to have fluffed his
chances through his open antagonism to the Maastricht process, and the
punters are having to re-study their race card.
From the back of the field, but already counted one of the surer bets, comes
council new boy Horst Schulmann, 60, who arrived back from Washington only
last October as president of the central bank of Hesse.
It was Schulmann who, as Helmut Schmidt's 'sherpa', worked hard on
convincing a sceptical Bundesbank to accept the EMS in the first place. He
has experience at the EC Commission on his side, and the politics also fit.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, which will make the selection, is
likely to go for an SPD candidate if only because it needs the opposition's
co-operation if it is to cut into welfare spending.
Meanwhile, Johann Gaddum, chief architect of the bank's recent 'dribbling'
approach to interest rate cuts, would probably be the most deserving winner.
But he's both the wrong political colour, and, with only just over a year to
retirement, a little old.
The intriguing outsider is Edgar Meister, finance minister of the Rhineland
Palatinate, Kohl's political training ground. He has the invaluable merit of
being on good terms with the beleaguered Theo Waigel, the Bonn finance
minister charged with slashing spending, and a man in need of all the
friends he can find, especially in the Bundesbank.

FT  15 JUN 93 / A behemoth goes to the block: Haig Simonian and Robert
Graham examine the privatisation of Italy's largest state holding company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, looks increasingly like a
beached whale - an ungainly creature that cannot be refloated. The political
waters in which it has moved for four decades are evaporating. The country's
politicians are distracted by scandal and, even if there was a will to keep
IRI alive, its finances are so parlous it is unlikely to survive in its
present form.
Group losses for last year were L4,809bn (Pounds 2.13bn), while accumulated
debts are L73,000bn, equal to almost 5 per cent of Italy's gross domestic
product. Privatisation of the empire, which employs 400,000 and has
interests ranging from baking to banking, telephones to television, is seen
by company strategists as the only way forward.
The impetus for change has been accelerated by the arrest last month of Mr
Franco Nobili, IRI's chairman since 1990 and the manager under whom debts
and losses mushroomed. His arrest, on corruption charges, provided the
government with an opportunity to bring in someone who would not shy away
from the basic question: does IRI need to exist in the 1990s?
The man chosen for the job is Mr Romano Prodi, the distinguished economist
who chaired IRI from 1982-89 until replaced by Mr Nobili. His previous
involvement in IRI may not seem the best qualification, since several
problems date from that period. But Mr Prodi's supporters, including Prime
Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, claim he is returning to push through the
rationalisation he was prevented from implementing by the politicians.
Power has been concentrated in the hands of Mr Prodi following the transfer
of Mr Michele Tedeschi, former chief executive, to IRI's telecommunications
subsidiary. He had been virtually running the group since last August, when
it was converted into a joint stock company.
A senior IRI official said: 'There is an urgent need to raise funds, and
privatisation will probably be along the lines Tedeschi has already worked
on.'
The main fear inside IRI's impressive 1930s head office in Rome is that the
financial urgency behind IRI's sell-off will mean that broader questions of
industrial development could be ignored in the reorganisation. IRI managers
insist the state still has a role, especially in sectors such as advanced
technology. They say IRI could be made slim and dynamic by selling scores of
companies and remaining as an investment vehicle with minority participation
in its engineering group Finmeccanica, and Stet, the telecommunications
holding company.
Yet this strategy could consign IRI to the same fate as that of Efim,
Italy's third-largest state industrial holding company, which became a
dustbin of unwanted businesses. Efim was wound up last July with debts of
more than L15,000bn, and the creditors' problems have yet to be resolved.
IRI could be left to nurse the loss-making companies which it could not
offload and which would be impossible to close for social or political
reasons.
The group's biggest loss-makers are Ilva, Europe's fourth-biggest steel
producer, and Iritecna, its construction arm. Between them, they account for
the bulk of IRI's 1992 losses. At Fincantieri (shipbuilding), Finmare
(shipping) and Alitalia (the airline), losses have been staunched, but all
remain in the red; while the finances of RAI, the television and radio
umbrella organisation, are severely stretched. IRI also owns two of Italy's
biggest banks. Although their profits are falling, they remain among the
group's biggest earners.
With domestic interest rates still high and the economy in recession, the
company is struggling to generate enough cash to meet daily needs, let alone
investments. IRI's financial difficulties were exacerbated by the
progressive withdrawal of funding since 1987 from the government, which was
striving to contain the large budget deficit.
More recently, support from the banks has declined because of concern about
IRI's financial health. Some foreign bankers, chastened by the debacle over
Efim, have cut lending, fearing a repetition. To make matters worse, an
Italian law prohibiting companies from issuing bonds when their debts exceed
their total capital, as in IRI's case, has removed recourse to the bond
market.
In the light of these constraints, piecemeal privatisation has become an
imperative, and has won the backing of the new government. The former Amato
government set the sell-off ball rolling last year, but there were internal
disagreements over an 'industrial strategy' for the state sector, with some
politicians fearing the loss of patronage implied by privatisation.
The Amato government had begun whittling away such patronage. IRI's board
was slimmed down to three members, while big subsidiaries, such as
Finmeccanica, gained in importance by obtaining an individual stock market
listing. The Ciampi government, with a more homgoneous economic team, is
less susceptible to pressure to keep IRI alive, particularly since the
country's political landscape has been transformed by the corruption
scandals, and the politicians who tried to stall the privatisation process
are discredited.
Despite the recession, which has limited the market for big sales, and the
wariness of some foreign multinationals to make Italian purchases, IRI is
slowly going on the block. The first sale will be SME, IRI's food
production, retailing and catering operation. Preliminary offers for two of
SME's food production divisions have been received and a deal is likely
within the next month. Together, the two operations should raise about
L1,200bn. The sale will be followed by that of SME's remaining food
retailing and catering activities, valued at about L2,000bn.
The other attractive assets up for sale are the two banks. IRI aims to sell
all or part of its 67 per cent holding in Credito Italiano, the
sixth-largest Italian bank, which is quoted on the stock market. Plans to
sell Banca Commerciale Italiano are less advanced.
Rather than floating its Credito shares on the market, IRI has opted for a
sale to another bank or a pool of institutions, in the hope of a higher
price. The most recent indications are, however, that no bank will pay the
L6,000bn estimated value. IRI has been forced to explore the possibility of
splitting its stake between several financial institutions and, as a result,
the deal is taking longer than expected.
While the banks deals are proceeding slowly, the financial pressures on IRI
are growing more urgent. Its Ilva steel arm has reported a L2,309bn loss for
last year and expects to lose about L1,700bn this year. Plans to restructure
it via asset sales and debt transfers to IRI have been critically received
by the European Commission, which supervises Europe's steel industry, and
the chances of a quick privatisation look slim.
Iritecna's financial difficulties are almost as pressing. A company will be
created, as with Ilva, to run the most profitable activities, while
loss-making subsidiaries and a large slice of debt will be transferred to
IRI pending restructuring or disposal.
With the timetable for sales lengthening, IRI has turned to sophisticated
money-raising techniques to pay its bills. So far, it has raised about
L1,000bn by selling future dividends on some of its profitable operations.
It has also sold tax credits on the shares of some subsidiaries. Although
such practices are commonplace in Italy, they have triggered a public row.
Critics charge IRI with using financial gimmicks to delay privatisation.
'They're pulling out all the stops to raise short-term cash wherever they
can, rather than just selling assets,' said one observer.
Mr Pietro Ciucci, IRI's finance director, points to last year's disposals of
controlling interests in the Cementir cement group and Banco di Roma as
proof that the company is not reluctant to sell. Like several other IRI
executives, he claims some of Italy's leading businessmen are waging a war
of words against the group because they are waiting to pick up bargains.
'Each time we devise an operation to help IRI survive, they get angry,' he
says.
Mr Ciucci and his colleagues stress the company is committed to disposals,
but not at the price of undervaluing its assets. The argument assumes IRI
has the luxury to choose the best moment for its sales. With the clock
ticking fast and losses mounting, time is not on its side.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Personal View: Where Mexico should draw the line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIDNEY WEINTRAUB and ROGELIO RAMIREZ DE LA O
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At US insistence, negotiations are now under way between Canada, Mexico, and
the US for side arrangements to the North American Free Trade Agreement on
environmental and labour issues, and to give extra protection to some
industries in the name of dealing with what are being called import surges.
President Clinton needs those parallel agreements to convince the Democratic
majority in Congress to support Nafta and to cater to some special
interests, such as the sugar lobby. The issue is no longer whether there
will be side agreements, but just how far the US will pressure its Nafta
partners - Mexico in particular  - to give way to satisfy domestic US
pressure.
Until now, Mexico has catered to almost every US demand. Mexico is even
going the extra mile. It has so far put more new money into clearing up the
environment at the US border than has the US. If there are import surges
that must be dealt with these days they are from the US into Mexico, but the
Mexican authorities have accepted these without raising new barriers.
Despite his misgivings about the wisdom of a special border tax on trade
among the Nafta countries to raise money to finance environmental projects,
Mexico's President Salinas may give way on this as well.
President Salinas is giving the impression that he is prepared to do almost
anything to get Nafta through. We believe he should do what is right in
Mexico's interest and he should show more spine when asked to agree to
unwise US demands or to cater to groups in the US, or people such as Ross
Perot, who will not support Nafta regardless of what Salinas does.
The Mexicans fear that if Nafta fails, investment into the country will dry
up. However, Mexico's best option is to proceed as if there were a Nafta. It
should continue to open its economy by reducing import barriers. The welcome
mat to foreign investment should not be withdrawn; if anything, it should be
extended beyond what was agreed in Nafta. The law protecting intellectual
property should not be erased. Many of the 50-plus pieces of new legislation
required to conform to Nafta provisions should proceed.
If Mexico further opens its economy, US businesses would still invest, based
on their having an assurance of policy continuation. The opponents of Nafta
could do nothing to stop this. By reducing its import duties further, Mexico
would permit producers there to continue their competitive drive. The
average US duty on imports from Mexico is now about 3 per cent. The
competitive position in the US market would not be much worse for most
products even if US tariffs did not decline to zero over 10 years, and could
even be stronger if the exchange rate of the peso were adjusted for this.
This would be a likely consequence of the market's reaction to the absence
of an agreement in any event. An adjustment of this kind would not
necessarily be a deterrent to foreign investment in Mexico, particularly for
equity investment, if properly enhanced by a consistent macroeconomic
package designed to control inflation.
The US would be just as exposed to competition from Mexico as it would be
under Nafta. The only way to prevent this would be to raise US import
barriers against Mexico. US protectionists would almost certainly try, and
the Clinton administration would then face a real test as to its trade bone
fides.
Those who insist that Mexican labour conditions are substandard in
comparison with the US would have no side agreement under which they could
leverage their demands. They would have to rely on Mexico's own perception
of its national interest in this area.
This is not an optimal outcome. Formalising the economic integration that is
occurring in any event has many advantages. It helps establish dozens of
consultative arrangements on specific issues such as customs administration,
sanitary standards, and technical requirements for products, and on broader
issues, including macroeconomic policies. Nafta gives some assurance against
backtracking on market opening by member countries. It provides a structure
for settlement of disputes on investment, financial and commercial matters,
and the use of countervailing and anti-dumping duties. Without Nafta the
remarkable political rapprochement that has been taking place in recent
years between Mexico and the US might be reversed. But US failure to approve
Nafta need not be an economic disaster for Mexico.
The authors are, respectively, director of the US-Mexico Policy Studies
Program at the Lyndon B Johnson School of Public Affairs, the University of
Texas at Austin, and president of Ecanal, an economic consulting firm in

FT  15 JUN 93 / Letter: Proper recognition still to be given to unemployment
problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, That unemployment will not yield all that much to 'active macroeconomic
policies' we've known for some time. Now, Edward Balls tells us ('A tide
that's not for turning', June 9) that the active labour market policies
Richard Layard was advocating in his Personal View (June 8), don't work
either, except as political tokenism designed to show the problem is being
taken seriously.
So what's left? 'Less generous unemployment benefits'? Yes, indeed, push the
welfare minimum down to America levels and you will force more people into
jobs - at the poverty-level wages which now characterise so much work in
America. Is that really what we want?
Surely we need to recognise that the unemployment problem is a result of the
new 'labour market scissors'. On one hand are the decent instincts which
have made a welfare floor of 40 per cent of average income pretty well
universal in European societies. On the other are those changes in society
and technology which have changed the job structure; more and more jobs are
beyond the learning capacity of people who did not do very well in school,
and fewer and fewer jobs are of the sort almost anybody can learn to do. The
exception are serving and caring jobs that are only slowly becoming
acceptable for able-bodied males.
And both of those factors are progressive factors. Don't we need to think
again about the nature of 'work' and how far doing it ought to be a
precondition for citizen dignity? The notion of a basic citizen income which
effectively cuts that link and makes extra-money-earning work as much a
voluntary activity for the lucky as amateur athletics, has been around for a
long time. Shouldn't the prospect that the unemployment problem will force
us into some such solution by 2020 start concentrating our minds on how to
get from here to there?
At present the only people thinking about this are the members of the
Citizens Income Study Centre and we are considered slightly dotty by our
academic colleagues. Isn't it time to take, if not us, at least the problem
more seriously, and for those who have a different perspective on the year
2020 to come clean and tell us what it is?

FT  15 JUN 93 / Letter: Solution to left-right dichotomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JAN CLIFFORD LESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan writes ('Clan hatreds divide Left from Right', June 7)
that 'the left-right dichotomy is a hopeless method of finding one's way
around' monetary and fiscal policy. But in his Left and Right: the Bogus
Dilemma and Capitalism and the Permissive Society he more or less solves the
problem without realising it.
As he shows, there is a fairly clear tendency for the left to be for state
regulation of 'the economy' (and against state regulation of personal
liberty) while the right are more likely to be the opposite. Where the
economic aspects are currently state-ridden the right are thus consistent in
seeking at least to second guess the market.
Of course, this is not a perfect description of left-right usage, and it
does conflict with some self-descriptions. But it clarifies debate
enormously to make this fairly realistic distinction stipulative. We are
then also able to introduce a libertarian-authoritarian north-south axis.
This accommodates both Samuel Brittan (as a north-winger) and me (extreme
north-winger). I leave the reader to say which politicians are really
south-wingers.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Post-perfect world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
The New Right is no longer triumphant. Its precepts are being challenged by
conservatives. Its doctrines are receding into the history of political
thought. Soon it will be regarded as the Old Wrong. The question of the turn
of the century is, what is to come next? One answer (not mine) could be a
mild, unambitious conservatism.
So runs the dream of the Menshevik, or non-Thatcherite, wing of Britain's
Conservative party, which hankers, whether it knows it or not, for a return
to a period of quiet, traditional conservative government, unruffled by the
assertive and divisive radicalism of the New Bolsheviks of the 1980s. The
present chancellor and putative next prime minister, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
implied as much last week when he described himself as standing at the 'hard
centre' of the Tory world; the actual prime minister, Mr John Major, would
not be harmed by a similar appellation.
Ever eager to help, I draw the attention of this centrist duo to a
forthcoming book* by John Gray, a conservative political philosopher and
fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. Mr Major may well find time in which to
read bits of it; Mr Clarke has first to digest the Maastricht treaty and one
or two other documents pertaining to his new job. Mr Gray is described by
his publisher as 'formerly a principal theorist of the New Right,' which
gives added piquancy to his extended critique of the work of the
'libertarian and classical liberal ideologues' whose nostrums continue to
haunt the Tory politicians of the 1990s.
He defines the New Right as properly anti-Marxist, understandably critical
of the failures of big government, questionably monetarist - and blind to
the imperfectibility of market institutions, which were 'understood as a
sort of perpetual motion machine for economic growth'. (Mr Gray, I am
delighted to report, is extremely unsound on growth.) 'It was this Whiggish
fantasy,' he writes, 'that animated the enthusiasts of the New Right; the
failure of its political projects, or the unanticipated consequences of
their success, has rudely dispelled it.' Among the failures, I would list
1980s macro-economic policy on both sides of the Atlantic and, in Britain,
the Tory health and education reforms.
Our author has an explanation for this headlong rush into doctrinal
disappointment. The ideologues behind Thatcherism and Reaganism, like the
Marxists they vanquished, mistakenly believed in the perfectibility of human
endeavour through the application of universal principles. One side-effect
was to introduce a sectarian spirit into conservative discourse. That, as we
know, is still present. So is the worship of the market as an institution
without flaw, not to mention the conception of all human conduct 'in terms
of a calculus of exchange'. This attitude denies the dependency of civil
society on the resources of its culture; it runs contrary to the
common-sense observation that human beings exist as part of families, or
communities. You could say, after reading Mr Gray, that the New Right was
mistaken in its assumption that there is no such thing as society.
'The lesson of the bankruptcy of the New Right,' he writes, '. . . is that
political life is not a project of world improvement in which are invested
the transcendental hopes of an age without faith. It is instead an almost
desperately humble task of endless improvisation, in which . . . the ever
present prospect of disaster is staved off. . .'
I have quoted extensively from this thought-provoking introduction because
the first three chapters of the book have appeared before, as self-critical
pamphlets published by New Right think-tanks. As noted at the time, Mr
Gray's view, as asserted in one of those pamphlets, is that 'a humane social
market economy is the only sort of free economy likely to survive . . . and
the only sort that deserves to survive'. If there is such a thing as
Majorism, these recycled chapters contain it. Traditional one-nation Tories,
and continental Christian Democrats, will grasp the point, even as they trim
spending on the welfare state.
The prime minister should, however, run a mile from the brand-new fourth and
final chapter. It takes the argument too close to the truth of the present
human condition. Entitled 'an agenda for Green conservatism', it soars
beyond the immediate needs of Mr Major and Mr Clarke. The problem is not Mr
Gray's adoption of a green mantle; Lady Thatcher herself did that. Anyhow,
he neatly disposes of the excesses of green theories. His arguments, that
private property and market mechanisms are essential tools for protecting
most of the environment, should appeal to Tories, even while greenery is
relatively unfashionable. He does see regulation as necessary to deal with
threats to the global commons, like the upper atmosphere, and he is
Malthusian about the population explosion. But some Conservatives might
swallow this medicine too, even if they have to swallow hard.
They will, however, gag on this: 'Though the eradication of involuntary
poverty remains a noble cause, the project of promoting maximal economic
growth is, perhaps, the most vulgar ideal ever put before suffering
humankind. The myth of open-ended progress is not an ennobling myth, and it
should form no part of conservative philosophy.' He goes on to deride the
'malady of infinite aspiration', and asks rather that we 'keep in good
repair those institutions and practices whereby human beings come to be
reconciled with their circumstances . . .' He offers as an alternative J S
Mill's conception of a 'stationary-state economy'.
I love it. Here is a Tory philosopher telling us what we know to be true -
that economic expansion allied to exponential population growth cannot
continue forever, and that we had better start thinking about the ethical
consequences of that stark arithmetic. I picked up Mr Gray's book after
returning from a seminar on the moral foundations of a democratic society,
organised by the Social Market Foundation, a newish think-tank. The seminar
affirmed the current absence of moral underpinnings for western thought.
Something has to replace Marx-based philosophies, and perhaps reinvent
Christianity. Mr Gray's fourth chapter suggests where to start.

course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, What a shame] Why has the UK government wasted a golden opportunity to
lead Europe forward to a better future? Why do we continue to portray our
exit from the exchange rate mechanism as a 'humiliation'?
Even the ex-chancellor can only whinge and criticise instead of standing up,
as he should have done last September, and proclaiming that the British move
was the only rational economic policy to follow when Europe was marching
from the hoped-for policies of disinflation over the cliff edge into
depression. Britain's exit should have been portrayed as a move
demonstrating strength and vision which the rest of Europe (Germany
excepted) needed to follow.
There is nothing wrong with allowing currency devaluation if it is the only
means by which interest rates can fall to a level more compatible with
economic stability. The UK has not abandoned stability policy by easing on
the monetary side when a tightening of fiscal policy and a global
disinflationary environment have so diluted the inflationary risks. On the
contrary, the UK is pursuing the only obvious course for most European
economies to follow at this juncture.
The only problem has been the manner in which policies were implemented; the
moves themselves are so sensible. What a shame we are not able to be proud
of them. At least we can take comfort that the UK will fare better by having
pursued the right policies in the wrong way rather than the wrong policies
altogether. Poor Europe]

FT  15 JUN 93 / Japan's best face forward: The hosts of the G7 summit in
Tokyo could emerge as the winners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In their heart of hearts, the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial
countries must be wishing that next month's Tokyo economic summit was not
taking place.
The US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - as well as
Russia and the European Commission, which have supporting roles at the
meeting - will be sending politicians of much-diminished stature to Tokyo's
Akasaka palace between July 7 and 9.
The euphoria that accompanied the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of
communism - which infused the three previous G7 summits in Houston, London
and Munich - has long gone. Instead of providing a rich harvest of support,
the triumph of democracy and the market economy after more than 40 years of
cold war has left the seven government heads deeply unpopular.
The reasons are not difficult to discern. The industrialised economies are
either in recession or, at best, fitful recoveries that will do little to
foster the 'feel-good factor' among disgruntled voters.
Unemployment, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, is heading upwards towards 36m in its 24 industrialised member
states and is likely to keep rising in most countries over the next 18
months.
The geo-political outlook, is, if anything, worse. The brutal civil war in
Bosnia has all but buried hopes of a 'new world order' to follow the
collapse of Soviet power. The latest crisis in Somalia casts serious doubts
on the ability of the United Nations to grow into the role of a
supranational referee bringing order to regional conflict.
Problems at home have made G7 governments and electorates increasingly
inward-looking. In today's parochial times, G7 leaders could lose as much as
gain from being seen with their counterparts at yet another international
meeting.
Governments like to think that G7 summits can increase consumer and business
confidence. But it is difficult to believe that three days of strutting,
eating and talking in Japan's mini-Versailles will gull the west's
increasingly cynical television viewers into believing that happy days are
here again.
However, it is possible to take a more optimistic view of the summit - both
for the world and for the host nation, Japan.
The hope, propagated by the US and encouraged by this month's OECD annual
ministerial meeting in Paris, is that Tokyo will mark a vital step towards
final agreement on the much-delayed Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation
talks.
Trade ministers from the US, Japan, Canada and the European Community are
negotiating an extensive tariff-cutting agreement for industrial products
and services to form part of a final Uruguay Round settlement. If their next
round of talks in Tokyo on June 23 and 24 produces an agreement that can be
finalised and endorsed by the G7 leaders, the summit may give a decisive
boost to the seven-year-old Round and so have helped solve the trade talks
impasse.
But the so-called market access agreement is only one of many problems to be
solved if the trade round is to be completed by the new deadline of
mid-December. The US and Japan are at loggerheads over US demands that Japan
accept numerical targets to reduce its huge trade surplus. A fight is also
brewing between Japan and the EC over limits to the sales of Japanese cars
in the community. Big difficulties have to be overcome within the EC and
among the G7 before agreement is reached on agriculture and other open
issues in the trade round.
Mr Koichiro Matsuura, the Japanese government 'sherpa' responsible for
preparing the economic side of the summit for Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
Japanese prime minister, last week put a slight damper on hopes that the
Uruguay Round might be settled this year. 'I cannot be totally optimistic,'
he told visiting journalists in Tokyo.
Other big problems offer little chance of a summit 'success'. Although Mr
Miyazawa has said that helping the former Soviet Union become a democracy
with a market economy 'is going to be the most important issue', it is
difficult to see the G7 doing much more. A strategy for helping Russia was
agreed in April. It is now up to President Boris Yeltsin, who will join the
talks on the final day, to implement agreed plans so that Russia can qualify
for promised western financial assistance.
Despite US pressure, there is little chance of action by Japan or Germany to
boost the world economy. Japan insists that it has done enough to boost
demand through two fiscal stimulus packages in the past 10 months. Fears for
the D-Mark's stability are limiting the Bundesbank's appetite for decisive
interest rate cuts in spite of recession in Germany.
While there will be much serious talk about regional conflicts, the
non-proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, and a
greater role for the United Nations, it is unclear whether initiatives will
emerge in these areas.
Little wonder, therefore, that the Japanese government has begun the
time-honoured pre-summit ritual of downgrading expectations. 'Don't expect
much out of a three-day meeting,' warns Mr Matsuura. Mr Kunihiko Saito, the
deputy foreign minister preparing the non-economic side of the summit, says
he does not 'think we can expect any tangible specific results'.
But that, for Japan, might be the best of all possible outcomes. This summit
 -the third in Tokyo since the late 1970s - could break the rule by which
Japan, as host, emerges as the loser.
In the past, Japan's G7 partners have been able to capitalise on the
reluctance of governments in Tokyo to have international rows occurring on
home territory. This year, the hosts seem in a feistier mood.
Japan has already taken the high moral ground on trade, rejecting the US
goal of setting bilateral numerical targets for deficit reduction as
'managed trade'. Japan also has offered widespread tariff reductions to help
bring about a market access agreement.
Although Japan itself is likely to emerge only gradually from its current
period of very slow growth, its economic performance this year is likely to
be better than nearly all its G7 partners. It can also present itself as
sole representative at the summit of east Asia, a region that is growing
faster and, in Tokyo's view, is politically more stable than other parts of
the world.
Tokyo is likely to step carefully in pressing claims such as Japan's desire
for a permanent seat on the UN security council. But officials are unusually
forthright when putting their case. 'We think Japan is qualified to be a
member of the security council,' was Mr Saito's comment last week.
Although Japan has stressed that the summit will not be a decision-making
event, it will nonetheless be an important event in the Japanese calendar.
Out of the mess of the post-cold war world, Japan may emerge with its
standing raised rather than lowered.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Letter: Common IT standards are needed in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GORDON EWAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article about the National Audit Office report into computer
systems for the Training and Enterprise Councils ('Scrapping Tecs computer
system may cost Pounds 50m', June 11) once more points to the importance of
nationally recognised - and implemented - standards for the information
technology community.
Only when we in the UK are all working to the same set of standards will we
be able to avoid the problems of 'them and us' when matching client needs
with the systems which are actually installed.
As the lead body for information technology standards in the UK, we have
been working for the past two years with all members of the IT community to
ensure that there is a clear set of practical guidelines for everyone
involved in information technology.
One of the ways of ensuring this happens is through the programme of
National Vocational Qualifications in information technology. This is a set
of standards which all companies and organisations and their staff and
employees can use to build better skills and greater mutual understanding.
With Britain needing to become more skilled, productive and cost-effective
in its working methods, adopting the best practices woven into our set of IT
standards surely makes a lot of sense and helps avoid expensive and
time-consuming problems.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CAROLE TONGUE MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Japan car workers top of earnings league in world motor
industry' (June 10), paints a rosy picture of the Japanese car worker's
condition. It ignores, though, the now oft-documented stress and ill health
their long working hours produce.
Without actually saying so, the article hints that Europe's social
provisions (particularly good wages and moderate working hours), should be
sacrificed in the name of increased competitiveness. This attitude is
increasingly souring relations with Britain's European neighbours, who
rightly feel social justice and economic prosperity go hand in hand and
resent the attempt of the UK government to create a competitive labour
market on the basis of low wages and poor working conditions.
There should be no suggestion that Europeans should go back on their social
achievements. We should be calling for our main competitors to adopt similar
policies to improve the living and working conditions of their working
people, particularly shorter worker hours to achieve an enhanced quality of
life and increased employment opportunities.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Arts: Springboards Festival - 'Syme' / Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Theatre's Springboards Festival of new work in Leicester,
Liverpool, London and Salisbury continues at the Birmingham Rep Studio with
Syme, a curious, quirky play about dissent in the police force.
Inspector John Syme (1875-1945) joined the Metropolitan Police in 1894, was
suspended in 1909 and dismissed in 1910 over an incident which set his own
liberal practice against the dictates of discipline and duty within the
establishment. Syme saw the police force as a civil organisation, and his
dismissal as a worrying gain for officialdom. He wrote in 1925: 'in the
future . . . no Civil Servant will be safe if, in the performance of his or
her duty to the Community, he or she expresses an opinion contrary to some
one in authority over them.' That is the issue.
Between 1910 and 1931, Syme conducted a blazing public relations campaign
for his innocence. It included 10,000 pamphlets to opinion-formers, and a
deluge of fruit and veg pelted at the Home Office, rather like a hustings
scene from Smollett. Syme was imprisoned 27 times on various grounds,
including lunacy. On each occasion he staged a hunger strike, as if the
sentence were little more than a spell at Champneys. In 1931 he was
retroactively pardoned and reinstated. During this time, this apparently
inveterate convict founded the National Union of Police and Prison Officers.
This makes engaging if not dramatic theatre, well directed by Anthony Clark,
who gets versatile performances from all seven cast. Claude Close as
Churchill, Peter Macqueen as Syme and Maria Gough as his tireless wife are
particularly attuned to the times. The fine encounter between Syme and Home
Secretary Churchill, standing at the top end of a sloping desk, manages a
visual metaphor for social and political power. Elsewhere, the barge-footed
policemen are just jolly coppers on parade: 'Rules is rules, Inspector Syme,
and the law is the law.'
The play's 31 scenes march briskly forward to music hall and military bands.
The tunes are so like de Souza's Liberty Bell and the designs (Ruari
Muchison) so redolent of Terry Gillam, that the show has an air of Monty
Python.
In fact, Syme (written by Michael Bourdages) is in praise of wronged
eccentricity. Syme's sad history proves that the English love to revert to
rules. And where traditions or customs are the rule of conduct rather than
individual character, both individual happiness and social progress are
jeopardised.

a script.
Sister Sarah (Lisa Bowerman), normality incarnate, is getting married.
Sister Kate (Anna-Juliana Clare), gay, sensible, and very much the heroine,
advises caution. Sister Rachel (Rosamund Shelley), whose problems provide
full employment for a stream of social workers, plans to use the ceremony
for an act of domestic revenge. Mother Sylvia (Pauline Monro) buries herself
in shopping and sherry. Will the ceremony draw the family together, or
provide the catalyst for radical re-appraisal?
There is something about music theatre which shrinks characters to a single
dimension. It is as if you cannot sing and develop a role at the same time.
But the gain is that however simple - not to say banal - the plot, the music
can raise the experience. Jones and Wills are not over-ambitious but they
have developed an attractive formula, which is neither opera, nor pop, nor
Andrew Lloyd Webber. The songs are simple, but sometimes have a haunting
innocence, sometimes a haunting power, and propel a broken backed story
line.
Despite yourself you get drawn into this unlikely family, with more
skeletons in its cupboard than the Black Museum. Of course, with the
predictable child abuse, infidelity, and lies, the institution of marriage
has acquired responsibility for all the evils of our generation. Wedlock
recklessly perpetuates the myth.
Yet it delivers the message with passion. Su Bentinck's set at the Battersea
Arts Centre, in which cupboards replace doors, is worrying rather than
useful, but the piece spins the imagination, thanks to the music. Warren
Mills mans the piano; Anthony Cornish directs.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Arts: Freddie Hubbard - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jazz trumpet players can be a surly lot, full of brooding bravado, often
unpredictable on the stand and sometimes leading colourful lives off it.
Think of Miles Davis, back to the audience, hunched over his horn for a few
precious notes before abruptly leaving; Lee Morgan, the great attacking
trumpet of hard bop shot dead onstage by a jealous lover. Last time I saw
mainstreamer Ruby Braff he was inciting a usually mild mannered Brecon crowd
to riot by the simple device of continuously telling them to shut up.
So it is with American Freddie Hubbard, currently and grumpily touring his
talented acoustic quintet across Europe. Last week, in the New Morning, a
grotty but friendly club by the Boulevard St Michel, I sat through one and a
half hours of slow hand claps until the gangsterish Hubbard sauntered
through the front door rubbing his belly. In Paris, the wait was hardly
worth the four hard bop standards Hubbard dispatched before complaining of a
bust lip: in retrospect, the time might better have been spent listening to
the quartet of promising young tenorist Javon Jackson, pianist Ron Mathews,
and a cracking rhythm section of Louis Hayes on drums and young bassist Jeff
Chambers.
But it was easier to forgive him the (over 90 minutes) wait in London - at
least we had two sets. And once he had grown accustomed to the reverberating
acoustics of the Union Chapel, Hubbard did at last stretch out on the
fluegelhorn. Grappling with the echo chamber effect and faulty equipment in
Islington Hubbard flew through 'Straight No Chaser' brassy and bright,
following up with a sparky rhumba, 'Bolivia', the leader pacing nervously,
trilling occasionally. A tough and boppy 'One of A Kind' provided Hayes with
his third driving solo of the evening and Jackson an opportunity to
construct a measured and gentle passage without his leader's interruption -
he had disappeared backstage.
By the second set, Hubbard gave up his unequal struggle with equipment and
imprecise acoustics and standing away from his microphone turned in a
flaring ballad, 'God Bless The Child', the burnished tone of the fluegelhorn
pitched beautifully into the high ceiling. Absorbed in his playing at last,
the full warm sound centred in a good tune, Hubbard showed how he maintains
a place at the top of the trumpet league. By finishing the set on 'Ease It',
however, which featured Chambers' bass while Hubbard again left for
backstage, he demonstrated his weakness as a leader and how precarious that
ranking is. Worth the wait, but only just.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Arts: Benvenuto Cellini - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never more than a semi-success during Berlioz's lifetime, on Sunday in the
Queen Elizabeth Hall his 1838 opera semi-seria proved to be a marvellous
tonic - as Chelsea Opera Group concert-performances regularly are. The
Group's knack for choosing exactly the operas that will reward current
revival, and bestowing historical care and dramatic flair upon them in equal
measure, makes their concerts indispensable fixtures in the London season.
Their Cellini was rewarding even beyond their excellent norm. It says a lot
for a performance three-and-a-quarter-hours long in concert dress without
any pretence at staging, that it not only held the delighted attention of a
full house but actually went from strength to strength. The COG has given
the opera before, but only in the compromised 'final' version that Berlioz
accepted for Liszt's Weimar performances in the 1850s. This time they
borrowed the fine Royal Opera recension, which restores most of the original
Paris score but sensibly trims the spoken dialogue and the later
recitatives.
From the Overture forward the conductor Adrian Brown's just tempi and
energetic confidence were relishable, whilst his four-square rhythms and his
disregard for the characteristic bated-breath pianissimi were a touch
disappointing. Something of Berlioz's volatile magic was lost. Yet in the
end, energy won through: unhampered by the weight of a stage production, the
score cantered along at a lively, natural pace, with satisfying variety and
not a single longueur. The COG chorus was good as ever, if run slightly
ragged in the quickest music.
The nine soloists, however, made a team of real distinction - boasting a
level of French diction unheard-of hereabouts even ten years ago. In lesser
roles, Michael Hart-Davis whined nasally but musically as the fretful
Innkeeper, and Lynton Atkinson and Martin Higgins brought alert character
and cutting edge to Cellini's chief assistants. For his patron Pope Clement
VII Brian Bannatyne-Scott's rich, ruminative bass served admirably.
Dour and funny, Jeremy White was no less stylish as the Papal treasurer
Balducci, Cellini's unwilling father-in-law-to-be. As the son-in-law he
would have preferred, Geoffrey Dolton's clever, idiomatic Fieramosca rose to
heroic defiance in his Act 2 aria. As Cellini's apprentice Ascanio the young
mezzo Margaret McDonald cut an irresistible figure in breeches, displayed a
remarkable vocal range and made a huge, unabashed success of her Act 2
party-piece - Offenbach before his time.
Not long ago, Teresa Cahill sang a lovely Daphne for the COG in Strauss's
opera. As Balducci's daughter Teresa here she made an unlikely 17-year-old,
with a mature soprano's sumptuously spreading tone where her inamorato
sported a youthful, tightly focused tenor; but her ripe musical thrust
carried all before it, full of generous, subtle feeling in a role that makes
relentless vocal demands. A couple of dodgy top-notes made no difference at
all.
Meanwhile her Cellini, Justin Lavender, fulfilled his promise of recent
years with springing elan. He has made a speciality of those 19th-century
French roles which prescribe a cruelly high tessitura for modern tenors,
from whom a lusty, full-throated attack is now expected where their period
predecessors probably got away with mere head-voice. In earlier Lavender
performances the strain has occasionally showed, even while he shaped a
vigorously elegant line. This time, as the challenges rose he not only met
them with ringing assurance, but left himself room still for wry asides in
roguish character. Berlioz would surely have been delighted.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Arts: Saved, but only by its Bacon - William Packer finds
the Venice Biennale an ill-assorted mess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This, the 45th Venice Biennale, actually moved on an extra year this time to
get onto the odd numbers in readiness for its centenary in 1995, is larger
than ever, not only in its various manifestations at sites across the city
and out into the lagoon, but also in the scope of its critical ambition.
That is not to say it is any the better: indeed, it is overall an
ill-assorted, uncritical and self-indulgent mess.
In the days when the Biennale was more or less confined to its principal
site in the public gardens of the Castello in a huge central pavilion
surrounded by its satellite national pavilions beneath the trees, there was
always the chance at least of a certain concentration of attention, if only
for the sake of a reasonable comparative discrimination between the
particular contributions. Even the bringing of Aperto, the selective
international survey of younger artists' work, closer to hand at the
Corderie might once have been seen in this respect as the bringing of an
unruly offspring somewhat to heel.
But Aperto is irredeemably delinquent and unbiddable, devoid of talent or
interest, merely thrashing around in the playpen of late 20th-century
academic modernism, without even the possibility of some personal
development that the average playschool would offer up in modest
justification. And increasingly the Aperto seems to set the tone of
successive Biennales, the tail that wags the dog.
Achille Bonito Oliva, the new director of the Biennale, gives us 'the
cardinal points of art' as his curatorial theme, setting out 'to document
the transition within contemporary art from the concept of nomadism to that
of the journey, wherein art's search for orientation in this epoch of
epistemological crisis is conducted within its own points of reference'.
Well, we see what he means. Do your own thing and anything will do.
Installation is the universal convention, and if you have a video screen to
perk it up a bit, so much the better.
In any such jamboree, of course, there are bound to be beautiful and
interesting things and I shall return to the matter and substance of the
Biennale at the weekend. But of all the several features of the Biennale as
it has developed over recent years, one seems more and more to be positive,
useful and redeeming. The Omaggio, a tribute paid by the Biennale to a
senior and distinguished artist, is given this time to Francis Bacon, who
died a little over a year ago. David Sylvester, who himself has been given a
Golden Lion at this Biennale for his life's work as a critic and curator - a
unique award in that he is not an artist - was asked to select the work, and
worked with the British Council on its presentation.
Thank goodness for small mercies. The result is quite simply the outstanding
exhibition of this Biennale, as indeed it would have been at a Biennale far
better than this. It is by no means large, a mere 32 works in all, but it
carries an enormous punch. For Sylvester managed to obtain the greater part
of his desired selection and has included a significant number of the large
triptychs. It is beautifully presented in the Museo Correr, in the Piazza
San Marco, quite rightly centre stage. As a celebration of the achievements
of a particular artist it holds its own not just in the context of the
Biennale but in this, the city of the greatest painting.
More to the point, it is a show that effectively modifies, or rather shifts
one's view of Bacon and his work. I had always felt that his standing as one
of the truly great painters of the later 20th century rested upon his work
of the first 20 years or so of his career, from the first small triptych of
1944, of figures at the base of a crucifixion, to the first Tate
retrospective of 1964, of which Sylvester again was the curator. What
followed was impressive and consistent enough to sustain his reputation, but
did not exactly take it further. It was as though the range of his attention
had narrowed - no more animals, popes, Van Goghs - the colour become more
predictable, even decorative, the space curiously conventional and
repetitive, the handling and description of his distorted and rising figures
oddly safe and unadventurous. In short, the work had become formulaic to a
certain degree.
This show has made me think again, not so much to revise that view
altogether but at least to recognise that in certain aspects of the later
work the qualities of those first two great decades, the simple dark
strength of the organisation of the pictorial space, and in particular its
severe and essentially frontal presentation remained. And there are still to
be found the simple authority of the imagery, and the raw energy of the
painted self in its handling across the surface of the canvas. 'Much has
changed', as it were, 'but much remains', the work still charged and
developing under the hand of manifestly the same creative sensibility.
However, nothing has changed the extraordinary authority or the power to
shock of those early works, represented here in remarkable force by a clutch
 -I use the word advisedly - of gaping, disembodied mouths, teeth bared and
rearing all but physically out of the very stuff of the paint itself. There
has surely been no painting since Soutine in which the image and the fabric
of the work are so bound in to each other - Van Gogh, Goya, Rembrandt,
Titian: it is a long and great tradition.
Bacon did not declare himself as a great artist until he was 35. He was in
his pomp thereafter for nearly 50 years more, and was 83 when he died. He
stood supreme in our time, yet curiously isolated as the last true
surrealist, expressionist and, in his own peculiar way, romantic. There
could be no better summary of his achievements than this exhibition.

FT  15 JUN 93 / People: At 40 to Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rejuvenation of Forte, Britain's largest hotel and restaurants group,
continues with the hiring of United Distillers' Keith Hamill as chief
financial officer and finance director designate.
Last month, Lord Forte handed the helm to his son, Rocco Forte, and a
handful of other directors, with over 200 years of service to the company
between them, also stood down from the board. At the same time, the company
has also been actively recruiting at just below board level over the last
year or so. 'It is a much more forward-looking group than it was a year or
eighteen months ago,' comments Peter Hilliar, an analyst at BZW.
Forte has arranged for a considerable handover period, as the current
finance director, Donald Main, who has been in the job since 1981, does not
retire until the end of 1994 when he turns 60. Main says he expects Hamill,
40, to move onto the board as finance director at the beginning of next
year, leaving him with time to devote to other areas, notably disposals.
Meanwhile, colleagues at United Distillers express no surprise that Hamill
is off after Philip Yea, the 37-year-old director of Guinness Brewing
Worldwide, was appointed Guinness group finance director designate in a
reorganisation initiated as Tony Greener took over as Guinness' chairman at
the turn of the year.
Hamill was previously a partner of Price Waterhouse, engaged on the Guinness
audit at the time of the scandal, joining the company full-time eighteen
months after Ernest Saunders resigned. Analysts agreed that in addition
accountancy skills, he had already demonstrated considerable commercial
savvy of importance for his new role at Forte.
Of his workaholic reputation among Distillers colleagues Hamill says: 'Now I
have turned 40, I have set myself objectives of being less of a workaholic.'
He points out that he is keen to keep a variety of outside interests - he is
chairman of the CBI financial reporting panel, a member of the urgent issues
task force of the Accounting Standards Board (where Main is a member of the
board), and is very active for his almer mater, Nottingham University.
Main also sits on the board of the Savoy, the luxury hotel group with which
Forte has clashed frequently in its takeover attempts but of which it owns
42 per cent. But he was non-committal as to whether he would be stepping
down from that job in favour of Hamill. 'It's so far away I can't really
say' was Main's comment yesterday.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Technology: Tape hits the cutting floor / A look at
development in the newsroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broadcasting from tape could soon be a thing of the past as television
stations make increasing use of computers and special software to replace
traditional tape technology.
New tapeless editing equipment, developed with the help of the British
Broadcasting Corporation and Cable News Network of the US, is being launched
at this week's bi-annual TV equipment show in Montreux, Switzerland.
Called the 'NewsCutter', and produced by Avid Technology, it is a full
news-style edit suite of tape machines and monitors on an Apple computer
which is capable of broadcasting directly to air. Both the BBC and
Independent Television News, its UK rival, are evaluating the product and
Avid hopes other European broadcasters will show a strong interest.
Avid's equipment works through the compression of digital pictures, with
data squeezed into ever smaller spaces on hard disc. It then uses other
software to allow editors to call up pictures instantly from disc.
Based in the US, Avid is prominent in the tapeless editing market. It will
shortly open a European service and distribution centre outside Dublin.
Avid's move into broadcast news has been helped by a partnership with
Silicon Graphics of the US to provide equipment which allows video to be
swapped between different machines in the newsroom.
The process of editing video on disc is called 'non-linear' because it is
not done in a line, as with normal editing on tape. It is akin to moving
paragraphs within a document on a word processor.
Avid is one of several companies selling into this growing market. But
unlike competitors such as Lightworks and Eidos, both of the UK, which have
tended to stay with commercials and broadcast programming, Avid is involved
with both news and feature film production.
Stephen Crummey, vice-president of world sales and marketing, says there are
more than 1,500 Avid machines installed worldwide, 100 in Hollywood alone.
Avid adapted its Film Composer for film use from the Media Composer, which
was designed for Pal or NTSC television standards. Based on a powerful Apple
Quadra 950 computer, Film Composer transfers images from tape or film on to
hard disc, a process called 'digitising'.
Shots are labelled using the keyboard and then read by the computer as
reference numbers, usually based on the time-codes recorded during shooting.
Shots can then be laid out in the edited order to run as a sequence.
To change the sequence, the film editor simply re-orders the sequence in
which the shots are to appear. Once a shot is moved, it can be viewed
instantly in its new position. When the edit is agreed, the list of edit
numbers is taken on a floppy disc and the originally shot material is then
reassembled in the new editing order.
The Media Composer has 24 channels of compact disc quality sound which can
be dubbed and mixed while the pictures are being edited. The completed sound
track is then added to the edited pictures. The BBC's political programme,
On the Record, has been working this way for more than a year.
But the big breakthrough for the industry is the ability to obtain
broadcast-quality pictures directly from hard disc. This results from
developments in video compression and disc speed. One second of
broadcast-quality television represents 25 megabytes of data. This is
compressed nearly tenfold to about three megabytes. Taped pictures which
have been digitised can be held on removable hard drives of about 20
minutes' airtime.
One impact of the technology will come in the area of cost. Avid's
NewsCutter, costing Dollars 50,000 in the US, is half the price of an
equivalent edit suite. Also, the new equipment needs no special installation
such as wiring and air conditioning. The BBC has already stopped using
several edit suites since it first introduced non-linear editing.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Technology: Reinventing the media - Computers, telecoms and
publishing are converging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every morning, in common with millions of other people around the world,
researcher Walter Bender reads his daily newspaper over breakfast. But the
publication, nicknamed Bender's Bugle, is far from the usual daily read.
It really is his very own newspaper, delivered to his personal computer and
reflecting his tastes and interests. The tailor-made publication is
assembled overnight from the near-limitless choice of words available in
electronic form from the news agency databases of Associated Press, Reuters
and Dow Jones.
Bender is interested in cycling, so the computers pick out cycling articles
and put them on his front page alongside news of world events. Bender is a
researcher at the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and one of a group which has launched a far-reaching programme of
research on news in the future.
Underlying 14 projects - ranging from computers that can 'understand' and
select the news, to the use of news as a tool for learning - are two
propositions: that the era of mass media is giving way to the era of
personal choice; and that all media, whether television, radio or print, are
being driven together by digital technology and turned into the equivalent
of bits of computer information.
All media organisations, according to Nicholas Negroponte, director of the
Media Laboratory, are now in 'the bit radiation business'. Work is already
under way on the practicalities of delivering personalised newspapers in the
form most people would like them - words printed with ink on paper and laid
out in a form resembling a conventional newspaper.
The Media Laboratory is trying to develop reusable paper so that newspapers
can be printed in the home in large format. 'You want 15 magical pieces of
natural paper and when you've finished today's paper you stick it back in
the machine and it erases today's paper and prints tomorrow's.
'There's going to be a huge uproar over the next four or five years about
dead trees. And printing in the home is not necessarily going to be more
expensive than current delivery systems,' he claims.
He first proposed founding the Media Laboratory in 1978 in the belief that
the worlds of computing, publishing and broadcasting would converge. By the
time Dollars 50m (Pounds 32m) had been raised to start the venture in 1985,
many of the things he had predicted were already beginning to happen, in
particular the widespread use of personal computers. Making PCs easier to
use and improving both the design and clarity of the words that appear on
computer screens has also been one of the underlying themes of the Media
Laboratory's work.
Funded 80 per cent by industry and 20 per cent by the US government, the
Media Laboratory has 75 sponsoring companies, including the largest names
from the world of media, computers and telecommunications. They include
Knight-Ridder and Reuters, Apple and IBM, BT and Deutsche Bundespost.
Many of the dozens of ideas under investigation at the laboratory's elegant
headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts involve the admittedly futuristic.
One long-term project involves holographic video. Already, researchers using
large-scale computing power can project and manipulate the holographic image
of a car. Within five years or so the technology could be used in medicine
to display images of the human body.
Other work is more immediate. Media Laboratory researchers contributed some
of the sophisticated code which controls the movement of the dinosaurs in
the compact disc game being released with Jurassic Park, the new Steven
Spielberg film.
Researchers were dismissed as 'nuts' when they proposed putting computing
power into childrens' bricks. Now this is the basic of a successful
programmable toy.
The laboratory's researchers also claim a contribution to the development of
PS/2, IBM's top-of-the-range PC. 'I can open a PS/2 and point to circuits
that came out of the Media Laboratory,' says Negroponte.
Even though not all the ideas generated by the Media Laboratory will find
their way into products, many heavyweight industrial backers are happy to
pay their share of the Dollars 12m-a-year running costs, just in case. As
sponsors, they have access to the venture's work.
There are few serious media organisations which are not watching closely the
convergence of computers, telecommunications and broadcasting in a new
digital world and trying to work out the implications for their businesses.
According to Negroponte, every computer company at the higher end of the
market is now involved in multi-media, while television manufacturers are
also putting more computing power into their products.
But in the broadcasting equipment market, he believes the computer companies
will emerge victorious over traditional manufacturers. 'In five years' time,
you will go to broadcast studios and see logos that say IBM and Digital
Equipment; you won't see Ampex or Grass Valley. They don't bring anything to
the market any more. You are not doing video any more, you are doing general
signal processing,' says Negroponte.
He predicts that hundreds of new television channels and the ability to
squirt film down telephone lines will create a video-on-demand business
worth Dollars 20bn a year in the US alone. Forecasting is not, however, the
way Negroponte describes what the Media Laboratory does. 'The best way to
predict the future is to invent it. We are not forecasting. We build working
prototypes. The 300 people here are inventors.'
This includes the Media Laboratory researcher who, Negroponte says, has just
discovered how to put 5,000 hours of piano music on a single compact disc.
Negroponte has told the researcher he will probably have to live the rest of
his life with Fatwa-threatened author Salman Rushdie if the music industry
finds out.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Technology: Keeping tabs on thieves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every time you buy an electric drill or a pair of shoes, part of the price
covers 'shrinkage', that retailing euphemism for theft. One problem for
retailers is that about 35 per cent of thefts (total thefts cost between
Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 3.5bn a year in the UK) are carried out by their own
employees.
Eliminating employee pilfering is one advantage of a system being developed
in the UK which has united retailers, equipment manufacturers and packaging
companies under the auspices of the Centre for Exploitation of Science and
Technology. The project's purpose is to develop a way of tagging items
during the manufacturing process, in such a way that would-be thieves cannot
distinguish whether an item is tagged or not.
Source tagging would also eliminate the time-consuming task of attaching
electronic article surveillance (EAS) tags once the goods reach the stores;
one type of tag could be used to protect everything from tea bags to CDs.
Cest's Martin Swerdlow says that the present worldwide market for EAS
equipment is worth Dollars 350m-Dollars 500m (Pounds 227m-Pounds 325m) a
year. He predicts, however, that if source tagging takes off the market will
grow to Dollars 10bn-Dollars 20bn within five years.
Cest has already produced a 'road map' for the development of source tagging
and the first element, the 20-micron wide sliver of magnetic tape which will
be incorporated in products, is available at less than 1p per item. The task
now, says Swerdlow, is to look at the best way of insetting the tape into
plastic, cardboard, paper and even metal.
Once the tag is in place, it can be activated by orientating the magnetic
strip to emit a signal. This is picked up by equipment at store exits if
goods are stolen. With legitimate purchases the tag, which is positioned
near the bar code, is deactivated - switched off - when the assistant reads
the bar code at the point of sale.
A full demonstration system should be in place at a CWS store in Slough,
Buckinghamshire in 18 months.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: US patent action poses threat to
computer makers - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Harry Aine, a US inventor and lawyer, has launched a patent petition with
the US International Trade Commission which, according to lawyers defending
the action, could cripple the multi-billion dollar personal computer
industry.
Mr Aine owns a patent taken out in 1987 for a process by which metal disks
for hard disk drives are coated with a protective layer of pure carbon. With
the help of Chicago law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Mr Aine is pursuing 20
foreign and US-based disk and disk-drive manufacturers which he claims are
infringing his patent.
According to the US National Law Journal, the list includes Seagate
Technology and Digital Equipment of the US, and Asahi Komag of Tokyo, but
not International Business Machines which has been licensed by Mr Aine.
In his petition lodged at the end of March, Mr Aine asked the ITC to ban
permanently the entry into the US of all disks, disk drives and computers
that infringe his patent. He told the ITC that an estimated 6.53m infringing
disks were produced a month by non-licensed companies. Under ITC rules the
Commission must rule on the case within one year.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Thresholds of power - Robert Rice
examines controversial proposals to give Brussels greater scope in vetting
large mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By the end of June, Mr Karel Van Miert, the new EC competition commissioner,
must take what is likely to prove one of the toughest decisions of his
tenure. Should he recommend changes to the rules of the EC merger regulation
to give Brussels greater powers to vet large EC mergers and risk upsetting
Germany, France and the UK? Or should he leave the current system unaltered?
Time is not on his side. When the regulation was adopted by the Council of
Ministers in December 1989, a legal obligation was imposed on the European
Commission to review two of its aspects before the end of 1993  - the
turnover thresholds, above which the Commission has exclusive competence to
investigate mergers; and, the article 9 exception under which the Commission
can refer cases which affect a distinct national or regional market back to
national competition authorities.
A proposal to change the turnover thresholds can be adopted by the Council
on the basis of a qualified majority, but, as Mr Christopher Bright, a
partner with City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines points out, only if it is
made before the beginning of 1994. Afterwards, unanimity will be required as
it is for all other changes to the regulation.
Given the stormy history of the regulation (it took 16 years to get it
adopted) unanimity on change is unlikely. So if Mr Van Miert wants to change
the thresholds, he may have to act this year. For practical purposes that
means any proposal for change must be put to the Council by mid-July at the
latest.
His dilemma is a very real one. The presumption recognised at the time the
regulation was adopted was that the thresholds would come down after three
years, thereby increasing the number of mergers examined by Brussels.
At present if the combined worldwide turnover of the companies involved in a
merger or a 'structural' joint venture is Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.95bn) or more,
and the aggregate EC turnover of at least two companies involved is Ecu250m
or more each, then the merger would be dealt with by Brussels. Below those
thresholds, or if each company has more than two-thirds of its EC turnover
in one EC country, mergers are to be dealt with by national authorities. The
presumption in 1989 was that the main threshold would be reduced to Ecu2bn
and the EC threshold would come down in proportion to Ecu100m.
Mr Van Miert recognises that lowering the thresholds in this way would not
only run counter to the increased emphasis on subsidiarity, but also that it
would be opposed by Germany France and the UK.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, UK director-general of fair trading, is believed to feel
an increase in Brussels' jurisdiction over mergers is premature. Equally,
the Bundeskartellamt, the German cartel office, believes it is too early to
make a judgment on change. France, infuriated by the blocking of
Aerospatiale-Alenia's 1992 bid for De Havilland, the Canadian aerospace
company (the only deal to be blocked under the regulation so far), wants
higher thresholds to scale back the Commission's powers.
Against that view the European Parliament has already formally stated that
it favours reducing the thresholds. Similarly, the Commission's Economic and
Social Committee has queried whether the thresholds are unduly high.
Research by the Commission among the EC's 300 leading companies and among
industry organisations shows industry generally in favour of threshold
reduction because of the advantages the regulation offers of 'one-stop shop'
merger control and rapid clearance of deals. The German industry
organisation, Bundesverband Deutscher Industrie, is particularly in favour
of threshold reduction.
The precise impact of lowering the thresholds in terms of increasing
Brussels' power is difficult to gauge. The Commission is known to be
concerned that mergers likely to have a big impact on competition throughout
the EC have slipped through the net.
The Reed/Elsevier publishing merger last year created the largest publishing
group in the EC and second only to Dun &amp; Bradstreet at world level. Yet the
companies combined worldwide turnover was only Ecu3.1bn and so the deal
escaped scrutiny by Brussels.
ICI's swap of its polypropylene activities for BASF's acrylic glass
activities increased ICI's share of certain EC market segments to more than
40 per cent, but the deal escaped scrutiny because BASF's acrylic activities
had an EC turnover of only Ecu165m.
In 1992 when Fried Krupp bought Hoesch, it created one of the world's
largest steel producers with EC turnover of Ecu10bn. The merger required
notification in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, but because both
undertakings had more than two-thirds of their EC turnover in Germany, the
merger was excluded from the scope of the regulation.
The Commission says these are not isolated cases. The survey of the 300
companies suggested that if the thresholds had already been lowered as
envisaged a further 53 cases would have fallen under the regulation since it
came into operation in September 1990. Twenty of them would not have been
notifiable to the Commission if the current two-thirds rule was maintained.
Based on these figures the Commission estimates that the extra number of
cases falling under the regulation each year if the thresholds are lowered
would vary whether or not the two-thirds rule was also abolished. If it was
abolished, the Commission estimates an extra 75 cases a year, but only 50 if
the rule was kept.
If the EC turnover threshold was kept at Ecu250m, as favoured by industry,
the number of extra cases would be much smaller.
This projected shift in power to Brussels is sufficiently modest to persuade
a number of senior Commission competition officials that an attempt to lower
the thresholds should be made. Mr Philip Lowe, the new head of the merger
task force, is believed to favour a reduction. Mr Van Miert, viewed by
Brussels insiders as extremely cautious, is hedging his bets until he knows
more precisely the extent of the trade-off which would have to be made to
win the backing of the Germans, French and British.
For Germany and Britain the price is likely to be a relaxation of the
article 9 exception to allow more cases affecting distinct national or
regional markets to be dealt with by national competition authorities. So
far there have only been five requests for referral back under article 9 and
only one has been granted (Steetley/Tarmac).
Even with a doubling of the number of cases handled by Brussels following a
reduction in the thresholds the number of article 9 requests is unlikely to
increase by more than nine a year. EC industry on the other hand appears
implacably opposed to an enlargement of the scope of article 9. A change to
article 9 is only likely if the thresholds are reduced.
Competition experts warn against over-concentration on the issue of
thresholds. There are other important changes which should be made to the
working of the regulation. By increasing the transparency of the Brussels'
decision making process, some of these might be acceptable to the Germans as
a trade-off for lower thresholds.
Mr Bright says that allowing the Commission to accept undertakings by
companies during a one-month first-stage investigation, and to publish
proposed undertakings so that third parties can comment before a final
decision to accept them is made, would be 'a big step forward in terms of
transparency and third-party rights'.
The time has come for Mr Van Miert to show his hand.

European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
On June 8, the EC Council of Ministers adopted a decision extending the
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance to all direct actions brought by
natural or legal persons. The decision follows a request by the European
Court of Justice in October 1991 for the CFI's jurisdiction to be extended.
At present the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance is limited to
competition cases, cases involving staff of the European Community
institutions and certain cases under the European Coal and Steel Community
Treaty.
The effect of the decision will be to set up a proper second level of
jurisdiction within the Community legal system and allow the quality and
effectiveness of judicial review in the Community to be maintained. The ECJ
will be free to concentrate on its main tasks of ensuring the uniform
interpretation of Community law and safeguarding the institutional balance
within the EC.
It is also hoped that relieving the ECJ of the burden of hearing direct
actions will speed up the time it takes to decide cases, particularly
preliminary references on points of law from national courts, which will
still be heard by the Court of Justice.
The decision will come into force on the first day of the second month after
publication of the decision in the Official Journal. This should mean it
will come into force on September 1, except for anti-dumping cases. The
actual date for the transfer of jurisdiction in anti-dumping cases has yet
to be agreed by the Council. After September 1 all direct actions brought by
natural or legal persons must be brought in the CFI; cases pending before
the Court of Justice will also be transferred to the CFI after that date.
Greece in breach of obligations
The failure of Greece to abide by a European Commission decision calling for
the repayment of illegal state aid could not be excused on the grounds that
one of the ways in which the aid could have been repaid was contrary to the
Greek constitution, the Court of Justice ruled last week.
The case involved a Greek law under which company profits arising from
exports were exempt from a certain tax. The Commission decided this was
unlawful state aid and ordered it to be repaid. The Greek government did not
challenge the decision but the aid was not repaid. The Commission brought an
action against Greece for breach of its Rome Treaty obligations.
The Greek government argued the Commission decision was unlawful and in any
event impossible to carry out. It said repayment of aid would have to take
the form of a retroactive tax which was incompatible with the Greek
constitution.
The court ruled that, as Greece had not challenged the Commission decision,
the only available defence was that it was impossible to carry out the
decision correctly.
However the court rejected the arguments put forward by the Greek
authorities because they were based exclusively on the hypothesis that the
only way repayment could be made was by imposition of a retroactive tax. The
Greek authorities were simply under an obligation to ensure the companies
which had received the aid repaid it. There was no requirement for the
imposition of a retroactive tax.
The court said the companies could not plead that the obligation to repay
the aid was in breach of their legitimate expectations as such a possibility
would deprive the Rome Treaty's state aid provisions of all useful effect.
The court said that in cases such as this member states were under an
obligation to collaborate with the Commission in good faith in order to
overcome the practical difficulties of ensuring repayment.
C-183/91: Commission v Greece, ECJ FC, June 10 1993.
Opinion in PVC case delayed
The opinion of Advocate General Walter Van Gerven in the PVC appeal case due
last week has been put back to June 29. The appeal brought by the Commission
challenges a decision of the Court of First Instance which ruled that the
Commission's original decision in the PVC case did not exist because of
procedural irregularity.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Aiming to ease conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial disputes frequently drift into legal proceedings which can be
costly and wasteful in terms of management time and damaging to goodwill
between the people involved.
But there is another method of defusing conflict, known as alternative
dispute resolution.
Suggestions of how and when to use ADR are contained in a new guide* by Alex
Roney, legal adviser to the London Chamber of Commerce. ADR may not be
suitable in every case, particularly if there is a link between the dispute
and further claims, but it does offer the advantages of speed, privacy and a
reduction in the amount of acrimonious discussion, says Roney. If it does
not work the parties can then resort to conventional litigation.
Alternative dispute resolution may involve conciliation, in which a neutral
third party encourages the two sides to reach agreement or mediation, where
the third party plays a more interventionist role.
The two sides to the dispute can stage a mini-trial or executive tribunal
where both parties present their case before senior executives from the two
sides and a neutral 'expert'.
How do the costs of ADR compare with formal litigation? The guide compares
the costs involved in a disputed claim of Pounds 15,000 in a county court, a
Pounds 100,000 claim before the high court and a claim settled by ADR. The
costs involved in ADR will be broadly similar almost regardless of the
amount claimed, it says.
The costs involved in county court litigation would be between Pounds 5,000
and Pounds 7,500, in high court action between Pounds 8,000 and Pounds
15,000, and under ADR, assuming mediation takes one business day, between
Pounds 3,300 and Pounds 4,500, Roney calculates.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A wider view for the
workforce - Lisa Wood examines a government standard which aims to improve
the training of employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every month or so for the past two years Christine and Malcolm Bolton have
closed their small Grimsby electroplating business on a Friday afternoon and
joined their six staff for a few hours at a local hotel.
It is not a social event. On the agenda might be a discussion on the latest
profits forecasts, a brainstorming session on how to tackle technical
problems arising from a new order and whether the premises meet health and
safety rules.
The meetings are part of wider changes at Riverside Electroplaters which
have helped the company become more efficient, produce a better-quality
service and increase turnover and maintain profits at a time when profit
margins in the sector are being squeezed.
The catalyst was the company becoming committed to, and then qualifying for,
a government standard called 'Investors In People'.
IIP was developed by the Department of Employment with help from human
resource development experts. It is administered in England and Wales by the
82 Training and Enterprise Councils, which this year will receive Pounds 10m
of government money to promote what is their main weapon for improving the
training of people in work. In Scotland the scheme is administered by the 14
Local Enterprise Companies.
IIP has had a big impact at Riverside - including savings on the bottom
line. A large order worth Pounds 40,000 was nearly rejected because
Riverside could not afford special processing equipment. An employee at a
monthly meeting suggested modifying existing equipment. It cost Pounds 200
and Riverside won the order. 'We have and are still having a tough time
because of the recession,' says Christine Bolton. 'If it had not been for
IIP we probably would not still be in business.'
Viewed by many small businesses as just another big government programme,
with all the attendant bureaucracy, the IIP standard has been slow to take
off. Yet experts agree it provides one of the most useful check lists, based
on best practice, of what companies should be doing on staff development.
The standard is not an award for spending large sums on training. Rather,
assessors acting for the Tecs will ask:
Have goals been set for a business?
Have these been explained to workers?
Have workers the right skills to meet those needs?
Has the investment been evaluated against the performance of the business?
Riverside, with six employees, is the smallest company to have achieved the
IIP standard and takes pride of place in Department of Employment publicity.
According to the department, more than half of the 253 companies that have
been awarded IIP status employ fewer than 200 people. It is unlikely that
IIP would be appropriate for a company any smaller than Riverside.
IIP's impact on recipient companies has yet to be formally evaluated. Case
examples provided by the department bring ringing endorsements. However,
Riverside did have some problems gaining the standard and other small
companies could encounter similar ones.
The biggest initial obstacle at Riverside was comprehension. 'We did not
really understand what it was all about at first,' says Christine Bolton,
who with her husband and several other local businesses was invited to
presentations by the Humberside Training and Enterprise Council nearly three
years ago when IIP was being piloted. 'It is very difficult for somebody to
get across what 'relating training to your business plan' really means.'
Some Tecs have been better than others at promoting the standard and
providing their staff with skills for going into a business and finding out
what it needs. Among the best Tecs is Gloucestershire Tec which has given
IIP top priority. London Tecs are among the worst.
There were teething problems at Humberside. Riverside was asked, for
example, to do an action plan at a time when it had only a very basic
business plan - the sort that is produced for a bank. 'We wrote things like
'We must work out a staff appraisal plan by such and such a date' but it
really did not mean much to us,' says Christine Bolton.
Humberside has refined its approach over the past two years and now an
applicant for IIP would immediately be offered diagnostic work to discover
its problems and whether or not it had the basics, such as a business plan.
Similarly, changes are being made nationally to the way the standard is
presented, with a new guide* for small businesses to be published this
month.
The next obstacle for the Boltons was time, and attendant costs. 'It took us
two years to get the standard and the time commitment was enormous,' says
Christine Bolton. 'First of all there were the meetings when the scheme was
explained. Then there was the detailed work, much of which we did at home,
and the half day every month that we spend with the employees. We do know
companies that have dropped out of trying to do IIP because they could not
afford the time.'
Riverside says it is difficult to assess the full costs. In common with many
of the early recipients of IIP, the company received a lot of help from its
local Tec, including a grant for a consultant who paid six two-hour visits.
Most Tecs provide grants or matching funds for consultancy and many provide
lists of approved consultants.
Humberside Tec estimates it would now cost about Pounds 2,000 for a company
of Riverside's size to achieve the standard. Riverside cost a bit more as it
was a pilot. Peter Fryer, chief executive of the Tec, says: 'We were
learning from them and vice versa.'
Costs include the formal assessment by a Tec representative. Fees average
around Pounds 300 a day, with small businesses probably requiring two to
three days' formal assessment time. In most cases Tecs, which are very keen
to get companies on board because they have targets to meet, will negotiate
fees.
The Boltons wrote their own business plan after taking advice from
Humberside Tec. 'Our basic plan had been a series of boxes with headings,'
says Christine Bolton. 'In our new plan we relate them to each other - like
productivity having a relationship to training.'
The plan she says was essential. 'It's when you are specific about a goal
that you are able to ask yourself whether you have the skills needed to get
there and, if not, how can you work towards that.' At Riverside this
resulted in some off-the-job training, such as everybody attending a
fork-lift truck course in order to provide a flexible workforce, to a
considerable amount of on-the-job coaching by senior staff.
Christine Bolton says improved communications with staff grew from this
process. 'How can you expect people to work towards a corporate objective if
they don't know what the plan is,' she says. One employee told the assessor:
'I've never known a place like this - they listen to you.' Another said:
'They don't just tell you what to do and how to do it but why.'
Riverside's ultimate problem was how to measure improvements. 'If you are a
big company, producing something like fish fingers, it is easier to measure
things than if you are a little one like ours doing jobbing work,' says
Christine Bolton.
She gives the example of the zinc barrel plating line where an aim was to
improve productivity. The consultant suggested they used the rejection rate
as a measure, something the Boltons had not thought of. Taking this idea
further they designed a new system whereby employees on the line measured
their own rejects and the information was made public every week. Previously
quality assurance was done separately. Rejection rates have dropped from 25
per cent to 2 per cent.
Christine Bolton says the setting of targets has brought benefits she had
never envisaged. 'The consultant suggested we measured debtor days and I had
targets to reduce them. We have very few bad debts now. Why? Because I get
to know the person responsible for the payments and build up a
relationship.'
The search for some magical system of cost-benefit analysis is a common
problem, according to Sue Webb, a national assessor. 'But evaluation can be
very simple,' she says. 'If you want somebody to improve their
report-writing skills and you send them on a course you just evaluate their
progress by whether they do fewer drafts. It can be as easy as that.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Small firms warned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small and medium-sized firms in Europe have enjoyed dynamic growth but now
face tougher competition from larger companies following the creation of the
single European market.
This is one of the findings of the first in a planned series of annual
reviews of the smaller firms sector in Europe. The European Observatory for
Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises* is compiled by academic researchers in
the 12 member countries.
In the short term the single market is expected to reduce delays and red
tape following the removal of customs checks at borders and the
harmonisation of technical standards. But some formalities have simply been
shifted on to businesses and there is a strong risk that smaller firms will
not fully reap the benefits in practice, the review warns.
In the medium term the creation of larger markets and more trade will
increase competition from new entrants, often larger firms, in many
traditional markets. In manufacturing sectors where small firms have been
unable to exploit economies of scale they may lose market share.
The number of small firms in manufacturing and distribution will probably
decline. By contrast, the creation of a larger market place will create
opportunities for further specialisation and new business initiatives. This
will prompt the creation of new companies offering innovative products and
services but will also lead to higher failure rates.
Almost 99.9 per cent of the 15.7m businesses in the EC are small or medium
sized and they employ 70 per cent of the total workforce. There are 14.5m
micro enterprises (employing up to nine people), 1m small firms (between 10
and 99 people) and 70,000 medium-sized businesses (from 100 to 499 people).
There are only 12,000 companies larger in size.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Oil tax threat leads to withdrawals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OIL industry withdrew applications for seven North Sea exploration
blocks in response to the government's proposed changes to Petroleum Revenue
Tax. But Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the withdrawals had not
significantly affected the success of the latest offshore licensing round,
which was the largest for 20 years.
The government yesterday awarded 110 blocks for offshore oil exploration out
of the 484 put on offer as part of the largest range of offerings since
1972. Oil companies showed much interest in important new areas for
exploration such as the area west of the Shetland Isles, and Cardigan Bay
off the Welsh coast.
Mr Eggar said he had particularly strong hopes for the area west of
Shetland. 'I think we are on the verge of proving up a major new province
which will be very significant for the future of the industry and UK oil
production,' he said.
But oil companies have been protesting about the government's proposed
changes to North Sea taxes. Mr Eggar said that, with the seven withdrawals,
some companies had altered their original work programmes in response to the
tax change.
The PRT reforms would reduce the rate of tax paid on existing fields but
abolish tax relief for exploration work.
Companies had committed themselves to drill 93 wells, but this was lower
than had been expected before the tax changes, Mr Eggar said.
The Department of Trade and Industry has imposed stringent new environmental
requirements on many companies which have been awarded blocks close to the
coast. This affected 35 blocks and Mr Eggar announced measures to monitor
closely companies' adherence to their environmental plans.
Greenpeace, the environmental group, said it was alarmed by Mr Eggar's
announcements yesterday. It said the UK was in the process of implementing a
directive from the EC to protect natural habitats which could ban industrial
activity in some coastal waters.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht tide sweeps into Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTENT of the threat-ened tidal wave of amendments for the House of
Lords committee discussion of the Maastricht bill began to emerge yesterday,
with almost 400 tabled so far.
The bulk of the amendments have been put down by two veteran Labour
Euro-sceptics, Lord Bruce of Donington and Lord Stoddart of Swindon. More
than 200 of them would simply exclude from the bill - and thus from UK law -
individual articles and in some cases even sentences in the treaty and its
protocols.
Those put forward tonight by Lord Pearson of Rannoch, the unofficial whip of
the Tory Euro-rebels, included one demanding assurances that Britons will
not be made subject to any 'duties' to the European Union.
Another would require the Act to be delayed until a list has been agreed by
parliament of powers which fall within the 'exclusive competence' of the
Community.
Peers are due to begin discussing the bill in detail a week today, and
amendments can be tabled even then.
Labour's frontbench team has so far tabled only a handful of amendments, and
ministers still expect at least one amendment providing for a referendum.
The only amendment so far from Lord Tebbit, aleading Euro-sceptic, is to
delete the concession the government was forced to make in the Commons,
ensuring a debate on the social chapter before the bill comes into force and
the treaty can be ratified.
Government business managers have already shown by refusing to provide more
than two days for last week's second reading debate on the bill - despite
the record number of speakers - that they would rather have the Lords
sitting into the early hours of the morning to finish discussion than have
the bill's timing knocked off course.
If the bill is given no longer in the Lords committee than the legislation
taking the UK into the European Community, then it could complete its
parliamentary passage soon after the middle of July.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: SIB chairman supports life
insurance proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief watchdog, yesterday backed the lenient disclosure proposals for
the life industry put forward by his predecessor, Sir David Walker.
The proposals have been criticised by the Office of Fair Trading and
consumer groups.
The Treasury is considering a report from the OFT which found that key
elements of the proposals unfairly restrict competition in the industry and
give consumers too little information to help them choose products wisely.
If the Treasury agrees with the OFT it may order the SIB to draft new
proposals.
Meanwhile, in response to questioning from MPs on the Treasury and Civil
Service committee, Mr Large said the SIB may have to consider forcing life
insurance sales agents to tell prospective customers how much commission
they earn on each sale.
The OFT had urged only that independent financial advisers should disclose
such information, while 'tied' agents, selling the products of only one
provider, would be exempt.
Mr Large said: 'If the Treasury were to decide that disclosure of commission
were desirable, we would need to find some equitable form of disclosure for
tied agents.'
Separately, he said that he expected the proposed new self-regulatory body
for retail financial services, the Personal Investment Authority, to be
operational early next year.
Mr Large said the SIB was drafting criteria for use of its powers under
section 59 of the Financial Services Act which give it authority to ban
individuals from practising. The rules are expected within eight weeks but
Mr Large declined to say whether they could apply to previous breaches.
It has been suggested that the SIB would use these powers in respect of
officials at Invesco MIM, the fund management group, which earlier this
month was fined Pounds 750,000 for 55 separate rule breaches.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: NAO reviews grant schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS about financial controls in grant-maintained schools have led the
National Audit Office to start annual inspections of the schools, the
Commons public accounts committee was told yesterday.
Sir Geoffrey Holland, the permanent secretary to the Department for
Education, said he welcomed the inspections, which followed a highly
critical NAO report. The report found that some schools had only one person
controlling cash and payroll, with no independent checks. Mr Robert Sheldon,
chairman of the committee, described such practices as a 'recipe for
disaster'. He also criticised the control of cash balances by
grant-maintained schools, which retained Pounds 10.7m in cash at the end of
the financial year.
Sir Geoffrey said that Pounds 4.5m of that cash had been privately raised.
Officials from the department faced criticism over double funding for
grant-maintained schools. Double funding meant that schools opting out early
had received Pounds 13.6m more than they would have done by staying under
local authority control.
The department said the funding followed the 'deliberate decision of
ministers'.
Sir Geoffrey admitted the department's officials had criticised the
financial controls of the Grant-Maintained Schools Centre, which provided
services for opted-out schools. He said: 'I asked my chief accounting
officers to visit the centre. They made criticisms, and the centre has begun
to implement their recommendations.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory right dents PM's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORY right wing last night voiced bitter criticism of Sir Norman Fowler,
party chairman, and warned Mr John Major againsttax increases.
A private meeting of the Conservative 92 group heard a series of attacks on
Sir Norman - a close confidant of Mr Major - for his assault last week on Mr
Norman Lamont, the former chancellor.
One senior MP in the group said the party chairman's intervention had caused
'more damage' than Mr Lamont's resignation speech itself. 'There were lots
of nasty words about Sir Norman,' the MP said.
The 92 group's reaction reflects a widespread belief among Tory MPs that Sir
Norman had been instrumental in Mr Lamont's downfall.
Sir George Gardiner, the group's chairman, is expected to seek an early
meeting with the prime minister and is likely to pass on the criticism of
Sir Norman.
The 92 group met as it emerged that Mr Clarke is to launch later this month
a concerted Treasury operation to brief Tory MPs on the state of public
finances and to test views on how the spiralling deficit should be
controlled.
Most of the 92 group MPs spoke out against direct tax increases - although
there was support for sweeping public spending cuts and, possibly, some
increases in indirect taxes to raise revenue.
One 92 group member said the public spending review was 'a litmus test' for
the new chancellor.
Suggestions that Mr Clarke is winning support as a possible future Tory
leader among the right wing were being played down last night. Instead,
senior members of the 92 group reported 'almost unanimous' support for Mr
Major with only one or two MPs, out of almost 60 who attended last night's
meeting, speaking against him.
Many rightwing MPs still regard Mr Major as 'on probation' for a year,
however. 'The government must get it's act together quickly,' said one.
Members of the 92 group complain that in last month's reshuffle Mr Major
'missed an opportunity' to promote rightwingers. One said Mr Major had to
realise rightwingers were his 'natural allies'. Apart from on Maastricht,
most Tory rebels were from the left of the party, he added.
The meeting took place on the eve of a key meeting between the prime
minister, Mr Michael Portillo, treasury chief secretary, and social security
secretary Mr Peter Lilley to consider the extent to which the spending axe
should fall on welfare payments.
Lord Howe, the former chancellor, yesterday suggested that Tory election
pledges could be put aside, perhaps temporarily, and income tax increased in
order to tackle the public sector deficit.
'There is no surer way of destroying the recovery than to run indefinitely
into debt,' he told BBC radio.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Manifesto pledges enter grey area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS no accident that the Conservative manifesto for last April's general
election found space for a hedgerow incentive scheme, but not for
commitments on value added tax or prescription charges.
The distinction made last week by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, between
what was said in the manifesto and 'stray speeches given on a wet Wednesday
evening in Dudley' during the campaign has focused attention anew on
promises in the 50-page election document.
There are no cast-iron pledges.
Even before the worst option of simply having to argue that times have
become harder since April 1992, the Tories can give just about any phrase
the desired meaning. In the last parliament they argued that the commitment
to pay child benefit 'as now' was not incompatible with freezing it.
In practice, however, Mr John Major's insistence that the spirit as well as
the letter of the manifesto will be honoured means that finding a tortuous
way through the words is much less likely than making changes where there is
a deafening silence.
The most straightforward commitment on taxation is that the government will
'make further progress towards a basic income tax rate of 20p'. There is
also a pledge to 'maintain mortgage tax relief'.
There is no commitment about uprating personal allowances, the higher rate
of tax, or about raising the VAT rate or extending its base.
The manifesto is silent also on National Insurance contributions, leaving
scope for changes beyond the 1 per cent increase announced in March.
The most specific pledges on spending are on the universal benefits.
Targeted benefits such as income support, family credit and housing benefit
are not referred to by name.
The value of child benefit, the promise runs, will increase each year in
line with prices. It 'will continue to be paid to all families, normally to
the mother, and in respect of all children'.
As for the basic state retirement pension, that will 'remain the foundation
for retirement. We will continue to protect its value against price rises'.
The spirit of the commitment rules out restricting the pension's
availability, though this is not specifically mentioned, and may also
exclude failing to pay the pensioners' Christmas bonus.
But nothing in the manifesto would prevent the government shifting
responsibility for employment-related payments such as industrial injury or
sickness benefit to employers.
On health, the basic promise is that 'need and not the ability to pay is,
and will remain, the basis on which care is offered to all by the NHS. We
will, year by year, increase the level of real resources committed to the
NHS'.
This does not preclude raising money by extending charges, provided that the
poorest are exempted, but at least the pledge contains the phrase 'year by
year', missing from other promises.
The politics of tax and spending have moved on sharply from just over a year
ago, and the focus of the debate has shifted. Some Tories now wish the
manifesto had left rather more room for manoeuvre on mortgage tax relief and
child benefit, and rather less on VAT.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ex-minister slams lease bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Jopling, the former Conservative cabinet minister, told the
Commons last night that in spite of improvements made by the House of Lords,
the bill extending leasehold enfranchisement remained 'contemptible'.
MPs approved the bulk of the 300 amendments made by peers to the Housing and
Urban Development bill, including the introduction of a residency test for
the enfranchisement of leasehold flats in central London and other areas.
Mr Jopling, who was chief whip in Baroness Thatcher's first administration,
said in his 20 years as an MP he could recall no other piece of legislation
which made him so ashamed of the Conservative party than 'this wretched,
miserable bill'.
He maintained that by providing for the tearing up of agreements which had
been freely entered into the bill was contrary to the philosophy of the
Conservative party.
Mr Jopling insisted that the inclusion of a residency tests amounted to no
more than a 'modest improvement' to what he still regarded as an
unacceptable bill.
His objections were supported by Sir Jerry Wiggin (C Weston-super-Mare), a
former junior minister, and by Mr Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (C Cirencester and
Tewkesbury).
Sir George Young, the housing minister, described the residency test as a
'sensible compromise' between two conflicting points of view.
He told Labour critics that it would not 'substantially disenfranchise a
large number of people'.
Sir George said the new test was intended to prevent a majority of
non-resident long leaseholders purchasing their landlords' interests.
It would exorcise the spectre of control by an absent minority.
In accordance with the terms of another amendment made by the Lords the
title of the bill was changed to the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Bill.

SYSTEMS for checking the quality of drinking water in England and Wales were
given a clean bill of health yesterday.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, announced that Professor Peter Stott had
found that the methods used by the Drinking Water Inspectorate were
'appropriate and sufficient'.
The review was announced last October to see if the methods were appropriate
for checking that water companies were complying with their statutory
duties.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WILL today use the second day's scrutiny of the government's new
insider dealing legislation to press ministers over the prosecution of City
crime.
Mr Alistair Darling, the party's City spokesman, will call for the
government to consider setting up a 'streamlined, independent organisation'
responsible for prosecuting City crime. 'There is a strong feeling that
there are too many cooks spoiling the broth,' he said.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories lose education vote
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was defeated 70-61 in the Lords early today as peers backed a
cross-party move to ensure that councils had a continuing role in the
provision of special education in grant-maintained schools.
An amendment to the Education Bill sponsored by Baroness David (Lab),
Baroness Warnock (Ind) and Lord Addington (Lib Dem), would require governors
of such schools to submit reports to the local authority on the planning of
special education.
Lady David said later that the vote 'cuts across the government's
long-running vendetta against elected local education authorities'.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley endorses TUC-led campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Bottomley, the former Conservative employment minister, yesterday
backed a campaign led by the Trades Union Congress against a late House of
Lords amendment to the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill, Diane
Summers writes.
The bill is due to be debated in the Commons today and tomorrow.
Mr Bottomley, MP for Eltham, said the amendment was an 'unbelievable
proposal' and was a 'direct attack on freedom of association' for union
members.
The amendment, which will strengthen employers' rights to derecognise unions
and introduce personal contracts, was introduced immediately after a Court
of Appeal ruling in April.
The court ruled that it was unlawful for employees to to be offered
financial inducements to give up their collective bargaining rights and sign
personal contracts. The latest employment bill amendment would reverse that
position.
The TUC said yesterday that it would complain to the International Labour
Organisation.
Mr Bottomley said Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, had not
sought such a measure. It was 'odd that anyone should try to be more
Thatcherite than Thatcher', he said.
Mr Michael Forsyth, a junior employment minister, said the amendment 'makes
clear that employers can pay more to secure changes in bargaining
arrangements, such as individual personal contracts or single-union
agreements'. Employees' rights to membership of unions were not affected, he
said.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury to brief Tory back benches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONCERTED Treasury operation to brief Tory MPs on the state of public
finances and to test views on how the spiralling deficit should be
controlled will be launched later this month by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor.
With debate on tax and spending policies threatening to cause fresh
divisions in Conservative ranks, Mr Clarke and Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the Treasury, are to hold a series of meetings with
Conservative MPs before the summer recess starts in late July.
The two cabinet ministers want to ensure that MPs understand the parameters
within which November's unified tax and expenditure Budget will have to be
set.
A bigger challenge, however, may be to find agreement among Conservative MPs
on measures to control the public sector borrowing requirement - or even
whether action is needed at all.
Sir Terence Higgins, the widely-respected former Treasury minister, has
warned that with most of the deficit caused by cyclical factors, action to
curb borrowing now would be 'inappropriate' and could impede economic
recovery.
But other MPs joined yesterday with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, in saying that Tory manifesto commitments may have to be broken
in the effort to rein back the deficit to a sustainable level.
Lord Howe, the former chancellor, yesterday suggested that election pledges
could be put aside, perhaps temporarily, and that income tax may have to be
rise in order to tackle the deficit. He said on BBC radio: 'There is no
surer way of destroying the recovery than to run indefinitely into debt.'
Among Conservative MPs there is a small lobby calling for the abolition of
mortgage interest tax relief. Another senior Tory, Sir Peter Hordern, MP for
Horsham and executive member of the 1922 backbench committee, has suggested
abolishing the National Insurance upper earnings limit to ensure the state
insurance scheme is fully funded.
Tory MPs' protests after the March Budget over the imposition of VAT on
domestic fuel and power highlighted the importance of political skills at
the Treasury. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, last night urged Mr
John Major to make clear his views on the future of the welfare state. He
was speaking ahead of a meeting today between Mr Major, Mr Portillo and Mr
Peter Lilley, social security secretary, to discuss the future of invalidity
benefit.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Minister calls for building ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LIST of construction projects, which the government would like to see
developed jointly by private and public-sector interests, is expected to be
published today.
Sir George Young, construction minister, is expected to announce the schemes
during a visit to Coventry. He will emphasise the government's commitment to
attracting private investment in infrastructure and services when it is
under intense pressure to reduce public spending.
The latest projects are in addition to 21 developments costing more than
Pounds 1bn which Mr John Redwood, then environment minister, identified as
candidates for joint ventures earlier this year.
Previous schemes included a new airport for Sheffield, a power station for
London's Docklands and a road tunnel under the River Tyne. The government is
thought to be close to announcing that private-sector backers have been
found for several of these.
Most of the schemes identified by the department would involve public
authorities handing over land to private companies which, in return, would
be expected to finance much needed inner-city developments.
The department said private investment might be supplemented either by local
authority capital receipts or from the Pounds 600m-a-year urban development
corporation, urban partnership and City Challenge budgets.
The projects have attracted strong interest from construction companies
which have been starved of public and private-sector work during the
recession.
The environment department schemes are in addition to several large road and
rail schemes which have been identified by the transport department as
candidates for joint ventures.
The government's determination to encourage greater private-sector
investment has prompted it to relax Treasury rules which required that
private schemes could proceed only if they were cheaper than equivalent
public-sector proposals.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Commercial property values 'start to climb'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL property values have stopped falling for the first time since
1989, statistics published yesterday show.
A report by Hillier Parker, the firm of chartered surveyors, provides the
first statistical evidence that the worst property recession for 50 years is
over.
The surveyors say average commercial property values, which fell 42 per cent
from their peak in 1989, have risen 0.2 per cent since May.
The greatest improvement was in the retail market, where values rose 0.8 per
cent, followed by the office sector, where values rose 0.1 per cent.
Industrial property continued to fall in value, with a decline of 0.6 per
cent.
The improvement in the market stems from a marked increase in demand from
investors, which has pushed down investment yields - the ratio of income to
capital values. This has more than compensated for the continued decline in
rental values, which also influence capital values. Rents are still falling,
but more slowly.
Hillier Parker says demand from investors in property is greater than at any
time in the past decade.
It calculates that at least Pounds 7bn has been earmarked for property
investment. It has identified 22 pension funds and 29 insurance companies
which plan to spend a total of Pounds 4bn on property. It believes also that
11 property companies want to spend Pounds 1.9bn and 83 overseas investors
Pounds 1.4bn.
Signs of recovery have reached even the most depressed parts of the market,
including central London offices, the firm says. Office yields showed the
most marked improvement over the past month, falling from 9.3 per cent to
9.1 per cent. In August 1989 they reached a low of 6.8 per cent.
Demand is still centred on good-quality, well-let property, which accounts
for about a quarter of the market, it says.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Abolish county of Avon, commission says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COUNTY of Avon should be abolished and Bristol, Gloucestershire and
Somerset restored to their historic boundaries, the Local Government
Commission for England recommended yesterday.
The commission proposes that the two-tier structure of three county and 17
district councils be replaced by eight unitary authorities. It estimates
that annual savings would be about Pounds 19m, mostly in administrative
costs, and that the transitional costs could be paid for within two years.
Under the proposals Bristol would regain the status it lost in 1974 when
Avon was created and took over responsibility for such matters as education
and social services.
But the commission does not support the case argued by Bristol City Council
and some businesses for its boundaries to be widened to include the
travel-to-work area. The commission says there are strong arguments of
community identity against such a move.
Under the commission's proposals Somerset and Gloucestershire would return
for non-administrative purposes to their boundaries of pre-1974, when they
lost territory to Avon. The commission said people identified strongly with
Somerset, and it proposed a single authority called South and West Somerset
to cover almost all the existing county. The southern part of Avon would
return to Somerset and would be covered by two unitary councils, one
including Bath.
The commission recommends that Gloucestershire County Council be replaced by
four unitary authorities, one covering the northern part of Avon and the
others covering Gloucester and Stroud, Cheltenham and Tewkesbury, and the
Forest of Dean.
Sir John Banham, chairman of the commission, stressed that the proposals
were a 'preferred solution' and that there would be consultation until
September. 'This is an unprecedented effort to tailor the structure of local
government to the expressed views of local people,' he said.
The commission, which was contacted by more than 6,000 local people and
organisations, said the abolition of Avon was seen as inevitable. It was the
structure of local government rather than Avon council's performance that
seemed to provoke the antipathy, it said.
Almost 1m people live in Avon but, as an 'artificial' county, it has never
been popular and the council, which employs 17,000, has appeared resigned to
its probable abolition. A Mori poll for the commission found that only 5 per
cent of people in Avon identified strongly with the county.
The Association of County Councils said the proposals for Avon and
Gloucestershire would harm services and lead to higher costs. But it
welcomed the recommendation that most of Somerset should be a unitary
authority.
Mr John Savage, chief executive of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and
Initiative, which supports the case for a greater Bristol council, attacked
the commission's proposals as a 'disaster for local government funding'.
Bristol and its problems would be isolated from the people who lived outside
the city but looked to it for their work and leisure, he said.
The commission has already published proposals for the Isle of Wight,
Cleveland and County Durham and Derbyshire. A review of Leicestershire is
under way and one of Nottinghamshire is due to start on June 21.

FT  15 JUN 93 / 45% of small businesses 'have been victims of crime'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY HALF of all small businesses have been the victims of crime,
according to a survey published yesterday by the Forum of Private Business.
Of 2,670 companies surveyed 45 per cent had been affected by crime. Burglary
was the most common problem, affecting 45 per cent of the victims. It was
followed by vandalism (31 per cent), theft (27 per cent), vehicle crime (24
per cent), shoplifting (17 per cent), and fraud (11 per cent).
In a follow-up poll 90 per cent of business owners called for greater powers
for the police and courts.
Finance firms were the most common targets for burglary followed by
manufacturing and wholesale. Construction and retail businesses suffered
most from vandalism.
Businesses of fewer than four people were least affected by crime. Small
businesses suffered most from shoplifting and fraud, while medium-sized
firms were disproportionately affected by vehicle-related crime, theft and
vandalism.
The north of England was affected more than any other region.

FT  15 JUN 93 / BCCI liquidators seek fee approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIQUIDATORS to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International plan
to seek advance approval of their fees for the coming year at the first
meeting of the formal creditors' committee, scheduled to take place on
Monday.
Accountants from Touche Ross will present the five-strong committee - whose
names were made public yesterday - with their planned budget for the
liquidation. The submission may help deflect criticism of the firm over the
level of fees it has so far billed, which amounted to more than Dollars 133m
between July 1991 and January 1993 on the UK liquidation alone.
A report on the liquidation, submitted to the Department of Trade and
Industry by Touche earlier this year, showed realisations during that period
of Dollars 648m against payments of Dollars 280.4m.
That included other expenses such as Dollars 37m on legal costs and Dollars
18m to BCCI's Luxembourg liquidators.
The informal creditors' committee, in operation until last month, had a
remit to review the fees charged by Touche but had no formal powers. The
formal committee, expected to meet monthly, has greater control under
English insolvency law.
In two separate resolutions at the first formal meeting of BCCI creditors at
London's Wembley Arena last month creditors voted in favour of establishing
a liquidation committee and selected for it five of the 24.
The committee may face some stormy sessions. Elected members include a
representative from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, owed more than
Dollars 72m, and Dr Adil Elias, chairman of the BCCI Depositors' Protection
Association, who is owed nearly Dollars 2m.
Bury Metropolitan District Council, owed Dollars 13m, is also a member,
along with Film &amp; Photo Pension Fund, owed Dollars 1m, and Visa
International Services Association, owed nearly Dollars 2m.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Tecs warned on national links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING AND Enterprise Councils must forge better working relationships
with other employer organisations if targets for improving the skills of the
workforce are to be met, Mrs Sheila Drew-Smith of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountancy firm, said at a training conference yesterday.
She was presenting a study on relations between the 82 Tecs, which deliver
government training schemes in England and Wales, and the 126 Industry
Training Organisations, which are national bodies focusing on particular
sectors.
When the government set up Tecs more than four years ago it wanted them to
work closely with the training organisations. They have information, for
example, on sectoral labour needs which the government believed could
provide a national perspective to Tecs, whose prime responsibility is to
respond to local labour markets.
The partnership has been patchy, however, with the organisations sometimes
complaining that Tecs have ignored them. Mrs Drew-Smith said the study
suggested that each set of organisations may not have perceived the value of
the other's role, or viewed the other as a potential threat.
Tecs had sometimes been seen by the training organisations as inexperienced
newcomers.
She said there was confusion about how they could collaborate to achieve
national targets for National Vocational Qualifications and Investors in
People, the government's main vehicle for improving the training of people
in work.
Mrs Drew-Smith who has prepared a checklist for Tecs and Industry Training
Organisations to see whether they are working effectively, said: 'This
situation cannot persist. We are dealing with scarce resources.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / Turnover falls at third of law firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN a third of law firms in England and Wales have suffered a fall in
turnover in the past 12 months and almost half have seen profits fall,
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, said yesterday.
A survey of 900 law firms shows an increasing gap between those performing
well and those performing badly. Coopers warns that firms with poor
financial management are at risk of going to the wall.
The survey found that 35 per cent of firms reported a decrease in turnover
in the past 12 months with 12 per cent suffering a fall of more than 10 per
cent.
Overall, 26 per cent suffered a decline in profitability of more than 10 per
cent. Firms in central London and the south-east were worst hit, with 73 per
cent of London firms and 57 per cent in the south-east reporting lower
profits. Only 15 per cent of London firms have increased profits. The
largest number reporting growth were in the north-west and north-east.
Two-thirds of firms in the survey bill fees of Pounds 250,000 or less per
partner a year and about one quarter bill between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds
500,000.
Three in 10 firms have a ratio of profits to fees of less than 20 per cent
with 20 per cent having a ratio of profits to fees of more than 30 per cent.
Coopers says the wide range of profitability is largely due to the varying
levels of control exercised by partners over staff and property costs.
Staff costs range from 40 per cent to 50 per cent of fees while property
costs range from less than 10 per cent to more than 15 per cent of fees.
A firm's size was irrelevant to its success. Although larger firms continued
to grow at a faster rate this was not reflected in a greater proportion of
larger firms showing increased profits.
Almost 50 per cent of firms expect to employ more staff next year and 72 per
cent expect increased profits. Mr Brian Woods Scawen, a senior partner of
Coopers, said: 'We think the optimism expressed by many of these firms about
their short-term prospects may be misplaced.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / Pounds 93m of Polly Peck assets realised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International have realised assets of Pounds
93m since Mr Asil Nadir's conglomerate collapsed in October 1990, a report
circulating among creditors shows.
Further realisations are expected to come from future sales of businesses
and from recoveries through legal action launched against Mr Nadir and
others.
The report projects that PPI Holdings, parent to many of the group's
subsidiaries, had realisable assets at March 2 this year of Fl 683m (Pounds
247m), against liabilities of Fl 2.6bn.
The details emerged as Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary,
called on the government to explain why no charges had been brought against
Mr Nadir for failing to declare in the Polly Peck accounts donations of more
than Pounds 400,000 to the Conservative party.
Mr Cook asked Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in a
letter whether he accepted that there were 'prima facie grounds' for
proceedings on a breach of the Companies Act, whether the DTI still had the
Nadir case 'under active consideration' and why charges had not been
brought.
The question of the donations is likely to be raised at a meeting of the
Commons home affairs committee tomorrow when Sir Norman Fowler, the
Conservative party chairman, appears before it.
The report says that proceeds from litigation have so far exceeded Pounds
1m. Proceedings continue for Pounds 378m against Mr Nadir, and for more than
Pounds 73m against Citibank, which is arguing that the case should be heard
in Switzerland. There are also legal actions in Turkey to gain control of AN
Graphics, a Turkish printing company and to recover shares in the company
which are allegedly held by Mr Nadir. They were transferred to him from
Voyager, a Polly Peck subsidiary, four days before administrators were
appointed.
A writ against Mr Mentes Aziz, Mr Nadir's lawyer, is to be discontinued
following 'a recent agreement', and a case against Impexbank, based in
Turkey, has been dropped since a settlement in February.
The Central Bank of northern Cyprus, which fought and won in the Court of
Appeal an argument that it could not be sued in the English courts, is
seeking to recover losses from the administrators that it claims were
sustained while its assets were frozen between October 1991 and March 1992.
The administrators are seeking a court ruling on whether to launch action
against Holdings BV to determine ownership of a Dollars 400m loan for the
purchase of Del Monte.
Polly Peck will tomorrow be claiming Pounds 2m of the Pounds 3.5m in cash
security provided by Mr Nadir as bail money.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Councils use more private companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
PRIVATE COMPANIES have won 31.9 per cent of current local authority
contracts, worth almost Pounds 300m, a report published yesterday by the
Local Government Management Board shows.
The Institute of Public Finance, the research arm of the Chartered Institute
of Public Finance and Accountancy, said the figures showed that 'with each
new tranche of contracts that passes, private contractors appear to be
winning a greater share of the contracts'.
However, the management board, which is financed mainly by local
authorities, pointed out that 154 authorities had still awarded all their
current contracts to their own direct service organisations.
Mr John Sutcliffe of the management board added that DSOs' share of
contracts by value remained healthier at 83 per cent than their share by
number.
But he said: 'In labour-intensive, low technology work like cleaning and
maintenance, direct service organisations are slipping back quite a lot.
There's also a regional differentiation. DSOs are losing more ground in
London and the south-east than in other places.'
The report says that the success of private companies varied according to
sector. They took 48.5 per cent of building cleaning contracts, but only 9.4
per cent of catering for schools and welfare services.
Mr Tom McGuirk, manager of the Institute of Public Finance's competitive
tendering information service, confirmed that there was 'almost no
private-sector interest at all' in catering services.
Overall competition was healthy, with an average of 11.4 applications for
each contract, of which on average 5.8 were invited to tender and 2.9
tendered. More than 94 per cent of contracts were awarded to the lowest
tenderer.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Exports weaken in engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKENING DEMAND in continental Europe is holding back the engineering
industry, and the competitive advantage created by last year's sterling
devaluation is diminishing, the latest survey of company performance in the
west Midlands shows.
The survey was carried out by the Engineering Employers' Federation, which
surveyed 470 companies.
The proportion of companies reporting a rise in domestic orders rose to 46
per cent in May from 36 per cent in February, but fewer companies reported
an increase in export orders. In February 30 per cent of companies reported
an increase. This has now slipped to 27 per cent.
Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the regional federation, said:
'Recovery will be muted if major export markets are moving in the opposite
direction to our own.'
He said that the competitive position of engineering companies in Europe had
been enhanced by sterling's devaluation, relatively low labour costs and by
the growing readiness of German companies to seek supplies in lower-cost
markets.
But he noted that, on the basis of the federation's own studies and talks
with members, German companies were trying to reduce their costs by putting
pressure for price reductions on their suppliers. This inevitably led to
pressure on the margins of British exporters.
In spite of the problems in Europe, 48 per cent of west Midlands engineering
companies have growing order books, compared with 42 per cent in February.
This has been translated into a greater use of factory capacity.
For the first time since summer 1989 - except for a blip after the general
election last year - raw material stocks have shown net growth.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Small business hit by crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY HALF of all small businesses have been the victims of crime,
according to a survey published yesterday by the Forum of Private Business.
Of 2,670 companies surveyed 45 per cent had been affected by crime. Burglary
was the most common problem, affecting 45 per cent of the victims. It was
followed by vandalism (31 per cent), theft (27 per cent), vehicle crime (24
per cent), shoplifting (17 per cent), and fraud (11 per cent).
In a follow-up poll, 90 per cent of business owners called for greater
powers for the police and courts. The forum, which has nearly 21,000
members, has requested a meeting with the home secretary to discuss the
findings of its survey.
Finance firms were the most common targets for burglary, with 71 per cent of
those hit by crime suffering a burglary, followed by manufacturing and
wholesale (57 per cent). Construction and retail businesses suffered most
from vandalism, which affected 36 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.
Businesses employing fewer than four people were least affected by crime and
were most satisfied with the police. The smallest businesses suffered most
from shoplifting and fraud, while medium-sized firms were disproportionately
affected by vehicle-related crime, theft and vandalism.
Crime affected more businesses (59 per cent) in the north of England than in
any other region and satisfaction with the police was lowest.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Raw material prices remain steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATIONARY pressures at factories remained subdued last month as
sterling's relatively strong performance in May kept raw material prices
from rising.
Provisional figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed
that the prices of raw materials and fuel purchased by manufacturing
industry fell 0.3 per cent on a non-seasonally adjusted basis between April
and May. That compared with a 0.7 per cent decline the month before.
Seasonally adjusted figures showed a slight upward trend of 0.2 per cent
between April and May, however, after a 0.8 per cent decline the previous
month.
Compared with the previous year, input prices rose 7.3 per cent in May after
a year-on-year increase of 7.1 per cent in April. But last month's rate of
input-price inflation was lower than in March, when raw material prices were
8.4 per cent higher than the year before.
The latest data covering manufacturing industry's output prices showed a
similarly mixed pattern. The index for home sales of all manufactured
products rose 0.2 per cent on a non-seasonally adjusted basis between April
and May after a 0.6 per cent rise between March and April.
The increase in the index was 4 per cent in the 12 months to May, slightly
higher than April's 3.8 per cent rate of output-price inflation and the
highest rate of inflation in prices of goods at the factory gate since March
last year.
The output-price index for manufactured-goods sales, excluding food, drink
and tobacco, increased only 0.1 per cent, seasonally adjusted, between April
and May after an increase of 0.2 per cent between March and April. That
index, which is considered by many analysts to be a good measure of
underlying trends, rose 2.6 per cent in the 12 months to May compared with
2.7 per cent in the year to April and lows of 2.4 per cent at the end of
last year.
Yesterday's figures were broadly in line with City expectations and had
little impact on financial markets. The Treasury expressed general
satisfaction with the producer-price figures, although a spokesman said it
was important to maintain downward pressure on unit wage costs so that
output prices remained under control.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Tecs warned on links with other groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING AND Enterprise Councils must forge better working relationships
with other employer organisations if targets for improving the skills of the
workforce are to be met, Mrs Sheila Drew-Smith of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
management consultancy, said at a training conference yesterday.
She was presenting a study on relations between the 82 Tecs, which deliver
government training schemes in England and Wales, and the 126 Industry
Training Organisations, which are national bodies focusing on particular
sectors.
When the government set up Tecs more than four years ago it wanted them to
work closely with the 126 training organisations.
They have information, for example, on sectoral labour needs which the
government believed could provide a national perspective to Tecs, whose
prime responsibility is to respond to local labour markets.
The partnership has been patchy, however, with the organisation sometimes
complaining vigorously that Tecs have ignored them.
Mrs Drew-Smith said the study suggested that each set of organisations may
not have perceived the value of the other's role, or at worse viewed the
other as a potential threat.
Tecs had sometimes been seen by the training organisations as inexperienced
newcomers to the education and training field.
She said there was confusion about how they could collaborate to achieve
national targets for National Vocational Qualifications and Investors in
People, the government's main vehicle for improving the training of people
in work.
Mrs Drew-Smith, who has prepared a checklist for Tecs and Industry Training
Organisations to see whether they are working effectively, said: 'This
situation cannot persist. We are dealing with scarce resources.'
She suggested that the Department of Employment should invite Tecs to become
the 'lead Tec' for promoting the national targets for training in individual
sectors.
Mr Ian Johnson, director-general of the training directorate of the
employment department, said the time was right for a more mature
relationship between Tecs and the training organisations.
He urged them to work more closely on matters of common interest such as
influencing the government's policy on training issues.
Miss Judith Rutherford, chief executive of Aztec, a Tec in south-west
London, told the conference her Tec was working with 12 of the Industry
Training Organisations to persuade companies to work towards the national
NVQ targets.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Foden expands workforce by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FODEN, the Cheshire-based truckmaker owned by Paccar of the US, has
recruited 80 additional employees to cope with what it describes as sharply
rising demand for its vehicles in the UK.
The move, which increases Foden's workforce by 20 per cent to 480, provides
another tentative sign that the UK truck market is starting to recover from
its most severe recession since the second world war.
But Iveco-Ford, the UK market leader, remains pessimistic about the outlook
for the truck market this year. It said yesterday it expected 1993 sales of
all trucks to be virtually the same as last year's 32,000.
The company said: 'We do expect an upturn in the final quarter of this year,
but have absolutely no thoughts about expanding the workforce.'
Iveco-Ford said yesterday it had added three more dealer outlets to five
formerly contracted to rival Leyland Daf.
Mr Rod Heather, Foden's managing director, said yesterday that orders for
some types of vehicles it produces were up more than 40 per cent compared
with last year.
Foden, however, is a small supplier in the UK truck industry, now producing
about four trucks a day, although it has capacity to produce 10.
It is being cautious about its expansion, and the additional workers it has
hired have only temporary status. Permanent employment terms are expected to
be offered only if it becomes clear that the recovery can be sustained.
Most of the truck industry has continued to shed jobs since the UK
commercial vehicle market first plunged at the end of 1989.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Rover agrees joint deal to make MGs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER IS to re-enter the European sports car market with the launch of a
range of small MG sports cars in 1995.
It reached agreement yesterday on a joint production venture with Mayflower,
the specialist UK engineering company, which will invest in the MG
development programme and share the profits.
Code-named PR3, the new MG sports car is expected to be a mid-engined
roadster priced from about Pounds 15,000. Output is planned to reach 15,000
to 20,000 a year, and the range is expected to be sold in Japan.
The sports car will be powered at the top end of the range by Rover's
K-Series engine in a new 1.6-litre version, which is under development.
Rover, the vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, is seeking to resurrect
one of the world's best-known sports car marques more than a decade after MG
was killed off in 1980 by Sir Michael Edwardes, then British Leyland
chairman.
The new model is intended to return MG to the mainstream sports car market,
a segment dominated in recent years by Japanese manufacturers with products
such as the Mazda MX-5.
Rover has awarded the contract for the design, development and supply of the
sports car body shell to Mayflower's Coventry-based automotive engineering
subsidiary, Motor Panels. Mayflower is to invest up to Pounds 24.2m for the
initial engineering design, development and tooling work including the
necessary production facilities for the body shells.
It will produce the MG body panels and supply the welded bodies to Rover for
painting and final assembly.
The body shell production contract is expected to run for six years with a
sales value for Mayflower of about Pounds 20m a year.
Rover opened the way for the long-awaited revival of the MG marque last
autumn with the unveiling of the MG RV8, a redesigned and more powerful
variant of the MGB sports car, last produced in 1980.
The Pounds 26,500 MG RV8 was developed to mark the 30th anniversary of the
MGB, of which more than 500,000 were built. It is being produced at a
maximum volume of only 15 a week and was intended to resurrect the MG name
as a precursor to the resumption of volume sports car production with the
PR3 project.
In less than four years Rover has renewed most of its product range. This
started with the launch of the 200/400 series, the Land Rover Discovery and
a re-engineered Metro in 1989 and 1990, followed by a revamped Rover 800 in
1991 and the recent launch of the Rover 600 large family car.
Rover and Mayflower would not comment yesterday. Rover said: 'We do not
discuss future products or detailed commercial negotiations.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / Opposition to ITV rules change dwindles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDEPENDENT television industry's resistance to relaxing the rules on
takeovers began to weaken yesterday as the four biggest companies were
joined by others supporting change.
By the end of a 90-minute meeting with Mr Peter Brooke, the national
heritage secretary, companies controlling more than 70 per cent of ITV
advertising revenue had made it clear they were prepared to accept takeovers
among the nine largest companies.
Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Television, holders of the London
weekday licence and the largest ITV franchise holder, said after the
meeting: 'The majority view - by my calculation a minimum of 70 per cent of
ITV - stated that there was a need for change and the secretary of state
certainly heard this loud and clear.'
Mr Green added: 'The minority are looking for protectionism which is always
a short-term answer.'
The main case for change was put by the four largest companies, Carlton
Television, Central, London Weekend, and Granada Television. They were later
joined by Mr Clive Leach of Yorkshire TV and Mr Bill Brown, chairman of
Scottish Television, although both made qualifications.
Yorkshire TV and Scottish TV would have preferred an extension of the
moratorium on takeovers of ITV companies which runs out at the end of this
year. Mr Brooke made clear that a moratorium extension was unlikely. The
main reason he gave was the pressure on parliamentary time.
Mr Leach was reported to have told the meeting he would accept non-hostile
takeovers if there was no extension of the moratorium.
Mr Brown of Scottish TV said his company would accept takeovers among the
nine as long as a minimum of four separate ITV companies survived.
The need for immediate change in ownership rules was opposed by Anglia, HTV
and Meridian Broadcasting.
Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman of HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west
of England, told Mr Brooke he would rather his company was controlled from
Europe or the US than Birmingham. Outside ownership would mean greater local
control of regional programming.
Sir Peter Gibbings, chairman of Anglia, last night conceded that there were
many in favour of change, but only after a moratorium extension had been
ruled out.
Mr Brooke said he would reflect on all the proposals put to him but did not
give a timetable for any decision.
If there is to be a change in the ownership rules it would have to come this
autumn. From January 1, European Community companies will be able to take
over ITV companies subject to the approval of the Independent Television
Commission.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Lonrho legal move refused
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOVE by Lonrho to cross-examine the three Fayed brothers over the source
of the funding for the Pounds 583m takeover of the Harrods stores group in
1985 was refused yesterday by the Court of Appeal.
Three judges allowed an appeal by the Fayeds, owners of the House of Fraser
group.
Lonrho still has pending an action against the Fayeds claiming damages for
alleged conspiracy and wrongful interference with Lonrho over the Harrods
takeover.
Lonrho claims the Fayeds lied by pretending they were wealthy and successful
businessmen from an established Egyptian family and had enough free wealth
to fund the takeover themselves.
It claims that if the truth were known - that the Fayeds were from 'very
humble origins' and that the funds for the takeover came from another
source, possibly the Sultan of Brunei - their bid would have been blocked,
leaving Lonrho free to make its own offer for Harrods.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Union challenge to pay ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit faced its first big
challenge yesterday after it was rejected by leaders of 500,000 white-collar
local government workers.
Their decision was fuelled by fears of the ceiling being extended to next
year.
Delegates at the Brighton conference of Nalgo, the public service union,
called on the union to campaign against the pay ceiling and threatened a
strike ballot over the issue. They overturned a recommendation from their
leaders who had 'reluctantly' asked for the ceiling to be accepted.
The 1.5 per cent offer will be put to a ballot, with a second ballot on
industrial action threatened if workers vote to reject the offer.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Security offshoots in copyright row
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEGAL ROW over copyright has broken out between Era Security Products, a
subsidiary of industrial group Laird, and two security subsidiaries of
Williams Holdings.
A writ was issued in the High Court yesterday seeking an injunction against
the two Williams companies, Polycell Products and Yale Security Products. A
hearing is set for Friday.
Era claims that eight products marketed by the Williams subsidiaries,
including door and window locks, infringe Era's copyright. Era is seeking an
injunction against infringement, as well as an inquiry as to damages and
costs.
Mr Martin Emm, managing director of Era, said his company had supplied
products to Polycell for several years until the arrangement was terminated
in May at Polycell's request. He alleged that some of Polycell's new range
of products were being produced in the Far East and were 'amazingly close'
in design to Era's.
Mr Mike Davies, operations director at Williams, said: 'We have responded
through our lawyers saying we are not aware of any infringement but will
look at the evidence to see if we are infringing their copyright. If we are
infringing it, we would make a voluntary undertaking to withdraw the
products.'
He said the products concerned constituted a small number of Polycell's
overall range, and revenue involved was limited.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Business failure rate 'static'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of business failures was the same in the first quarter of this
year as in the final months of last year, figures released yesterday by
trade credit insurer Trade Indemnity show, Andrew Jack writes.
Failures and bad debts notified to the company were 1,767 in the three
months to March, down 15 per cent from the first quarter of last year.
The figures support other recent statistics suggesting that the worst of the
recession may be over, or that banks are holding back from appointing
receivers.
The company said late payment and bad debt continued to be damaging and
their extent was underestimated by many companies.
Year-on-year, business failures declined in all regions of the UK except
Scotland and northern and north-western England.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Nissan UK chief 'part of breathtaking fraud'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGING director of Nissan UK, the former importer and distributor of
the Japanese cars, was part of a fraud of 'breathtaking proportions', a jury
was told yesterday.
It was clear on 'overwhelming evidence' that Mr Michael Hunt swindled the
Inland Revenue out of nearly Pounds 100m over a 17-year period, Mr Peter
Rook QC, summing up for the prosecution, told Southwark Crown Court sitting
at Chichester Rents in central London.
He said it was a fraud carried out against the Revenue involving unpaid
corporation tax and not, as the defence had claimed, a swindle perpetrated
abroad by others against Japanese tax authorities.
Mr Hunt, of Hove, East Sussex, denies two counts of conspiracy to cheat and
two charges of conspiracy to make use of false accounting documents between
October 1975 and December 1991. He has not given or called any evidence.
When the case opened nearly two months ago Mr Rook, for the Serious Fraud
Office, told the jury the fraud involved the secret syphoning off of Pounds
219m from the company's profits.
He claimed that Mr Hunt, with other 'sophisticated fraudsters', including
Swiss bankers, laundered a huge amount through Geneva bank accounts,
covering their tracks with a 'morass of false documentation' as well as sham
shipping agents in Holland and Norway. Mr Rook said the 'prime mover' behind
the swindle was Mr Octav Botnar, the former head of Nissan UK, who is
believed to be in Switzerland. A warrant has been issued for his arrest.
Recalling weeks of evidence from prosecution witnesses flown in from around
the world, Mr Rook said: 'You have been listening to an extraordinary story
. . . a story of a massive fraud perpetrated over many years, a fraud
perpetrated on the UK Revenue who were cheated of more than Pounds 97m of
corporation tax, and that is without looking at the interest.'
He said that bearing in mind some of the figures dated back to 1976 and
1977, the fraud, involving allegedly inflated freight charges, was of
'breath-taking proportions'.
Mr Rook recalled that in the opening speech for the defence, Mr Michael
Sherrard QC, for Mr Hunt, had told the court there was a 'significant,
serious and credible alternative' to the prosecution's claims - a fraud
against the Japanese tax authorities.
'If that were the case then for all those years, 1976 right through to 1991,
Mr Botnar and Mr Hunt would have been innocent dupes,' said Mr Rook.
While jurors had to give that possibility serious consideration, they might
think the defence had tried to give 'sinister connotations' to any piece of
evidence relating to the Japanese.
The trial was adjourned until today.

A PAYPHONE for people with speech or hearing defects is being tested by
British Telecommunications at six sites in the UK including Heathrow
Airport, Kings Cross station in London and a college for the deaf in
Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Alan Cane writes.
The company said if the trial proved successful it would install the
payphones in sites such as shopping centres and bus and rail stations.
Operated by a BT phonecard, a drawer in the base of the device opens to
reveal a keyboard and two-line screen.
Messages can be sent either to a textphone, BT's existing screen and
keyboard-based system for private subscribers, or to a human operator who
will relay the message to a recipient with normal hearing.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Farmers intend to sue Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON APSION, an Oxfordshire barrister who specialises in agricultural
issues, is heading a new legal challenge to the Lloyd's insurance market on
behalf of more than a dozen small farmers who claim they could lose their
livelihoods as a result of their losses as Names.
Like more than 2,000 other Names, they are suing their agents. But Mr Apsion
also intends to sue the council of Lloyd's, the market's governing body, and
the corporation of Lloyd's, which administers the market. He says Lloyd's
'ought to have been aware about the malpractices in the operation of the
market'.
Mr Apsion expects more farmers to join his action. An article about the
farmers' plight in Farming News, a trade publication with 90,000 readers,
'generated more reader response than any other individual story for several
years,' said Mr Richard Saunders, the news editor of Farming News.
Many of the more than 30 calls have come from farmers, who have used their
land as security for the bank guarantees presented to Lloyd's as security.
Mr Apsion has referred farmers to Hancocks, a commercial law firm.
Under the 1982 Lloyd's Act, Lloyd's is immune from paying damages from a
civil suit unless it can be shown as acting in bad faith.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LI PENG, China's prime minister, yesterday made his first public
appearance in seven weeks and struck an active pose in an apparent attempt
to counter speculation that a lingering illness had left him politically
weakened.
But western officials and Chinese observers said it was too soon to judge
whether Mr Li would be able to resume a full workload. Mr Li, who had last
been sighted in public in late April, received Dr Mahathir Mohammed, the
visiting Malaysian prime minister, at a ceremonial welcome yesterday in the
Great Hall of the People, before adjourning for talks.
He showed no obvious sign of recent serious illness but, according to
reporters present, he stiffened without responding directly when Dr
Mahathir, a medical practitioner, enquired about his health during
pleasantries that preceded their talks.
Chinese officials had initially explained Mr Li's disappearance from public
view by saying that he was suffering from a bad cold. But reports have
circulated widely that he suffered at least one, and possibly two, heart
attacks.
Mr Li, accompanied by his wife Mrs Zhu Lin, walked fairly briskly as he
escorted Dr Mahathir. He also posed smilingly for photographers, as if to
reinforce the point that he had recovered.
Later, he conducted 80 minutes of formal talks with the Malaysian leader, in
which the two shared similar views on human rights. 'For a developing
nation, human rights are in the first place the rights to independence,
existence and development,' Mr Li was quoted as saying.
Dr Mahathir is said to have replied: 'Foreign forces always seek to impose
their social systems and concepts of values upon us, so as to disrupt our
countries and control us.'
A western official said that some weeks would have to pass before it was
clear whether Mr Li could fully resume his responsibilities. 'If he has had
a heart attack, even a mild one, he should avoid stress and long working
hours,' she said. 'If he is only able to manage one or two meetings a week,
it is unlikely he would be able to continue as premier for very long.'
Mr Wu Jianmin, foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters that Mr Li's
recovery was 'very good' and that he was resuming all his duties. 'As
Premier Li Peng is getting better and better with his health, he will
certainly have more diplomatic duties to perform,' Mr Wu said.
Mr Li's illness became public on April 26, when he suddenly cancelled a
meeting with Philippine President Fidel Ramos. He was subsequently obliged
to postpone a five-nation tour of central Asia.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Pakistani force in Somalia backed by Security Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations yesterday sprang to the defence of Pakistani troops under
its command in Somalia, after the killing of civilians in a bloody encounter
at the weekend.
In a statement last night, the UN Security Council said it strongly endorsed
the Pakistanis' actions. It accused General Mohamed Farah Aideed, the local
warlord, of using women and children as human shields to screen attacks on
UN forces.
In unequivocal backing for the Pakistanis, the 15-nation body said they
acted towards the demonstrators in Mogadishu 'in accordance with UN Security
Council resolutions.'
The statement, issued by Mr Kuan Antonio Yanez-Barnuevo of Spain, the
current Security Council president, stressed that the primary objective of
the UN force in Somalia was 'to put an end to the plight of the Somali
people'. But restoration of law and order was essential if it was to deliver
humanitarian aid and help rebuild the country, ravaged by war and famine.
While the council expressed regret at the civilian deaths, it said
preliminary reports indicated Gen Aideed used 'human shields' as a tactic.
It also appeared that shots were fired from the crowd at UN soldiers.
The deaths, which have further angered Somalis, came as a crowd was
protesting at US air raids against targets of Gen Aideed's forces.
A UN report earlier yesterday charged that Somali gunmen had fired on the
unarmed demonstrators as well as attacking the UN soldiers. It described the
confrontation as a 'staged incident'.
Mr Joe Sills, the UN spokesman, said that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the
secretary general, had repeatedly but in vain tried to persuade the US to
disarm the Somali factions after US troops entered the country in December.
'Everybody would have been much better off if it had been done sooner,' he
said. The UN force that replaced the Americans last month has made disarming
warlords and their followers a high priority.
Mr Kofi Annan, head of UN peacekeeping operations, said the Pakistani
soldiers, who lost 23 of their colleagues in a Somali ambush 10 days ago,
had behaved 'professionally'. But if there were any evidence of wrongdoing
those responsible would be disciplined.
Mr Sills said a 'routine' investigation was under way.

FT  15 JUN 93 / UN human rights row: Dalai Lama refused entry to Vienna
conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM IN VIENNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations World Conference on Human Rights, the first in 25 years,
opened in Vienna yesterday amid controversy and strong criticisms from
independent human rights organisations which denounced the organisers'
decision not to allow the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader and
campaigner for human rights, to attend the opening ceremony.
The Dalai Lama unwittingly became the symbol of what many non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) regard as the double standards set by the UN and member
states when it comes to human rights issues.
The Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace prizewinner, was barred from attending the
ceremony following objections to his presence from China. The decision
brought an outcry and caused a boycott of the opening ceremony by 14 Nobel
Peace prize laureates.
Mr Pierre Sane, secretary general of Amnesty International, said: 'Is this
the message the UN World Conference wants to send to the world this morning?
Is this what is meant by a commitment to human rights - that a man of peace
like thr Dalai Lama is forbidden entry? We are appalled by this decision.'
The row symbolised the enduring and at times bitter debate between advocates
of the 'universality' of human rights - represented primarily by the
developed countries of the north - and many developing countries which
prefer to stress economic development and cultural differences, and who see
the strictures of the north as badly disguised interference and imperialism.
More than 100 countries are represented in Vienna.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, in his opening speech
tried to steer a middle road but he could not avoid the debate over
'interference'.
He suggested the international community had a duty to act against states
that flouted human rights and abused their people.

<TEXT>
JORDAN is on the verge of a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 650m) debt rescheduling
agreement with the London Club of commercial creditors which is said to give
among the best terms ever obtained by a Third World debtor country.
After many rounds of tough negotiations, the London Club has offered a draft
agreement which will give direct and indirect relief of around 58 per cent
of the kingdom's gross debts to the banks.
The formula presents the commercial creditors the option of either 35 per
cent discounted bonds, or par bonds, both payable after 30 years and with
low interest rates. Jordan has stipulated that creditors must opt for at
least 35 per cent of the debt to be covered by discounted bonds.
The London Club had been wary of setting a precedent which other debtor
countries would then request. But Jordan, which boasts an impressive
economic record since its IMF adjustment programme began in the autumn of
1991, was supported in its hard bargaining by the IMF. It will now replace
Argentina as the Club's most favoured Third World debtor.
Mr Sami Qammo, the kingdom's new finance minister, is due to go to London at
the end of June to finalise the agreement.
Despite the kingdom's overall success with the adjustment programme so far,
the London Club's offer comes at a time when Jordan is facing increasing
difficulties in implementing certain IMF strictures.
The government had been expected to introduce a controversial sales tax
before debt rescheduling took place. But faced with fierce opposition,
especially from the private sector, the idea was dropped.
Instead Mr Qammo last week announced amendments to the kingdom's old
consumption tax which he described as 'a compromise with the IMF'. Fuel and
electricity price increases have also been announced recently.
Jordan's total external debts are around Dollars 6.5bn, or 140 per cent of
gross domestic product. The Paris Club of creditor governments and lending
agencies is due Dollars 4.5bn. The rest is owed to Russia, former East bloc
states, Arab lending groups and the London Club.
A Paris Club meeting is scheduled for July 1993 and western diplomats in
Amman express confidence that further debt rescheduling will be agreed to.
'Most western countries are sympathetic towards Jordan and appreciate its
moderate political stand. I think they want to help,' says one diplomat.

THE PAKISTANI government last night unveiled the country's annual budget
which avoided some unpopular measures that businessmen had expected, though
it sought to widen the tax net.
Prices of petroleum products were increased by 10 per cent but costs of gas
and electricity remained unchanged. Petrol may rise further depending on the
the exchange rate of the Pakistani rupee against the dollar.
Sales tax was increased by 2.5 percentage points to 15 per cent. Mr Sartaj
Aziz, in his budget speech before the parliament, also announced a 2 per
cent duty surcharge on the cost of new commercial buildings in large urban
areas.
No tax was introduced on agricultural income. Pakistanis are exempt from
paying direct income tax on agriculture, a subject of criticism from foreign
donors. In recent days, many officials expected some form of tax, even in a
limited form, in response to those concerns.
The budget has come at a time of political uncertainty. Mr Aziz appealed to
the opposition to join in a bipartisan consensus on economic policies as a
way to encourage foreign invest-ors.
Many businessmen have recently expressed concern over a chronic budget
deficit which has repeatedly been responsible for Pakistan missing its
economic targets.

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GULF between the Israeli government and Palestinian peace negotiators
appeared as wide as ever yesterday on the eve of the resumption of the
Arab-Israeli peace talks in Washington today.
In the run-up to the tenth round of talks both the Palestinians and the
Israelis have played down expectations of a breakthrough on a joint
statement of principles on interim Palestinian self-rule.
The Palestinian delegation, led by Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, is said to be
deeply unhappy about the failure of US officials sponsoring the talks to
provide concrete answers to a series of questions defining the extent of
Palestinian autonomy to be granted over the occupied territories during an
interim period.
The Palestinian delegation has been in Washington since last week pressing
the US State Department to clarify its position on questions central to the
peace talks. Among issues presented by the Palestinians are whether the US
views the territories as 'disputed' or 'occupied', how East Jerusalem would
be governed during the interim and how Washington sees the linkage between
an interim solution and a permanent settlement.
The Palestinians said they failed to receive clear answers from the US
administration and yesterday it was unclear whether Mr Abdel-Shafi would
attend this morning's session or merely send a symbolic delegation.
In Jerusalem Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said that he expected
no breakthrough in Washington but he said he believed that Israel and some
of the Arab states had passed the point of no return in the negotiations.
'We are not ready for gestures. The period of confidence-building measures
is over,' Mr Rabin reportedly told a parliamentary committee yesterday.
Without any progress on the Palestinian track, negotiations between
Jerusalem and its Arab neighbours Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon are unlikely to
make any headway in Washington.
King Hussein of Jordan, who is due to meet President Bill Clinton on Friday,
last week ruled out the possibility of signing any bilateral agreement until
there is progress in Palestinian-Israeli talks.
Palestinian and Arab delegates are pressing the US to take a more
interventionist role to force concessions on the parties and ensure some
progress is made before the tenth round ends in three weeks.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party yesterday conceded that
they cannot reach agreement on reform of the scandal-tainted political
system, prompting one faction boss to call for a new reform coalition which
would group LDP and opposition politicians.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, head of the LDP's Hata faction, said the apparent failure
of the reform push had forced him to gather a group of pro-reformers from
the government and opposition, which he suggested could ultimately become
the base for a new political party.
If Mr Hata is successful in convincing members of other LDP factions to
defect on this issue, the government could be defeated in an
opposition-sponsored no-confidence motion in parliament and be forced to
extend the present sitting beyond this week or even to call an election.
'Over the next day or two, I will be gathering people from different LDP
factions who have the same desire for reform,' Mr Hata said. 'There is a
possibility in the longer-term that it could be a new party, but we will
have to see what develops.'
Mr Hata's move came as Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, the LDP's secretary general,
said he had been unable to get agreement from LDP parliamentarians on
political reforms including a redrawing of electoral boundaries and tougher
controls on political funding.
Many LDP members are opposed to reforms, which would replace the present
system of multi-seat constituencies with a single-seat system or
proportional representation or a mix of both. The new format would threaten
the LDP's traditional system of factional patronage, as, in tandem with
funding laws, the cost of politics would be cut.
But the problem for Mr Hata and other self-proclaimed reformers is that the
Social Democratic party of Japan, the largest opposition party, has also yet
to agree on the details of political reform, which is likely to be opposed
by members who benefit from the present system.
'We will have to see which politicians are really in favour of reform, and
those who are just saying nice things,' Mr Hata said. 'Reform will help to
nurture real political parties, and it will help Japan to develop a more
independent foreign policy and to take diplomatic initiatives.'
Japanese MPs yesterday declared their personal assets, which were an average
Y132.2m (Pounds 796,300) for members of the LDP, and a more modest Y43.5m
for opposition MPs - the average total for Japanese is Y21.1m.
The totals made public were probably far below the actual figures, as
property and stock prices were calculated at book value, not market value,
and the total does not include the assets of other family members. Many
politicians are believed to have transferred assets to their spouse or
children to avoid declaring an embarrassingly large total.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian leader, celebrated the opening of the
elected assembly yesterday by announcing a new era of liberal democracy and
free enterprise and calling for a solid ceasefire between the country's
warring factions.
The 120-member assembly, chosen in last month's UN-organised election, is
obliged to draw up a new constitution and form a government within three
months under an international peace plan agreed in Paris in 1991.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, urged
the elected representatives to 'bury the hatchet of yesterday' and said he
was proud to have led the UN's most ambitious undertaking to date. Untac's
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) mission is supposed to end with the formation of
a new government.
'Your presence here is a clear affirmation of democracy in Cambodia and of
the unmistakeable will of the people to become the masters of their own
country,' Mr Akashi said, holding out the promise of support from foreign
donors and investors if stability returns to Cambodia.
Mr Akashi and his staff are likely to face a difficult three months dealing
with the unpredictable Prince Sihanouk and with an incumbent communist
administration unwilling to yield power to Funcinpec, the royalist
opposition party which won the most seats in the election.
Several leaders of the ruling communist Cambodian People's party have
established an 'autonomous zone' along the Vietnamese border, terrorising
Funcinpec supporters and driving out UN civilian workers at gunpoint; Khmer
Rouge guerrillas opposed to the CPP have their own zone on the Thai border
in the west.
After entering the assembly under a golden umbrella, the 70-year-old Prince
Sihanouk told its members that the Cambodian people wanted a united and
peaceful country and a better standard of living.
He condemned deforestation and the theft of archaeological treasures from
the ruins of Angkor in the north, and suggested a return to the 'prosperous
agriculture of the 1950s and 1960s' - the time when he was in power.
One of the assembly's first acts yesterday was to mollify the prince by
declaring the coup d'etat against him by Gen Lon Nol in 1970 to be null and
void, and by reaffirming him as head of state 'so that he can effectively
save our country and allow Cambodia once more to know progress and
prosperity, as in the days of the Sangkum Reastr Niyum'.
Untac officials said the decision was of doubtful legal force - since the
assembly has yet to pass a constitution - and did not necessarily bode well
for democracy; the Sangkum, or 'People's Socialist Community', was a
national movement founded by Prince Sihanouk with the purpose of
obliterating other political parties, and won its first election with the
help of intimidation and vote-rigging in 1955.
Cambodian rice yields and per capita income, furthermore, were among the
lowest in south-east Asia in the 1960s.

MR Harshad Mehta, the flamboyant stockbroker at the centre of India's

He would thus gain immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying
about a Rs10m (Pounds 210,000) political payoff, said Mr Ram Jethmalani, his
lawyer.
Mr Mehta, 38, has been charged with bribery, fraud and currency violations
in the scandal, which was exposed in April 1992. He is one of several
brokers and bankers accused of involvement in the scandal, in which money is
alleged to have been siphoned from the interbank securities market to help
pump up prices on the then booming Bombay stock exchange.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Japan 'to hold interest rates' as yen rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN will not adjust interest rates to stem the yen's continued rise
against the dollar, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor, said
yesterday after the dollar fell to an all-time low of Y105.20 at the close
of trading in Tokyo.
Mr Mieno's remarks at his regular press conference are likely to fuel a
further rise in the yen over the next few days, say Tokyo foreign exchange
dealers. The dollar fell by Y1.12 in Tokyo yesterday.
Many Tokyo dealers believe the dollar will continue to slide against the yen
until the US authorities intervene to support the dollar to prevent US
import prices and inflation from rising.
The yen's rise is being fuelled by several factors, chiefly the rising
Japanese trade surplus. US-Japanese government talks over the weekend in
Washington failed to agree a framework for cutting the surplus.
Mr Mieno's rejection of a change in monetary policy is part of a subtle
shift in Tokyo's approach to the yen's rise, which may senior officials
privately acknowledge is heading for Y100 to the dollar.
In late April, when the dollar fell sharply from about Y115 to about Y110,
the Bank of Japan joined a fierce attack on the Clinton administration for
allegedly encouraging the yen to rise. Business leaders and politicians
warned that the yen's appreciation could choke off the recovery of the
Japanese economy.
In contrast the yen's most recent rise to about Y105 has not been
accompanied by criticism of the US. The government's claim that
international co-ordination to stabilise exchange rates, which Tokyo says
was agreed at an April meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers, is
looking increasingly tattered.
Instead Tokyo policy makers now acknowledge that the dollar will probably
stop falling only when Washington decides to support the US currency.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, warned US inflation would soon start rising, threatening a rise in
US interest rates, if the dollar fall continues.
The change of tone is not simply a reflection of the Japanese authorities'
powerlessness in preventing the yen's rise. It also reflects a reassessment
of the impact upon the economy.
The Bank of Japan believes that in the short term the yen's appreciation
could stifle the incipient recovery in the Japanese economy. However it
believes in the long run the Japanese economy may benefit as manufacturing
companies will become more efficient to cope with the yen's rise.
Mr Mieno emphasised yesterday he would take into account both the positive
and negative effects of the yen's rise in deciding the bank's policy.
Equally significant were comments by Mr Sieroku Kajiyama, secretary general
of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, that a stronger yen could be
tolerated in the long run.
Mr Mieno said it was still too early to say that the Japanese economy was
bottoming out as signs of recovery were too weak. The question of whether
the economy has hit the bottom of the cycle has sharply divided economic
ministers over the past week.

look at the annual report of the Bank for International Settlements
</HEADLINE>

   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE shake-out in employment in financial services in the UK has been much
greater than in any other comparable country, underlining how the recession
has hit what was once regarded as a high-growth industry.
The BIS report says employment in financial services in the UK dropped by
10.7 per cent between 1989 and last year. Employment in this field in the US
fell over the same period by 0.4 per cent, while in France it grew 0.6 per
cent.
The study says the falls in numbers working in this area of industry 'can be
attributed to automation and excess capacity' in the financial sector.
Another aspect was the high growth in employment in this field in many
countries, including Britain, during the economic upswing in the 1980s.
In 1990, the financial services industry in Britain employed 2.8m people, or
roughly one eighth of the total workforce and nearly double the comparable
number in 1979.
During the 1980s, employment in this field grew with particular rapidity in
insurance, property-related services and banking.
The reduction in numbers employed in this sector in Britain since 1989
compares with the 3.9 per cent gain in employment in the Japanese financial
services industry over the same period.

FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: Europe urged to re-peg currencies to the
D-Mark  - A look at the annual report of the Bank for International
Settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE must re-peg its currencies to the D-Mark to head off growing
protectionist pressures, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the
Bank for International Settlements, said yesterday.
Speaking after the bank's annual meeting, Mr Lamfalussy said the present
arrangement, in which Britain and Italy were no longer in the European
exchange rate mechanism and the currencies of Sweden, Finland and Norway
were floating, was 'not sustainable in the longer term'.
In linking the ERM turbulence of the past year with trade, Mr Lamfalussy was
underlining how some nations in the ERM - notably France - believed
devaluation of the pound and lira enabled the UK and Italy to boost growth
at the expense of other European nations by helping export competitiveness.
Mr Lamfalussy said devaluation of several European currencies in the past
year could 'cause problems' among their trading partners. 'If someone could
prove to me that floating currencies are compatible with relatively stable
real exchange rates then my argument wouldn't hold - but in the past this
hasn't happened,' he said.
The report's downbeat tone was backed by comments yesterday by Mr Bengt
Dennis, BIS chairman and president of the Swedish central bank. Mr Dennis
said ERM turbulence last year had 'undoubtedly contributed to erosion of
business and consumer confidence' in Europe and said 'especially worrisome'
was the deepening German recession.
On future exchange rate management in Europe, he said changes in information
technology and the culture of private currency investors made the task of
goverments seeking stable long-term relationships between currencies
'clearly more difficult.'

FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: Economic recovery 'held back by a lack of
co-ordination'  - A look at the annual report of the Bank for International
Settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC recovery in the industrial world may be held back by a lack of
international co-ordination of economic policy and a reluctance to use
fiscal measures to boost demand because of worries about growing public
deficits, the Bank for International Settlements warned yesterday.
In its annual report, the bank also says inflation targeting may not succeed
in providing stable economic policies in those countries such as the UK
which have stopped linking their exchange rates to the D-Mark.
The BIS puts much of the blame for last year's crisis in the European
exchange rate mechanism on the lack of willingness by governments to
consider 'preventative parity adjustments' in exchange rates prior to the
emergence of severe market strains.
It concludes that 'adjustments ultimately had to be made in conditions of
crisis, precipitately, triggering speculative attacks even in cases (of
specific currencies) where the fundamentals were sound'.
With special reference to Britain which, having left the ERM, has introduced
a target of keeping underlying inflation to less than 4 per cent, the report
says 'it is questionable' whether such targets can succeed in helping to
bring about stable economic policy.
'Given the lags with which monetary policy has an impact on inflation, the
effectiveness of policy in meeting inflation objectives can be judged only
after a long delay.'
It warns that the credibility of such targets may 'take time to establish in
countries which have changed the framework of policy several times in recent
years and adopted inflation targets only after a substantial depreciation of
their currencies'.
In generally gloomy comments about the outlook, the BIS - owned by 32
central banks from the developed world and former communist countries in
eastern Europe - says easing in monetary policy in several countries has so
far had little effect in stimulating economic activity.
While a return to growth seems likely in the US and the UK, prospects for
continental Europe look poor 'with industrial production declining, gross
domestic product at best stagnating and unemployment and budget deficits
rising'.
Also lack of progress in international trade talks means 'the potential for
conflict is enormous' in the area of protectionist measures.
However, more hopeful news comes from relatively good growth in some
developing countries, especially in south-east Asia, the general absence of
marked inflationary pressures in much of the developed world, and good
productivity growth in some countries.

FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: Portfolio flows across borders stay at
high level  - A look at the annual report of the Bank for International
Settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROSS-BORDER financial transfers fell back slightly last year but remained
at high levels.
Flows of portfolio capital, covering such areas as bonds, equities and other
securities, came to Dollars 238bn from Dollars 274bn in 1991 and Dollars
152.8bn the year before, according to the BIS report.
In many countries, portfolio capital transfers are now much higher than
flows of money caused by payments of physical goods.
This underlines how different countries' capital accounts are more important
than their trade accounts in determining the value of international
currencies.
Investment by the UK and Japan, who were the biggest players in 1991,
declined, while US investment increased somewhat and continental European
investment rose sharply, with German investment setting a new record of
Dollars 43bn (Pounds 28bn).
Inflows into Japan 'all but evaporated', partly because of low long-term
interest rates, while flows into Germany were high, partly due to the high
level of the D-Mark.
Investments in capital into continental Europe now account for more than
half of the transfers of this sort in the industrial world. US portfolio
investment came to Dollars 48.6bn last year, up from Dollars 45bn the year
before, while the EC, excluding the UK, accounted for transfers of Dollars
92.3bn, up from Dollars 69.2bn.

report, Sweden and Norway saw falls in employment in this area of 2.3 per
cent and 0.7 per cent. The analysis fails to give comparable figures for
Germany, where the financial services industry in recent years has seen
modest growth as part of general increases in employment in
non-manufacturing areas.

FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: Income inequalities of rich and poor
widen  - A look at the annual report of the Bank for International
Settlements

<TEXT>
PEOPLE in south-east Asia are catching up rapidly with the western world in
terms of income, while those in Africa and Latin America are falling further
behind, according to the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) annual
report.
While the average person in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong
Kong experienced income growth of up to about 7 per cent during the 1980s,
incomes in Latin America and Africa fell during the decade, due to economic
stagnation and rapidly rising populations.
Illustrating the widening differences between the poorest and richest
nations, the study says the poorest 20 per cent of the global population in
1960 received only 5 per cent of the world's income.
By 1990, this fraction had fallen still further - to 3.4 per cent. Over the
same period, and excluding China where strong economic development in the
1980s has greatly eased poverty, the richest 20 per cent of the world's
people saw their share of total incomes increase from 58.3 per cent to 64.6
per cent.
The study points out that better schools, curbs on population growth and
factory investment to boost exports are all keys to increasing the wealth of
the earth's poorest nations.
It says the experiences of the past 30 years, in which rich nations have
increased their lead over the world's economic also-rans, 'cast doubt on the
widely held assumption that poor countries will generally gain, relative to
more advanced countries, due to the spill-over of technology and capital
inflows'.
Between 1960 and 1990, the fifth of the world's population which lives in
China increased its share of world incomes from 7.3 per cent to 11.5 per
cent.
Economic advance in China was particularly substantial during the 1980s,
when the income of the average person increased 6.9 per cent a year. Over
the same period, incomes in the rapidly industrialising bloc of South Korea,
Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong expanded by 5.6 per cent a year.
However, during the 1980s, per capita incomes in Latin America and Africa
fell by 0.8 per cent and 0.3 per cent a year respectively.
This was despite good progress in both these regions during the 1960s and
1970s, when the comparable figures had been between 2 per cent and 3.1 per
cent.
In 1990, the average citizen in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong
received an income only 17 per cent below the average in the rich
industrialised world - this is substantially better than in 1960, when
incomes were 69 per cent less than in the west.
However, progress in this respect was markedly different in Latin America
and Asia, where in 1990 incomes were roughly one-third and one-tenth
respectively of the equivalent figures in the developed world.
Thirty years earlier, the corresponding fractions had been significantly
higher, at 41 per cent and 17 per cent respectively.

FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: Japanese banks 'short on details'  - A
look at the annual report of the Bank for International Settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH

<TEXT>
UNCOVERING details about loan problems in Japan is made more difficult by
limited statistics provided by Japanese banks on borrowers which run into
difficulties, the BIS report says.
In a section on financial distress in the banking system, it says loan
losses in companies or banks 'can have serious implications' for economies,
even though these are often difficult to assess.
The report says an important question is the extent to which information
known to banking authorities about banks' balance-sheets is publicly
disclosed - an area where standards differ markedly between different
countries.
The BIS says: 'The limited statistics on non-performing loans make it
particularly difficult to assess asset quality in the case of Japanese
banks.'
The BIS emphasises that in the case of 21 big Japanese banks the information
of this kind covers only loans of a specific period. Loans granted which
fail to meet the criteria for reporting suggest that in Japan 'the actual
scale of problem loans is likely to be larger' than would appear from an
examination of publicly available documents.
The report says banking authorities should identify problem loans early and
take quick action to tackle them.

FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: Warning for central bankers  - A look at
the annual report of the Bank for International Settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's central banks will have to improve their strategies for exchange
rate management if they are to avoid further spells of currency turbulence,
according to Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the BIS's general manager.
Writing in the annual report, Mr Lamfalussy says monetary authorities in
industrial countries need to back up efforts to manage currencies by buying
and selling them with interest rate changes.
However, such exercises can only work if they do not run foul of sentiment
on the world's financial markets, which have increasing powers to force
exchange rate adjustments. The BIS general manager says: 'The authorities
cannot therefore afford to ignore the crucial role of expectations (in
financial markets). If they want to meet exchange rate targets they will
have to influence these expectations, or at least avoid giving rise to
adverse ones.'
Elsewhere in the report, the BIS suggests governments were guilty of a
'piecemeal approach' to managing the turbulence in the European exchange
rate mechanism last year. Instead of arranging a general realignment of the
currencies in the system, they allowed financial markets to force events,
with the result that individual currencies had to be devalued one by one,
or, in the case of the Italian lira and sterling, pushed out of the
mechanism. With about Dollars 1,000bn (Pounds 649bn) a day traded on the
world's currency markets, the power of investors to influence events is such
that 'even in the face of an attack on a currency whose fundamentals are
sound, intervention (by central banks to buy or sell currencies) now had to
be greater than in the past'.
On a similar theme, Mr Lamfalussy says an additional reason for governments'
reduced ability to control exchange rate movements has been the 'emergence
of an activist asset and liability management culture, encouraged by the
successive waves of financial innovation and accelerating advances in
information systems and communications technology'.
Turning to the economic outlook, Mr Lamfalussy is moderately optimistic
about the possibilities of a sustained upturn across the industrial world.
He says investment has generally been resilient, savings have increased and
productivity growth is increasing in many countries, not only in
manufacturing but in services.

FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: Japan keeps cash at home  - A look at the
annual report of the Bank for International Settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH

<TEXT>
JAPANESE overseas investment fell steeply last year, exacerbating economic
difficulties in much of the industrialised world.
Particularly affected was the US, a strong beneficiary of Japanese
investment in the late 1980s, while in the European Community inward
investment last year generally held up well in spite of signs of economic
slowdown. Total world cross-border investment last year came to Dollars
158.5bn (Pounds 102.9bn), down 13 per cent on the corresponding figure for
1991.
According to the BIS report, foreign investment by Japanese companies,
including capital spending and acquisitions, totalled Dollars 17.2bn last
year, down from Dollars 30.7bn in 1991 and the Dollars 48bn invested the
year before.
The report suggests that the main effect of much of the large Japanese
foreign investment in the 1980s has been to create jobs and boost economic
activity in the countries concerned, rather than to lead to large profits
for the Japanese companies spending the money. It says the 'flood' of
Japanese overseas investment between 1987 and 1991, totalling Dollars 175bn,
has 'apparently yielded a very poor return'. In the US last year, according
to the report, Japanese investors recorded a net loss of Dollars 2bn in
terms of more cash flowing out of their businesses than coming in.
Overall, last year saw a net negative investment in the US of Dollars 3.9bn.
That arose partly because the poor economic climate persuaded potential
investors that they had better uses for their money.
In terms of total world cross-border investments, the US was responsible for
the biggest share, contributing Dollars 35.3bn out of total world investment
of this type of Dollars 158.5bn last year. This figure was 13 per cent down
on the Dollars 182.2bn figure for 1991.
Investment inflows across borders in the EC were relatively high at Dollars
70.3bn last year, compared with Dollars 68.6bn the year before.
The UK received the biggest share of last year's investment with Dollars
19bn, followed by France with Dollars 16bn.

FT  15 JUN 93 / World Trade News: German fury at minister's telecoms line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German telecoms industry yesterday sharply criticised the recent
announcement by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, federal economics minister, that Germany
and the US had agreed to sidestep sanctions and counter-sanctions over
government contracts affecting telecommunications.
'We are surprised and angered at the fact that the Economics Ministry is
breaking ranks with EC trade politics,' a source in the industry said.
'Germany will now become a platform for non-EC producers wanting to enter
the common market, and German companies will be the first to pay the price
for this increased competition.'
On the eve of his trip today to Washington, French Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur expressed disbelief that Germany could have struck a separate deal
with the US on telecommunications. Nonetheless, France has asked the
European Commission to verify the agreement.
The German Economics Ministry yesterday attempted to defuse the crisis,
which has thrown Germany into a bitter dispute with the Commission. However,
ministry officials kept an embarrassed silence when asked about ways in
which Bonn could mend its dispute with Brussels.
The ministry said no trade agreement lifting sanctions had been signed with
the US. 'Our trade representatives simply informed their US counterparts
that Germany was not discriminating against US companies, as do Spain,
Portugal and Greece,' a spokesman from the ministry said.
The row between Germany and Brussels broke out last Thursday when Mr Mickey
Kantor, US trade representative, told a US congressional committee that
Germany and the US had agreed to drop sanctions against companies importing
telecoms equipment.
On Friday Mr Rexrodt announced that Germany could not apply discriminatory
sanctions against US companies because of a 1954 bilateral trade agreement.
The announcement prompted the European Commission to ask for a
clarification.
The US recently erected barriers against EC telecoms suppliers seeking
government contracts in the US. This was in retaliation for Article 29 of
the EC's utilities directive, enacted in January and giving a price
preference to EC companies bidding for European government contracts.
But Mr Rexrodt said on Friday Germany would not apply Article 29's
restrictive provisions.

FT  15 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US pacts must be 'results-oriented'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Council on Competitiveness has joined a growing number of influential
private-sector groups recommending Washington negotiate 'results-oriented'
pacts, including market-share goals, when strong companies cannot gain
foreign market access.
In its latest report - Roadmap for Results: Trade Policy, Technology and
American Competitiveness - the council also endorses the use of trade
sanctions if necessary.
The council is headed by Mr George Fisher, chairman of Motorola, who was one
of the few private-sector representatives invited to dine on Friday night
with a Japanese delegation in Washington for trade negotiations. It played a
key role in developing the Clinton administration's technology policy.
The new report offers some insight into US strategy towards Japan, which it
names as a candidate for results-oriented pacts because 'its structural
barriers and discriminatory private-sector linkages are often more
entrenched than in other parts of the world'.
The report acknowledges that the US has, in the past, relied too heavily on
trade policy instead of addressing basic competitiveness problems, such as
insufficient research and development, 'impatient capital markets and a
burdensome regulatory environment'.
US trade policy has been poorly co-ordinated among government agencies and
with other policies, the report says. This has led to numerous
inconsistencies; for example Washington rejecting subsidies in multilateral
steel talks, while making plans to subsidise high-technology R&amp;D.
The administration has already moved to correct past deficiencies. Its Japan
policy has been developed in the interagency National Economic Council in
tandem with the National Security Agency. It is insisting on some kind of
measurable indicators, and has the broad backing of both Republicans and
Democrats in Congress.
Although the administration has pledged not to retaliate if negotiated goals
are not met, it will use sanctions to enforce trade US laws.
The options for leverage are numerous. A higher mini-van tariff, now buried
in a Treasury review process, could be called into play or US officials
could return to talking up the yen.

FT  15 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Contractors join the new battle of Beirut
 -Andrew Taylor detects growing international interest in plans for city's
reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of rebuilding war-ravaged Beirut, 18 months after hostilities
ceased, is beginning to excite the interest of international contractors.
They are anxious to win foreign orders to supplement depressed domestic
order books with much of the western world struggling to escape the grip of
recession.
The extent to which their interest will be translated into structures on the
ground will depend on the ability of the Lebanese authorities to raise the
money to pay for reconstruction.
Last week building and civil engineering contractors were asked to submit
pre-qualifying bids for the Dollars 350m (Pounds 227m) rehabilitation and
extension of Beirut international airport.
According to contractors, finance for the airport is expected to be in the
form of foreign loans and grants, most likely from other Middle Eastern
countries.
The Lebanese Council for Development and Reconstruction responsible for the
project has told construction companies that the airport development has the
personal support of Mr Rafik Al Hariri, the prime minister.
About 70 contractors are expected to seek to pre-qualify to expand the
airport's capacity from about 1.5m passengers a year to 6m. The work, which
includes a third 3,500m runway, is expected to last two years.
It is part of a Dollars 12.9bn reconstruction programme which includes
rebuilding shattered transport, water, sewerage and electricity generation
services as well.
A separate plan for the redevelopment of Beirut, once one of the richest
Middle Eastern cities, has been drawn up by local consultants Dar
Al-Handasah. The rehabilitation of 1.3m sq m, including 660,000 sq m of
private property, in the bombed-out centre of Beirut, is expected to cost
about Dollars 3bn.
The reconstruction programme, says the council, will be paid for out of
foreign loans and aid, Lebanese government finance and private investment
from returning businessmen and Lebanese expatriates. It is estimated that
these hold overseas assets worth Dollars 30bn to Dollars 40bn.
Much will depend upon the success of Mr Hariri, a 48-year-old Moslem
billionaire, in convincing the investment community that he can rally
Lebanon's divided society and reverse the country's balance of payments
deficit.
The long-term solution to the country's political and economic problems will
involve reaching a peace agreement under which Israel will withdraw its
troops from its self-declared security zone in south Lebanon. Without this
accord, it will be impossible for large scale country-wide re-development to
take place.
The first phase of re-development, costing Dollars 2.7bn, from 1993 to 1995
will depend heavily on foreign loans which will account for two-thirds of
the finance with foreign aid accounting for another 21 per cent. Domestic
borrowing will account for about 13 per cent, says the council.
Earlier projects, therefore, will be those which can quickly generate income
from users to repay borrowings. These may include the airport development,
electricity generation, port developments and communications.
Contractors will be looking for as much security as possible from lenders
such as the World Bank. The council toyed with the idea of trying to raise
finance for the air-port from a private sector operator but did not consider
this to be feasible in the current political and economic climate.
Nonetheless, there are signs of activity which have encouraged international
contractors. Lebanese businessmen, as a sign of confidence in Mr Hariri's
new government, repatriated Dollars 700m last year.
Mr Derek Ashburner, business development director of Trafalgar House, the UK
construction, engineering, property, shipping and hotel group, was a member
of a construction industry trade mission to Beirut sponsored by the British
government at the beginning of this month.
'Land costs have risen sharply in recent months and there are reports of
apartments along the coastal strip changing hands at Dollars 1m each, all of
which are signs of returning confidence,' said Mr Ashburner.
'British, French and Italian engineering consultants are already working on
preliminary designs for parts of the reconstruction prog-ramme. We are
hopeful we too will pick up some of the work as this programme develops.'

Sumitomo Light Metal of Japan and Norway's Hydro Aluminium have formally

Hydro is Europe's biggest producer of aluminium extrusions while Sumitomo is

FT  15 JUN 93 / Slow in hitting justice jackpot: The US president still
seems indecisive and politically irresolute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT took President Bill Clinton three pulls at the lever before hitting the
attorney-general jackpot with Ms Janet Reno. Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg may
turn out to be a splendid new Supreme Court justice, but the process by
which she was selected has done nothing for the president's - and the White
House staff's - reputation for being indecisive and politically irresolute.
This indictment against both the president and his people is already the
talk of Washington, and explains Mr Clinton's anger with the press.
The salient charges include:
Vacillation. It took the administration three months to find a replacement
for Justice Byron White, who had announced in March he would retire at the
end of the court term this summer so that a replacement could be confirmed
by the Senate before the recess and installed on the bench by September.
This timetable is now in doubt.
By contrast, presidents Reagan and Bush took less than a week to announce
nominations to court vacancies and did not demand - as Mr Clinton does,
almost to obsession - personal knowledge of candidates. Even when both
Republican presidents lost nominees - Mr Robert Bork and Mr Douglas Ginsburg
 -replacements were put forward within days.
Poor staff work: Judge Stephen Breyer of Massachusetts, the favourite until
Sunday, is reported to have told Mr Bernard Nussbaum, White House legal
counsel, five weeks ago he had a problem with social security payments for a
domestic employee. Yet this only surfaced over the weekend after the judge,
a White House lunch guest last Friday, had been asked to stay in Washington,
presumably to await announcement of his nomination.
Even then, he was dropped after several prominent senators - including Mr
Robert Dole, Republican leader, and Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the
judiciary committee - had said he should be confirmed, not least because new
ground rules, worked out by the committee and the White House, allowed for
'unintentional oversight', which seems the worst he was guilty of.
Even some leading advocates of women's rights, distressed over the
circumstances that undid Ms Zoe Baird and Judge Kimba Wood as prospective
attorneys-general, pointed to qualitative differences between his domestic
affairs and those of the two women.
Callousness. If Judge Breyer was led up the garden path of expectation, so
was Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, rated favourite a week ago. He had
to endure the re-emergence of old - never substantiated - claims that he had
connections to organised crime.
Political resolution: It baffled even some of Mr Clinton's friends when Mr
Babbitt's name was so freely mentioned, as he is widely considered a tower
of strength in the cabinet, particularly admired by liberals and
environmentalists. A confirmation battle to replace him at the interior
department seemed needless.
The president's desire to know his most important nominees personally may be
understandable. But he deserted an old friend, Ms Lani Guinier, when her
nomination to the civil rights section at the Justice Department came under
fire and, in dropping Mr Babbitt and Judge Breyer, Mr Clinton has again left
the impression that he bends before critical winds. This also makes him
enemies: Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a sponsor of Judge Breyer,
is not pleased.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Canadian Tories take gamble on Campbell: The new PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY CHOOSING Ms Kim Campbell to succeed Brian Mulroney as party leader and
prime minister, Canada's ruling Progressive Conservatives have taken a
gamble.
If it pays off, the Tories will find themselves in power for a third
consecutive term after the election Ms Campbell is likely to call in
September.
The country may then have a prime minister with the forcefulness to press
ahead vigorously for the next five years with the tasks which Mr Mulroney
began - adjusting the economy to the rigours of greater competition,
especially in North America, bringing down a ballooning budget deficit,
reforming the costly social security system and giving a freer rein to
private enterprise.
As a native of Vancouver, Ms Campbell may be the ideal leader to accommodate
Canada's regional and linguistic disparities, while maintaining an
over-arching role for the federal government in Ottawa.
Her intellect, sophisticated tastes and considerable exposure to the world
outside North America could give the new prime minister and her country as
much attention on the international stage in the 1990s as Mr Pierre Trudeau
won for it in the 1970s.
Ms Campbell, aged 46, is in many ways an unusual - and therefore, for her
party, a risky - choice as Canada's 19th prime minister. Besides being the
first woman in the post, she is the first prime minister with western roots
since Mr John Diefenbaker in the late 1950s. Ms Campbell, who has spent much
of her life studying or teaching, was elected to the House of Commons in
Ottawa only five years ago.
Her previous experience in politics was limited to a school board in
Vancouver and to British Columbia's right-wing Social Credit party. She is
barely fluent in French, and has little first-hand knowledge of Quebec, more
than 2,000 miles from Vancouver.
The general election race will be wide open. The Tories have a fillip from
Mr Mulroney's departure, and are now running neck and neck with the
opposition Liberals in public opinion polls. But, with voters in an
unusually volatile mood, polls now offer little guidance to the outcome. For
one thing, Ms Campbell's chief opponent, Liberal party leader Mr Jean
Chretien, is among the country's most seasoned politicians.
Ms Campbell will make her international debut at next month's Group of Seven
summit in Tokyo - an event which Tory organisers hope will also help boost
her image at home ahead of the general election.
The other G7 leaders are likely to find that their new Canadian counterpart
has a more piercing intellect than Mr Mulroney, but is less convivial.
The same traits have won her affection in some quarters, but disdain in
others. One of her political confidants notes that it was just as well there
were no microphones at hand last Saturday evening as Ms Campbell sat
watching the keynote speeches of the other four candidates at the
Conservative leadership convention.
Her comments were, it seems, such that a Campbell fan would have regarded
them as reflecting her impish sense of humour, a detractor as proof of a
condescending manner.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Clinton names moderate as Supreme Court choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday ended a controversial three-month search
for a new Supreme Court justice by nominating Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to
the highest US bench.
He also reacted angrily, by cutting off a planned news conference after the
first question, when a reporter implied he had 'zig-zagged' over the
nomination. Having been moved to tears by Judge Ginsburg's effusive thanks
to those who had helped in her career, he snapped back: 'I have long since
given up the thought that I could disabuse some of you (from) turning any
substantive decision into anything but political process. How you could ask
a question like that, after the statement she just made, is beyond me.'
The invited Rose Garden audience burst into applause.
Judge Ginsburg, who is 60 and serves on the federal appeals court based in
Washington, should win confirmation by the Senate for the seat being vacated
by Justice Byron White.
She would be the second woman to serve on the highest US court, joining
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, and the first Jew since Justice Abe Fortas
resigned in 1969.
Mr Clinton, the only Democrat in a position to make a nomination to the
court in 26 years, said she was 'progressive in outlook, wise in judgment,
and balanced and fair in her opinions'.
Judge Ginsburg was chosen in preference to Judge Stephen Breyer of
Massachusetts, complimented by Mr Clinton yesterday, and Mr Bruce Babbitt,
interior secretary. Her candidacy emerged only at the weekend after Judge
Breyer was revealed not to have paid social security taxes on a part-time
cleaning woman.
Named to the federal bench by President Carter in 1980, Judge Ginsburg had
previously been general counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. As a
judge on a circuit principally engaged with regulatory issues, she is rated
a moderate.
The judge is credited, in a 1985 ruling, with having opened the US natural
gas pipeline business to competitive forces. She was recently praised as a
potentially ideal Supreme Court member by Justice Antonin Scalia, the
court's most distinctive conservative voice. But she is also close to former
Justice William Brennan, even in retirement a powerful liberal influence.
Some women's groups attacked her last year for a speech in which she had
suggested the court's 1973 landmark ruling, Roe vs Wade, which guarantees
abortion rights, might have gone too far and 'halted a political process
that was moving in a reform direction and thereby, I believe, prolonged
divisiveness'.
But that speech has to be matched against her record as an advocate in the
1970s, when she won five out of six cases in the court, arguing that the
constitution's 14th amendment, covering citizenship rights, should serve as
a protection for women.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Austerity aimed at righting Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL is to slash government spending by the equivalent of Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 3.8bn) as part of a last-ditch austerity plan, announced last night.
The so-called plano de verdade (truth plan) was unveiled by Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the new finance minister and the fourth person in eight
months to take the helm of the crisis-ridden Brazilian economy. The plan is
seen as the government's last chance, before the December 1994 presidential
and congressional elections, to tackle the country's soaring inflation, now
at 32 per cent a month.
The six-point plan contains none of the shocks of some of its predecessors
over the last eight years. 'I can offer no miracles,' Mr Cardoso told a news
conference in Braslia.
Instead, it seeks tighter fiscal control in an attempt to bridge an expected
Dollars 12bn budget deficit. 'It is imperative that the government set an
example by putting its house in order,' said the minister.
The Dollars 6bn cut represents a small proportion of the Dollars 240bn total
federal budget, but a large slice of what the minister called the 'tiny
parcel for new investment and running costs - unfortunately it is that which
we have had to cut.'
He pointed out that the constitution gave the government little flexibility,
most revenue being eaten by government wages, interest payments, and by
mandatory transfers to states and cities which receive 45 per cent of all
taxes.
Mr Cardoso has yet to give details of his 'budgetary diet', but said he had
chosen Dollars 6bn as the minimum necessary to balance the budget and allow
a return to growth.
Aside from the spending cuts, the minister hopes to boost revenue through a
crackdown on tax evaders, with offenders being jailed for the first time,
and through the new cheque tax still awaiting congressional approval.

<TEXT>
REPORTS that South American security forces worked together last year to
'rescue' a Chilean intelligence officer, wanted in connection with human
rights investigations in Chile, have set off political trouble in Uruguay,
where the officer was last seen.
The affair came to light last week when Uruguayan congressmen received an
anonymous letter claiming that Argentine, Chilean and Uruguayan intelligence
services co-operated last November, apparently without the knowledge of
their civilian political masters, to spirit Mr Eugenio Berros out of Chile,
where he was wanted on human rights charges. He is alleged to have been
implicated in rights violations during General Augusto Pinochet's military
regime of 1973-1990.
Mr Berros was taken first to Argentina, then to Uruguay, where he is
believed to have been protected by army and police officers. He has since
disappeared without trace.
Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle cut short last week an official
visit to London to deal with the affair. He sacked General Mario Aguerrondo
as head of military intelligence and Mr Ramon Rivas, the police chief
suspected of holding Mr Berros in the town of Parque del Plata.
However, Mr Lacalle has been careful to avoid a head-on confrontation with
the Uruguayan military, which has evaded the sort of human rights
investigations that dogged the armed forces of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
Paraguay after they handed back power to civilians.
Mr Lacalle has ordered a confidential interior and defence ministry
investigation of the Berros affair, rather than a full judicial inquiry. He
stressed at the weekend that the affair was mainly a Chilean problem, with
ramifications in Uruguay.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Shake-up at EBRD may be postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP MANAGEMENT changes at the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development are likely to be postponed following the intervention of Mrs
Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, in a row that has split the bank's
directors.
At a board meeting in London yesterday, Mr Claes de Neergaard of Sweden,
acting on Mrs Wibble's instructions, recommended the directors set up a
committee to negotiate with the EBRD's president, Mr Jacques Attali, on any
restructuring. A decision on the proposal will be taken by the directors
later this week.
However, one director said yesterday he was now hopeful that the proposed
management changes, which had led to threats of resignation from the present
first vice-president, Mr Ron Freeman, would be delayed until after an audit
committee report, due next month, into criticisms of overspending at the
bank.
The planned management changes would involve the appointment of Mr Ernest
Stern, the World Bank number two, as a senior vice-president, in effect
displacing Mr Freeman as Mr Attali's deputy.
Mrs Wibble, who is chairman of the bank's governors, had made it clear she
felt all EBRD shareholders - 54 countries and agencies - should be involved
in the management re-organisation decision. Sweden and some other countries
are concerned at manoeuvring by the Group of Seven industrial countries to
force through management changes.
Many directors also made clear they were unhappy about proposals in an EBRD
report by Mr Stanley Katz, a former bank executive, commissioned by Mr
Attali, to shift the organisation's emphasis towards development banking
along the lines of the World Bank. The EBRD's original philosophy was
promotion of privatisation in eastern Europe, a policy most directors still
favour.
Directors of the bank said last night the board was split roughly 50-50 on
whether the management changes should be postponed, with the G7
representatives under instructions to push for immediate changes.
At yesterday's inconclusive day-long board meeting, Mr Attali proposed
appointing Mr Stern to the new post of number two at the EBRD. Mr Attali,
the focus of the recent allegations of EBRD over-spending, said Mr Stern had
accepted the job in principle to help strengthen management.
But Mr de Neergaard, who is chairman of the bank's audit committee and is
overseeing examination of alleged cost over-runs, spoke out against changes
until the investigation was completed on July 15.
Mr Attali's future was not broached at the meeting. But several directors
feel an early decision on creating a new job for Mr Stern could pre-empt
wider changes - including Mr Attali's own position - which may become
necessary once the audit report is concluded.

FT  15 JUN 93 / East Ukraine flexes its muscles: A strike with an overtly
political intent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WERE IT not for the signs denouncing President Leonid Kravchuk, at a rally
in the central square of the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk yesterday
could have been mistaken for a massive civic picnic.
Many of the 35,000 demonstrators who converged on October Square to show
their solidarity with striking coal miners carried brightly coloured
parasols against the summer sun. Miners, distinctive in red hard-hats and
coal-blackened faces, reclined on the lush lawns surrounding the square to
enjoy an open-air brunch.
The festive mood was facilitated by a thoughtful local government. The riot
police and truncheons one might expect to see at a demonstration of militant
coal-miners were nowhere in evidence. The regional government even gave the
strike committee offices in its massive white granite building and allowed
the miners to use the steps as a podium.
But for all that, the wave of industrial unrest triggered by the miners'
strikes which began last Wednesday has been an effective flexing of the
muscles of industrialised eastern Ukraine.
The strikes, which have stopped work at 228 of the Donbass region's 253
mines and been joined by workers at some metallurgical and machine-building
factories in the area, have pushed the political demands of the east to the
top of the political agenda. The miners of western Ukraine, as hard hit by
last week's five-fold leap in food prices as their eastern comrades, have by
and large not joined the strike.
But, according to observers in eastern Ukraine, unlike previous miners'
strikes which have focused on pay increases for the coal sector, the main
goal of this round of industrial action has been to give eastern Ukraine,
which is predominantly Russian-speaking, greater political power.
'This is eastern Ukraine's political revenge,' said Mr Hryhori Nemyria, a
professor of political science at Donetsk University. 'After many years of
the recruitment of Ukraine's political elites from the Donbass, it is
western Ukraine which is now prominent. The current strike is an effort to
turn the tables back again.'
The first winner in this struggle is Mr Ekhim Zvehilsky, catapulted from his
job as mayor of Donetsk to the critical post of first deputy prime minister.
The links between his overnight political promotion and the strikes are
strong: the normally quiescent Zasiadko mine, where he used to work as
director, was the first to take to the picket lines. Moreover, one of the
strike leaders is his top political aide.
Mr Zvehilsky wasted no time in using his new job to push the main demand of
the striking miners: a national referendum on whether to hold new
presidential and parliamentary elections.
'Our young state is in jeopardy,' Mr Zvehilsky said to the emergency session
of parliament convened yesterday afternoon to debate the miners' demand for
a referendum. 'If we do not decide today to hold a referendum, then in three
or four days there will be no reason to meet at all.'
He warned that failure to meet the miners' demands could spark a wider
strike which would halt the national economy.
By late yesterday, parliament had not yet taken a decision on whether to
hold a referendum. If it does, the resultwould be difficult to predict. The
ex-Communist-dominated parliament is widely discredited and a referendum
could be expected to result in parliamentary elections.
The president's position is more ambiguous. Ukraine's collapsing economy and
escalating tensions with Russia have pushed his rating down in the opinion
polls, but Mr Kravchuk is a skilled politician with a strong network of
regional representatives, and, like his Russian counterpart, could manage to
pull off a vote of confidence.
That would not please the miners of Donetsk, whose region voted strongly in
favour of Mr Kravchuk, then perceived as a moderate alternative to
nationalist politicians from western Ukraine, in the 1991 presidential
elections. 'Kravchuk cannot lead and he does not understand the economy,'
said Mr Iuri Makarov, co-chairman of the strike committee. 'People have now
understood that he is not able to do anything for the state.'

<TEXT>
THE long-awaited federal regulatory body for the German securities industry
is unlikely to be fully operational before 1995 or even 1996, the government
minister responsible for policing Germany's largest stock market warned
yesterday.
Mr Ernst Welteke, economics minister for the state of Hesse, said in
Frankfurt yesterday he expected legislation to create the German equivalent
of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and to make insider dealing
illegal would be on the statute book in the first quarter of next year.
But, he cautioned, it could take up to two years after that for the new body
to recruit its full complement of up to 100 staff and be in a position to
undertake its tasks, including monitoring of insider dealing.
Mr Welteke's observations highlight the slow pace of change in the
regulatory environment in Germany - a slowness all the more marked because
of German financiers' growing recognition that it is in the interests of
Finanzplatz Deutschland, the promotion of Germany as a financial centre, to
bring regulations up to international standards as quickly as possible.
This feeling intensified in recent weeks following the downfall of Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, former head of IG Metall, the powerful engineering union. He
was forced to resign after it emerged he had dealt in shares of a
Daimler-Benz holding company ahead of a price sensitive announcement while
serving on the Daimler-Benz supervisory board.
Mr Steinkuhler's dealings in the shares of Mercedes Holding are being
investigated by the insider dealing unit of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. He
has denied insider dealing but his case has brought attention to the lack of
insider laws in Germany.
Mr Welteke called yesterday's briefing to explain measures which the state
of Hesse has taken to strengthen its regulatory activities ahead of the
introduction of the new laws.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Morillon warns of 'catastrophe': Serbs increase pressure on
besieged Moslem town of Gorazde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French commander of United Nations troops in Bosnia, General Philippe
Morillon, said last night he hoped a ceasefire between Moslems and Serbs
could be reached today to save the Moslem enclave of Gorazde from
'catastrophe'.
Bosnian Serb commanders said their troops were just 150 metres from Moslem
positions in Gorazde, which is a UN-proclaimed 'safe area' and the last
government stronghold in the once mostly Moslem east of the country.
As Serb forces pressed ahead with their three-week offensive,
Moslem-controlled radio said 69 people had been killed and dozens wounded in
the last 24 hours as Serbs poured in rocket and artillery fire. Radio
messages from Gorazde have been appealing for outside intervention to save
the town from the Serbs.
But in his statement on French TV Gen Morillon said a ceasefire needed to be
in place before UN forces could act. 'We will go back into Gorazde before
there is a catastrophe provided there is an agreement among parties to cease
hostilities,' he said.
Amateur radio operators in Gorazde called the besieged town a 'real hell
under constant attacks from Serbian multiple rocket launchers and grenades'.
'Everything is burning and the villages are being destroyed,' said one
report.
In an another move to consolidate their self-proclaimed state, Serb forces
set up checkpoints on the UN-controlled road from Sarajevo airport to the
capital. The Serb barricades violate a year-long UN agreement for an
international airlift to Sarajevo airport and the unhindered transport of
food and medical supplies on the airport road, a vital lifeline for the
380,000 people trapped in Sarajevo.
Serbs holding Croatia's Krajina enclave shelled the Adriatic coastal resort
town of Biograd yesterday, killing five people, Croatian officials said. The
attack coincided with rising tension between Croatia and the Krajina Serbs
over their plan to hold a referendum this weekend on merging the enclave
with Serb-held Bosnia as part of a 'Greater Serbia'.
In New York, a report to the Security Council recommended that the UN send
7,500 more troops, backed by air power, to Bosnia immediately to guard
civilians in six Moslem 'safe areas', including Gorazde. But the report, by
Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali, said 34,000 soldiers would be
needed if the enclaves were to be protected properly.
Earlier this month the Security Council called for more troops and air power
in the 'safe areas' and asked for a report on the subject.

FT  15 JUN 93 / SPD plays it safe in choice of new leader: The heads of all
three main parties are now in place for the elections

MR RUDOLF SCHARPING, the worthy, youthful, but decidedly uncharismatic
premier of the west German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, was yesterday
unanimously proposed as the next national chairman of the opposition Social
Democrats.
His nomination by the party's national executive committee is intended to
mark the end of a divisive leadership struggle which has left the SPD
drifting in the opinion polls since the surprise resignation last month of
Mr Bjorn Engholm, the former party leader.
It follows Mr Scharping's clear victory in an unprecedented weekend poll of
rank-and-file members, which gave him more than 40 per cent support, against
33 per cent for his nearest rival, Mr Gerhard Schroder, premier of Lower
Saxony.
His selection means that the leaders of all three main political parties are
now in place for the elections next year, although Mr Scharping refused to
say yesterday whether he would run as SPD candidate for chancellor.
It also means that all three, the governing Christian Democratic Union, the
minority Free Democratic party in the coalition government, and the SPD,
have opted for safe, centrist but essentially uninspiring leaders.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has no challengers within his CDU, although he is
widely accused of failing to give clear leadership, and his popularity is
languishing in the polls.
On Friday, the FDP voted overwhelmingly for Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign
minister, as its leader. A civil servant for almost his entire career, and
only a party member for two years, he is solid, plain-speaking but no ball
of fire.
Now the SPD has opted, both at grass-roots level and as party leader, for an
equally uncharismatic figure: Mr Scharping is young (45), hard-working,
clearly competent, but rather wooden in presentation. Yet his confirmation
as national chairman at a party conference on June 25 now appears a foregone
conclusion.
With typical caution, he refused to be drawn on the question of whether he
wants to be the party's candidate to oppose Mr Kohl at next year's national
elections, although previously he has said that the party chairman should be
the candidate for chancellor, too.
He is the obvious choice, but the current deputy leader, Mr Oskar
Lafontaine, who failed to defeat Mr Kohl in 1990, has said he wants to run
again.
Mr Scharping, a career politician since his student days, would only say
that the party had to decide before election day. He hoped it would decide a
bit sooner, he admitted.
His refusal to give any such hostages to fortune is clearly seen by party
supporters as an advantage over Mr Schroder, whose obvious ambition and
clear commitment to fight the next elections in tandem with the Green party
may have frightened off votes.
On the other hand, Mr Scharping's lack of political profile is an obvious
disadvantage in the coming battle with Mr Kohl, himself a former premier of
Rhineland-Palatinate.
In spite of his unpopularity (37 per cent of voters think he is doing a good
job, against 50 per cent who do not), the current chancellor towers over all
other figures in his own party, and among his rivals.
The leadership struggle in the SPD has scarcely helped. Some 70 per cent
said in a recent poll that they did not think the party was capable of
heading a future government. Some 33 per cent of SPD voters expected the CDU
to win next time round.
Somehow Mr Scharping has to change that perspective, and he has just 18
months to do so before the next elections.

ITALY'S huge Stet public sector telecommunications group has been dragged
further into the national political corruption scandal with the arrest
yesterday of Mr Francesco Silvano, managing director until earlier this
month.
The detention of Mr Silvano, who gave himself up to Milan police, takes the
investigations into the telecommunications sector a further rung up Stet's
management ladder. Earlier arrests had involved executives of Stet
subsidiaries.
Telecommunications has become one of the most active areas of investigation
as magistrates pursue leads involving contracts with the former ASST state
telecoms agency. Inquiries are also believed to be proceeding on suggestions
that some telecoms companies have rigged bids. Last month, police arrested
Mr Luigi Montella and Mr Salvatore Randi, managing directors of Stet's Sirti
and Italtel subsidiaries.

MR BERND OTTO, chief defendant in the long-running fraud trial involving the
Co op German retail group, has been sentenced to four and a half years in
jail.
Mr Otto, a former chief executive of the Co op, was found guilty on counts
of fraud and accounts manipulation involving a total of approximately DM20m
(Pounds 8m). The trial has been running for almost a year.
The court found the money had been transferred illegally to Swiss bank
accounts for the personal use of Mr Otto and other former senior Co op
executives. The charges date back to events in the mid-to-late eighties when
Co op pursued an aggressive expansion course.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Bosnian 'safe area' in UN plea: Serbs increase pressure on
besieged Moslem town of Gorazde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RADIO messages from the besieged eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde yesterday
appealed for outside intervention to save the UN-proclaimed 'safe area' as
Serb forces pressed ahead with their three-week offensive.
Bosnian Serb commanders said their troops were just 150 metres from
Moslem-positions in Gorazde, the last government stronghold in the
once-mostly Moslem east of the country.
In an ominous note which was likely to signal an intensification of Serb
attacks, a Bosnian Serb officer accused Moslem fighters of 'slaughtering
hundreds of Serbs' in villages surrounding Gorazde, according to the
Belgrade news agency, Tanjug. Serb commanders previously have used the claim
that Serb civilians are 'endangered' to justify an attack.
In an another move to consolidate their self-proclaimed state, Serb forces
set up checkpoints on the UN-controlled road from Sarajevo airport to the
besieged capital.
The Serb barricades violate a year-long UN agreement for an international
airlift to Sarajevo airport and the unhindered transport of food and medical
supplies on the airport road, a vital lifeline for the 380,000 people
trapped in Sarajevo.
General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, at the weekend agreed to
the deployment of UN military observers in Gorazde. His go-ahead suggested
that the Serb strategy in Gorazde may be similar to their operations earlier
this year around Srebrenica, the first UN-designated safe area.
In Srebrenica the intensity of Serb attacks, combined with a year-long
siege, forced the Bosnian authorities to agree to a demilitarisation of the
area. The area has been described by relief workers as an unsafe and
wretched refugee camp.
'The Serbs may be seeking to create yet another unviable refugee camp out of
Gorazde,' a western diplomat based in Belgrade said yesterday. Serb forces
control traffic leading to the six UN-declared safe areas, making remote the
possibility of any long-term future for Moslem-led Bosnian enclaves in
Serb-held eastern Bosnia.
Reports from amateur radio operators yesterday called Gorazde a 'real hell
under constant attacks from Serbian multiple rocket launchers and grenades'.
'Everything is burning and the villages are being destroyed,' said the
reports, which could not be independently confirmed because amateur radio
operators are the besieged town's only link with the outside world.
Bosnian radio said more than 50 people were killed on Sunday in a Serb
rocket attack on a hospital in the town.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Long wait in prospect for German SEC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-awaited federal regulatory body for the German securities industry
is unlikely to be fully operational before 1995 or even 1996, the government
minister responsible for policing Germany's largest stock market warned
yesterday.
Mr Ernst Welteke, economics minister for the state of Hesse, said in
Frankfurt yesterday that he expected the legislation to create the German
equivalent of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and to make insider
dealing illegal, would be on the statute book in the first quarter of next
year.
But, he cautioned, it could take up to two years after that for the new body
to recruit its full complement of up to 100 staff and be in a position to
undertake its tasks, including the monitoring of insider dealing.
Mr Welteke's observations highlight the slow pace of change in the
regulatory environment in Germany - a slowness which is all the more marked
because of German financiers' growing recognition that it is in the
interests of Finanzplatz Deutschland, the promotion of Germany as a
financial centre, to bring regulations up to international standards as
quickly as possible.
This feeling has intensified in recent weeks following the downfall of Mr
Franz Steinkuhler, the former head of IG Metall, the powerful engineering
union. He was forced to resign from the union after it emerged that he had
dealt in the shares of a Daimler-Benz holding company ahead of a price
sensitive announcement while serving as a member of the Daimler-Benz
supervisory board.
Mr Steinkuhler's dealings in the shares of Mercedes Holding are being
investigated by the insider dealing unit of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. He
has denied insider dealing but his case has brought popular attention to the
lack of insider laws in Germany.
'The current sanctions against insider dealing are minimal,' Mr Welteke
said. 'They are not at all enough. At the moment it is just a matter of
commonsense that you don't do it - or at least you don't let yourself get
caught.'
Mr Welteke, whose ministry is responsible for overseeing the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, which conducts 70 per cent of securities business in Germany,
called yesterday's briefing to explain measures which the state of Hesse has
taken to strengthen its regulatory activities ahead of the introduction of
the new laws.
The German government had intended to criminalise insider dealing and to
create the German SEC by the end of 1992. But disputes between federal and
state governments have led to serious delays in the implementation of
reforms first proposed by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, in January
last year.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Car sales plummet in western Europe: May's 17.9% decline
means more than a million fewer vehicles sold in first five months of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales plunged by 17.9 per cent in west European last month to an
estimated 973,000, the fifth successive month demand has fallen steeply from
the corresponding period a year ago.
In the first five months alone more than 1m fewer new cars have been sold in
west Europe than in the same period a year ago. Sales dropped by 17.3 per
cent to 5.15m, according to industry estimates.
The sharp decline is increasing the strains between the European Community
and Japan over the level of the latter's sales in Europe. The Japanese share
of the west European market is estimated to have increased to 12.3 per cent
in the first five months from 11.6 per cent in the same period a year ago.
Under intensified pressure from European carmakers, the European Commission
has requested urgent talks with Tokyo before the August summer break, with a
view to revising the present deal on Japanese exports to the EC this year.
That was based on a forecast fall in the EC market for cars and light
commercial vehicles of only 6.5 per cent.
According to the industry, new car sales both in May and in the first five
months of the year were lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 west European
markets. Higher sales were achieved only in Britain and Ireland.
The decline is still accelerating in Italy where year-on-year sales fell
27.8 per cent in May and by 21.1 per cent in the first five months. In
Germany, Europe's biggest market, they fell by an estimated 20.8 per cent
last month to 284,000 from 358,000 a year ago. Corresponding figures for
Spain and France were 20.5 and 12.1 per cent respectively.
Only Britain showed significant growth in May. New car sales rose there by
11.9 per cent, albeit from a very low level after three years of recession.
Most leading carmakers in Europe have been forced to introduce extensive
short-time working and are cutting their workforces severely in the face of
shrinking profits or mounting losses.
Rover was the only one to increase sales volume in the first five months,
with a rise of 8 per cent helped by the growth of the UK market and its own
strong performance in the German, French and Italian markets from a small
base.
Nissan is benefiting from rising production from its British and Spanish
assembly plants, which is allowing it to increase its penetration of the
protected southern European markets, where direct imports from Japan are
still limited by quotas.
The company's sales in Italy jumped by 78.9 per cent to 20,347 in the first
five months, and fell in Spain by only 0.3 per cent despite a 31.2 per cent
decline in the overall market.
Among the big six volume carmakers in Europe, General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall)
and Ford have gained some ground helped by the launch of new models.
Volkswagen and Fiat are losing market share.
Fiat group, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo as well as Ferrari and
Maserati, has suffered a serious erosion of its market share from the late
1980s, when it captured 14.9 per cent in 1988 and 1989. That share fell in
the first five months of this year to only 11.9 per cent from 12.5 per cent
in the same period a year ago.

DEAD POETS and ageing rock stars could receive an unexpected boost in
royalty payments from mid-1995, under harmonised European Community
copyright rules agreed yesterday.
EC internal market ministers agreed that books and films should enjoy
copyright protection for 70 years after the author's death, while musical
recordings will earn royalties for 50 years from the date the record was
first published or the performance broadcast.
The deal - agreed by a majority in spite of opposition from the Irish,
Luxembourg, Dutch and Portuguese delegations - aims to end problems which
could be caused by varying protection across the EC.
Without such a measure, certain governments were worried publishers would
escape paying royalties in high-protection member states by importing
records or books from countries where protection was low or non-existent,
taking advantage of the single market.
But one side-effect of the new measure could be a temporary bonanza for
performers and the heirs of authors for whom copyright protection has
already expired in some parts of the Community.
For example, early Beatles recordings no longer earn royalties in Germany,
which protects recordings for just 25 years. From July 1, 1997, however, the
Beatles will again earn royalties on recordings and broadcasts of their
early songs, until the new 50-year period expires.
The same rules will apply for books in Britain, which will have to extend
copyright protection from 50 to 70 years after the author's death. That
could mean a royalties boom for heirs of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, for
example.
However, the directive should protect publishers and recording companies
which rushed out special editions to coincide with the end of copyright
protection. A special clause says states should take action to protect the
'acquired rights and legitimate expectations' of those who took advantage of
the old, unharmonised copyright system.
The EC yesterday came a step closer to agreeing common rules on the freedom
and cross-border management of pension funds.
In their first detailed discussion of the measure, internal market ministers
reached broad agreement on how to liberalise a sector still bound by
traditional national restrictions on where and how funds can be invested.
But officials said several problems needed resolving at a future ministerial
meeting - possibly in the autumn.
They would have to agree on the extent to which pension fund assets should
be kept in the fund's home country; and to what extent pension funds should
invest in currencies other than those in which pensioners were paid.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Calls for reform of Community's new VAT system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's new value added tax system is excessively
complicated and costly and requires reform, Mr Serge Foucher, director of
finance and accounting for Sony Europa, said yesterday.
Mr Foucher told the Financial Times international tax conference in London
that the origin-based system introduced at the start of this year had proved
a heavy administrative burden.
'We feel penalised because we have set up as a European company,' he said.
He told delegates that Sony had been forced to register an additional 26
times in EC member states to comply with VAT regulations, and employ 200
extra staff to amend its systems to the new requirements.
He called on the EC to require all countries to implement EC directives
fully and consistently in place of the existing haphazard system, and to
simplify the requirements for business transactions involving several
different countries.
Sony's comments were supported by Mr Peter Jenkins, head of the VAT practice
at accountants Ernst &amp; Young, who called the new system 'onerous and
burdensome'.
He said his clients complained of a lack of commercial awareness on the part
of EC officials, and difficulties for UK companies of negotiating with
customs officials in other member states.
The difficulties had been the direct result of the 'hybrid' transitional VAT
arrangements introduced in advance of the proposed move to a
destination-based system in 1997.
The views were rejected by EC officials. Mr Peter Wilmott, director general
of the customs and indirect taxation director in the EC Commission, called
the abolition of customs controls at the end of last year 'a great
achievement'.
He said work still needed to be done on an EC-wide system to exchange
information for audit and control in the VAT network.
He suggested that officials needed to consider amendments to the existing
VAT rules for privatised business, financial services and services linked to
goods such as repair work. He stressed that there was a very tight timetable
if the destination-based system is to be introduced by 1997.
Ms Valerie Strachan, chairman of HM Customs &amp; Excise, said she was very
pleased that more than 80 per cent of British companies were now filing the
monthly 'Intrastat' statistical returns required.
She claimed that an estimated Pounds 135m in net benefits to business last
year of the new system, after one-off start up costs, was 'not very far off
the mark'.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Britain wins EC reprieve for big motorcycles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH motorcycle enthusiasts have won a reprieve until the end of the
century from technical rules which would ban the sale of high-powered
machines in the European Community.
EC internal market ministers agreed yesterday on a 100 brake horsepower
limit for motorcycles registered in the Community after December 31, 1994,
in spite of another large and noisy demonstration by motorcycle enthusiasts
in Luxembourg.
But member states will have the right to a five-year exemption from the
rules. In practice, only the UK is likely to exercise that right. Other
governments will not be able to prevent the riding of machines up to 125
brake horsepower, and motorcycles registered before the deadline will escape
the restrictions, but EC countries will be allowed to outlaw the
re-registration of high-powered motorcycles after 1994.
The UK has been vociferous in defence of the large motorcycles, which it
claims are sold to a specialised market of expert riders, and do not reduce
road safety in Europe.
The European Commission has been asked to submit a study of the safety
record of the high-powered motorcycles by 1998.
Triumph, the revitalised UK motorcycle manufacturer, is one company which
will benefit from the exemption. It hopes to produce nearly 7,000
motorcycles this year, but five of its eight models would be illegal under
the EC rules. Even under the exemption Triumph would be prevented from
exporting those machines to the rest of the EC after 1994.
EC cosmetics makers will be banned from testing products on animals from
January 1, 1998, if alternative methods have been developed. Ministers
yesterday formally adopted a directive on the free movement of cosmetics,
but without the stricter amendments proposed by the European Parliament in
April, which would have banned all animal tests from the year 2000.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Recession forces France to trim interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday lowered a key official interest rate to combat deepening
recession in the economy.
The Bank of France cut the intervention rate, at which it meets most of the
financing needs of French banks, from 7.5 to 7.25 per cent, and its 5-10 day
repurchase rate from 8.5 to 8.25 per cent. The main commercial banks said
they would cut their base rates from 8.8 to 8.6 per cent on Thursday.
Last time the French authorities took the gamble of letting their rates fall
below those of Germany - in October 1991 - they had to raise them a month
later. This time, however, the rate reductions, which were welcomed Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, deputy Bundesbank president, look likely to stick, with the franc
staying strong inside the ERM yesterday.
In an interview before the new rates were announced, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy,
budget minister, said that, given this year's expected FFr317bn (Pounds
38bn) budget deficit, 'there is no more room in the budget other than that
we have already used' to try to lift the economy out of recession. He
acknowledged the reversal in policy: 'We came to power convinced of the need
to cut taxes, only to find we had to do the opposite to save social
programmes.'
For his part, Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, pleaded yesterday for
people to withold judgment on his jobs and economic recovery programme until
September because it could not produce any effects before then. Mr Sarkozy
forecast the programme's first results would not be evident until early
1994.
The government looks set later this week to revise its estimate of the
contraction in goods and services traded this year from 0.4 per cent to 0.8
per cent. However, it is pressing on with its programme to privatise some 21
state companies and to give the Bank of France autonomy in monetary policy.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Banks decide not to wait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French interest rates cut was a further indication that European central
banks are not waiting for Germany to ease monetary policy.
The last easing in the Bundesbank's monetary policy took place more than a
month ago when the central bank reduced the cost of lending D-Marks to
commercial banks via its 'repo' rate to 7.6 per cent. In spite of this, the
D-Mark has remained rather weak against most currencies as dealers grow
increasingly concerned by the scale of the German recession and the size of
its budget deficit.
Pressures on the D-Mark have led central banks to think they can cut rates
without fear of their currencies coming under pressure in the ERM.
Yesterday, the Bank of Portugal took a similar step to France's, cutting its
key mop-up rate by  3/4 of a percentage point to 11.25 per cent.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Danish central bank governor, was also reported as saying
that he would like to cut his country's interest rates as soon as possible,
and would not necessarily follow the Bundesbank. Speaking at the meeting of
central bank governors in Basle, he gave no indication of when this might
take place.
France's move had no effect on the French franc yesterday, which closed
unchanged at FFr3.363 to the D-Mark. However, the escudo closed lower at
Es95.00 per D-Mark from a previous Es94.90.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Women's advance reflects a fast-changing Turkey: John Murray
Brown puts the Moslem country's first female prime minister in her place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTION by Turkey's largest party of Mrs Tansu Ciller as party leader
and the country's first woman prime minister was explained in one Ankara
newspaper by the story that wives of the men who voted had threatened a
collective withdrawal of conjugal rights if she did not win.
Mischievous perhaps - the newspaper or the wives, depending on the truth -
but the story illustrates the point that there is a growing group of Turkish
women asserting themselves in ways which to the outsider may seem at odds
with Turkey's image as a conservative Moslem country. And Mrs Ciller is one
such woman.
She is unlikely to be quite as forthright as one of Turkey's most eminent
woman professors who told a recent conference that 'women's equality must
start in bed'.
But her advocacy of women's rights seems certain to occupy a high priority
in her policy agenda as she starts her first day as Turkey's new leader. The
47-year-old US-trained economist, is already well-known for having a husband
who took her maiden name.
Drop into her office in the new prime ministry and you are as likely to find
a group of Turkish girl guides lobbying her support, as a moustachioed male
adviser on the economy.
Turkey is changing dramatically, and women offer dramatic illustration of
those changes. Sociologists point out that the Turks were historically a
matriarchal society.
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the country's founder, enshrined women's equal
rights, gave them the vote in 1932 before much of Europe, banned the Moslem
'chador' or veil, saw women elected to the new parliament, even sent a
women's team to the 1936 Berlin Olympics.
Women account for two in 5 physicists and chemists; one in six lawyers,
judges and public prosecutors; one in six doctors; one in 10 government
administrators and one in 30 managers of private corporations.
In 1991, Turkey appointed its first woman provincial governor. Previously
the feeble reason given to exclude women from the post was that governors
were required to travel on horseback - something which was deemed unseemly
and quite possibly dangerous for a woman official.
By law women need their husbands' permission to work. Women are not allowed
to remarry within a year after a divorce. A number of municipalities have
established safe houses to treat women battered by their husbands, still a
widespread phenomenon.
But it is among the less-educated and particularly in rural areas where
women face the greater uphill struggle for their rights.
According to a study by the World Bank and the Erzurum University, women
account for a 59 per cent of the labour force, a statistic reinforced by the
briefest of contacts with the Turkish countryside where the sight of one man
'herding' a team of women in a field of chickpeas is not unusual.
Mrs Semra Ozal,wife of the late president Mr Turgut Ozal, did much to raise
the profile of women. Her Daisies foundation travelled the countryside
converting thousands of religious marriages into civil contracts, giving
women equal rights in inheritance and claims on children in a divorce.
The junior partners in the coalition, the Social Democrats have suggested a
quota system in parliament to ensure an even hand for women. People point
out that there were more women in parliament in Ataturk's time than today
where there are just eight deputies in the 450-member chamber. The strongest
female representation is in the right-wing Motherland party, with four women
members. Mrs Ciller's True Path party has two.
In the old coalition, Mrs Ciller was one of just two women ministers. Her
former ministerial colleague, Mrs Guler Ileri, a Social Democrat, was forced
to resign, the only casualty of the coalition government, over allegations
she purloined state funds allocated for a children's orphanage.
Today the only thing anyone remembers about Mrs Ileri is that she succeeded
in having a coiffure for women opened in the parliament building.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Somalis cast UN peacekeepers in role of tyrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHARRED remains of a young boy, burnt beyond recognition, marked the
place where US bombers pounded clandestine ammunitions dumps in Mogadishu
for the third night in a row.
Wailing women said as many as nine people had been killed in the pre-dawn
strike. For Somalis, the nightly raids bring back the nightmare of the
savage civil war that destroyed their capital. The difference is that this
time the attacks are from the foreign troops who were greeted with garlands
of flowers and songs when the United Nations launched its humanitarian
operation in Somalia last year.
'First they brought us food. Now they are bringing weapons,' a young man
said. 'We fear they have come to kill us.' The air attacks, which are aimed
at destroying the hidden weapons stores of Somalia's most defiant warlord,
General Mohamed Farah Aideed, have united the people of his south Mogadishu
fiefdom in blind hatred of the 12,000 UN troops stationed in the capital.
Even residents who bear the scars of Gen Aideed's brutality say they must
rally in defence of a man branded as a war criminal and a tyrant.
Yesterday was a day of mourning for the victims of a demonstration shot at
by Pakistani troops on Sunday. Heeding the call of Moslem prayers from
loudspeaker vans, hundreds of families walked to a parade ground. They held
their arms up to show the helicopters hovering overhead they were carrying
no weapons. The helicopters fired warning shots; the crowd would not budge.
The swaying arms turned into clenched fists. From prayers, the voices
curdled into angry slogans against the United States and the UN. The
commanders of the UN Blue Helmets are being dubbed 'Somalia's new warlords'.
'Look how they are behaving in our country,' said Ms Quman Ahmed Gurhar,
incensed with rage. 'We don't want the UN here. We are prepared to fight to
save Aideed. He is our leader, like Bill Clinton.' Pieces of shrapnel from
last night's air attack were being given to journalists as proof of further
senseless destruction of the city.
The rally was shaken by a loud explosion. UN helicopter pilots had fired a
shell at a rocket launcher hidden in a garden. They missed their target,
instead hitting a ramshackle tea stall where a young mother eked out a
meagre existence. She was alive when the crowd bundled her into a cart to
take her to Benazir hospital, but conditions there are primitive.
The UN came under some international criticism for the weekend shooting of
unarmed demonstrators which, according to the International Committee of the
Red Cross, left 38 dead.
Mr Fabio Fabbri, Italian defence minister, said such episodes discredited
the image of the UN and could, in the long run, jeopardise peace efforts in
other trouble spots of the world.
The US said it regretted the shootings, but announced it was stepping up
military activity by sending at least four more attack helicopters to join
action against Gen Aideed's forces. 'We are going to smack them as they need
to be smacked, hitting them as circumstances demand,' a Pentagon official
said.
In Germany, the opposition Social Democrats said they would take Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's government to court over its decision to send troops to
Somalia. An advance party of 225 German soldiers is already in the country
and 1,700 will be deployed there under current plans.
In Mogadishu, the UN hit back at accusations that Pakistani peacekeepers had
fired at unarmed civilians first. The UN spokesman said gunmen loyal to Gen
Aideed fired the first shots at a Pakistani-held building. 'Armed Aideed
gunmen used women and children as shields while they advanced on the
Pakistani unit,' US army Lt Col Kelvin McGovern told reporters.
He also accused Gen Aideed's militias of mutilating the 23 Pakistanis
ambushed at a feeding centre on June 5 - an act of cold-blooded murder which
sparked the present crisis.
But the Pakistani action last weekend has blotted out the memory of the
earlier atrocity and it is clear the presence of the 4,000-strong Pakistani
contingent is inflammatory.

FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS warns of rise in UK's net debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S overall debt position is deteriorating faster than any other
country in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, according to the
Bank for International Settlements.
The government's net debt will jump to 41 per cent of the nation's output
this year from 35.5 per cent unless action is taken to raise taxes or cut
spending, the bank's annual report made clear yesterday.
The bank warned that out of 18 industrial countries, only two - Sweden and
Finland - face bigger problems than Britain in curbing the increase of
public indebtedness.
BIS calculations suggest that if the government were to try to stabilise its
ratio of net debt to gross domestic product at the 1992 level, it would have
to raise taxes or cut spending by about 5.5 per cent of GDP or Pounds 33bn
this year. Net debt measures overall government debt minus the value of
public sector assets.
The Pounds 33bn compares with the government's March Budget package of
Pounds 17bn worth of tax increases spread over the three financial years
ending 1995-96 and the forecast British public sector borrowing requirement
of Pounds 50bn in 1993-94.
The BIS figures highlight the damage done to the government's finances by
the recession.
Of the 18 countries, only Ireland and Japan appeared able to avoid an
increase in their debt/GDP ratios this year, the BIS said. Without
specifically mentioning Britain, the report added: 'Debt stabilisation in
most countries would require a substantial tightening of fiscal policy, in
some cases beyond what is realistically possible.'
The bank blamed the suddenness of the UK's slide into debt on 'a relatively
deep recession and a number of expansionary measures (in public spending)'.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Venables not wanted at Spurs, Sugar says after ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, last night sought to impose
his authority on the troubled football club after winning the first round of
his legal battle with Mr Terry Venables, whose dismissal as chief executive
was upheld by the High Court.
Speaking with some bitterness, Mr Sugar said that he and his family had been
put through 'hell' by Mr Venables and that, in future, the north London club
would be run on 'correct' business lines.
As some fans threatened to boycott ticket sales and the club was warned that
several players might not renew their contracts, Mr Sugar said Mr Venables
had no future at Tottenham except in his role as a non-executive director.
'We don't want him at the club,' said Mr Sugar, 'and if I have anything to
do with it, he's not coming back at all.'
Mr Sugar was speaking after a senior High Court judge, Sir Donald Nicholls,
rejected an attempt by Mr Venables to extend the injunction preventing Mr
Sugar and the Tottenham board from sacking him as chief executive.
Hundreds of Spurs fans demonstrated their support for Mr Venables, cheering
as he left court.
Some supporters then threatened to starve Tottenham of ticket sales in an
attempt to force Mr Sugar to leave the club.
Mr Eric Hall, Mr Venables' commercial agent, who also represents several
Spurs players, said after the hearing: 'I represent about 12 players and
they've all told me in the last couple of days that they certainly will put
in for transfers and leave Tottenham Hotspur.'
Mr Sugar acknowledged that the battle between himself and Mr Venables had
damaged the club. However, he went on: 'Everyone has forgotten that this is
a company. What has happened is no different to what happens every day in
corporate life.'
Mr Venables insisted that he would pursue his court battle to force Mr Sugar
to sell him his 47 per cent share in the club. Mr Sugar said he would fight
that move vigorously.
The legal battle between the two men will resume this autumn or early next
year. However, Sir Donald yesterday said this move would probably prove
'difficult' for Mr Venables. He ordered Mr Venables to pay Mr Sugar's legal
costs.
Mr Sugar said the search for Mr Venables' replacement would now begin but
this would not be a hurried 'cosmetic' process. He would be talking to the
existing team management duo of Doug Livermore and Ray Clemence.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Thatcher steps in with conditional support for Major: PM
tries to end cabinet dispute over deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major's premiership last night won unexpected but conditional
support from Lady Thatcher as the right wing of the Conservative party
sought to set the terms for Mr Kenneth Clarke's chancellorship.
Lady Thatcher's intervention coincided with an effort by the prime
minister's office to put an end to the disarray in the cabinet over tax and
spending policies. Senior officials insisted the government could reduce
public borrowing without breaking its election pledges.
Downing Street's stance reinforced the impression that Mr Major wants Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, to avoid both increases in income tax
and draconian cuts in welfare spending in the November Budget.
Lady Thatcher described speculation about an early challenge to the prime
minister as 'ill-timed and ill-judged', while the right-wing 92 group of
Tory MPs signalled that they were ready to back Mr Major if he eschewed
increases in direct taxation.
The less-than-wholehearted endorsement of the prime minister by his
predecessor and her acolytes in the House of Commons was seen at Westminster
as a deliberate attempt to weaken Mr Clarke.
The new chancellor, still deeply distrusted by many on the Tory right, has
emerged as the clear favourite to replace Mr Major if the crisis in the
Conservative party threatens the prime minister's leadership.
Senior Whitehall officials stressed that nothing has been ruled out ahead of
the Budget. But Mr Major appears determined to stress the priority of
sustaining the economic recovery and maintaining tight spending controls,
thus downplaying the possibility of further tax increases.
The prime minister said last week that about 70 per cent of the Pounds
50bn-a-year deficit could be attributed to the impact on spending and
revenues of the recession.
His insistence yesterday on sticking to the manifesto followed conflicting
ministerial statements on how the government might square the apparent
circle between pledges to hold down taxes, increase spending and reduce
borrowing.
In an apparent left-right split in the cabinet, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, suggested at the weekend that pre-election
commitments could no longer be regarded as sacrosanct. But Mr Peter Lilley,
social services secretary, and Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, both
rejected the idea that the government could renege on its income tax
pledges.
Mr Clarke will underline his determination to curb the borrowing requirement
in his first keynote speech to a City audience at the Mansion House this
evening. On Thursday the cabinet is expected to endorse public spending
ceilings for the next two years at least as tough as the Pounds 253.6bn and
Pounds 263.3bn cash totals agreed for 1994-95 and 1995-96, if not tougher.
Senior officials said the prime minister's reaffirmation of manifesto
commitments did not foreshadow any relaxation of the prospective squeeze on
spending. Mr Major will this morning meet Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the Treasury, and Mr Lilley, to press forward with plans to
curb the Pounds 6bn-a-year budget for invalidity benefit.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Major tries to end cabinet dispute on tax and spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S office yesterday sought to put an end to cabinet disarray
over the government's tax and spending policies by insisting it could reduce
public borrowing without breaking its election pledges.
Downing Street's stance reinforced the impression that Mr Major wants Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, to avoid both increases in income tax
and draconian cuts in welfare spending in the November Budget.
It came as the 92 group of Tory backbench MPs indicated last night that the
right wing of the party would oppose fiercely any increase in direct taxes.
The influential group also launched a strong attack on Sir Norman Fowler,
the party chairman, for his public criticism last week of Mr Norman Lamont,
the former chancellor.
Senior Whitehall officials stressed nothing has been ruled out ahead of the
Budget. But Mr Major appears determined to stress the priority of sustaining
the economic recovery and of maintaining tight spending controls, thus
downplaying the possibility of further tax increases.
The prime minister said last week that about 70 per cent of the Pounds
50bn-a-year deficit could be attributed to the impact on spending and
revenues of the recession rather than to 'structural' imbalances in the
government's finances.
His insistence yesterday on sticking to the manifesto followed conflicting
ministerial statements on how the government might square the apparent
circle between pledges to hold down taxes, increase spending and reduce
borrowing.
In an apparent left-right split in the cabinet, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, suggested at the weekend that pre-election
commitments could no longer be regarded as sacrosanct. But Mr Peter Lilley,
social services secretary, and Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, both
rejected the idea that the government could renege on its income tax
pledges.
Mr Clarke will underline his determination to curb the borrowing requirement
in his first keynote speech to a City audience at the Mansion House this
evening.
On Thurday the cabinet is expected to endorse public spending ceilings for
the next two years at least as tough - if not tougher - than the Pounds
253.6bn and Pounds 263.3bn cash totals agreed last autumn for 1994-95 and
1995-96.
Senior officials said that the prime minister's reaffirmation of manifesto
commitments did not foreshadow any relaxation of the prospective squeeze on
spending. Mr Major will this morning meet Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the Treasury, and Mr Lilley, to press forward with plans to
curb the Pounds 6bn-a-year-budget for invalidity benefit.
The vague terms in which the manifesto was framed allowed significant
latitude on both spending and taxation changes, the officials said.
But in a significant change in rhetoric both Mr Major and Mr Clarke are now
emphasising the pre-eminent role in tackling the deficit of sustained
economic recovery.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Industrial groups join forces to bid on private rail
projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE of Britain's biggest industrial groups are joining forces to bid for
some of the large privately financed rail projects being promoted by the UK
government.
General Electric Company yesterday announced that it is to take an equal
share in Eurorail with Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping
and hotel group, and BICC, the engineering and construction company.
The emergence of the grouping is one of the strongest indicators yet of
private sector enthusiasm for the government's attempts to attract private
funding into public infrastructure.
Eurorail said yesterday it would seek to work with government agencies in
the development of the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail link, the Pounds 2bn
CrossRail project under London and a proposal to improve the main west coast
railway line between London and Glasgow, expected to cost at least Pounds
900m.
Lord Parkinson, a former Conservative transport secretary, was yesterday
appointed chairman of Eurorail. When in office, he rejected a joint bid by
BICC, Trafalgar House and British Rail in 1990 to build the proposed high
speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel because the public
subsidy required by the companies was regarded as too high.
The government has recently adopted a more positive attitude towards joint
ventures between private and public sector interests investing in
infrastructure projects.
The addition of GEC to Eurorail will complement the engineering and
construction skills of Trafalgar House and BICC as well as providing access
to GEC's financial strength.
Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, has previously indicated the group
might be prepared to invest some of its cash reserves of nearly Pounds 2bn
in private infrastructure projects.
GEC owns 50 per cent of GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French joint venture which
makes railway engines, rolling stock and power equipment.
Trafalgar House was part of the consortium which built the privately
financed toll road bridge across the River Thames at Dartford. BICC is part
of the consortium building the Barking Reach Power Station.

FT  15 JUN 93 / Venables not wanted at Spurs, Sugar says after ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, last night sought to impose
his authority on the troubled football club after winning the first round of
his legal battle with Mr Terry Venables, whose dismissal as chief executive
was upheld by the High Court.
Speaking with some bitterness Mr Sugar said that he and his family had been
put through 'hell' by Mr Venables and that, in future, the north London club
would be run on 'correct' business lines.
As some fans threatened to boycott ticket sales and the club was warned that
several players might not renew their contracts, Mr Sugar said Mr Venables
had no future at Tottenham except in his role as a non-executive director.
We don't want him at the club,' said Mr Sugar, 'and if I have anything to do
with it, he's not coming back at all.'
Mr Sugar was speaking after a senior High Court judge rejected an attempt by
Mr Venables to extend the injunction preventing Mr Sugar and the Tottenham
board from sacking him as chief executive.
Hundreds of Spurs fans again demonstrated their support for Venables
cheering, clapping and chanting, 'we'll support you evermore', as he left
court.
Some supporters responded by threatening to starve Tottenham of ticket sales
in an attempt to force Mr Sugar to leave the club.
Mr Eric Hall, Mr Venables' commercial agent who also represents several
Spurs players, said after the hearing: 'I represent about 12 players at
Tottenham Hotspur and they've all told me in the last couple of days that
they certainly will put in for transfers and leave Tottenham Hotspur.'
Mr Sugar acknowledged that the battle between himself and Mr Venables over
control of Tottenham had damaged the club. However, he went on: 'Everyone
has forgotten that this is a company. What has happened is no different to
what happens every day in corporate life.'
Mr Venables insisted that he would pursue his court battle to force Mr Sugar
to sell him his 47 per cent share in the club. Mr Sugar he would fight that
move vigorously.
The legal battle between the two men will resume this autumn or early next
year. However, Sir Donald yesterday said this move would probably prove
'difficult' for Mr Venables. He ordered Mr Venables to pay Mr Sugar's legal
costs.
Mr Sugar said the search for Mr Venables' replacement would now begin but
this would not be a hurried 'cosmetic' process.
He said he would be talking to the existing team management duo of Mr Doug
Livermore and Mr Ray Clemence, as well as the rest of the players as soon as
they returned from vacation.
The judge said he was aware Venables was popular with fans and players. 'I
have seen 700 letters expressing support for him and dismay at the prospect
that he may leave,' he said.
Teddy Sheringham, the Tottenham striker, said he was shocked by the court
ruling. 'To be ousted when he felt on the threshold of something great is a
crying shame.'

Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, the two largest US debt rating agencies, said
they were reviewing the ratings of H. J. Heinz for a possible downgrade,
writes Nikki Tait.
The announcements came after directors of Heinz, the Pittsburgh-based food
group, authorised the 'buy-back' of up to an additional 10m ordinary shares.
Heinz has an existing share repurchase programme, which began in December
1991 and was also for 10m shares. However, it now has only 300,000 shares
left to repurchase under this earlier authorisation.

FT  14 JUN 93 / General Motors warns VW over Spanish plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS of the US has warned Volkswagen of further legal action if it
goes ahead with plans for a revolutionary ultra-low-cost car production
plant in Spain.
A letter delivered at the weekend to Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the
German group, said a 'similar' project was prepared by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua while he was still employed by General Motors.
The warning was sent as Mr Lopez prepared to hold his first press
conferences since he defected from the US group to VW in March. In two
appearances today, in Hanover and later in Madrid, Mr Lopez is expected to
announce that Volkswagen will build a new super-lean production plant in his
Basque homeland, where cars can be built in less than half the time needed
in the average European factory.
Last week Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, said 'some especially interesting'
proposals had been put forward from regional authorities.
The GM letter represents a further step in the US group's campaign against
Mr Lopez, which is focused on charges, now under investigation by public
prosecutors in Germany, that he and several of his associates took top
secret industrial, model and marketing plans with them when they went to VW.
While still at GM, Mr Lopez shrouded his proposals for the so-called Plateau
6 works in secrecy. Numbered copies of all plans, including draft factory
drawings and car model designs, are still in the possession of the US
group's top executives.
Mr Lopez campaigned fiercely at GM for his Plateau 6 plant to be built in
his homeland, where he retains strong political connections. The US group's
refusal to comply, and its preference for any future investments to be made
in eastern Europe where costs are below those in the European Community, are
understood to be the main reasons for his stormy departure from Detroit in
March.
The Plateau 6 concept is aimed at improving production efficiency beyond the
levels achieved by Japanese manufacturers. The proposals include plans for
component suppliers to ship complete modules rather than single parts into
the works where their employees would install them in vehicles. Other
concepts include a wide range of differential pay rates for car assembly
staff, breaking with the standard practice of paying all line operators the
same basic wage.
Last month GM suffered its first important loss in its legal battle against
VW.
An initial attempt to prevent seven former employees of GM and Adam Opel,
the US group's German subsidiary, from working for VW for 12 months was
thrown out by a Frankfurt court.
The seven included former top members of Mr Lopez's buying team at GM, who
left the US shortly after their boss.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOLDIERS allowed several thousand people in the western port of St Marc to
march over the weekend in protest at the 1991 ousting of President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, AP reports from Port-au-Prince.
The march, an unusual act of tolerance, was one of several signs of growing
support for the reinstatement of Mr Aristide, Haiti's first democratically
elected president. Pro-Aristide and anti-army demonstrations have routinely
been crushed by soldiers since the coup.
In the capital, the presidents of Haiti's business associations met to draft
a declaration urging Aristide's reinstatement.
The draft called on parliament to recognise the exiled president's
legitimacy and to approve an Aristide-designated prime minister to head a
new government. In exchange, it asked Aristide to grant a general amnesty to
coup leaders and endorse all laws passed by parliament since he was ousted.
The army high command backs the proposal, according to a businessman close
to senior officers.
A consensus for Aristide's reinstatement is also building among legislators.
The National Assembly was due to convene today to begin working out a
solution.
The march was organised by Protestant churches in the city 60 miles to the
north of Port-au-Prince.
It has been the middle class, which supported the coup, that has grown
increasingly frustrated with the failure of military-backed governments to
find a way out of the crisis resulting from international economic sanctions
imposed after the coup.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investors will sign contracts with Chinese partners worth some
USDollars 80bn in 1993, according to a senior trade official in Beijing.
Mr Lin Kun, deputy director of foreign investment in China's trade ministry,
also said that China was planning further steps to open its markets to
overseas investors and these would be unveiled at a national symposium later
this year.
Hong Kong, Japan, the US, Taiwan and South Korea would spearhead the
continuing investment surge into China, Mr Lin told the English-language
Business Weekly: 'China's market is no longer potential, it's tangible.'
Official figures show that China signed agreements in 1992 involving Dollars
68.5bn in foreign capital, while foreign funds actually flowing into the
country last year totalled Dollars 11bn.
Mr Lin predicted that the main targets for investment this year would be the
automotive sector and onshore oil exploration. This latter was a reference
to the invitation to foreign companies to explore the Tarim basin prospect
in China's far west, described as one of the world's last great oil
frontiers.
China, facing energy and mineral shortages at home, is also conducting a
wide-ranging survey of investment prospects abroad, according to Mr Zhang
Hongren, vice minister of geology and mineral resources.
His ministry had launched preliminary studies of more than 20 countries in
Asia, the Americas and Africa, including Australia and Brazil, said Mr
Zhang.
Mr Lin said meanwhile that further steps to open China's automotive
industries to foreign participation would lead to a big jump in investment.
He noted that China had approved foreign involvement in only 10 domestic
automotive plants. 'These plants far from meet the soaring domestic demand
for automobiles.'
Mr Lin did not expect the continuing depreciation of the yuan - it fell 7
per cent to Yn10.7 to the dollar last week - would deter investors.

THE COUNTRY AND CLIMATE
Tunisia lies on the north-east corner of the Maghrib, less than three hours
from London. For more than 2,500 years, since Queen Dido arrived from Tyre
to found Carthage, which today is the residential suburb of the capital,
Tunis.
The climate is hot in summer (often up to 40 degrees C in Tunis, with higher
temperatures inland and in the south), temperate in spring and autumn. The
north is often windy and wet in winter, the climate more Continental as the
visitor travels inland towards the Algerian frontier. The deep south of the
country is true desert climate, more pleasant to visit in the winter and
spring than in summer.
The Tunisians remain very much as Thomas Shaw, the British traveller, wrote
of then in the early 18th Century: 'The most civilised people who inhabit
the coast of the Mediterranean. They addict themselves to trade and
commerce, which induces them to cultivate the friendship of Christians.'
GETTING THERE
Most leading Western airlines fly to Tunisia. GB Airways and Tunis Air have
direct flights from Heathrow or Gatwick six days a week. Visas are not
required for UK and most other western European and American visitors. The
dinar currency cannot be bought outside Tunisia.
BUSINESS HOURS
Government offices work a six-day week closing on Friday and Saturday
afternoons and Sunday. Banks and private companies work a five-day week.
Tunis is virtually closed down during August.
CAR HIRE
Cars are easy to hire at principal airports and hotels but are expensive. Do
not expect them to be in perfect condition. Tunisian roads are being
improved but local driving is, at best, erratic.
HOTELS
In general they are cheap and easy to find. The state has sold off virtually
all its hotels. Tunisia essentially attracts package holidaymakers. Some
hotels offer good service - the Abou Nawas, Africa and Hilton in Tunis, the
Abou Nawas in Gammarth, and the Syphax in Sfax. The Jerba Menzel on the
island of Jerba and the outstanding Tamerza Palace in the desert mountain
oasis of Tamerza offer excellent service and food and, for the latter, an
extraordinary setting.
EATING OUT
'Tunis is a land of liberty,' wrote Chevalier d'Arvieux, the French
diplomat, three centuries ago. 'Religion disturbs no one; they pray God when
they must, fast when they cannot do otherwise, drink wine when they have
money, get drunk when they drink too much and no-one finds any harm in it.'
Tunisians love good food and drink and the choice of restaurants is large.
In Tunis, L'Astragale and La Closerie are top of the range; the Dar Jeld
offers traditional Tunisian dishes such as 'couscous' in a tastefully
restored traditional house in the old medina. Chez Slah and Le Cafe Vert in
the suburb of La Goulette serve excellent fish; the Cercle Italien and
Paradiso good Italian and Tunisian food; Cesar, Chez Nous and Le Strasbourg
reasonable French food. In nearby Sidi Bou Said, L'Atlantide is good.
Further north, in Gammarth, Le Golfe is pleasant. On the corniche in the
port of Bizerta, 60 kilometres north of Tunis, L'Eden offers good food in
pleasant surroundings. In the deep south, the food at the Tamerza Palace is
outstanding.
Arts and craftsThe variety of good traditional crafts in Tunisia is limited.
The Office de l'Artisanat, Avenue Mohammed Cinq, offers the best choice to
those who are not specialists and do not wish to bargain for hours.
Tunisian carpets (Mergoum or Kairouan weaves) remain attractive, well made
and very reasonably priced. Old silver jewellery is difficult to locate but
can be found in the old medina of Tunis.
For those interested in Muslim architecture, the Association de Sauvegarde
de la Medina will be happy to show visitors around some of the old houses
and shrines of the city. The Bardo museum has the finest collection of Roman
mosaics to be found anywhere. One of the palaces of the former rulers, the
beys, at Ksar Said, has just been renovated and opened as a museum.
There are many private art galleries in a country which boasts some fine
modern painting. Among the best are Cherif Fine Arts and Ammar Fine Arts in
Sidi Bou Said, Gorgi Gallery in Mutuelleville, the Medina Gallery near the
Dar Jeld restaurant in the old medina, Chiyem Gallery and the Arts Gallery,
both in the new district known as El Menzah Six.
ECONOMICS
For economic information about Tunisia, there is little outside specialised
publications such as the Conjoncturte Review, edited monthly by the ministry
of economic affairs. Despite recent publications such as L'Economiste,
information in the local media is usually mediocre and often inaccurate.
BOOKS TO READ
All principal guide series have a volume devoted to Tunisia. For a lively
account of the country's recent political history, Aziz Krichen's Le
Syndrome Bourguiba published by Ceres Productions in Tunis is useful.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (13): Escaping Islam's past - The role of
women in society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the key reasons President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali is opposed to
granting legal recognition to the al Nahda (Renaissance) opposition party -
whose creed is Islam - is fear that such a move risks undoing what many
Tunisians regard as their country's proudest achievement since independence;
the corpus of laws which, in 1956, abolished polygamy and gave Tunisian
women rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world.
The 'Personal Status Code' is, arguably, former president Habib Bourguiba's
greatest single achievement. It was promulgated the year Tunisia gained
independence from France, a year before the new constitution that abolished
the monarchy.
The rights of women were further consolidated last August by the national
assembly. In the case of divorce, for instance, custody no longer goes
automatically to the husband. Violence against women within the family is
punishable, women can request a passport without going through their father
or husband and the state helps divorced women to secure alimony.
Since 1956 a policy of family planning has been in place. In the early 1960s
free and confidential advice and prophylactics were made available to women.
Combined with efforts to promote health and education, these policies
reduced population growth from 3.2 to 1.9 per cent. The birth rate has
declined from 45 to 25.4 per thousand, mortality from 15 to 6.1 per
thousand. The illiteracy rate has been brought down from 87.7 per cent to 35
per cent, though the figure is higher among women in poorer country areas.
Women are increasingly visible in teaching, medicine, architecture - in
factories as workers, engineers, managers and owners. But Tunisian politics
remains very much a man's world, despite some remarkable exceptions,
including Fethia Baccouche and Hanoun Houda, who are deputies, two
secretaries of state and a handful of senior civil servants such as Fayza
Kefi, whose presides over the Union Nationale des Femmes de Tunisie.
Most educated women have no lost love for the teachings of radical Islamic
groups. Though al Nahda leaders have said they accept many of Mr Bourguiba's
inheritance, women are mindful of the often violent track record of some
supporters of the party, notably the throwing of acid in the faces of
university students on the campus in Tunis.
History teaches women that radical Islam has not been sympathetic to the
idea of equality between sexes or to their presence in public places.
The history of modern Tunisia suggests that the emancipation of women has
been a key factor in explaining the country's social and economic progress
since 1956.
Economic progress has provided a means of emancipation which is far from
negligible. When a new law in 1973 allowed joint ventures to be established
for the first time in Tunisia with offshore tax status, a string of
factories set up across the country, giving many young women their first
taste of freedom.
The simple act of walking to work a few hundred yards from home, away from
the all powerful mother, broke many taboos. These women were not well paid
but what little they earned allowed them to build up a dowry and gain a
measure of freedom in choosing their husband. Once married, many were able
to claim help from the state to buy a flat.
Women have 25 per cent of all jobs in Tunisia, 35 per cent of jobs in
industry, 22 per cent of jobs in the growing services sector, 40 per cent of
jobs in agriculture, where they manage nearly 10 per cent of all farms. They
are present everywhere, seldom veiled, and give Tunis and other major towns
a strong Mediterranean feel.
Last year's laws are ahead of the social mores of many Tunisians, yet they
also reflect the fast changing attitudes affecting many sectors of society.
About ten per cent of new companies are created by women, according to Aziza
Dargouth, who runs the Cabinet de Prospective Sociale consulting agency.
Hayet Laouni had her first job as secretary in a shipping company, 26 years
ago, after training to become a primary school teacher. She now owns and
runs Stumar, a company with turnover of Dollars 3m and is active in
stevedoring, conveyancing and forwarding. She concedes it has not been easy
for a woman to win acceptance in such a milieu, but as she moves around her
office, cigarette in hand, firing orders, inquiring whether a particular
container has arrived, the feeling Tunisia is undergoing a quiet revolution
is overwhelming.
Sarah Sahdallah owns and runs a porcelain factory, Ibtissem Kamoun has
become one of Tunisia's largest producers of ice-cream, Rashida Rouissi
exports fruit and vegetables. Scores of others are involved in textiles, ice
cream and software.
Such people would not quarrel with the policy of the Minister of Education,
the highly respected Mohammed Charfi, who is having references in school
text books that men are superior to women and adulterous women be stoned
expurgated. The books of Hassan El Banna, the founder of modern
fundamentalism, have been withdrawn from schools and public libraries. To
western critics of such moves, many Tunisians point out that wealthy Saudis
have, for the past two decades, been subsidising the printing and
distributing of books offering the most conservative interpretation of
Islam. Why should they be criticised for trying to promote more liberal
views?
Educated Tunisian women are well aware that some of their sisters support al
Nahda. They agree with attempts to liberalise the economy and are convinced
economic growth and a more broadly liberal society are the only serious ways
to fight radical Islam. They are fearful of the possible spillover effects
of events in neighbouring Algeria and Egypt.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (14): Tourism's unattractive side - There
are fears that Tunisia could be about to lose its charm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUNISIA'S tourist sector has grown quickly in recent years. Capacity has
doubled to 140,000 beds since 1980 and new hotels under construction and
building permits suggest that figure could rise to 200,000 by 1998.
Investment in new hotels nearly doubled to Dinars 200m between 1990 and
1992, with more than 3m visitors traveling to the shores of North Africa's
smallest country every year, earning it between Dinars 830m and 930m.
Tourist receipts cover between 50 and 100 per cent of the trade deficit,
amounting to about one fifth of exports of goods and services. The sector
accounts for 5 per cent of GDP and 5 per cent of all investment. The jobs
its creates - 40,000 directly and 150,000 indirectly - are welcome in a
country with few natural resources.
This success story does, however, have its less attractive side. An ever
growing number of Tunisians are wondering what will be left of their
coastline as they watch the inexorable advance of concrete in places like
the island of Jerba. They also wonder what will be left of Hammamet, already
the busiest tourist area in the country, when another 13,000 beds are added
by the massive Hammamet Sud development.
Tunisians with long experience in this sector worry about what they see as
the 'cheapening' of the Mediterranean's cheapest destination for package
tour travellers. They say the strategy encouraging growing numbers of beds
to be built in hotels with low occupancy rates except in summer is
fundamentally flawed. Such a strategy gives international tour operators,
who already dominate the Tunisian market, an ever stronger hand.
Critics say that some figures are misleading. The tourists who really matter
are Europeans, but the figures here have not changed much since the late
1980s - 1.6m to 1.8m annually. The balance is made up of Libyans and
Algerians whose presence is either fluctuating or at times unwelcome.
Critics say the policy of subsidising interest rates on bank loans for new
hotels should be curtailed. They also say that - despite official
encouragement to young entrepreneurs - the cost of money means that only
wealthy Tunisians can afford to build new hotels. The sector has attracted
many new rich Tunisians whose love of bricks and mortar is far above any
professional capacity they might have to manage a hotel.
The critic's fears are borne out by what is happening in Tabarka, a small
port lying close to the Algerian frontier. A massive new development of ten
thousand beds is under way, three thousand of which have been built. The
style of new hotels, such as the Mehari Beach, look like a pale imitation of
California. The size of the new buildings sit uncomfortably with the small
houses in the town, which is surrounded with coark oaks at the foot of the
Kroumir mountains.
Activities are more varied here than in any other Tunisian resort. Golfers
enjoy a spectacular new course virtually all year round, sailors and divers
are attracted by the summer months. There is boar hunting in autumn and
winter. Is it wise, critics ask, for the state to spend TD250m in
infrastructure, including the cost of a new airport? Would it not have been
more judicious to build a fast road to Tunis and cut the time of travelling
to the capital from three-and-a-half to one-and-a-half hours? This would
have encouraged a flow of visitors throughout the year, quite a part from
the benefits it would have brought local farmers.
The consequences of careless development is increasingly visible in the
south, where small oasis such as Douz are being ruined by hotels whose
architecture destroys the very character of what is a uniquely fragile
desert environment. In nearby Tozeur, new hotels ignore local architectural
style. Yet, due north of Tozeur, in the mountain oasis of Tamerza, an
architect, Mr Foued Elleuch, and a hotel manager who knows the region well,
Mr Mouldi Hached, have produced the perfect Shanghri La. The architecture of
the Tamerza Palace blends perfectly with the crumbling desert mountains
against which it is set. It sits dramatically above the abandoned village
and oasis of Tamerza.
The interior is a masterpiece of simple design, well suited to the
barrenness of the desert, which sprawls beyond its walls. The service is
excellent and the food delicious. The hotel is attracting discerning
travellers. Its success raises key questions about the direction Tunisian
tourism will take.
Either the authorities want to encourage the building of smaller hotels
tailored to a specific clientele, who have money to spend, or they will
continue to encourage the ever growing spread of uninspired architecture;
hotels for mass tourism whose foreign earning power is increasingly in doubt
and whose presence is destroying many areas of the country.
In the book 'Medinas' recently published by Dar Ashraf Azouz, the French
architect, Claude Santelli, raises a cry of alarm about the number of old,
colonial buildings being pulled down. Roman ruins are also being desecrated,
such as the pier at Thapsus.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (12): Covers come off real history -
Memories of the Jewish past are being unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHTEEN months after succeeding Mr Habib Bourguiba as Tunisia's second
president, Mr Zine el Abidine Ben Ali paid a state visit to France. All the
usual trappings of a state visit were in evidence, including a few hours
spent at the Saint Cyr Coetquidan military academy which the young officer
had attended 30 years earlier. More unusual was the restaurant at which Mr
Ben Ali chose to have dinner on his first night in Paris - Chez George de
Tunis, Rue Monmartre, is a typically Tunisian Jewish restaurant, of which
there are many in this arrondissement of Paris.
Last September, the chief rabbi of France, Mr Joseph Sitruk, was invited
back to the country where he was born. The rabbi was shown round the
presidential palace by the head of state in person and the news was featured
on prime time television.
This gesture marked a break in the arabisme of the past two decades. It
brought back memories of Mr Bourguiba's bold suggestion, made in Amman in
1965, that only when the Israelis and the Palestinians sat down together
would there be any hope for peace.
To mark the fifth anniversary of his accession to power last November, the
president attended a ceremony where Tunisian history was evoked with a
greater measure of truth than ever before. Never since 1956 had Tunisian
people been reminded that a majority of their countrymen were Christians
until just over 1,000 years ago. The vast majority of this Sunni Moslem
country had no idea that Shi'ite Islam had flourished under the Fatimid
dynasty which ruled in the ninth and 10th centuries. The menorah candlestick
was paraded, a reminder of the more than 2,000 years of Jewish presence in
the country.
Tunisia's personality is complex, its richness lies in its diversity. Legend
has it that the Ghriba synagogue of the southern island of Jerba was built
around a stone prised from the eastern wall of King Solomon's temple in
Jerusalem brought by a group of Jews after its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar
in 586BC. The synagogue, according to another account, takes its name from a
Jewish woman who reached Jerba, carrying a stone in her hand. She became
known on the island as al Ghriba,the stranger, who, after living an
exemplary life, died, leaving no trace.
The annual pilgrimage held in memory of Rabbi Meir Ba'al Haness and Rabbi
Shimon Bar Yochal takes place annually a few weeks after Passover. This year
it attracted 2,000 Jews, the largest number in decades.
Seven hundred of an estimated 2,000 Jews in Tunisia live on the island,
happily co-existing with the local inhabitants who belong to the Ibadite
rite of Islam which is the dominant rite in Oman and in the southern
Algerian town of Ghardaia. Ibadites in north Africa are traditionally
tolerant, learned and excellent traders. Indeed, hospitality as they
practise it is described by the great Arab poet Omar Khayyam as deeply
etched on to Jerba - 'the clay whispered to the potter who pounded it;
remember I was once as you are, do not handle me roughly.'
History recalls the presence of Jews in Tunisia, notably in Carthage nearly
2,000 years ago. A large necropolis was discovered in the 1970s, probably
the burial ground of those Jews descended from others who had taken refuge
in north Africa after the second destruction of the temple by the Roman
emperor Titus in 70AD.
Unlike the events in many Arab countries after the creation of Israel the
Tunisian Jews, who at the time of independence numbered around 50,000 and
had acquired French nationality, did not leave the country under duress.
Moving to France was natural as that country offered greater opportunities.
One Tunisian Jew who did stay and is now a successful businessman is Mr
Roger Bismuth, who still lives in the suburb of La Goulette, just outside
Tunis, an area which in colonial days was synonymous with Jewish and
Sicilian ways of life.
Following the French Great Rabbi's visit, the Tunisian authorities lifted
the freeze on funds belonging to Tunisian Jews. That money can now be spent
in Tunisia.
Official recognition of the diversity of Tunisian history is taking other
forms. The role of the former rulers of Tunisia, the 'beys', is now
officially recognised. Since the last bey, Lamine, was deposed in 1957, the
very memory of their existence had been erased. One of their palaces near
Tunis, at Ksar Said, has recently been restored.
All these gestures come at a time when Tunisian leaders are liberalising the
management of the country's economy. Foreign investment is being encouraged
and some Tunisian entrepreneurs are now investing abroad. No one expects
former Tunisian Jews to come back and settle in Tunisia but they could prove
useful relays in marketing Tunisian goods abroad or joining with Tunisians
in joint ventures in the land where they lived for so many centuries.
International marketing is one of the skills which still eludes many
Tunisian businessmen.
Former Tunisian Jews are well established, notably in Paris. Most of them
have fond memories of Tunisia - for centuries they shared many cultural
values not least music and many business interests. As the Tunisian film,
The Man of Ashes, so eloquently showed, the cultural symbiosis between the
two communities ran deep. A number of Tunisian families played an important
role in the struggle for independence.
During the Vichy and the Italian-German occupation, 1940 to 1943, many
Tunisian Jews found refuge and help with their Moslem rather than their
French brethren. Mr Ben Ali shares such memories of close relations with
Jews with many Tunisians. His childhood days were spent in Hamman Sousse
during the Second World War.
Closer links with the Jewish community, if they develop, could have other
beneficial consequences. They could encourage moves to liberalise the
economy further. They could force greater transparency in economic
operations. Such links could encourage foreign investment and trade, greater
freedom of expression.
Mr Ben Ali's welcoming hand in no way belies his support for the Palestinian
Liberal Organisation. The president has said he would be happy to host a
meeting between the PLO leader Mr Yasir Arafat and the Israeli prime
minister. The president's policy might simply help Tunisia recover its
memory and thus bring it closer to Europe.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (11): New age dawns in old town - A fresh
generation is coming of age in Bizerta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE years after Tunisia gained independence from France, in 1956, the town
of Bizerta was the scene of a bloody battle which pitted General de Gaulle
against President Habib Bourguiba. Mr Bourguiba was keen to regain control
of the important naval base France had built after it occupied the country
in 1881, and which it was unwilling to hand back.
For 75 years, this former privateering port ranked, along with Mers El Kebir
in western Algeria and Toulon, as one of France's key naval bases. The town
retains most of its colonial architecture, a port dominated by old
fortifications, and its old 'medina' (Arab quarter). Only four hotels have
been built on the nearby corniche - tourism has not ruined the town.
Bizerta was cosmopolitan thanks to the mix of tens of thousands of French
army and navy men and officers, Sicilian fishermen, Maltese handymen, a
smattering of Greeks and White Russian exiles fleeing the 1917 revolution.
Unlike Tunisians elsewhere, the people of Bizerta did not have to fight to
make a living. Few of them became doctors or lawyers. They did not much care
for Mr Bourguiba who did not bother to hide his contempt.
Times are changing and no man could symbolise the new mood better than Mr
Mohamed Ben Rejjeb, who was appointed governor two years ago. Mr Ben Rejjeb
is a hands-on governor, a tireless fighter who seems to be present on every
front coaxing people, pushing others, getting Bizerta's needs noticed in the
capital which, psychologically, still feels more distant than the 60
kilometres separating the towns.
Three factors explain this awakening of Bizerta and its rich farming
hinterland. First, a new generation of 'Bizertins' is coming of age,
well-educated people who want to invest in industry and farming. They have
no nostalgia for an age they never knew. They know that the port and other
industrial facilities, many still unused, which dot the town and the shores
of the large inland lake behind Bizerta - connected to the sea by a wide
canal - offer prime industry sites. A free trade zone, an idea which appears
to make sense, both because Bizerta is strategically placed between the
eastern and western Mediterranean and because Tunisia is liberalising its
economy and actively promoting foreign investment, is expected shortly. This
zone will be managed by a private joint venture associating Tunisian and
foreign capital. A second trade zone is being set up in the southern port of
Zarzis, close to the Libyan frontier.
The industrial sector is strong and varied. There is the country's primary
oil refinery, steelworks at nearby El Fouled, a string of textile factories
 -many started in the mid-1970s by German and French companies which import
the fabric that is then re-exported as jeans, shirts and hosiery. Expensive
'Van Lack' German shirts are made here.
Bizertex manager, Mr Ferinand Terburg, who has lived in Bizerta for 15
years, is looking forward to the company soon opening its third factory in
the town. He praises his workforce's standard of education and professional
skill, saying that 18 per cent of the 500 women working in the factory are
involved in quality checking. He feels the political stability Tunisia
enjoys, the three-year agreements negotiated between the trade unions and
employers' federation, provide a steady environment where he can work. He
adds that government officials are more willing to consider changes to
existing rules and regulations than they were a decade ago.
More ambitious plans are afoot in the farming town of Mateur, just inland
from Bizerta, where Tunisia's leading producer of electrical cables, the
Chakira Group, has started production of electrical harnesses for cars in a
plant where, until 1986 when it went bankrupt, Renault cars were assembled.
The Chakira group already produces harnesses in another factory in Tunisia,
part of a joint venture with General Motors.
Other companies in the group are involved in manufacturing printed circuits
and high-voltage, medium-voltage and low-voltage power cables. Other
activities include manufacturing kitchen equipment such as high-pressure
cookers and 'Tefal' saucepans. Such a company may be small by international
standards but it is symbolic of the internationalisation of the economy.
Indeed, it is investing abroad and will this summer start producing
electrical harnesses in Portugal and in Egypt.
The region of Bizerta is also attracting investment in farming. Natural
advantages include more regular rainfall than elsewhere in the country and
good land. Ninety per cent of all arable land in the region is in the hands
of private farmers, which means the mismanagement of the vast public domains
created in the 1970s out of land expropriated from former French colons has
been avoided. What state land there is is being conceded on long leases to
private companies.
Typical of new farming businesses is the joint venture established by a
Tunisian company with one of Italy's largest plant and flower companies,
Resteya Italia, whose home base is Treviso, north of Venice. Geranium mother
plants are imported to Bizerta in the autumn and cuttings are taken a few
months later and rebedded. When they have grown roots, they are flown to
Treviso. Similar attempts are being made with artichoke plants which, if
successful, could prove lucrative. Such ventures can make use of the
region's temperate winter climate and cheaper labour costs than in Europe.

   DEVELOPING THE southern provinces of Tunisia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
running from the Algerian frontier around the Shott El Jerid, the salty
flatlands which, during the hot summer months turn into a hard salty crust
stretching for miles, to the port of Gabes, opposite the tourist island of
Jerba - presents a unique challenge.
The western provinces of Tozeur, Gafsa and Kebili traditionally belong to
the bled siba, the land of dissidence whose inhabitants led a nomadic life
until the 1960s and seldom paid taxes to the rulers in Tunis.
Though often illiterate, the inhabitants of the Jerid and Nefzaoua region
south of the Shott had a rich tradition of urban life and boasted one great
source of wealth, the deglet nour or date of light, considered by
connoisseurs the finest in the world.
During the past few years tourism has emerged as a new source of income but,
even more important, is the development of fruit and vegetables such as
melons and tomatoes, which are grown in greenhouses using the many local hot
water springs and whose produce can be shipped to Europe between
mid-November and mid-May when no EC quotas or tariffs impede their entry.
If not carefully managed, however, the fast development of such crops and
the spread of new hotels could seriously threaten the environment and the
balance of human resources of a fragile desert region.
The new face of Tunisian agriculture can be seen near Gabes, where a
Tunisian agricultural engineer, Mr Nejib Zarrouk, has established a joint
venture with a group of French businessmen who grow melons near Chinon in
the Loire valley and market them through a company called Derby. Half the
DT1.7m capital, of which DT500,000 is so far paid up, is provided by the
so-called Beregovoy line of subsidised credit and administered in Tunisia by
France's Caisse Centrale de Cooperation, the rest is spread among Tunisian
banks, most notably the Tunisian Saudi Development Bank, Stusid.
A long lease for the necessary three hectares has been secured from the
Tunisian state and in 1992, the first year of activity, 220 tonnes of
tomatoes and 76 tonnes of high quality melons were exported to France.
Figures will more than double for the second season ending in May.
The Chenchou success story is a pointer to the future as the Tunisian state
is leasing an ever growing surface of its 500,000-hectare domain, foreigners
are allowed to invest in land and bright young Tunisian engineers are keen
to start up their own business.
Thanks to an ambitious deep water drilling programme financed by the Gulf
states and Saudi aid, undreamed of riches in water have been discovered. As
the standard of living increases and more people establish irrigated crops,
the authorities face two problems. The first is how to control irrigation
schemes that are increasingly set up without permission, the second is how
to drain water after it has been used.
In traditional oases the date palms and the fruit and vegetable which grow
below were set up on slopes to allow the water to drain away. Faulty
drainage can have a lethal effect as it allows salt to accumulate, a sure
way to sterilise the land and kill date palms.
Ensuring proper drainage is essential, particularly at the 1,152-hectare
oasis of Rjim Maatoug, a new oasis being created west of Kebili and financed
by EC aid worth DT15m, Italian aid worth DT7m and DT10m worth of Tunisian
funds. The high cost of the Rjim Maatoug project is justified in terms of
the broader security of an area close to the Algerian frontier. When
completed, the project will help settle local nomadic tribesmen. The project
is being managed by the army, together with civilian authorities, a
combination that in the harsh and difficult to reach surroundings appears to
be working well.
The fast development of tourism poses a different challenge. Quite apart
from the danger of spoiling a unique landscape with hotels whose style jars
surrounding buildings, hotels attract labour away from farming and that
means essentially looking after date palms. This is a very labour intensive
and skilled job. The palms must be individually pollinated by hand, the
dates hand-picked. The sight of young boys scrambling up date palms may be
picturesque. Such skills, however, are becoming less available, but
essential for future crops.
A further challenge is to improve the marketing of dates abroad. Despite the
high quality of the deglet nour, half the dates the Jerid produces are
marketed through a few traders in Marseilles, depriving Tunisia of direct
access to many markets. Packaging is way behind modern international
standards. In other words, Tunisia lacks access to a good international
distribution network. Dates are the kind of farm produce from which the
country should be earning good foreign income. They are labour intensive and
do not compete with any EC equivalents.
Many older oases have been virtually abandoned, their intricate foggara
water channels ill kept, if not abandoned. Inhabitants of such remote places
are often not keen to work in hotels.
In the mountain oasis of Tamerza due north of Tozeur, the only local baker
refuses to deliver bread to the Tamerza Palace, a hotel which opened last
year. On Sunday he remains closed forcing the hotel to send for its bread 20
kilometres away in Redeyef. People from Tamerza show no interest in jobs
provided by the hotel, but small settlements further afield are less
disdainful of such jobs.
Developing this remote area of Tunisia presents a unique set of challenges.
Three constraints, which are intimately related, touch on water resources,
human skills and the environment. They must be taken into account if serious
damage is to be avoided. Mistakes here carry a heavier price than in the
more temperate northern or maritime provinces.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (9): Oiling the wheels of the workers -
The 55m olive trees in Tunisia occupy one third of all arable land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE olive tree has been a source of wealth, a symbol of peace and prosperity
since time immemorial around the Mediterranean. In Tunisia, olives were
grown well before Carthage was founded by Queen Dido in 814BC and the very
name Zaytuna Mosque, which dominates the old medina of Tunis and houses one
of the oldest Islamic universities in the world, means 'olive tree'. The
production and trading of olive oil remains a quintessentially Mediterranean
phenomenon.
Some olive oil is produced in Argentina and California but Italy, Spain,
France, Greece and Tunisia - the fifth largest producer - account for the
bulk of the 1.7m tonnes produced in the world every year. Of this figure, 75
per cent comes from southern Europe, the balance from Tunisia, with 7-10 per
cent, Jordan, Morocco and Turkey.
Three sets of figures underline the central importance of this sector to the
Tunisian economy. More than one third of all farms in the country derive
more than half their income from the production and sale of oil; nearly 1m
Tunisians draw part of their income from the same source. Between 1987 and
1992, olive oil accounted for 8 per cent of the value of all Tunisian
exports and 42 per cent of the value of exports of foodstuffs.
The 55m olive trees the country boasts occupy one third of all arable land,
notably in the arid central provinces around the city of Sfax where the poor
soil could not accommodate other crops; the trees also provide one of the
best means of fighting desertification. A further advantage is that the
number of jobs generated by the olive oil industry puts a brake on migration
to the cities.
The production of olive oil does, however, fluctuate strongly from 50,000
tonnes in years of drought to 270,000 tonnes in exceptional years such as
1992. Domestic consumption accounts for about 40,000 tonnes annually. The
balance of requirements, about 110,000 tonnes, is made up by importing much
cheaper sunflower and colza oil. Olive oil is four times as expensive as the
mixture of olive and sunflower oil most Tunisians use for their daily
requirements.
Tunisia cannot export all its surplus oil because its annual export quota to
the EC is only 46,000 tonnes. Nearly 90 per cent of Tunisian exports go to
EC countries. Italy alone absorbs more than two-thirds of Tunisian oil
exports to the EC. Tunisia pays a tariff of Ecu5-10 per 100 kilogrammes of
olive oil, compared to ECU55 for Moroccan and Turkish exports, for which
there is no quota.
The glut of olive oil which followed the 1991-1992 crop has made life
exceptionally difficult for the Tunisian Office National de l'Huile, which
has a monopoly on collecting olive oil in the country and manages virtually
all exports. World production last year reached a record 2.2m tonnes, as all
Mediterranean countries recorded a bumper crop, something which occurs once
in a generation.
Tunisia's record crop was not simply the result of excellent weather
conditions but because of the improved farming methods and replanting of
olive trees encouraged in recent years. Producers have also been encouraged
by the prices paid by the Office National de l'Huile which have increased by
half since 1987-1988.
The office has been obliged to stock olive oil and has been forced to borrow
from Tunisian banks at market rates. Since 1990, the office no longer enjoys
access to subsidised loans, part of the overall policy of rationalising
economic management. Private companies have begun exporting olive oil but
the main burden of selling abroad still rests very much with the office.
The reason why Tunisia cannot gain a bigger quota with the EC concerns the
subsidies EC members are allowed to give their own producers of olive oil.
Subsidies are extended to primary producers and to the olive oil processing
industry.
Subsidies for the export of olive oil outside the EC are equivalent to 50
per cent of the value of exports and the EC has even started promoting the
consumption of olive oil in such far away markets as Japan and Australia.
Italy is also widely believed to provide bogus figures for its own
production of olive oil. It imports Tunisian oil which it re-exports under
Italian labels, notably to the US.
In its annual report for 1991, the EC Court of Auditors criticises the
manner in which subsidies to the olive oil industry are distributed within
the EC and suggests it is 'unreliable'. It also criticises the manner in
which the International Olive Oil Council, which was set up in 1986, is
managed. The EC provides 74 per cent of the budget of the Olive Oil Council.
The EC Commission, however, has rejected such criticism.
The difficulty the Tunisians have in exporting more of what, for them, is a
vital crop, illustrates the conflict of interest between Maghreb and
southern European countries which centres on foodstuffs produced on both
shores of the Mediterranean. But Tunisian officials argue that if the real
figures of EC production and subsidies were available, their country would
be able to gain an increase in its quota without damaging the interests of
EC producers.
The broader question is whether it is morally justifiable for the EC to
close its eyes to certain practices among its own members and at the same
time limit imports from countries in North Africa who desperately require
funds for projects aimed at stopping the advance of the desert and halting
the exodus from the land.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (8): Agriculture is reborn - A quiet
revolution under way in the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUIET revolution is afoot in the Tunisian countryside. Production of a
wide range of foodstuffs - cereals, olive oil, fruit, vegetables, meat and
dairy products - is increasing. The variety and quality of produce on offer
in local markets and for export is growing.
Four consecutive years of good rainfall have played their part. But so have
government policies, which in recent years have lent greater support to
farming than at any time in the past 30 years.
Several factors lie behind what amounts to a rebirth.
Long-standing efforts to improve farming techniques have borne fruit.
Considerable efforts have been made to mobilise water resources.
Life on the land is less harsh than before, thanks to improved roads,
electricity and better access to education and health in remote areas.
The state is divesting itself of some of the land it has held since French
farms were 'nationalised' in 1964. These 500,000 hectares of state land are
among the richest in Tunisia.
Wheatfields in Tunisia no longer sprout poppies, which made them attractive
to visitors in the spring but suggested low yields and poor use of
fertilisers. The growing use of the latter has proved a key factor in
improving yields and overall quality. Farmers are also mastering irrigation
techniques, at a time when the amount of land under irrigation is growing
fast. Improving their mastery of water is essential in a country whose
resources are scarce and which suffers drought at regular intervals.
The state has given strong backing to efforts to build dams. In recent
years, however, small earthenware dams have been promoted, which are cheaper
and easier to build and play an important role in arresting soil erosion.
Erosion remains a serious problem that is being addressed in a number of
ways, notably the planting of fruit trees in northern and central Tunisia
and the renewal of the vast olive groves - the olive tree remains the best
instrument to stop the advance of the desert in central Tunisia.
Life in the countryside is also improving for those who till the land. For
more than two decades after independence life in the towns, with access to
good facilities in education and health and subsidised food, was more
attractive than tilling the land. As Tunisia liberalises its economy,
allowing the price of foodstuffs to rise and gives farmers a better income,
that balance is slowly shifting.
The leasing over the past three or four years of 100,000 hectares of some of
the best land in the country, for up to 25 years to private investors, is
introducing more capital intensive and modern crops to the land. These
leases are renewable and joint ventures with foreign companies are being
actively promoted. During the socialist experiment in the 1960s, these state
domains were badly mismanaged. Then, and for the following ten years, the
prices producers could charge were frozen, basic foodstuffs increasingly
subsidised. The domains being leased can be large, such as a 1,000 hectare
domain at M'Raissa, where Shell, in partnership with private Tunisians, is
growing seedless grapes for export. Other domains have been split into
smaller units with leases often granted to agricultural engineers who are
growing crops new for Tunisia - winter strawberries and melons, asparagus
and mushrooms. Some are raising rabbits, an unheard of activity here until
recently, which find ready markets in the many hotels along the coast.
The current improvement can be traced back to the reforms aimed at
liberalising the management of the country's economy introduced in 1986.
Prices paid to producers have, since then, improved 40 per cent on average.
The cost of inputs has also shot up; fertilisers by 60 per cent, seeds a
more modest 25 per cent and water 9 per cent annually. As subsidies on basic
foodstuffs are reined in, the result is that resources are being reallocated
towards a key sector of the economy in more rational fashion. The results
are visible.
In 1991-1992 Tunisia enjoyed a positive food balance for the first time in
two decades. Barley and hard wheat are in surplus, though a deficit remains
in soft wheat. The amount of rainfall still dictates the size of the cereal
crop, which can vary from 300,000 tonnes to 2.4 million tonnes. In a good
year, foodstuffs account for 10 per cent of all imports, a figure that rises
sharply in years of drought.
Some sectors have not followed the progress of others. Vineyards have
suffered until very recently from under investment. A few years ago Tunisia
nearly ran short of wine during the summer season - a Moslem country
importing wine would have been a real embarrassment for the authorities. Had
joint ventures with foreigners been encouraged earlier, Tunisia today could
be exporting high quality wines.
Olive oil presents a unique difficulty, as the European Community imposes
quotas. Italy is not shy when it comes to mixing Tunisian olive oil with its
own and selling it as Italian oil. The production of olive oil is the main
source of income for 100,000 families and helps provide income for 1 million
people overall. It also helps the environment - olive trees are the best way
of preventing erosion.
Two constraints, however, hamper the further development of farming. First
is the ever-growing fragmentation of ownership, with 80 per cent of all
farms boasting 20 hectares or less. The result is often poorly capitalised
farms and a major brake on progress. The other constraint is age - the
average Tunisian farmer is over 50. This weakness can to some degree be
remedied if farming in the newly leased state domains is made more
attractive.
As Tunisia is ever more self-sufficient in many products and seeks to export
more food it is confronted with new difficulties. EC quotas are one, but
also the lack of regular high quality control, the backwardness of packaging
and marketing methods. The next battle will be fought on these fronts.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (7): Bright hopes for energy / Examining
the future of the oil and gas sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUNISIA is, by Middle Eastern standards, a very small producer of oil and
gas - 5.19m tonnes of oil last year and 231,000 tonnes of oil-equivalent in
gas.
However, the royalties, in the form of gas, Tunisia receives from the
trans-Mediterranean pipeline that carries Algerian gas to Italy, gives it
access to three times as much gas as it produces.
The share of natural gas in meeting the country's growing requirements is
steadily increasing.
Two factors will ensure that the share of gas in meeting Tunisian energy
requirements continues to grow. First is the doubling, over the next five
years, of the volume of Algerian gas Italy has contracted to buy, which
spells a doubling of royalties to Tunisia; second is the development, by
British Gas, of the Tunisian offshore Miskar gas field, the production of
which will meet domestic requirements.
The last four years have also witnessed a surge of oil exploration and
development as more international oil companies are attracted by the
favourable environment Tunisia offers, including tax incentives, stable
government and pleasant living conditions.
Conoco's senior director of exploration, Mr Alfred J Boulos, said recently:
'Tunisians are intelligent and worldly wise, listen to reason and logic and
take positive steps whenever justifiable.' Such words well describe senior
oil gas officials, be it in the state companies or in the ministry of
economic affairs.
In the middle 1980s, such people were faced with having to meet rising
domestic energy consumption when production from the country's two leading
oilfields, El Borma and Ashtart, was declining. Consumption looked as if it
might overtake production. New legislation was introduced in 1987. In
particular, faster cost-recovery in royalties starting as low as 2 per cent
were aimed at promoting the development of low- and medium-sized fields that
had been discovered but not exploited in the decade or so before.
After five years of decline, production picked up in 1989 and has grown
modestly but steadily ever since. The past two years have been marked by
three important developments. The annual number of new wells drilled on and
offshore has increased threefold to 22, the figure of investment by foreign
oil companies doubled over the same period from Dollars 70m to Dollars 140m.
The aim is to keep drilling activity around 20 annually to the end of the
decade. Despite the rising consumption of energy, the increased exploration
activity has just about maintained a reserve to production, at current
levels ratio, of about 12 years.
The second important development was the agreement in December 1991 between
British Gas and Enterprise Tunisienne d'Activites Petrolieres (ETAP),
whereby the UK company decided it would spend Dollars 580m developing the
offshore Miskar gas field. This field was discovered 15 years ago by the
French company Elf and inherited by British Gas when it bought the US
company Teneco in 1988. Among the reasons that made a gas field interesting
in 1991 - when ti was unattractive to develop in the mid 1970s - were the
fast development of Tunisia's domestic gas requirements. Gas today accounts
for between 17 and 33 per cent of the country's energy requirements,
depending on how competitive its price is with heavy fuel oil to fire power
stations. The construction of combined cycle power stations, which produce
electricity from gas, is increasing the need for gas.
The Tunisians did much to lure British Gas. As production from Miskar will
be too modest for export purposes, British Gas has been guaranteed the sale
of all the gas it produces to the Tunisian domestic market. The gas will be
paid for in hard currency and British Gas will be allowed to transfer
profits out of the country. Further advantages include royalties which,
since the law was changed in 1985-7, are now calculated on a flexible basis.
They can be as low as 2 per cent or as high as 15 per cent depending on the
profitability of the operation. Tunisian flexibility has proved worthy of
the country's Carthaginian forebears.
Meanwhile, the 10th anniversary of the trans-Mediterranean gas pipeline was
celebrated last month. The throughput capacity of the pipeline is being
doubled to 24bn cubic metres and the work will be completed this summer.
The passage of this pipeline has become a central feature of the energy
policy. Tunisia's reputation, and for that matter Algeria's, has been
enhanced by the complete absence of disruption to the gas flow since
operations started in 1983. There have been no disputes on tariffs or
prices. No political dispute between Tunisia and Algeria has marred the
operation. The seller has succeeded on more than one occasion in altering
the price formula, but the flow of gas has not been interrupted.
The doubling of the Trans-Mediterranean is a vindication of the security of
supply. It has proved a key factor in helping to launch the western
trans-Mediterranean line, which will carry Algerian gas to Spain across
Morocco and under the Straits of Gibraltar.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (6): Mapping out an EC future - Mark
Nicholson discusses trade relations with Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER the map suggests, there is little doubt to which regional bloc
Tunisia belongs economically. Last year Tunisia bought 71 per cent of its
imports from the EC, to which it sold 77 per cent of its exports. The
respective figures for trade with its Maghreb neighbours were 3.6 and 7.9
per cent. And much of that was with Libya.
For these commercial reasons alone, Tunisia's forthcoming negotiations with
the European Community on a fresh co-operation accord are likely to
overshadow whatever diligent efforts the government may make - and recently
has certainly been making - to create something meaningful out of the
four-year-old Arab Maghreb Union (which embraces Mauritania, Morocco,
Algeria, Tunisia and Libya).
But Europe is Tunisia's touchstone near-neighbour for cultural reasons, too.
For all its religious distinction, Tunisia is a deeply Mediterranean country
and the aspirations of its swelling and sophisticated middle classes are
little different from those of its neighbours on northern shores. 'It is
very important for Tunisia, and particularly for the government here, to
feel itself a south European rather than simply a north African country,'
says one diplomat.
For these reasons, therefore, Tunisia and the EC look set to tie their knot
more tightly by negotiating onwards from the financial protocols which have
guided relations between the two since 1977 to a fuller accord. 'We want to
enlarge our relations to a complete and total collaboration,' says one
foreign ministry official. 'Because we are condemned to live together, we
want to make sure we do so as happily as possible.'
By the end of the fourth and latest Tunisia-EC protocol in 1996, the
community will have provided direct aid in the form of grants and credits
worth around Ecu743m (Dollars 899m). A clutch of additional agreements have
also been reached, covering co-operation in science and technology, the
environment, telecommunications, energy and many other areas.
But most important for Tunisia will be the negotiations on trade.
Eventually, both sides want to see the creation of a free trade zone between
the EC and Tunisia, but in Tunisian eyes this is a long way off and much
needs urgently to be negotiated well before then. Under the most optimistic
assessments of some officials, the country will be in a sufficiently sturdy
economic state to offer fully free trade with the EC only by about 2010.
Under the format for the negotiations, four rounds of 'exploratory
conversations' have now been concluded to establish the basic technical
issues covering an eventual accord. Pending a mandate from the council of
ministers, negotiations are likely to begin at the start of next year on a
text which, with luck, could be ratified by the Twelve and in place by 1996.
The EC is following a parallel course already in talks with Morocco and
hopes to add Algeria to the process as soon as its political stability will
allow. A bloc-to-bloc approach from the EC to the Arab Maghreb Union has
been a non-starter for several reasons, not least among which is Libya's
continued diplomatic isolation over the Lockerbie affair.
But although both EC officials and their Tunisian counterparts consider
overall relations to be excellent, mutual understanding high and the will to
reach an accord clear, there are some very tough talks ahead. To begin with,
say Tunis officials, the EC will have to stump up considerably more aid if
it is to help put Tunisia on a steady enough economic footing to consider
opening its economy further to EC goods. 'There's a heavy price to pay and
an effort to make,' says one official. 'We'll make the effort, but the
community must help us to pay.'
The thorniest issue, however, will be trade, particularly in agricultural
products, and most particularly on the issue of olive oil - Tunisia's most
important agricultural export. At present, Tunisia is permitted a quota of
46,000 tonnes of olive oil under an agreement which expires at the end of
this year. A fresh transitional agreement covering 1994-1995 is under
discussion now, and Tunisia is insisting on a quota of at least 80,000
tonnes.
By Tunisian standards that is a modest request. In a bad year the present EC
quota would account for less than half Tunisia's olive oil crop. In good
years, like 1991-92, the country produces 270,000 tonnes. Furthermore,
agriculture is one of Tunisia's most important employers - accounting for
perhaps 40 per cent of the workforce - and environmentally vital crops.
Olive trees are among the country's best defences against desertification.
But olive oil is also a key crop for almost all southern EC states,
particularly Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece. As a result, the present
quota looks likely to stay more or less in place, pending agreement on the
wider accord. 'The Tunisians are saying to Europe, open up your olive oil
market, and the Europeans are saying open up all the rest of your markets
first. Neither can happen immediately,' says one diplomat.
However tough these interim talks prove, though, Tunisian officials are
quietly confident of the eventual outcome. The 'pragmatic march of Europe',
in the view of one senior official, will soon extend it across the present
Efta countries and many in eastern Europe. 'Eventually,' he says,
'membership of Europe will be a question of purely economic rather than
geographical criteria. At that point we will inevitably be part of a broader
Europe.'

TUNISIA does not leap to mind if one is compiling a list of the world's tax
havens and offshore banking centres. But it is at least 17 years since the
first offshore banks opened for business in Tunis, and the tax advantages
are the equal of most of its better-known peers: Bahrain, Cyprus, the
Channel Islands, for instance. So why is Tunisia so little known?
The question baffles some ministers, who argue that Tunisia not only offers
all the usual offshore banking perks, but good infrastructure, close
proximity to southern Europe, a highly convivial and congenial lifestyle and
more besides. Yet, there are only six offshore banks established in Tunis.
The matter also puzzles some of the bankers. They believe part of the answer
is government reluctance to sell Tunisia hard. 'The government wanted to be
able to give everything possible to foreign investors into the country,
through the offshore banks,' says one banker, 'but without attracting any of
the negative aspects associated with tax havens elsewhere.'
Tunisia's offshore banks are there, essentially, to serve the Tunisian
economy, runs this view. And for a host of largely external reasons, the
sector has never quite fulfilled the more global ambitions held out for it
by the government which, in 1976, passed Tunisia's first offshore banking
law.
This law, as much as anything, aimed to offer a Tunisian shelter for
fugitive banks and capital fleeing the civil war which was to end Beirut's
primacy as the Arab banking centre of the 1960s and early 1970s. And, at the
time, some 12 banks arrived, including Citibank and Bank of America.
Within a few years, however, Bahrain had comfortably wrested Beirut's
mantle. Offshore banking there was fuelled both by the surge of petrodollars
to recycle and by the need to finance Saudi Arabia's voracious appetite for
expansion. Tunisia, out on a limb from all that and without an equally
dynamic regional Maghrebi economy to compete, began to lose some of the
early arrivals - Bank of America closed down, Banco de Brazil, National Bank
of Abu Dhabi and others followed.
Tunisia's remaining offshore banks settled thereafter into their present
role as the leading financial intermediaries for foreign investors. For a
largely inward-looking local banking system, spawned from the dirigiste
economy of the 1960s and screened from the outside world by the central
bank, the offshore banks offered a window on the world.
They, alone, were legally entitled to offer exporters established as
'non-resident' companies, but manufacturing out of Tunisia, hard currency
transactions without prior approval from the central bank. They also tended
to lead the way on trade finance. But the size and scope of the offshore
banks came to be tied directly to the fortunes of Tunisia's economy.
Several banks carved out particular niches. Very broadly: BEST bank, a joint
venture between the central bank and the Albaraka group, encouraged Saudi
investment in Tunisia; North African International Bank focused on
Tunisian-Libyan trade finance; Citibank took a lead in treasury operations,
in particular with Maghreb currencies; and Tunis International Bank
developed private banking, trade and investment finance.
Both BEST and Citibank also evolved onshore operations. These are
permissible under laws permitting offshore banks to deal in local currencies
to the value of equity investments they have brought into the country. BEST
bank, for instance, reckons on having brought in Dollars 200m of such
investment and has created an onshore dinar operation accordingly, within a
further ceiling which permits offshore banks to take dinar deposits only up
to 1 per cent of total domestic deposits.
But there is soon to be an erosion of the offshore banks' most
distinguishing feature - their privileged position as foreign currency
intermediaries. The government's decision to introduce current account
convertibility of the dinar earlier this year now means that foreign
currency transactions for import and export deals can be transacted without
prior central bank approval, merely subsequent notification and record.
As the government moves towards full convertibility, pencilled in for 1996,
the local banks will be increasingly exposed to direct international
dealings and differences between the local and offshore banks will diminish
accordingly. This, at least, is the hope and, indeed, the cue for the
offshore banks' next role.
This will be, primarily, as the catalyst for the regeneration and
internationalisation of Tunisia's still underdeveloped banking sector. By
virtue of their previously exclusive international experience and a small
salary premium over local banks, the offshore banks harbour the greater part
of Tunisia's best bankers. As the country begins to develop its embryonic
financial markets and accelerate its drive to attract inward investment, the
offshore banks are positioning themselves to expand their products,
particularly in investment and merchant banking.
The process is about to receive a small fillip in the shape of Arab Banking
Corporation's arrival as a fully-fledged offshore bank. The Bahrain-based
bank's representative office of some years standing has won approval for
offshore status and the bank is aiming eventually to add onshore facilities.
ABC, which already has an office in Tripoli and is seeking another in
Casablanca, is the biggest international banking arrival in Tunis since the
seventies.
It is unlikely to herald a new era for Tunisia as an Arab banking capital to
rival Bahrain. Local bankers point out, for instance, that Tunisian banks
are almost without direct representation in the country's main trading
markets and have some way to go before they can aspire to that. ABC's
arrival, however, and, more particularly, the government's clear
determination to kick-start the financial sector nevertheless suggest that,
should the Maghreb countries succeed in putting their professed ambitions of
economic union into more effective practice, Tunis will emerge as North
Africa's natural banking centre.

stepped up / Examining how the country is selling itself to the world

NOTHING is more vital to Tunisia's economic ambitions than substantially
raising levels of direct foreign investment.
In this respect, Tunisia is being ambitious. To succeed in keeping GDP
growth at a real 6 per cent a year until 1996, the end of the present
development plan, the government has set itself the target of tripling
inward investment, outside the hydrocarbons sector, from around Dollars 70m
disbursed a year to at least Dollars 200m.
Only growth at that pace will create the additional 5,000 to 10,000 jobs a
year needed to accommodate annual entrants to the workforce. And, in the
view of many bankers, only foreign investment in export industries can
generate this.
There is nothing new about Tunisia's investment drive, which began in
earnest during the early 1970s when a previous government encouraged the
creation of 'non-resident' exporting companies through tax incentives and
foreign exchange privileges.
But with the arrival of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and the post-1987
changement, with its attendant flurry of liberalising economic reforms, came
a change of gear.
Import, tariff and price controls have been dropped or relaxed. Investment
licensing has been abandoned. A ministry of co-operation and foreign
investment has been created to centralise the government's sales pitch. And
early this year the government took the first steps towards making the dinar
convertible, introducing current account convertibility for imports and
exports.
The government's next, imminent, step will be to produce a unified
investment code to replace separate sectoral codes covering manufacturing,
services, tourism and agriculture - 'at the moment we're confronted by a
library of texts,' says one Tunis banker. The code covering hydrocarbons,
which is substantially the biggest draw for foreign investors, will remain
in place.
'We are producing a consistent and coherent institutional environment,' says
Mr Mustapha Nabli, planning and regional development minister. 'We want to
end changes in the environment. We're saying, with this code - that's it.'
The new code, which Mr Nabli says should be finished and in place by July,
also aims to cover areas, like transport and education, not previously
covered by any sectoral code. It should also encourage regional development
and, particularly, add incentives for investment bringing technology
transfer.
However, the new code is unlikely in itself to offer a particular incentive
in a country which foreign investors say has always offered a clear,
efficient and systematic institutional framework for investment. Tunisia's
main selling points will remain its political stability, its proximity and
good access to the EC market, and its cheap labour costs.
This combination has been rewarded by a steady flow of Italian, French,
German and Belgian investment, notably in tourism, textiles, leather goods,
and electrical and mechanical products. The resulting growth in tourism and
textiles is particularly marked. There are, for instance, now more than 160
separate German manufacturing investments in Tunisia, covering companies
employing 22,000 people. Exports of textiles and leather products to Europe
alone, to illustrate further, made up 41 per cent of Tunisia's total exports
in 1992.
The textile sector could receive a further, considerable boost should the
board of Sara Lee, the US clothing and foods group, decide this month to
proceed with a possible Dollars 60m investment in a spinning and weaving
plant in Tunisia. The chief rival for the proposed investment appears to be
Morocco, which has been lobbying hard to bring the US group to its corner of
North Africa.
Indeed, all such major commitments from multinationals are likely to be
increasingly hard won. Moreover, Tunisia's retention of keen competitive
advantages against its immediate neighbours, the countries of eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union and the Asian 'tigers', is likely to pose the
greatest challenge to the government over the next few years, committed, as
it is, to increasing, at the same time, a politically vital set of social
policies.
On sheer wage costs, Tunisia remains competitive. A recent report by the
Tunisian-French Chamber of Commerce quoted findings that Tunisia was a
substantially cheaper place to make some garments than Poland, Portugal,
Turkey and Hong Kong.
Nevertheless, unlike many of its rivals, Tunisia maintains a minimum
guaranteed industrial wage which is subject to increases in line with
prospective inflation. 'Tunisia is still competitive,' says one German
industrialist. 'But they have to pay attention.'
Some foreign investment agencies are watching closely, for instance, the
development of the new investment code. Among the measures under discussion
is the granting of a 10-year tax holiday for new manufacturing enterprises -
but this would, in fact, be something of a disincentive given that most
present investments are granted an indefinite tax holiday.
'We can understand that the government wants to make the code as
economically beneficial as possible for the country,' says a German
investor. 'But it has to remain as profitable as possible for us.'
The Tunisian government is hoping, however, to move beyond the simple appeal
of low wages and emphasise instead the relatively high education of
Tunisians. 'Workers are not just productive here, they have shown they can
also produce high quality,' says one diplomat.
While the country is scarcely going to turn down further investment in, for
instance, textiles, it would rather see companies look to Tunisia to develop
higher technology products, service industries or computing and software.
'Tunisia cannot count on remaining a low-wage economy,' says Mr Nabli. 'The
level of living here is continually rising and our competitive strengths
changing. We need above all for our economy to absorb more sophisticated
technology.'

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (2): Reform programme as right as rain -
Three seasons of bountiful harvests have helped boost the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR the gods have smiled upon Tunisia's economic reform programme. Or,
perhaps more accurately, rained on it.
Four growing seasons of good rain and correspondingly bountiful harvests
have, as much as anything else, helped Tunisia raise GDP by an average of
6.6 per cent a year over the past three years. Further good rains promise
also to lift this year's growth above government budgetary forecasts of 2.9
per cent.
Tourism receipts have been equally buoyant, rising 34 per cent last year to
around DT1bn as the industry bounced back from its reverse during the Gulf
war - a rebound which largely accounts for the disproportionately big 8.4
per cent rise in GDP for 1992 over 1991.
But Tunisia's harvests, tourist crop and, indeed, yields from all other
sectors of its economy need to be abundant. The government, in its eighth
and present development plan, has stencilled in an annual average growth
rate of 6 per cent a year to 1996. Only at that rate, the government
estimates, can the economy deliver the 313,000 new jobs the labour market
will demand over the period.
That target is ambitious for at least two good reasons. The first is that it
must be achieved by export-led growth into the teeth of a recession in
Europe, which at present swallows more than 77 per cent of Tunisia's
overseas sales. The second is that this growth must also come as Tunisia's
structural adjustment programme begins to cut more deeply into the softer
underbelly of Tunisian industry.
Tunisia's vulnerability to Europe's economic malaise is already becoming
evident. Even with 1992's banner growth figures, Tunisia's merchandise trade
deficit widened 55 per cent to DT2.1bn: exports rose only 4 per cent against
an 18 per cent rise in imports. Already this year, provisional figures
suggest exports have risen only 0.3 per cent in the first three months while
imports are up 10.2 per cent.
A big surplus in Tunisia's services is likely to offset much of the
merchandise trade deficit, with tourism revenues in particular expected to
grow by as much as 18 per cent. But some western economists believe Tunisia
is likely nevertheless to see its current account deficit exceed last year's
figure of DT722m in 1993.
The weakness of Tunisia's main markets may also have the effect of worsening
the damage to its less competitive industries wrought by the continuing
structural adjustment programme, now in its seventh year. 'The effect of the
reforms would have been quite small had there been no international crisis,'
says Mr Nouri Zorgati, the finance minister. 'Unfortunately more firms will
be affected than might have been the case - and sadly above all in
textiles'.
Mr Zorgati reckons that some 10 per cent of the country's hundreds of
garment manufacturing companies could be directly at risk as Tunisia
continues to dismantle import, tariff and price controls under its
International Monetary Fund and World Bank guided reforms. As part of those
reforms, the World Bank is to commit a line of credit worth Dollars 100m, to
be disbursed through the banking sector, to help alleviate some of the pain
among less competitive companies.
This restructuring process is already well under way - indeed, Mr Mustapha
Nabli, planning and regional affairs minister, says the process should be
almost complete by 1994. Already, he says, Tunisia has freed 87 per cent of
producer prices and half of consumer prices. Some 85 per cent of imports
have been freed of restrictions, with the remainder due to be freed by 1994.
Tariffs, meanwhile, have been cut from pre-reform levels exceeding 200 per
cent in some cases to an average of 43 per cent.
Nevertheless, the toughest effects of these reforms are still to come in
many cases, and some of the most sensitive barriers remain to be dismantled.
For one thing, some western economists calculate that although 85 per cent
of imports have been freed from restrictions in total, restrictions have
been lifted entirely on only 30 per cent of imports which compete directly
with local products.
Some additional tariff barriers also remain. As a temporary and transitional
cushion to some sectors of the economy the government in 1992 introduced a
phased and diminishing additional tariff on some goods falling 30-20-10 per
cent over three years and disappearing by 1995. Furthermore, a 'temporary' 5
per cent import surcharge introduced to help cope with the economic shock of
the Gulf war remains in place.
Nevertheless, there is no question either of the government's resolve to
push through the full gamut of liberalising reforms, albeit at a pace which
it feels it can politically afford, or of its success in managing those
reforms already undertaken. Subsidies, for instance, have been trimmed
substantially from around 3.3 per cent of GDP two years ago to a little over
2 per cent. Further cuts in basic subsidies are being examined.
On the revenues side, the introduction at a stroke in 1988 of value added
tax, combined with a complete overhaul and rationalisation of income and
corporate taxes has seen the tax take rise considerably - from Dollars 400m
in 1991, for instance, to Dollars 590m in 1992. Top marginal tax rates were
cut on income tax to 35 per cent from 68 per cent, and on corporate tax also
to 35 per cent from 45 per cent, but the coverage increased substantially
while, in the words of one banker, making the whole tax structure
'brilliantly clear'.
The budget deficit, as a result, has slimmed from 3.9 per cent of GDP in
1989 to an expected 2.3 per cent this year. The figure is expected to fall
by 1992, the end of the present plan, to 1.2 per cent. As another measure of
the government's disengagement from the economy, the government's budget as
a share of GDP has fallen from 40 per cent in 1989 to 35 per cent this year.
A privatisation programme has begun with the sale of more than 40 state-held
interests, although the World Bank and IMF are understood to be pressing the
government to accelerate the process. Among the bigger state interests
potentially under the hammer is Tunisair, the national carrier. However, Mr
Tahar Hadj Ali, the transport minister, says that for the time being the
sale of up to 10 per cent of the airline's stock is being 'prudently
considered'.
The one area where perhaps most remains to be done is in the development of
Tunisia's banking industry and, more broadly, of its capital and financial
markets. The latter, at present, extend little further than the interbank
market and the country's small bourse, on which only 16 companies are
traded.
The financial system has been given a considerable shake-up under the
post-1987 administration, to clear away many of the dirigiste cobwebs
accumulated under the more collectivist Bourguiba regime. Central Bank
controls on bank credit and investment licencing have been removed. Interest
rates have been largely freed to the market, bank lending rates liberalised
with a fixed margin but no ceiling on maximum rates. All remaining lending
and deposit rate restrictions are set to go next year.
But the country's numerous domestic banks, many of them laden with bad debts
to companies of dubious competitiveness, still have far to go - almost
certainly by way of mergers, recapitalisations and restructurings - before
they will be at ease in Tunisia's fast-opening economy.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survey of Tunisia (1): An economic balancing act - As a
result of its policy of structural adjustment, Tunisia has become a
favourite of the International Monetary Fund. It is also a pilot country for
certain United Nations social programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and FRANCIS GHILES

<TEXT>
NORTH Africa's smallest nation looks to its neighbours with a peculiar
mixture of pride and unease. Tunisia's ministers, and swelling class of
businessmen and women, point with self-congratulation to the country's
recent economic successes, its political stability and its distinctively
western social policies. The ogre of Islamic fundamentalism has, they claim,
been quashed.
A course of near-Europeanisation is firmly plotted. If only the same held
next door to the west, where Tunisians are profoundly disconcerted by the
threat of incipient guerrilla war in Algeria, or to the east where Libya
continues to ply its own unpredictable, pariah's path]
Such regional uncertainties appear only to harden the government's
determination to set a better, meaning a more western, example. The regime
of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, which calmly ushered out, on the
pretext of 'senility', the post-independence leader Mr Habib Bourguiba in
1987, holds as its primary ambition nothing less than laying eventual claim
to a full place in what it hopes will be an expanded European economic
space.
Much has been achieved. Seven years into International Monetary Fund and
World Bank guided structural adjustment, Tunisia's increasingly open economy
has grown by an average 6.6 per cent in real terms over the past three
years. Absolute poverty has shrunk, according to official figures, from 30
per cent of the population in the 1970s to 6.7 per cent today. As a legacy
of Bourguiba's progressive birth control policies, the population growth
rate has diminished to a regionally unparalleled 1.9 per cent, and the
country is set to reach replacement rate for its economic population in
2025, by which time there will be around 12m Tunisians.
Socially, too, Tunisia aspires to European norms. Perhaps most important is
the role accorded to women, who enjoy better rights to divorce, abortion and
general equality before the law than their counterparts in any other Arab
country - again a legacy of the Bourguiba era. Tunisia's association of
women managers has 2,000 or more members.
Such achievements have made Tunisia a favourite of the IMF, and a pilot
country for certain United Nations social programmes. But they have been won
in a manner which has brought the government little praise for its political
strategy.
In testimony last month before the US House foreign affairs committee, Mr
Edward Djerejian, assistant secretary responsible for Near East Affairs,
praised Tunisia as a 'case study of the positive results of free market
reforms,' but voiced 'serious concerns' about human rights and political
freedom. 'Tunisia has dealt too harshly with some of its political
opponents,' he said. 'Tunisia's human rights record has been marred by
credible claims of torture.'
These claims were raised particularly by Amnesty International following the
government's arrest and detention in May 1991 of almost 300 alleged members
of the now outlawed al Nahda Islamic party, whose leader, Mr Rachid
Gannouchi, is now seeking political asylum in Britain.
The group was accused of plotting the government's overthrow and planning to
attack the president's aircraft with a Stinger anti-aircraft missile. But
the clampdown followed rising concern within the regime at the rising
Islamic challenge in Algeria and the burning of two night watchmen at the
premises of the ruling party. In the view of most western diplomats in
Tunis, the government simply decided to come down as hard as possible, as
soon as possible, on what many consider to have been at best a nascent
threat. 'They wanted to crush the movement while it was still inside the
egg,' says one.
The government, and Tunisia's middle classes, profess themselves confident
that, for the moment, whatever fundamentalist threat there was has been
summarily dealt with. Whatever residual popular support al-Nahda might still
have is almost impossible to judge. Diplomats quote support ranging from
13-20 per cent in the last elections, where independent candidates backed by
al-Nahda were free to run. While the government keeps a tightly policed
clamp on any political manifestation of Islam, however, estimates of present
fundamentalist sympathy are anecdotal surmise.
In fact, the government's weapons against political Islam are not merely
oppressive. Its championing of women is one attempt to create a powerful
social pillar of resistance against what it regards as 'backward' Islamic
thinking.
Among other attempts to attack the possible social causes of fundamentalism,
the ministry of social affairs is also, creating numerous centres of 'social
service and integration'. These are being set up in places of relative
poverty and deprivation to nip 'delinquency' in the bud and better to
understand and address its causes. 'In Algeria and Egypt social policies
have been left to the fundamentalists,' says one official. 'That will not
happen here.'
But the greatest single weapon, the government hopes, will be economic
progress and the delivery to Tunisia's already large middle class of some
tangible rewards from liberalisation. On the macro level, Tunisia has
already brought down its budget deficit to around 2 per cent of GDP from
more than double that in the late 1980s, has freed a majority of producer
and consumer prices, trimmed subsidies, begun to liberalise financial
markets, freed constraints on most imports and courted with increasing zeal
foreign investment, levels of which it hopes to treble over the next three
years.
It has also begun preliminary negotiations with the European Community, with
which Tunisia does almost 80 per cent of its trade, towards a comprehensive
co-operation accord to improve substantially on the financial protocols and
quota agreements which at present determine its links across the
Mediterranean.
The key to its success will lie in achieving its ambitious inward investment
target. To keep pace with its growing workforce, Tunisia needs to create
more than 60,000 jobs a year - and more if it is to make inroads on
unemployment officially calculated at 15 per cent. 'This growth is
possible,' says one banker, 'but only through marginal investment, and this
can come in sufficient size only from overseas'.
The difficult task for Tunisia's technocratic ministers will be to attract
this investment while continuing to expand, and pay for, social policies
which are considered both a political imperative and the natural fulfilment
of the population's increasingly middle class aspirations. For the moment
Tunisia competes directly as a low wage economy with its North African
neighbours, notably Morocco, eastern European countries and, in some
industries, south-east Asia. But, says Mr Nouri Zorgati, the finance
minister: 'We do not want to break records of competitiveness by sacrificing
social standards.' The government is determined to improve its network of
social policies, including, for instance, a minimum wage which rises in line
with inflation. At the same time it cannot afford to lose competitive ground
to the countries of eastern Europe.
To that balancing act should be added, in the minds of many Tunisians, an
additional political imperative: that of taking greater steps towards real
democratisation while at the same time allowing the country's press greater
freedom. At present, President Ben Ali's ruling party, the Rassemblement
Constitutionnel Democratique, holds all 141 seats in the country's
parliament and keeps an iron grip on the political process.
Talks between Mr Hamed Karoui, the prime minister, and opposition parties
are under way with the aim of ensuring at least some non-RCD representation
after general elections next March. The government has conceded the
principle of allowing some seats in the chamber to be elected through
proportional representation, the rest first-past-the-post. This, it is
believed, could return 10-20 opposition MPs. 'The government wants to create
an opposition which is both credible, and controllable,' says one diplomat,
'and that won't be easy.'
But some critics in the country believe the government's present efforts
will fall far short of creating truly representative opposition, accusing
the government of maintaining a 'monochrome' parliament which does an
injustice to the sophistication of Tunisia's educated electorate and to the
kind of debate over its economic reforms many consider vital. 'You can't
talk of economic liberalism and continue with political dirigisme,' says one
critic, who prefers to remain anonymous. 'The model of Pinochet-style
development is dead.'
These critics understand the difficulty of opening up the political system
when the chief beneficiary could be Islamic militants. But many argue that
the government will be able to carry through the next difficult phase of
economic reforms only if these can be fully debated in a freer press and by
a more representative parliament.
