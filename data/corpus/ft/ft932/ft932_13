FT  10 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: All-time peak in Shell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE in Royal Dutch stock in the US overnight and on the Amsterdam market
early yesterday, which drove the shares up to a record high, promoted a
similar wave of support for Shell Transport shares, which raced ahead to an
all-time peak of 628p, prior to closing a net 12 up at 627p. Turnover was a
healthy 5.2m shares.
Apart from the impact of Royal Dutch's performance, Shell's strength came
from a general groundswell of international buying, after last week's round
of presentations by the company in Europe and ahead of a presentation to UK
analysts on Monday.
Dealers said the market had been overwhelmed by big buying interest and
heavy arbitrage business carried out by four big market players from the US.
'The market was caught short and spent most of yesterday chasing its tail in
Shell,' said one marketmaker. In its recent buy note on Shell, Strauss
Turnbull said it expected Shell 'to embark on an accelerated programme of
cost-cutting, via redundancies'.

FT  10 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG trade in Asda stock options that led to a sharp rise in total volume
in the traded options was the outstanding feature in the derivatives, writes
Joel Kibazo.
The trade in Asda was said to have been carried out by NatWest Securities
and brought volume in the stock to a hefty 15,618 contracts. Total turnover
by the close was 46,052 lots, more than double Tuesday's 19,037 contracts.
British Aerospace, newly returned to the FT-SE 100 Index, was also a strong
feature and traded 2,920 contracts, to make it the second most active stock
option. That total was well above average for the derivative instrument and
reflected continued strength in the underlying equities. It was followed by
Hanson at 2,161 lots and British Steel at 1,318. Shell, Glaxo and BT were
also busy.
Hopes of a cut in interest rates brought an advance in the June futures
contract on the FT-SE 100, although volume remained thin. Having opened at
2,847, June traded lower in the first hour as independent traders sold
stock.
But the interest rates talk put paid to further selling and led to a strong
rise. It traded around the 2,860 level over the lunchtime period and
received a further boost by the firm opening on Wall Street, climbing to the
day's high of 2,875. June closed at 2,873, at a 7-point premium to the
underlying cash market. Turnover was 7,056 contracts.

FT  10 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Initial rally on
futures-related buying is lost
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
AFTER posting early gains on futures-related computer program buying, US
share prices slipped back yesterday afternoon to end little changed, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 1.39 at 3,511.93,
almost 20 points below its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.07 ahead at 445.78, while the Nasdaq composite gained
1.50 at 689.24. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 249m shares.
Traders said stocks opened firmer partly because the declines incurred at
the start of the week had left prices low enough to attract sporadic buying
interest from investors. Some program buying related to movements on the
futures market also lifted stocks, as did reports that President Bill
Clinton is willing to try alternatives to his proposed, but much criticised,
energy tax.
The early gains, however, did not take hold, and prices retreated steadily
in the afternoon amid selling of selected blue chip stocks. Throughout,
investors remained nervous ahead of forthcoming inflation data. The May
producer prices index will be released tomorrow, followed by the consumer
prices data early next week. The figures should provide a clear picture of
inflation, and determine whether the Federal Reserve will have to lift
interest rates to slow the pace of future price rises.
Leading technology stocks were in mixed form. Compaq fell Dollars 4 3/8 to
Dollars 53 3/4 after two broking houses, Prudential Securities and Cowen &amp;
Co, lowered their ratings on the stock in the wake of its recent strong
performance. The shares were also undermined by newspaper reports that
Compaq senior executives have been heavy sellers of their company's stock in
recent months.
Although the downgrade seemed to hit some other computer stocks - Motorola
lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 82 and Unisys eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 11
5/8 - the rest of the sector was in surprisingly good form, with IBM adding
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 53, Hewlett-Packard rising Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
86 1/4 and Digital Equipment gaining Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 43 1/8 .
A disappointing earnings projection from Apple Computer, traded on the
Nasdaq market, also buffeted the sector. Apple, which said it expected
earnings for the second half of the year to be below comparable results for
1992, dropped Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 44 1/4 in volume of 10.5m shares.
Poor second-quarter earnings and continued weakness in plywood prices
undermined Georgia-Pacific, which declined Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 59 3/8
in busy trading.
Canada
TORONTO stocks pared earlier losses to leave the market only marginally
lower on balance, with a recovery in bank shares offsetting weak precious
metals issues.
The TSE 300 index lost a net 3.0 at a closing 3,859.7, while declines
outnumbered advances by 436 to 295 after volume of 57.1m shares valued at
CDollars 509.1m.
Eight of the 14 sub-group indices ended lower, led by the golds group, off
1.6 per cent. The price of gold in New York fell USDollars 2.65 to USDollars
371.35 an ounce. Financial services showed a gain of 1.0 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Takeover rumours lift
Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO was closed for the Japanese royal wedding.
HONG KONG heard market rumours that Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific planned a
joint bid for Miramar Hotel, suspended pending an announcement. This boosted
technical demand and the Hang Seng index rose 79.34 to 7,339.08 as turnover
eased from HKDollars 5.03bn to HKDollars 4.69bn.
Cheung Kong gained 10 cents at HKDollars 27.80, while Citic put on 30 cents
at HKDollars 18.20.
Brokers said there was still some caution ahead of the next round of Sino-UK
talks next Monday on Hong Kong political reforms. Meanwhile, Kim Eng
Securities said the probable short term effect in China of the Rmb
devaluation was that inflation was likely to escalate, leading to a further
movement of capital into gold and foreign assets. 'Hong Kong,' said the
broker, 'is the likely beneficiary.'
SEOUL went to a 31-month peak for the third consecutive day, the composite
index ending 9.06 stronger at 777.25. Volume and turnover set a record high
of 79.4m shares worth Won1,340bn.
BANGKOK advanced 1.8 per cent as investors decided that a no-confidence
debate would have no great impact on the government. The SET index finished
15.17 ahead at 845.88 in turnover of Bt5.03bn.
All four major sectors - banking, finance and securities, construction
materials and property - rose strongly. Bangkok Bank climbed Bt3 to Bt125,
Siam Cement Bt14 to Bt438 and housing developer Tanayong Bt3 to Bt62.50.
AUSTRALIAN golds retreated as the All Ordinaries index slipped 14.0 to
1,709.1. The golds index dropped 54.1 to 1,725.5, investors fearing further
losses on bullion, which had shed more than USDollars 1.50 an ounce in 24
hours, to around USDollars 371.75 by the Sydney close.
National turnover was 214.3m shares worth ADollars 411m, with falls
outpacing rises by a ratio of two-to-one.
NEW ZEALAND fell on very light turnover, with a 3-cent decline to NZDollars
1.11 in Brierley a major contributor as the NZSE-40 index dipped 8.14 to
1,646.99.
Supermarket operator Progressive Enterprises rose 6 cents to NZDollars 1.73:
rumours of a takeover by Foodland Associated, a Perth-based grocery
wholesaler, resurfaced as the latter raised ADollars 51.7m in a share
placing with institutions.
KUALA LUMPUR saw a big premium on the listing of Buildcon, the ready-mixed
concrete group, as the broad market stayed cautious and profit-taking pushed
the KLSE composite index down 1.35 to 734.93. However, volume soared from
273.3m shares to 448.2m and winners led losers by 262 to 78.
Leading the gainers, Jasa Kita climbed MDollars 3.75 to MDollars 10.60 on
rumours of a takeover. Buildcon closed at MDollars 8.80 for a premium of
MDollars 4.60 over its offer price.
SINGAPORE was led lower by some index stocks as the Straits Times Industrial
index receded 6.16 to 1,864.51, but brokers said the underlying tone was
still firm, with speculative buying still evident.
TAIWAN registered the smallest turnover since January, TDollars 14.5bn
against Tuesday's TDollars 17.65bn, as the weighted index ended 7.70 down at
4,269.72.
MANILA weakened across the board as selling of blue chips spilled over into
mines and oils. The composite index dropped 17.81 to 1,581.84.
JAKARTA ended mixed in moderate trade and the JKSE index was up 0.8 at
352.8.
BOMBAY saw volatility in market leader Telco put pressure on blue chips and
the BSE index lost 25 to 2,351. Telco was sold short ahead of its results,
and while it only lost Rs3.75 to Rs192.50 on the day, brokers said later
that the results were worse than expected.
KARACHI went higher on buying of textile shares ahead of the 1993/94 budget,
due for release on Monday. The KSE index gained 11.99 at 1,182.72. Polyester
stocks rose sharply on rumours of higher taxes in the budget on imported
polyester fibre that would boost demand and the price of locally produced
polyester.

FT  10 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris regains 1,900 level on
interest rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST senior bourses had a more positive day, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS looked for an interest rate cut, and regained the 1,900 level for the
first time in more than a month. The CAC-40 index rose 21.58 to 1,915.23 in
good turnover of some FFr3.7bn.
Suez rose FFr7 to FFr291.50, helped by reports that it might resolve its
dispute with UAP, FFr9 higher at FFr583, over shareholdings in the Victoire
insurance group.
Lyonnaise Dumez put on FFr19.70 to FFr456.90 after forecasting a 'marked'
rise in 1993 profits while Generale des Eaux advanced FFr19 to FFr2,233 on
steady first quarter sales.
Ahead of today's annual meeting LVMH was steady at FFr3,710 in spite of
champagne producers saying that they were to lower prices by up to 25 per
cent in an effort to counter falling sales.
FRANKFURT edged up again as a strong dollar helped export sensitive shares.
The DAX index scored its fifth consecutive gain, up 11.46 at 1,673.07,
turnover easing from DM5.5bn to DM5.4bn ahead of today's public holiday.
Steel and engineering shares continued to show widespread gains, with little
apparent discrimination between those which have produced satisfactory
results this year, and those which have disappointed.
Linde, an engineer which comes into the steadier category, rose DM13 to
DM752, up DM36 in a week; but Thyssen, the steel group recommended by Nomura
as a buy on bad news a week ago at DM163, put on another DM3.60 to DM175.80.
AMSTERDAM rallied as Royal Dutch closed at a record high helped by the
strength of the dollar and a positive Opec ministers meeting in Geneva. The
shares gained Fl 3.80 to Fl 172.50 as the CBS Tendency index gained 1.3 or
1.2 per cent to 107.0.
Amev was another riser, up Fl 1.10 to Fl 71.40 ahead of today's first
quarter results: NatWest Securities in London forecasts a 6 per cent
increase with a rise of about 7 per cent at the operating level.
MILAN found some encouragement in Fiat and Olivetti, while Ferruzzi and
Montedison continued to slide as fresh rumours swept the market.
The Comit index closed 4.50 higher at 525.90. Fiat rose L210 to L5,570 at
the fix and further to L5,675 on the kerb for a gain of nearly 6 per cent on
the day. Interest was revitalised by its announcement of a new small car to
replace the Uno. The model is expected to be available by the autumn.
The last day of Olivetti's L903bn rights issue saw active arbitrage between
the ordinary shares and the rights, with the former rising L95 to L1,290.
Ferruzzi was suspended temporarily as it fell more than 9 per cent. There
were various market rumours concerning the group, including one claiming
that its debts might be double the amount previously published. Investors
are also worried that minority shareholders will lose out under the terms of
the restructuring plan presently being negotiated. The shares fixed L59.30
down at L823.80, off the day's low of L795.
MADRID recovered some of its post-election losses, the general index closing
2.38 higher at 256.29 in turnover of Pta18.6bn.
Banks improved slightly, and the construction sector was little changed on
balance; among individual stocks, two of the best gains came from
Telefonica, up Pta25 at Pta1,390, and Repsol, which recovered Pta75 to
Pta3,200.
ZURICH ended at a record close, led by chemical and financial blue chips.
News of lower Swiss year to year inflation, slightly easier money market
rates and firmer bourses elsewhere in Europe helped lift sentiment as the
SMI index of leading shares rose 16.9 to 2,311.4.
BRUSSELS featured a 5 per cent rise in Solvay, up BFr550 at BFr11,500 and
another good performance from Petrofina, up BFr100 at BFr8,450, as the
Bel-20 index gained 10.07 to 1,207.44.
STOCKHOLM was positive on Skandia on news that institutions had bought a 39
per cent stake previously held by Uni Storebrand of Norway and Hafnia
Holding of Denmark. Its shares rose SKr5 to SKr123 as the Affarsvarlden
general index rose 2.3 to 1,080.7 in high turnover of SKr2.7bn.
HELSINKI fell for the third consecutive session, the Hex index down 16.6 at
1,098.5.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Money Markets: German rate fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in German interest rate markets were pessimistic about the prospects
for near-term cuts in German rates yesterday as the D-Mark weakened sharply
against most currencies, writes James Blitz.
The passing of the Spanish general election has extinguished fears about
another peseta devaluation for the time being, allowing dealers to sell the
German currency - which is itself weakened by poor economic fundamentals.
The Bundesbank appears unwilling to cut short-term interest rates while the
currency is weak, for fear that this will increase the prospects for
imported inflation.
The lowest accepted repo rate was left unchanged at 7.60 per cent yesterday
for 14-day maturities. For 28-day matur-ities the lowest accepted rate was
7.61 per cent.
Yesterday, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, underlined that
the central bank will take the value of the currency into account when
plotting further rate cuts. According to one dealer, this had the danger of
drawing a vicious circle: if the D-Mark weakens, that will leave interest
rates high, threatening a recovery, which would in turn weaken the German
currency.
As a result, Euromark futures fell back yesterday afternoon. The June
contract closed 4 basis points down at 92.44, while the September contract
ended 5 basis points off on the day at 93.24.
The D-Mark's weakness underlined the prospect that French interest rates
could come down at a faster pace than is set by the Germans. The bid rate
for three-month French francs dropped from 7.38 per cent yesterday to 7.25
per cent.
The September French interest rate futures contract rose from 93.41 to 93.45
yesterday, although it later declined to 93.37.
Sterling interest rate futures fell back yesterday after Mr Norman Lamont,
the former UK chancellor, called for an independent Bank of England, saying
that interest rate cuts should not be used as a purely political instrument.
The September short sterling contract slipped 4 basis points to finish at
94.21, as expectations of another cut in UK base rates diminished.
Three-month money was fractionally firmer in the cash market at 5 31/32 per
cent. A Pounds 1.15bn shortage was easily despatched, although there was
Pounds 40m of late assistance.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Soros helps the D-Mark down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark weakened against the dollar and most European currencies
yesterday after dealers were impressed by a comment from Mr George Soros,
the foreign exchange operator, that the German currency was in the throes of
long-term weakness, writes James Blitz.
The timing of Mr Soros's comments, in yesterday's Times, helped to
concentrate minds on the fertile issue of the D-Mark's potential weakness.
Earlier in the week, the peseta's recovery in the wake of Mr Felipe
Gonzalez's general election victory had helped to quell tensions in the
European exchange rate mechanism - again lifting the veil on the weak
economic fundamentals that underlie the D-Mark. By Tuesday night in Europe,
when Mr Soros's comments appeared, the market was gearing itself up for
another round of concerted selling of the German currency.
The D-Mark dropped as low as DM1.6420 against the dollar in Europe, later
closing at DM1.6380, nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs down on the day; in New York the
dollar ended at DM1.6350. In London, the D-Mark opened 2 pfennigs weaker
against sterling at DM2.4849. The pound still ended 1 3/4 pfennigs up from
its previous close, at DM2.4825, in spite of public criticism of Mr John
Major's government by his former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont.
Inside the ERM, the D-Mark dropped to minus 16 percentage points on its
divergence indicator, although it has been as low as minus 23 in recent
times. The French franc looked powerful, closing at FFr3.363 per D-Mark, up
from FFr3.368.
However, there was no reason to think that the German currency had broken
below strategic barriers in yesterday's moves. The dollar has traded in a
range of DM1.5630 to DM1.6730 all year. Yesterday's close roughly matched
the one for the first trading day of 1993.
Nor was Mr Soros clearly planning a concerted strategy against the German
currency. He admitted yesterday that he was talking his own book. But, in
the view of one London dealer yesterday, a serious investor does not talk
his book in public.
The potential weakness of the D-Mark clearly worries the Bundesbank. The
repo rate, with which funds are supplied to banks, was yesterday left
unchanged at a lowest accepted level of 7.60 per cent. A battle is
developing between a market that wants to sell the D-Mark and a central bank
that wants its value to be maintained.
Sterling's performance surprised some dealers. The pound should have been
undermined by political unrest in Westminster and by suspected Bank of
England selling of the currency.
But the outlook for the dollar and D-Mark looks uncertain and some dealers
wonder whether the yen's rise has run its course. So, the pound, whose
country has a positive growth rate and few inflation worries, might look
attractive.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Statoil halts additive project
</HEADLINE>

STATOIL, THE Norwegian state oil company, has halted engineering work on a
NKr3bn (Pounds 290m) methyltertiary butyl ether plant and said it will
charge accounts with a NKr300m loss on the project.
There are two reasons behind the move: Statoil failed to obtain an
acceptable agreement with a co-investor to reduce its risk in the project;
and market prospects for the product are more uncertain now than they were
when the decision to build the MTBE plant was taken two years ago.
MTBE is used as an additive to boost the octane level of unleaded petrol.
The plant was meant to be completed in 1995 and provide 100 permanent jobs.
Statoil said it had already awarded a major engineering, procurement and
construction contract for the plant to UK-based Fluor Daniel Construction.
Mr Arild Steine, a Statoil spokesman, said yesterday the company had
committed NKr500m to the project and, as a result of termination clauses in
the EPC contract, would lose NKr300m. He refused to reveal the overall EPC
contract value.
In April, Statoil warned the costs of an associated NKr2.4bn methanol
project were threatening to escalate by several hundred million kroner,
prompting a comprehensive and critical review of the project with findings
to be presented in June. Mr Steine said those findings would be presented an
the end of this month at the earliest.
Statoil has an 82 per cent stake in the proposed methanol plant and partners
Conoco Norway and parent company du Pont de Nemours have 18 per cent.
The methanol plant, planned to come on stream in 1996, is to be supplied
with 650m cubic metres of gas annually from the NKr25bn Heidrun oil and gas
field development, itself facing a cost over-run of NKr4.1bn or 19 per cent.
This would allow the methanol plant to produce 830,000 tonnes of methanol a
year. The methanol plant would, in turn, have supplied 200,000 tonnes
annually of feedstock to the MTBE plant allowing annual output of 500,000
tonnes.

FT  10 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The selling season in the main wool producing countries ends this month and
at some of the concluding sales this week offerings were low enough to limit
price guidance. The market in general is just holding its own, with the
emphasis on firmness or a continuing dearer tendency among finer merinos.
The recent sharp upturn in prices seems to be adequately established
although among wool consuming countries the burst of buying activity has
definitely subsided. The AWC market indicator yesterday was 459c a kg.
compared with 455c a kg. a week before.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's low-grade crystals
worry New York traders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEW YORK'S Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange, which administers the world's
most traded sugar futures contract, is under pressure from the world's
biggest refiners to tighten its definition of what is deliverable against
its No. 11 raw sugar contract.
The controversy, which has been simmering since April, is crucial to traders
who have been in the midst of a supply-driven rally following crop disasters
in Thailand and Cuba and reduced output from other of the world's major
sugar exporters.
Unusual market conditions have re-arranged traditional price relationships
between raw sugar and other grades. White sugar usually trades at a premium
to raw sugar, and so would not be delivered against the New York futures
contract.
However, as world raw sugar supplies tighten, prices have at times moved
above those for low-grade Brazilian white crystals. The Brazilian product is
of too low quality to be delivered against the London white sugar market,
but technically meets New York's delivery specifications, even though it is
not raw sugar.
New York sugar traders at one point believed as much as 200,000 tonnes of
the Brazilian crystals would be delivered against the expiring July
contract.
The crystals, according to Mr Peter Hulme, divisional trading director for
Tate and Lyle International, are difficult to handle, produce dust that
poses safety concerns for warehouses and could meet with import restrictions
at some international borders.
Now, with July futures well below their high of 13.26 cents a lb, the
immediate threat of white crystal deliveries seems to have faded.
However, the controversy remains, and Mr Hulme, who says he represents the
position of a consortium of sugar refiners, has asked the exchange clearly
to exclude the crystals from delivery before the problem arises again.
The CSCE's sugar committee met briefly Tuesday to discuss the issue, but did
not communicate any findings. The exchange's board was attending a regular
meeting yesterday but an official would not say if the sugar delivery issue
was on the agenda.
French trade house Sucres et Denrees yesterday denied rumors that it sold
white sugar to Russia's Prodintorg trade agency in the past few days,
reports Reuter from Paris.
'I don't know where these rumours come from. They're false. We haven't
signed a deal with Prodintorg recently, but we do sell sugar every day to
Russia through private buyers,' said Sucden's co-president, Mr Serge
Varsano. Private business with Russia was likely to reach 1m to 1.5m tonnes
this year, through small but almost daily sales of 20,000 to 40,000 tonnes,
he added.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India tries to realise its food
export dream - Stefan Wagstyl reports on a switch to a more outward-looking
agricultural policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN GOVERNMENTS have long dreamt of turning the fertile fields of the
Punjab, in northern India, into an important source of export earnings.
The soil, water, and the weather are well-suited to the large-scale
production of cash crops and Punjabi farmers are among the most industrious
in India. The state is the largest contributor to the country's national
food stockpile.
And yet, Punjab's and India's food exports are minuscule. The country, the
world's second largest producer of fruit and vegetables and a leading grower
of grains, exports less than 1 per cent of its output.
The reformist government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, now
wants to transform Indian agriculture. Earlier this year, it announced new
policies to promote agricultural exports with a view to increasing them from
USDollars 2.5bn in the year to March 1993 to Dollars 5bn-6bn in 1996-97. The
figure excludes tea and other traditional plantation crops such as coconuts,
but it includes fruit and vegetables, meat, grains, sugar and fish-farm
products.
Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, believes the policy changes will
stimulate rapid growth in agricultural exports because investments in
agriculture brought quick results. 'It will not take much time,' he says.
Punjabi businessmen think, however, that the government's target will be
hard to meet. They argue that it could be difficult to persuade farmers to
improve the quality of the crops to make them fit for export. Also, India
lacks the storage and transport facilities needed to deliver produce to
foreign markets. Mr Rohit Khanna, a consultant at Nijjer Agro Foods, one of
India's largest food processing companies, says the potential of Indian
agriculture is 'unbelievable' but it could take 20 years for it to be
fulfilled.
Moreover, businessmen say India cannot produce farm goods of international
quality without support from foreign food processing groups as only they can
provide the necessary seeds and technology. As Mr Khanna says: 'Without
prior experience it is impossible to develop a solid food processing
industry. Otherwise large Indian industrial groups would have moved into
agriculture long ago.'
The government's main concession is to permit businessmen to import
machinery and raw materials such as seeds duty-free for use in
export-oriented farms or food processing plants. Given that Indian import
duties are among the world's highest, this will greatly reduce the cost of
investing in modern equipment. Moreover, export-oriented units will be
obliged to export only 50 per cent of their output, leaving the rest for
sale in the Indian market.
At the same time, the government is easing a host of controls regulating the
flow of food supplies in India - including export restrictions on sugar,
grains, oils and other crops.
The controversial reforms represent a significant departure from
post-independence agricultural policy, a central plank of which has been
restraint of exports to keep down domestic food prices and reduce the risk
of famine. Mr Mukherjee says the new export-oriented policy will not hurt
domestic consumers because total output is rising and will increase further
with the new techniques that export-oriented producers will introduce.
However, many businessmen doubt whether the country's agricultural sector
can bring results as fast as the government expects.
They point to shortages of adequate cold storage warehouses, food processing
plants and refrigerated lorries. India processes less than 1.5 per cent of
its fruit and vegetables, compared with 80 per cent in the US and 70 per
cent in Brazil, the world's largest fruit growers.
Educating farmers to produce exportable crops takes longer than might be
expected. Often Indian seeds need replacing with new varieties bred for
their resistance to disease. Sometimes such seeds can be imported; sometimes
imported seeds must be adapted for Indian conditions - a time-consuming
laboratory job. Similarly, modern watering technologies - such as
drip-feeding techniques developed in the US, Israel and elsewhere - may be
ideal for Indian conditions. But more often than not they need some
alterations. For example, drip-feed systems can carry fertiliser as well as
water to crops - but fertiliser powders can clog the pipework if they are
wrongly prepared.
Unless farmers produce crops of the right quality, investments further along
the food processing pipeline will be worthless. As Mr Khanna of Nijjer says:
'The key to food processing is good links with the farmers'.
Nijjer itself has grown from a tomato farm run in the Punjab by Mr Wasant
Singh Nijjer, who travelled to the US in the 1960s and brought back modern
techniques and high-quality American seeds. After supplying other processors
for over 30 years, Nijjer started processing tomatoes into paste itself in
1991. This year it plans to export half its 5,000-tonne output and earn
about Rs300m ((Pounds 6m) in foreign exchange.
Perhaps, the best way for foreign companies to create such ties with local
farmers is through joint ventures. For example, Nijjer's main rival in
Punjab is a joint venture involving Pepsi, the US food and drinks company
and owner of India's largest tomato paste factory. Other foreign companies
that have invested in food processing include Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch
combine, which this year bought control of Kissan Products, a South Indian
maker of ketchup and food pulp.
An executive at one foreign food processing company says most multinationals
are likely to invest cautiously in Indian agriculture and food processing.
In almost every country, agriculture is prone to political interference, he
says. Foreign companies have to be particularly careful about not raising
nationalist's hackles. However, there are opportunities in India for
investing in downstream processing. India can be a good source of supply,
especially for the fast-growing markets of east Asia, says the executive.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold dips below Dollars 370 an
ounce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD TRADED below Dollars 370 a troy ounce on the London bullion market
yesterday after an early bout of selling from the Middle East. Gold futures
were also knocked back sharply by speculative Middle East sales in early
trading on New York's Comex.
London's morning fix of Dollars 370.65 a troy ounce marked a fall of Dollars
4.60 on the previous afternoon fix. But the market recovered some of the
lost ground, fixing at Dollars 371.45 in the afternoon and closing at
Dollars 372.50, a fall of Dollars 2.85 on the day. Trading volume was light.
'The rally has clearly stalled,' said Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst with SG
Warburg. At the end of last month gold touched Dollars 380 a troy ounce in
London, the highest level for nearly two and a half years.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst with Williams de Broe, said the market needed to
consolidate and blow off some of the speculative froth. There had not been
much sign of producers coming into the market with forward sales.
Mr Spriggs said even those who were bullish about the rally should not be
surprised to see some consolidation. There was still no reason in the charts
why the price should not go on to Dollars 400 an ounce.
However, he was a bear of the market, and argued that the recent rise would
prove to be a spike driven by speculative money in the futures and options
markets.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italian fraud sparks call for
EC-wide investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission has asked European Community governments to
investigate the possibility of widespread fraud involving surplus stocks of
grain, following the discovery of an Ecu77.7m (Pounds 60m) wheat fraud in
southern Italy.
The Italian agriculture ministry announced at the weekend that a fraud had
been uncovered by 13 commission experts, working with the Italian
authorities in a two-week investigation.
The commission confirmed yesterday that its team had discovered a shortfall
of nearly 260,000 tonnes of durum or hard wheat - worth Ecu77.7m - compared
with the figure declared by AIMA, the Italian government agency that paid
private silos to stock the grain.
The commission's statement coincided with the first day of a two-day
European Parliament hearing on fraud in the Community. Yesterday, Mr John
Tomlinson, a British Labour MEP and member of the Parliament's budgetary
control committee, said fraud could be costing the EC more than Pounds 2bn a
year - 20 times Commission estimates. 'The Commission figure is the tip of
an iceberg - less than Pounds 100m and of that only about eight pence in the
pound recovered,' he said.
Mr Peter Schmidhuber the EC commissioner responsible for fraud prevention,
will address the Parliament's budgetary control committee today.
In its statement on the Italian case, the commission said it had called on
all member states holding surplus grain stocks to carry out 'the appropriate
inquiries', assisted by commission officials.
The commission's inquiry into the Italian fraud centred on stocks held in
Puglia, Basilicata, Campania, Calabria and Sicily, all in the south of the
country.
The commission said yesterday that the exact damage to the EC budget still
had to be worked out, because investigations were continuing into other
grain stocks not covered by the two-week Commission inquiry.
Italy will have to reimburse the community for the sums lost, and the
commission added that any other consequences for EC finances would be
examined as soon as the results of continuing inquiries had been analysed.
The Italian authorities claimed at the weekend that the implications of the
fraud would go well beyond the original value of the shortfall, because
wheat illegally sold on would distort the EC market. Some silos had also
claimed EC subsidies for non-existent purchases of durum wheat, the ministry
alleged.
The Italian involvement in the commission's inquiry is indicative of the new
spirit of co-operation in such investigations under the government of Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.

COPPER prices fell away from earlier highs in late trading on the LME, but
still ended steady, as did most other metals. Three-month metal made an
abortive attempt to break above Dollars 1,850 a tonne, aided by
option-linked buying. Selling emerged above Dollars 1,840, however, and by
the close the market was back at Dollars 1,834, unchanged from Tuesday.
ALUMINIUM also eased in late trading, pressurised by continued profit taking
and resistance above Dollars 1,180 a tonne for three-month metal. But given
recent investment fund and speculative buying, the market remained on course
for Dollars 1,200, dealers said. London's robusta COFFEE closed with small
gains. The market is caught between underlying buying interest from roasters
and overhead origin selling, particularly from Brazil and Indonesia. London
COCOA closed with marginal losses. Business was dominated by active rolling
forward of positions out of the near July contract into September. Dealers
said there was some talk that the business might have been fund-related.
Talks at the ICCO continued to be monitored. The key issue remains the
eventual dispose of the buffer stock.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar production forecast to
fall by 21% in 1992-93

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INDIAN SUGAR production in the season ending September 1993 will be about
10.6m tonnes, compared with the 1991-92 record of 13.41m tonnes, according
to the latest industry estimate.
Except for the few factories in Tamil Nadu, the industry has completed cane
crushing for 1992-93. The sharp setback in sugar production is attributed to
the fall in cane crop to 230m tonnes from 249m tonnes in 1991-92. Indian
sugar factories get to crush just about half the cane crop. The balance is
used to produce gur and locally-consumed sweetener.
Drought in many sugar growing areas and the industry's failure to clear cane
bills in time led to a shrinkage in the area under cane by about 300,000
hectares (750,000 acres) to 3.5m hectares in 1992-93. According to industry
officials the country's next cane crop will be around this year's level.
Planting has been particularly disappointing in drought-hit Maharashtra, the
second largest cane growing state in India.
As sugar production will once again be low during 1993-94, India will not be
left with export surpluses after meeting a domestic requirement of more than
12m tonnes. It may actually need to import sugar.
The country resumed exporting sugar after a gap of six years in 1990-91 and
the government has released 500,000 tonnes of sugar for export in stages
during the current year.
The 1993-94 season will be opening in October with much-reduced stocks of
2.7m tonnes, compared with 4.9m at the start of the current year.
Alarmed by the prospects for the next year, the federal government has told
sugar mills that for sugar to be produced between October 1 and November 15,
they will be allowed to sell 72 per cent of production in the open market,
compared with the normal 60 per cent. It has also offered a package of
incentives to the industry to enable it to settle the cane bills quickly.
The most important incentive is decontrol of the price and distribution of
molasses, an important by-product of sugar mills. As a result, the
industry's cane debts have fallen from Rs6bn last year to Rs1.5bn.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Soros comments act as catalyst for French
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH government bonds responded rapidly yesterday to positive comments by
Mr George Soros, the financial speculator. His support for French bonds in
favour of their German counterparts prompted a sharp rise in the French bond
futures contract.
September futures picked up half a point at one stage before profit-takers
moved in and sold them. The contract closed 0.18 higher at 118.02.
Mr Soros said: 'France is gaining in competitiveness against Germany. It has
a significantly lower inflation rate and its industry has been more adept at
adjusting its cost structure than its German counterparts.' Most economists
said Mr Soros's remarks contained nothing new but acted as a catalyst.
Mr George Magnus, a senior economist at SG Warburg Securities said: 'I think
the Soros factor has been instrumental if only to the extent that he singled
out the French market as his particular favourite.' The comments followed
remarks by Bundesbank council members signalling that French interest rates
have further to fall.
Traders said the market was overbought but new investors were still visible
at the long end of the yield curve yesterday with few sellers prepared to
match their orders.
IN Germany, the Bundesbank failed to fulfil hopes of easier money and left
its repo rate unchanged at 7.6 per cent. However, government bond futures
performed strongly on a mix of factors.
September bund futures opened at 94.33 and rose to a high of 94.68 before
settling at about 94.52.
Dealers said the market was recovering from an oversold position. Ms Alison
Cottrell, an economist with Midland Global Markets, argued that unforeseen
currency weakness, prompted by Mr Soros's comments, had prevented an easing
in the repo rate but the signals were encouraging for a shaving next week.
THE UK government bond market was the strongest performer with long-dated
gilts gaining half a point at best. However, short-dated gilts were held
back by heavy supply in the Eurosterling sector.
Much of the business was futures driven with long gilt futures breaking
through a resistance level at 104.00 and triggering some stop-loss buying.
The September contract opened up at 103.27 and closed at 104.16, its high of
the day.
Interest in short-dated issues was diverted by Pounds 700m of fixed rate
Eurosterling deals, including a Pounds 500m five-year issue by Gefco, the UK
export finance agency.
THE combination of a firm lira and a strong tone in the other European
government bond markets provided momentum for the Italian government bond
market.
The Liffe futures contract, which broke through the psychologically
important 100.00 level on Tuesday, opened at 100.15 yesterday and reached a
high of 100.48. But the contract ended the day at 100.20 as investors took
profits.
LONG-DATED Spanish government bonds made further gains yesterday, continuing
to benefit from the socialists' election victory on Sunday.
The yield on the 10-year bond, which was at 10.88 per cent on Friday, fell
to 10.68 per cent from 10.72 per cent yesterday. However, some analysts
pointed out that the rally may be running out of steam.
The long end of the Spanish government bond market has outperformed the
short end this week, leading to a flattening of the yield curve and
reflecting expectations that cuts in interest rates will take place more
gradually under the socialists than they would have done had the People's
Party won the election.
US Treasury prices firmed at both ends of the market yesterday as trading
remained subdued ahead of tomorrow's inflation report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/2 at 103
1/8 , yielding 6.873 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was  1/16 firmer at 99 23/32 , to yield 4.258 per cent.
Traders reported retail and speculative interest throughout the day,
although some of the early gains were a follow through from reports of
buying by Middle East investors overnight.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Sterling dominates as week's supply
breaches Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW issues in the sterling market again dominated activity yesterday, with a
further Pounds 700m of fixed-rate paper bringing the supply of paper so far
this week to Pounds 1.1bn
In the developing Eurolira bond market, the European Investment Bank issued
a L700bn five-year deal, the largest single lira issue ever launched. The
deal benefited from strong overseas demand for the still relatively high
coupons available on Eurolira bonds.
Of the three fixed-rate issues launched in the sterling market yesterday,
the largest, a Pounds 500m issue for Gefco, the UK export financing agency,
was the most disappointing.
A Pounds 100m 5 1/2 -year issue for Unilever, arranged by SG Warburg and IBJ
International, met enthusiastic demand, driven by retail interest in the
name. Like Marks and Spencer's Pounds 150m offering yesterday, the deal
attracted institutional investors who expected the spread to tighten as
retail investors bought paper.
After a wave of new issues in March, the sterling market has been relatively
quiet until this week, as the over-supply was absorbed. However, the
relative under-performance of the gilts market compared with some European
markets in the past few months has rekindled interest in sterling bonds,
which offer relatively attractive yields.
However, continental European investors remain very choosy, preferring high
quality and rare names. M&amp;S and Unilever both fit the bill. The fact that
the deals both mature in 5 1/2 years, but are priced off a five-year gilt,
providing an extra saving for issuers seeking to meet aggressive swap
targets, does not appear to have deterred these investors.
The Gefco deal suffered by comparison, although the spread of 20 basis
points over the five-year gilt was not substantially tighter. However,
dealers reported slow sales, and said the issue was likely to take some time
to place. 'The spread is not likely to perform because the deal has no
retail potential,' argued one dealer. However, an official at lead manager
Samuel Montagu pointed out that Gefco paper has traded as tight as 10 basis
points of gilts in the past.
A 10-year issue for the Bank of Greece, its first Eurosterling deal, met a
positive reception. The Greek central bank, which is rated BAA1 by Moody's
and BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's, is an unusually weak credit for the sterling
market. However, careful pre-marketing of the deal, and the general view
that Greece, as an EC member, is an improving credit, encouraged broad
participation in the deal by UK institutional investors.
The deal, arranged by SG Warburg, was launched at a spread of 175 basis
points over the 10-year gilt, and tightened to 170 basis points by the end
of the day.
In the floating-rate sector of the sterling market, Woolwich Building
Society launched a Pounds 125m four-year deal via UBS, which benefited from
the substantial level of redemptions in the sector.
Moody's, the US rating agency, has lowered the senior debt ratings of Credit
Lyonnais and its subsidiaries from AA3 to A1, citing asset quality problems
and the implications of the bank's forthcoming privatisation. The ratings
were placed under review on March 29.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Schiphol Airport flies in the
face of flotation talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTERDAM'S Schiphol Airport, with a new Triple A/AA1 rating, strong
financial position and international reputation in such areas as efficiency
and duty-free shopping, appears to be a prime candidate to become the next
European airport to be either making or considering a stock market
flotation.
However, the lure of the private sector has no appeal for the airport, even
as it enters the second phase of an ambitious multi-billion guilder, 15-year
project to double in size by the year 2003.
The scale of the investment might have persuaded other airports to look into
attracting outside shareholders, but Schiphol - 76 per cent owned by the
Dutch government, 22 per cent by the city of Amsterdam and 2 per cent by
Rotterdam - is firmly against the idea.
'The answer is simply no,' says Mr Bart van Leeuwen, the airport's finance
director.
True, Schiphol tapped the international bond market last week for the first
time in nearly 30 years, raising Fl 400m (Dollars 222m) towards
consolidating short-term debt and paying for its heavy investment programme.
But the airport, Europe's fifth largest, is happy being 'a private company
owned by the government'.
One key to Schiphol's contentment is that under government ownership it does
not pay corporate tax. Dividend policy is another obvious advantage. For the
past six years, Schiphol has paid an unchanged Fl 60 per share of Fl 1,000
even though operating profit trebled and net profit doubled over the same
period.
This minimal dividend has freed cash-flow for a Fl 4.5bn investment
programme launched in 1989 and due for completion in the year 2003.
Privatised airports, such as BAA in the UK or Vienna airport in Austria,
must generate cash to satisfy their shareholders and to plough back into
their operations, Mr Leeuwen says.
Schiphol's firm opposition to privatisation, which is shared by its three
public-sector owners, does not mean that it plans to remain aloof from the
international capital market.
Last week's 7-year 6.75 per cent Eurobond, led by ING Bank and supported by
Schiphol's AAA rating from Standard &amp; Poor's and AA1 from Moody's, could be
followed by bonds in future years, al-though Mr van Leeuwen is keeping an
open mind. Until now, Schiphol has financed investments almost exclusively
through private placements and internal cash flow.
Its finances were lifted by its record performance in 1992, with net profit
rising by 55 per cent to Fl 90m. This is in contrast to the loss-making KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines, which accounts for nearly half of Schiphol's revenue
and half its aircraft movements.
Reflecting the difficult straits of the world's airlines, Schiphol raised
its landing charges by just 1.6 per cent in April instead of the 3 per cent
rate by which it would normally have increased charges to keep up with
inflation.
The first five-year phase of Schiphol's 15-year investment programme was
completed last month, when the airport opened a Fl 550m extension to its
existing terminal building, raising passenger capacity to 27m a year from
19m.
According to the airport's investment projections, its financial obligations
will start to exceed free cash flow around the turn of the century, when
Schiphol is hoping to build a fifth runway to lift its capacity to more than
100 aircraft movements an hour from the current 70 to 80.

ELECTROLUX, the Swedish electrical appliance group, has sold a 10 per cent
interest in Email, the Australian white goods company, to a group of
international institutions for ADollars 84.5m (USDollars 56.5m).
It retains an interest of just over 5 per cent in Email. Electrolux has 'no
present intention' of further reducing its stake and said the disposal did
not reflect any change in the commercial relationship between the two
companies.
Electrolux said the deal would generate a SKr200m (Dollars 27.4m) capital
gain, but one-off costs on to the sale of a French operation meant it would
have no overall impact on second-quarter results.
Email distributes Electrolux products in Australia and uses the Swedish
company's networks in Asia for export.
For the year ended March, Email made profits after abnormal items of
ADollars 55.5m on sales of ADollars 1.47bn.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Enso-Gutzeit to expand in east
Germany
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENSO-GUTZEIT, one of Finland's largest paper makers, yesterday announced
plans to build a DM800m (Dollars 493m) recycling plant in the eastern German
state of Saxony, the biggest single foreign investment so far in the region.
In a move aimed at expanding into the German market, and later into eastern
Europe, the group will use the green-field site primarily for recycling, and
will target the product for the growing newspaper market in eastern Germany.
Germany already accounts for 15 per cent of the group's net sales, which
last year totalled FM10.2bn (Dollars 1.86bn).
The plant, situated east of Leipzig, one of the fastest-growing industrial
centres among the five new eastern states, will start operating in September
1994 with an initial workforce of 300 people.
Mr Jukka Hamala, director of Enso, said the decision to locate in Saxony was
prompted by the region's proximity to southern Germany, the Czech Republic,
and other countries in eastern Europe.
'We are in the middle of one of the fastest-growing markets in Europe,' he
said, adding that the group had wanted to enter the recycling market for
some time, but could not obtain enough capacity from the small Finnish
market.
Mr Kai Korkonen, managing director of Sachsen Papier Eilenburg, the company
set up to run the plant, said it would have a production capacity of 280,000
tons a year.
The government of Saxony, led by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, had lobbied hard to
attract Enso. 'Western Germany could take a leaf out of our book. Saxony is
determined to attract foreign investors and make the region a highly
competitive market.' Mr Biedenkopf, an economist and one of the most dynamic
prime ministers in the eastern German state, also said the investment by
Enso could persuade other foreign investors to settle in Saxony, and create
jobs.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rembrandt results show little
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REMBRANDT Group, the South African tobacco-based conglomerate, produced
earnings per share virtually unchanged at 182.1 cents for the year ended
March as weak performances from industrial interests offset growth on the
tobacco and banking side.
The results were broadly in line with market expectations, although
disappointing by the standards of Rembrandt - one of the largest and most
successful companies in the country. Rembrandt is controlled by the Rupert
family, which also controls the Swiss-based tobacco and luxury goods group
Richemont.
The group is stepping up its dividend by 11 per cent to 36.2 cents a share,
against the 32.6 cents paid for 1991-92.
Income before tax rose to R1.24bn (Dollars 269m) from R1.17bn.
Tobacco, where the group has a market share of about 80 per cent, normally
contributes about 40 per cent of bottom line earnings. Analysts believe that
on the published figures, attributable income from tobacco probably rose by
14-15 per cent despite an estimated 3 per cent decline in volumes.
Offsetting this werepoor figures from Huntcor, the industrial subsidiary
with food and forestry interests. Huntcor's attributable profits fell by 65
per cent, mainly on account of a R77m loss at Rainbow Chickens. Metkor and
Dorbyl, other industrial investments in the group, also performed poorly.
Aside from tobacco, and industrial interests - which account for about 10
per cent - some 18 per cent of group earnings come from Genbeheer, the
holding company of Gencor, in which Rembrandt has a 25.2 per cent stake.
Earnings at ABSA, the country's largest banking group, which contributes
about 7 per cent of Rembrandt's earnings, rose by 12 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Premier earnings up 16% despite
difficult conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREMIER Group, the South African food, pharmaceuticals and retail group,
overcame difficult trading conditions last year to record a 16 per cent
increase in earnings per share to 283 cents.
The results reflect a better than expected performance from Metro Cash and
Carry, the food distributor and a substantial improvement in earnings from
Premier Pharmaceuticals.
Contributions from the group's core food division were flat as the drought
and deteriorating socio-political conditions put margins under pressure. On
the retail side, CNA Gallo performed slightly better and Clicks recorded
good growth.
Turnover rose 3 per cent to R10.1bn (Dollars 3.16bn) with trading profit 4
per cent higher at R438.9m. A decline in the interest bill to R23.6m from
R58m boosted pre-tax profits, which rose by 15 per cent to R415.3m.
A lower tax charge and higher dividend income and equity accounted earnings
helped lift net profits by 23 per cent to R233.8m. The dividend is going up
from 81 cents a share to 94 cents.
Mr Peter Wrighton, the chairman, said the group was planning for real growth
in the year ahead. This assumed a political settlement, a better performance
from the food division and CNA Gallo, first time contributions from Bonnita
and UPD, and other operations staying on course.
Mr Wrighton stressed that last year, ending April, was characterised by a
number of acquisitions and disposals.
Premier paid R144m for a 39 per cent interest in Bonnita Holdings, South
Africa's second largest producer of milk based products; increased its
shareholdings in Premier Pharmaceuticals, Clicks and Metro; and formed
United Pharmaceutical Distributors, a wholesale distribution company in
which Premier has an effective 40 per cent stake.
The chairman said the group had also substantially increased its investment
in people development to over R20m a year.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Japan's assurers still not
investing abroad - Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo on the reluctance of
life groups to diversify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S life assurance companies have joined the list of financial
institutions willing to expose some of the scars from the late 1980s, a time
when even sober-minded fund managers were tempted to lend to speculators and
developers who would normally be kept at arm's length.
The industry's bad loans comprise a very small portion of loans outstanding,
but the figures released by the companies, with Chiyoda Mutual topping the
list at Y231.6bn (Dollars 2.2bn), do not tell the full story as they include
loans on which interest rates have been greatly reduced to ease the squeeze
on troubled clients.
A modest stock of non-performing loans should encourage assurers to press
for better returns on long-term shareholdings in Japanese companies, but
there is little sign they have begun to act on their threat to pull-out of
shares in companies with low dividends.
The life companies had also indicated that they would increase their income
by diversifying into foreign investments, but their holdings of foreign
securities slipped 4 per cent in January, compared with the same month a
year earlier, and the yen's rapid appreciation in recent weeks has made them
even more wary of investing abroad.
Mr Takayuki Kimura, manager of Chiyoda Mutual's international department,
said the yen's erratic movement has made the eight leading companies
particularly conscious of exchange rate risk: 'We have to be very careful
about international investment.'
He said Chiyoda Mutual has 'revised' its long-term shareholdings in Japanese
companies and is altering its portfolio 'little by little' but has no
intention of dumping the stocks of companies with low dividends. Facing a
fourth year of falling profits, many listed Japanese companies are cutting
their dividends or considering a cut, putting more pressure on the life
assurers.
'We don't only look at dividends. We have to consider the future growth
potential of the company, its long-term profitability, and the importance of
cross-shareholdings,' Mr Kimura said.
The prospect of life assurers running down their investment portfolios has
prompted a debate over whether the country's corporate cross-holding system
was coming apart at the seams. But the companies are holding on to most of
the shares, even though the strategy appears to be bruising them, and their
policy holders.
A surge in Tokyo prices in the final weeks of the fiscal year to March
bolstered the companies' latent profits on stocks at the close of accounts.
But the combined total for the eight leading life companies - Y8,416bn - was
still down almost 60 per cent from two years ago, reflecting the steep
decline in share prices.
To encourage the companies not to realise profits, which could have pushed
share prices lower, the finance ministry allowed them to record appraisal
profits on their holdings. Seven of the eight took advantage of the
decision.
The combined premium income of the eight expanded by only 4.4 per cent in
1992-93 while total assets were 9.1 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Even with the appraisal profits on stocks, their return on assets ranged
from only 3.8 per cent to 4.72 per cent.
Nippon Life has by far the largest latent profits on stocks, Y3,183bn at the
end of March, while Chiyoda had the smallest at Y169.6bn - some Y60bn less
than its non-performing loans.
Chiyoda's loan problems stem partly from its funding of Mr Hideki Yokoi, a
share speculator. The company has launched a legal action against him in an
attempt to raise funds from the sale of Tokyo property.
Traditionally, Japanese life assurers were important providers of funds to
the country's manufacturing companies, but these companies found funds easy
to raise on the stock market during the late 1980s, prompting some to look
beyond the old, trusted customers.
Life assurers insist that they have limited exposure to the property market,
the cause of Japanese banks' bad loan burden, and say they are again able to
court conservative industrial companies, which are unable to raise funds on
the Tokyo stock market. They say they have overhauled their risk assessment
systems to ensure fewer lending mistakes.
At the end of last year, the companies loans amounted to 37 per cent of the
life assurers' assets, while securities holdings, domestic and foreign,
comprised 43 per cent of that figure - domestic stocks accounted for about
half of the total.
The companies are hoping that loans as a percentage of funds employed, which
fell from 68 per cent to 35 per cent from 1975 to 1989, will start to
recover. They expect the percentage to improve to between 40 and 50 per cent
over the next few years.

It retains an interest of just over 5 per cent in Email. Electrolux has 'no

Mr Leif Johansson, Electrolux president, said: 'Email is a highly valued

further strengthened in the future.'
Email distributes Electrolux products in Australia and uses the Swedish
company's networks in Asia for export.
Electrolux plans to continue to participate in technical licence and brand
name agreements and Mr Anders Scharp, Electrolux chief executive, will
remain on the Email board.
The shares were placed by Potter Warburg with institutional investors in
Australia, the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and the US at ADollars 3.25.
They closed at ADollars 3.37.
For the year ended March, Email made profits after abnormal items of

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Enso-Gutzeit to expand in east
Germany

ENSO-GUTZEIT, one of Finland's largest paper makers, yesterday announced
plans to build a DM800m (Dollars 493m) recycling plant in the eastern German
state of Saxony, the biggest single foreign investment so far in the region.
In a move aimed at expanding into the German market, and later into eastern
Europe, the group will use the green-field site primarily for recycling, and
will target the product for the growing newspaper market in eastern Germany.
Germany already accounts for 15 per cent of the group's net sales, which
last year totalled FM10.2bn (Dollars 1.86bn).
The plant, situated east of Leipzig, one of the fastest-growing industrial
centres among the five new eastern states, will start operating in September
1994 with an initial workforce of 300 people.
Mr Jukka Hamala, director of Enso, said the decision to locate in Saxony was
prompted by the region's geographical proximity to southern Germany, the
Czech Republic, and other countries in eastern Europe.
'We are in the middle of one of the fastest-growing markets in Europe,' he
said, adding that the group had wanted to enter the recycling market for
some time, but could not obtain enough capacity from the small Finnish
market.
Mr Kai Korkonen, managing director of Sachsen Papier Eilenburg, the company
set up to run the plant, said it would have a production capacity of 280,000
tons a year.
The government of Saxony, led by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, had lobbied hard to
attract Enso. 'We cut through the red tape, we resolved any outstanding
problems over property rights, and we showed that planning permission could
be done in six months,' he said.
'Western Germany could take a leaf out of our book. Saxony is determined to
attract foreign investors and make the region a highly competitive market.'
Mr Biedenkopf, an economist and one of the most dynamic prime ministers in
the eastern German state, also said the investment by Enso could persuade
other foreign investors to settle in Saxony, and create jobs.
The unemployment rate in Saxony is 301,000, or 13 per cent of the labour
force, although this does not take into account those on job creation and
training schemes, and part-time work.
Besides its geographical location, the government of Saxony attracted Enso
by offering substantial subsidies. About 15 per cent of the construction
costs for the plant have been covered by the state. In addition, Enso will
receive generous tax concessions of up to 40 per cent for the first three
years.
These advantages 'will offset high labour costs and make it worthwhile for
us to use Saxony as a stepping stone into other parts of this region in
Europe,' said Mr Korkonen.
Saxony, and particularly Leipzig, the state's second largest city, was one
of the centres of the printing and newspaper industry before the second
world war, and the core of eastern Germany's heavy industry under the former
communists. It also has a skilled workforce and a westward-looking 4.8m
population.
As a result, Saxony now tops the list in foreign investors and privatisation
sales undertaken by the Treuhand, the agency responsible for restructuring
and selling off eastern Germany's industrial sector.
Since late 1990, the Treuhand has secured investment commitments of more
than DM42.7bn, and job guarantees in excess of 406,500. Foreign companies
which bought from the Treuhand account for DM2.7bn of investments, and
24,100 guaranteed jobs.
Daimler-Benz is increasingly optimistic that it will be able to boost 1994
sales after an expected decline in sales in 1993, AP-DJ reports from
Stuttgart.
Mr Gerhard Liener, chief financial officer, said the German industrial giant
expects to post sales of DM96bn in 1993, down from DM98.5bn in 1992.
Daimler is basing its growing optimism for 1994 on hopes that it will double
its expected 1993 sales of its C-class Mercedes-Benz cars.

THE LAWSUIT filed by Wall Street securities house PaineWebber against the UK
investment bank Kleinwort Benson alleging that two of its former executives
who defected in April to Kleinwort's US operation had improperly lured away
clients, employees and confidential information has been settled.
The suit was filed on April 29 after Mr Stephen Canter, president and chief
executive of PaineWebber's investment management subsidiary Mitchell
Hutchins Institutional Investors (MHII), and Mr Emad Zikry, the firm's
managing director of fixed income and quantitative investing, left the firm
for Kleinwort Benson International Investment in New York. Following their
departure, several other MHII executives also joined them at Kleinwort.
At the time, PaineWebber said the two had recruited other MHII employees
while still at the firm and used confidential and proprietary client
information to solicit MHII clients.
As part of its settlement with Kleinwort, however, MHII acknowledged that
'after completing expedited pre-trial discovery proceedings, it has
discovered no evidence that either Mr Canter or Mr Zikry, while in the
employ of MHII, solicited any client or any employee of MHII to leave MHII
or took any property belonging to MHII'.
Both sides expressed satisfaction with the outcome, the full terms of which
were not disclosed.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Decision time for O&amp;Y in the US
 -A row threatens to derail Dollars 5.3bn debt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Cyrus Vance is due to tell a New York judge today whether he has had more
success in brokering a peace agreement among squabbling creditors of Olympia
&amp; York than he had among the warring factions of Bosnia.
In a business version of shuttle diplomacy, the former US secretary of state
has spent the past 10 days meeting the various protagonists separately. He
has asked them not to talk to the press or to each other. One of the parties
predicts that he is more likely to submit a progress report today than the
terms of a full peace settlement.
Mr Vance was approached in a last-ditch effort to break a deadlock over the
appointment of a new board of directors for Olympia &amp; York Real Estate USA,
the crippled Canadian developer's 80 per cent owned US subsidiary.
The row over the directors has wider ramifications, however, for the
company, one arm of O&amp;Y which has so far managed to avoid the protection of
a bankruptcy court.
In particular, it threatens to derail painstaking negotiations to
restructure USDollars 5.3bn in debt owed by the US subsidiary to about two
dozen separate groups of lenders.
The US unit's secured creditors are backing demands by its management for
greater autonomy from Olympia &amp; York Developments (OYDL), the Toronto-based
parent company. OYDL emerged from bankruptcy protection last month, and is
now run by a court-appointed administrator.
The administrator, Mr Robert Lowe, an insolvency specialist in the Toronto
office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, is assisted by a five-member 'monitoring
committee' representing OYDL's unsecured shareholders. The committee is
chaired by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, OYDL's biggest creditor.
The US subsidiary, led by former New York deputy mayor John Zuccotti,
believes that a degree of independence from Toronto would expedite the US
restructuring plan, as well as maintain the stability and values of O&amp;Y's US
properties, which include the 7.6m sq ft World Financial Centre in lower
Manhattan.
Central to the demands of the US unit and its creditors is the inclusion of
three independent directors, based in New York, on the board of O&amp;Y USA.
Mr Zuccotti and the secured lenders have accused the administrator and the
monitoring committee in Toronto of stonewalling the appointment of an
independent board.
According to an affidavit submitted by Mr Zuccotti last week, the committee
and the administrator also do not see eye to eye over which of them controls
the US subsidiary. Mr Zuccotti said that this situation has made it
'virtually impossible for me to properly perform my duties'.
Spokesmen for both the monitoring committee and the administrator have
denied Mr Zuccotti's assertion.
With no US board in place to take decisions or set policy guidelines, the
debt talks have ground to a halt.
A lawyer for one group of Japanese creditors says that a successful debt
plan is 'almost impossible' without a resolution of the corporate governance
issues.
The dispute over the independence of the US board also appears to be part of
an inevitable jockeying for position among different classes of creditors.
An official at one bank involved in the negotiations notes that the present
market value of the US properties is not enough to cover even the claims of
fully-secured creditors.
They will be forced to take 'a pretty sizeable haircut,' he predicts.
Matters are complicated however, by the overlapping interests of some
creditors.
Two secured creditors of the US operations, Sanwa Bank and Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, are also members of the Canadian monitoring committee of
unsecured creditors. CIBC and Sanwa have opposed moves by the rest of the
committee to keep control of the US board in Canada.
Citibank, which has spearheaded efforts by the US creditors to obtain
greater independence for O&amp;Y USA, was co-chairman of the Canadian unsecured
creditors committee which approved the parent company's restructuring plan.
One banker accuses Citibank of displaying 'a degree of schizophrenia'.
For his part, Mr Lowe noted in a statement last month that he has a
fiduciary responsibility to about 100 international creditors of OYDL, many
of them in the US. The tangled negotiations raise the prospect that O&amp;Y USA
may, in the end, be unable to avoid the same fate as its parent.
An official at one secured lender predicts that the wrangling among
creditors will eventually force all the group's US properties into the
bankruptcy courts.
Mr Zuccotti noted in his recent affidavit that 'the expense and complexity
is multiplying . . . The process that has emerged has erected barriers to
communication, presents a constant threat to credibility, and provides an
image of apparent confusion in decision-making.'
But O&amp;Y USA also insists that talks with several creditor groups have made
substantial progress. A number of properties have already been sold or
handed over to creditors. There are plans to sell others, notably a
33-storey building in Portland, Oregon.
A spokesman says the company is 'quite confident that it has a very good
shot at accomplishing (a debt-restructuring)' if the dispute over the board
of directors can be settled.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: VW expected to build plant in
Basque region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CONFIRMATION that Volks-wagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, is investigating
new investment possibilities in Spain yesterday fuelled speculation that the
group may shortly unveil plans to build a revolutionary low-cost car
production plant in the Basque country.
Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, said 'some especially interesting' proposals
had been put forward from regional authorities.
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the German group's Basque-born
production director who recently defected from General Motors, campaigned
fiercely at GM for his so-called Plateau 6 plant to be built in his
homeland, where he retains strong political connections. The US group's
refusal, and its preference for any future investments to be made in eastern
Europe where costs are far below those in any European Community country,
are understood to be the main reasons for his stormy departure from Detroit
in March.
Seat's statement yesterday, following the announcement that Mr Lopez is to
hold press conferences in Hanover and Madrid next Monday, were widely seen
as signalling confirmation that VW had accepted his proposals.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, told shareholders last week that the group
was planning a new plant to build a cheap 'people's car'. He did not say
where or when.
Mr Piech, who recently ordered that development of a brand-new plant in
Mosel, eastern Germany, should be slowed because of industry-wide
over-capacity and the worst market slump since the war, said the people's
car could only be built in a new plant.
Plateau 6 is a concept developed partly by Mr Lopez while he was at GM. It
involves the assembly of cars from modules mainly shipped from outside
suppliers, and installed by their staff. The object is to cut costs by
reducing manufacturing time to around half the current European average.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Sharp reduction in number of
component suppliers planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLKSWAGEN group is planning a drastic reduction in the number of its
component suppliers, as it seeks to rationalise production and purchasing
operations.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, said in an interview with the FT that
the company was planning to move to a system in which some of its leading
suppliers became 'logistical partners'.
These first tier suppliers would take over responsibility for supplying
complete modules rather than individual components.
'Around the year 2000 our group will have 100-200 logistical partners.
Toyota has 220 logistical partners today,' said Mr Piech. At present the VW
division alone had 1,500 suppliers and Audi, the group's executive car
division had around 800.
Mr Piech said Audi currently had around 22 suppliers providing components
for a complete dashboard and instrument panel, which were assembled in the
car plant.
'We are beginning to plan for one of the 22 to become responsible for the
logistics of the other 21 suppliers, and this partner would supply a
complete module,' he said.
Since the arrival of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from General Motors
as the VW group director for purchasing and production, VW has started to
build a global purchasing organisation with the aim of cutting costs and
reducing dependence on its high cost German supply base.
Volkswagen has created seven purchasing centres around the world, said Mr
Frans Boot, head of the recently established VW group purchasing office in
the UK.
The groups have been set up in Wolfsburg, Germany, with responsibility for
purchasing from suppliers in northern Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East,
in Ingolstadt with responsibility for southern Germany, Austria and Italy,
and in Mlada Boleslav in the Czech Republic for eastern Europe.
A group purchasing office had been set up in Barcelona with responsibility
for Spain, Portugal and South America, in Detroit with responsibility for
the US, Canada and Mexico, in Brussels for the Benelux countries and France
and in Milton Keynes for the UK and Ireland.
The regional purchasing offices have been set up to serve all four of the
group's brand divisions, Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda, and under the
Lopez system all the groups will be seeking to scour their regions for lower
cost suppliers at high levels of quality and service.
Mr Boot said that the group was seeking to standardise many components
across model ranges.

APPLE Computer's share price dropped sharply yesterday when the personal
computer company revealed that second-half earnings would be lower than in
the same period last year, and below the company's expectations.
Apple's stock was down Dollars 5 at midday, trading at Dollars 44 1/2 . In
the second half of 1992, Apple earned Dollars 229.2m, or Dollars 1.88 a
share. Analysts had been expecting third-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.05 a
share, compared with Dollars 1.07 in the third quarter of 1992.
Apple said that while volume sales of its Macintosh personal computers
continued to be strong, price cuts forced by aggressive competition had
reduced gross profit margins.
'According to published industry reports, Macintosh continues to gain market
share in a very competitive industry,' said Mr John Sculley, chairman and
chief executive. 'However, our growth in unit shipments is coming at lower
prices than we previously expected - and this will diminish our
profitability during the second half of the fiscal year.
'We remain committed to our strategy of market share growth,' he said, 'and
we will be taking aggressive actions to accelerate sales momentum.'
Apple's announcement prompted several Wall Street analysts to lower their
earnings estimates for the company. Apple shares had been on a steady
decline since Monday, when analysts at Dean Witter and Bear Stearns
expressed concerns about their estimates.
Moody's Investors Service said yesterday it may downgrade Apple's shelf
registered debt currently at A2 and short-term debt at Prime-1.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Swiss group offers to buy back
shares

<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale de Surveillance, the Swiss trade and aid inspection group,
is offering to buy back for cancellation up to SFr216m (Dollars 154.2m)
worth of its bearer shares with a view to reducing its large liquid
reserves.
The directors revealed at the annual meeting in Geneva yesterday that
consolidated net income in the first four months of 1993 was 'slightly
lower' than in the same period of last year due to extraordinary gains in
1992. The operating margin was maintained at a satisfactory level.
No figures were given.
Following the example of EMS-Chemie last month, SGS is proposing to buy back
a significant block of its shares. Mrs Elisabeth Salina Amorini, chairman,
observed that the group had net liquid reserves of about SFr1bn,
representing about a third of its market capitalisation, and that the return
on them was declining as interest rates fell.
Shareholders will be issued free options for selling their shares at the
rate of five options for every bearer share held and one per registered
share. They can then sell one bearer share to the company at SFr2,300 for
every 100 options held or one registered share at SFr460 for every 20
options held. In both cases, Swiss 35 per cent withholding tax will be
deducted at source, so the effective prices are SFr1,530 and SFr306
respectively.
The operation differs from that of EMS in that both classes of shareholder
are treated equally. EMS made the offer only on its bearer shares, with the
result that the voting strength of its registered shares, held entirely by
Mr Christoph Blocher, increased to 64 per cent from 53 per cent.
The two groups used different methods of ensuring that individual
shareholders, for whom the sell back would not be fiscally sensible, could
benefit as well.

UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's largest insurance group, is to be re-listed on the
Oslo Stock Exchange within two weeks. It will then be released from the grip
of public administrators in August, company officials said yesterday.
The disposal on Tuesday of Uni Holding's 25 per cent stake in Skandia, the
big Swedish insurance group, was the last step in a difficult process to
facilitate a NKr4.3bn (Dollars 627m) recapitalisation of the group.
A fully-underwritten share offer will raise NKr2.8bn, while a bond issue
will generate the remaining NKr1.5bn. A prospectus for the issue of 208m new
shares, to be sent to 115,000 former Uni shareholders, is about to be
finalised. The shares in the rights issue will be priced a NKr10 each.
Norway's finance ministry had demanded the disposal of the Skandia stake
before it would approve the plan.
Uni collapsed last August under the weight of NKr3.8bn in short-term debt
accrued to finance the acquisition of a NKr4.7bn, 28.3 per cent Skandia
shareholding. Uni, together with Hafnia, the Danish insurance company,
jointly launched a failed raid on Skandia, which almost resulted in the
demise of both companies. Uni and Hafnia disposed of their respective
Skandia shareholdings in a deal valued at SKr3.2bn (Dollars 441m).
Skandia warmly welcomed news of the share placing, saying it brought
stability to its ownership base and 'a strong position in the market for
future success'. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia chief executive, said: 'This
means that uncertainty concerning the ownership issue, which has prevailed
for nearly three years, has at last been resolved.'
Uni sold 18.96m shares at SKr100 a share, or a total of NKr1.77bn, while
Hafnia got SKr110 a share.
At the end of March, Uni Holding's 25 per cent Skandia stake was booked at a
value of NKr1.57bn, which means it will book a gain on the disposal of an
estimated NKr200m. Uni's life insurance business still holds a 3.3 per cent
stake in Skandia, or 2.5m shares.
Skandia has rebuffed two assaults since 1990 - the first from Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken, the second from Hafnia and Uni Storebrand - but saw its
share price plunge from around SKr220 to a low of SKr45 in the process.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: German toolmaker deal closer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Maho and Friedrich Deckel, two of Germany's largest machine-tool
manufacturers, were suspended yesterday as they finalised their planned
merger.
The shares have been suspended pending a formal valuation of the two
companies to determine the terms on which the merger - and an accompanying
capital-raising issue - is to be effected. The transaction is set to be
finalised in September.
The fusion of the two south German companies, for decades bitter rivals,
underlines the severity of the downturn in the German machine-tools sector.
Both are loss-making and analysts believe a merger is the only way they can
survive amid market conditions depressed by weak demand for capital goods.
From being one of Germany's most prosperous industrial sectors, machine-tool
production fell 13 per cent in 1991 and a further 17 per cent last year. It
is set to fall again this year, taking output to half the level of 1989, the
record year for the industry in Germany.
The merged company will have market share of between 35 and 40 per cent of
the domestic German market for certain types of products, for example
milling and boring machines. The transaction is still subject to the
approval of Germany's cartel authorities.
Maho, based in Pfronten in south Germany, lost DM157m (Dollars 98.1m) in the
year to the end of June, 1992 on sales down 31 per cent to DM442m; Deckel,
based in Munich, lost DM75m last year on sales down from DM406m to DM290m.
The merger is likely to be effected by the exchange of one Deckel share for
1.2 Maho shares. It was first announced in April after Maho abandoned plans
for a strategic alliance with Traub, another machine-tools company. Traub
announced a co-operation deal with Berthold Hermle, manufacturer of milling
and boring tools.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Skandia clear victor in bitter
tussle - Christopher Brown-Humes and Karen Fossli on market implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swedish insurer Skandia was being magnanimous in victory yesterday, but
there was no disguising the feeling that it had emerged a clear winner from
nearly three years of turmoil in the Scandinavian insurance sector.
'We don't want to rub salt into an open wound, but we believe we have come
out top dog,' a Skandia official said.
The deal, which places 40 per cent of Skandia shares in the hands of
international institutional investors, leaves it with a stable ownership
base, and without a single large unfriendly presence on its shareholder
register for the first time since October 1990.
It confirms a clear triumph over the predators which tried to take it over -
first, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, which acquired a 28 per option in
pursuit of a grand insurance/banking alliance, and then Uni Storebrand and
Hafnia who bought 43 per cent in pursuit of pan-Nordic insurance
co-operation - and ensures their place is not taken by some equally
unwelcome grouping.
It also means the group is free to pursue its strategic ambition of building
up and integrating its insurance activities in what it describes as its
'Nordic home market'.
'We can now concentrate all our resources on the development of business
activities in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, while implementing a restructuring
of our international operations,' said Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia chief
executive.
The group has already signalled a retreat from non-life reinsurance, and has
a stated strategy of gaining between 20 and 25 per cent of the Scandinavian
life and non-life insurance market, compared with a 13-14 per cent share
today.
Pursuing this will now be a lot easier, not least because the group's main
rivals - including Uni Storebrand and Denmark's Baltica and Hafnia - have
been badly weakened by the events of the last two years.
This means Skandia should be able to pick up market share without reducing
premiums, simply because very few companies in the region can afford to
start a price war. Indeed, this weakness and the fact that no big foreign
insurer has entered the picture, suggest premium rates can now move upwards.
Skandia has shown interest in making an acquisition in Denmark in the past,
as its market share there is only around 5 per cent. While this could
trigger a bid for another group, it is far more likely that the growth will
be organic. It has made it clear it hopes to pick up some business in
Denmark following the March takeover of Hafnia's healthy insurance
activities by fellow Danish insurer Codan.
The placing of the Hafnia and Uni Storebrand shares was almost certainly
helped by a feeling that the Scandinavian market is picking up. It would
also have been assisted by firm evidence of financial recovery at Skandia,
which recently reported a SKr700m (Dollars 96.5m) profit for the first
quarter, a SKr1bn improvement on the same 1992 period. The group said its
net asset value per share was also increasing because of rising share and
bond prices and favourable exchange rate movements.
Uni Storebrand is also back in profit, with a NKr150m (Dollars 21.9m)
surplus, compared with a NKr151m loss in the same 1992 period.
The disposal of a 25 per cent stake has given the Norwegian group a new
lease of life following the chaos, uncertainty and debilitation which
followed its abortive attempt to take over its Swedish rival.
It can now look forward to a huge NKr4.3bn recapitalisation and to resuming
a listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange.
Mr Per Terje Vold, the group's chief executive, says the focus now will be
on improving group profitability, increasing business volume and
consolidating activities.
Mr Vold says the company was considering selling some of its international
activities as part of an increased focus on its core domestic life and
non-life businesses. Uni has a 30 per cent share of the Norwegian life
market and a 40 per cent non-life share.
'We also have a goal to return to the domestic market as a major
institutional investor, which was one of the main reasons for the merger
between Uni and Storebrand three years ago,' said Mr Vold.
The affair has not left Uni unscathed. It sold its shares for SKr100 each,
against an average purchase price of SKr220.
It also had to submit to one last concession to facilitate the disposal: to
bring Hafnia on board, the Norwegians agreed to sell their stake for SKr10
per share less than the price Hafnia fetched for its holding.
'Due to a previous agreement between Hafnia and Uni - which put some
restrictions on Uni - Hafnia had to get more to be brought into the deal,' a
source close to the three companies said.
The wider implication of the placing is that Scandinavian insurance, having
been shunned by international investors and analysts as a disaster area for
the last 18 months, is back on the map.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Demerger appears successful as Racal
Electronics recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY in Racal Electronics pre-tax profits, from Pounds 16.1m to
Pounds 51.5m, is the latest evidence Sir Ernest Harrison's demerger of the
group has added to shareholders' value.
The group may have benefitted from a general rise in the market since
Williams Holdings launched its hostile bid in 1991. But the turnround at
Racal and - surprises apart - the continuing strong performance at Chubb
which reports today, suggests that had the bid succeeded, it would have been
a deal of a lifetime for Williams.
This is not to say Racal has left its troubles behind. An overwhelming
Pounds 370.6m of sales - 39 per cent of group turnover - still comes from
data communications.
Margins may have recovered to 3.4 per cent from less than 0.5 per cent last
year. But rather like the personal computer market, this industry remains
fiercely competit-ive with margins and prices permanently under press-ure.
Adding two more percentage points of margin over the next two years as the
group has targetted, will have an impact on profits and earnings. But data
communications is hardly an area likely to generate strong long term growth
once that margin recovery has been achieved.
Elsewhere Racal remains a mixed bag of businesses which analysts say still
appears to lack clear strategic direction. Some businesses, like military
radio, in-flight telephony and area data networks would appear to have
strong long term potential.
There again, Redac the computer aided design business, continues to
disappoint in the short term and will continue to make losses this year, the
problem now being in the tough Japanese market.
Racal has sharply increased cash flow and hopes to do the same this year in
the data communications area, which should lead to further strengthening of
the balance sheet.
Recovery should lead to profits this year of Pounds 63m, giving earnings of
13.8p, rising to Pounds 72.5m or 16p next year.
This puts Racal's prospective earnings mulitiple on a 15 per cent premium to
the market this year, which given the tough nature of some of its markets,
seems high enough.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Mansfield Brewery ahead to Pounds 12.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANSFIELD BREWERY lifted pre-tax profits 14 per cent from Pounds 11m to
Pounds 12.5m in the 12 months to March 27. The Yorkshire and east Midlands
brewer also proposed a 4-for-1 share split.
Property disposals contributed just Pounds 8,000 compared with Pounds
407,000 and earnings per share increased by 14.8 per cent to 55.8p (48.6p).
Excluding the effect of the property sales earnings per share expanded by
21.1 per cent.
The final dividend is increased to 11p (9.6p) for a total of 15.4p (13.6p).
Profits at the operating level, after charging Pounds 1.3m against free
trade debts and loans, increased by 11.8 per cent to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds
16.7m).
The operating and trading margins improved to 15.9 per cent and 10.6 per
cent respectively mainly reflecting the increased proportion of draught
beers in the mix.
Turnover rose to Pounds 117.7m (Pounds 114.5m), buoyed by the full inclusion
of the 94 pubs acquired in March and April last year. The expansion of the
estate, which continued with the purchase of a further 17 pubs for Pounds
3.1m, enabled the group to increase sales of draught beers and ciders by 3.2
per cent despite the depressed market. Tied trade sales on a like-for-like
basis fell 3.9 per cent.
However, free trade sales rose 0.7 per cent with sales to wholesalers
growing 15.9 per cent.
Sir David White, chairman, said this had enabled the group to further
increase its share of the regional draught beer market. Sales of packaged
take home beers fell 7.6 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Fine Decor gains listing through Pounds
10.7m placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINE DECOR, the wallpaper designer, manufacturer and distributor came to
market yesterday through a placing of 5.39m ordinary shares at 210p each,
valuing the Cheshire-based group at Pounds 26.2m.
The company demerged from Boots in 1989 via a management buy-out, six months
after the chemist and DIY business acquired it as part of Ward White.
The placing raised about Pounds 10.7m in net proceeds, of which Pounds 4.6m
will be used to repay company debt with the balance representing shares sold
by existing institutional shareholders.
None of the directors disposed of shares, they retain 3.63m, representing a
29.1 per cent stake.
Mr Harry Morgan, chief executive, who previously spent 16 years with
Unilever, said the proceeds of the placing would give the group greater
flexibility to finance growth and that the listing will give it access to a
wider capital market.
He added: 'Since the buy-out, we have achieved strong growth in sales,
profits and market share, despite severe recessionary conditions in most of
the group's markets. The combination of these markets moving out of
recession and a recovery in the number of house sales is expected to have a
beneficial impact on the group.
The directors have forecast operating profits of not less than Pounds 1.62m
for the first half to July 31, against Pounds 1.32m in the comparable
period.
They expect to recommend total dividends for the current year of not less
than 7.5p.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Anglo Utd falls Pounds 30m in red -
Restructuring costs amount to Pounds 19m, including Pounds 8.9m to advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO UNITED, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, yesterday
reported a loss before tax of Pounds 30.5m for the year ended March 31 1993,
after exceptional charges of Pounds 18.8m relating to restructuring. That
compared with the previous profit of Pounds 4.8m.
Cost of lawyers, accountants, merchant banks and other parties working on
the restructuring amounted to Pounds 8.9m.
Mr John Gainham, group managing director, deplored the cost and said: 'When
you have advisers from eight banks you need a room the size of Wembley. We
have no control over them.'
Provisions for operational reorganisation came to Pounds 7m and there was
Pounds 2.4m mainly in connection with aborted disposals.
The interest charge was Pounds 32.4m (Pounds 32.7m). Anglo's core debt has
been reduced from Pounds 251m to Pounds 130m.
Interest on most of the borrowings is currently fixed at 14.5 per cent.
Operating profits before exceptional items fell from Pounds 34.3m to Pounds
20.3m. Mr Gainham said the result had been affected by another mild winter,
the continuing recession, uncertainty over the future of British Coal and
the distraction of the restructuring.
Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said: 'We have all the working capital we need.'
Smokeless fuels reported reduced operating profits of Pounds 12.3m (Pounds
21m) as many of the company's solid fuel customers continued to destock
because of recession.
Liquid fuels and chemicals saw operating profits drop from Pounds 8.6m to
Pounds 4.6m, mainly because of lower heating oil margins. Operating profits
from other activities fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 3.4m as revenues
declined from the Falkland Islands Company because of the reduction in
fishing.
Losses per share of 8.9p compared to earnings of 0.8p. There is no dividend,
compared with a total of 0.85p last time.
COMMENT
Anglo is in a vicious circle. The interest on the bank debt is bleeding the
company dry when it should be expanding its core businesses to help pay off
some of its principal debt. Ideally it should be buying some small
distributorships, but with what? Disposals is the obvious answer, but that
is all but ruled out while its markets are still affected by the recession.
One solution could be to sell its main business, namely smokeless fuels. In
the short-term Anglo is restricted to its current business plan but in the
long-term Mr Gainham says nothing is sacred and all options are open. With
the company's options so restricted, its shares, languishing at 3 1/2 p,
offer little hope for recovery in the medium-term.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Meyer at Pounds 14.4m and senses slow
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEYER INTERNATIONAL, the timber supplier which owns the Jewson chain of
builders' merchants, said the UK housing market was poised for recovery, but
warned that it could be slow.
Mr Richard Jewson, chairman, said: 'Housing starts have been up each month
since December 1992 and housing transactions rose slightly in March and
April.
'It is in the level of housing transactions, which drive repairs,
maintenance and improvement expenditure, where the group looks for an
increase; but the directors remain cautious about the pace of recovery.'
Meyer, which launched a Pounds 70m rights issue in April, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.4m in the year to March 31, compared with a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 19.9m, restated under FRS 3.
Turnover fell from Pounds 1.13bn to Pounds 1.09m, although it increased
marginally for continuing businesses. Operating profits were flat at Pounds
32.5m (Pounds 32.8m), but declined 15 per cent for continuing businesses.
Property profits fell back sharply, from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 500,000.
Earnings per share of 10.5p compared with a restated loss of 23.3p. As
announced at the time of the rights issue, which achieved a 93.7 per cent
take-up, the final dividend is cut to 5.8p (12.3p), giving a total of 10p
(16.5p), covered 1.05 times.
The number of Jewson builders' merchant branches fell by 11 to 191, a level
the group said it was now content with. Operating profits fell from Pounds
18.1m to Pounds 11.6m on sales of Pounds 394.1m (Pounds 409.2m). Recession
had taken particular toll of smaller customers, and bad debt charges
increased.
The forest products division raised operating profits to Pounds 8.8m (Pounds
8.5m) despite a slight fall in sales from Pounds 212.5m to Pounds 205.8m.
The laminates division, which since April 1 has been combined with forest
products, increased operating profits from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 8.8m.
Mr Jewson said: 'Our priority must be to drive up operating margins from the
present unsatisfactory level and thus restore a reasonable return on
capital. Provided expectations for the UK housing market are not frustrated,
I am confident that we shall make progress.'
He said business in the US had improved but the outlook was less certain in
the Netherlands and Germany.

<TEXT>
CAPE, the industrial services and building products group controlled by
Charter Consolidated, yesterday reported a slight fall in profits because of
lower interest income.
Pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 11.9m in the year to
March 31. Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chairman, said the results were satisfactory
given recession in the building industry. At the interim stage, profits fell
9 per cent to Pounds 6.52m.
Interest income fell from Pounds 1.08m to just Pounds 11,000. The company
said cash resources plunged Pounds 12m because of working capital needs and
capital expenditure.
Turnover increased 21 per cent to Pounds 245.2m, helped by acquisitions and
strong overseas sales. The latter rose by more than a third and now account
for 44 per cent of turnover, compared to 39 per cent a year ago.
Operating profits gained 2 per cent to Pounds 13.2m and were depressed by
losses at two building products companies. The building and architectural
products division saw profits fall from Pounds 6.88m to Pounds 6.48m while
industrial services increased 10 per cent to Pounds 6.69m.
Acquisitions, which included the purchase in December from William Baird of
contractor Darchem, contributed Pounds 4.9m of sales and Pounds 211,000 of
operating profits.
Earnings fell from 15.3p to 14.9p. The final dividend is 7.75p for a total
of 10.75p (10.5p).

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Interest cut gives boost to Caffyns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced exceptional costs and interest charges helped Caffyns, the motor
dealer, expand pre-tax profits from Pounds 63,000 to Pounds 262,000 in the
year ended March 31.
Turnover fell from Pounds 127.8m to Pounds 123.9m reflecting the closure of
four branches, and trading profit was cut from Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 1.55m.
Interest charges were Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 1.47m) mainly as a result of a
reduction in the stocking of new cars. Several manufacturers have introduced
new systems whereby they stand much of that cost and in return reduce the
dealers' margins in an attempt to forego heavy discounting.
Currently, the group was in negotiation to restructure its activities in the
Brighton and Hove area.
Negotiations were also in progress with Shell about future arrangements
regarding the petrol stations operated under the Shell Share franchise.
Earnings per share were 0.8p (losses 5.6p). The recommended final dividend
is 6.5p for an unchanged total of 11.5p.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sanderson Elect static at Pounds 1.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the economic climate and a disappointing contribution from
associates, Sanderson Electronics held first half pre-tax profits at Pounds
1.8m.
The group, which supplies a range of computer solutions and maintenance and
support services, lifted turnover 14 per cent to Pounds 12.1m and trading
profit 8 per cent to Pounds 1.97m. Associates' contribution fell to Pounds
13,000 (Pounds 189,000).
Mr Paul Thompson, chairman, said 74 per cent of overheads were covered by
annually recurring revenues from maintenance, software licence fees and
service and support contracts, which currently provide turnover of about
Pounds 10m per year.
Profit reflected an 8 per cent increase in the UK although five of the
subsidiaries were still operating at 'well below peak levels of
profitability'.
Earnings per share came to 14.2p (16p) after a higher tax rate. The second
interim dividend of 4.5p makes 9.9p (9p).

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Revamped Albrighton cuts losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBRIGHTON, the heavily-restructured quarrying group, reported a sharply
reduced deficit over the 12 months to March 31.
On turnover of Pounds 2.45m (Pounds 2.53m from continuing operations) and
after reduced interest charges of Pounds 277,000 (Pounds 684,000), losses
before tax were reduced to Pounds 358,000 (Pounds 14.1m restated for FRS 3).
The USM-quoted group has made a number of disposals over the past two years
to reduce debt.
Following the Pounds 3.2m acquisition of five quarries and two masonry
processing plants late last year from Tarmac - the acquisition was
'substantially completed and going well' - it now focused on natural
dimensional stone products.
Mr Humphrey Wood, chairman, said the outcome was affected by rationalisation
and redundancy costs; the group still had a bad debt problem and trading
activity was at a low level, although the current year had got off to a
'promising' start.
Losses per share were 0.6p (225.1p).

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sutcliffe Speakman plans restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON FARRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUTCLIFFE Speakman, whose core businesses relate to activated carbon
technology and related equipment applications, is restructuring its balance
sheet and raising equity to fund development.
It is selling John F Seyfried &amp; Sons, its food merchanting subsidiary and
the last of the non-core businesses, for Pounds 1 plus net indebtedness
expected to be Pounds 521,000.
Results for the year ended March 31 1993, the first under the stewardship of
the new board, have also been published. These showed a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 6.56m (Pounds 2.7m) after restructuring costs of Pounds 5.83m (Pounds
560,000).
An operating profit of Pounds 214,000 was achieved in the second half,
primarily due to both Barnebey &amp; Sutcliffe in the US, now the most
profitable part of the group, and Sutcliffe Croftshaw in the UK performing
strongly.
Sutcliffe Speakman Carbons had not yet returned to profitability.
The capital restructuring involves:
raising Pounds 5.6m net through a 9-for-20 rights issue at 8.5p, against
yesterday's closing price of 12p;
converting the 7 per cent preference shares issued primarily to banks and
finance companies into 17.4m ordinary and cancelling the arrears of
dividend;
releasing Pounds 2m liability in respect of the lease purchase agreements
between the company and Lombard North Central and British Linen Shipping,
and issuing 11m shares to the finance companies;
placing 6.6m of the conversion shares and 4.2m of the finance company shares
at 8.5p each;
cancelling the Pounds 333,451 preference dividend arrears and making a scrip
issue to holders on the basis of 2.456 shares for every preference;
consolidating the 1p shares into 5p shares and reducing the capital to
eliminate the deficit on distributable reserves of Pounds 8m.
New banking facilities have also been arranged.
Turnover in the period under review was Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 30.7m). Losses
per share were doubled to 4.2p.
The majority of the exceptional costs related to plant write-downs and
restructuring provisions in rationalising the UK carbon manufacturing
facility at Leigh.
The company said that would significantly improve the prospects for
restoring Sutcliffe Speakman Carbons to profitability, and was made possible
by the success in re-establishing a working contract with the Sri Lankan
associate.
Carbon sales from Leigh in April and May were showing an improvement on the
average monthly level in the second half of last year.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Mansfield ahead 14% as margins improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANSFIELD BREWERY lifted pre-tax profits 14 per cent from Pounds 11m to
Pounds 12.5m in the 12 months to March 27. The Yorkshire and east Midlands
brewer also proposed a 4-for-1 share split.
Property disposals contributed just Pounds 8,000 compared with Pounds
407,000 and earnings per share increased by 14.8 per cent to 55.8p (48.6p).
Excluding the effect of the property sales earnings per share expanded by
21.1 per cent.
The final dividend is increased to 11p (9.6p) for a total of 15.4p (13.6p).
Profits at the operating level, after charging Pounds 1.3m against free
trade debts and loans, increased by 11.8 per cent to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds
16.7m). The operating and trading margins improved to 15.9 per cent and 10.6
per cent respectively mainly reflecting the increased proportion of draught
beers in the mix.
Turnover rose to Pounds 117.7m (Pounds 114.5m), buoyed by the full inclusion
of the 94 pubs acquired in March and April last year. The expansion of the
estate, which continued with the purchase of a further 17 pubs for Pounds
3.1m, enabled the group to increase sales of draught beers and ciders by 3.2
per cent despite the depressed market. Tied trade sales on a like-for-like
basis fell 3.9 per cent.
However, free trade sales rose 0.7 per cent with sales to wholesalers
growing 15.9 per cent. Sir David White, chairman, said this had enabled the
group to further increase its share of the regional draught beer market.
Sales of take home beers fell 7.6 per cent.
During the year Pounds 21.3m was invested in capital projects, including pub
acquisitions and refurbishment, and free trade loan growth, partly financed
by Pounds 4.5m of property disposals. Borrowings increased by Pounds 3.2m to
Pounds 63.5m representing gearing of 44.4 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eaglet offer to raise Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAGLET Investment Trust is being launched via an offer for subscription
which hopes to raise up to Pounds 30m.
The new trust, which will invest in smaller companies with a market
capitalisation of under Pounds 50m, is issuing up to 30m shares, with
warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis.
Management will be undertaken by CW Asset Management, a subsidiary of
Capital Ventures, best known for its activities in the Business Expansion
Scheme market. Mr Peter Webb, who previously ran the Thornton Smaller
Companies unit trust, owns 25 per cent of CW Asset and will be running the
trust.
The aim will be to outperform the Extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies
Index (excluding investment trusts).
If the net asset value outperforms the index by 2 per cent a year, then CW
will receive 5 per cent of the excess, subject to a ceiling of 0.7 per cent
of net assets.
The basic management fee will be 1 per cent of gross assets per year.
Smaller company shares have rebounded since the pound's departure from the
ERM in September, having suffered badly during the recession.
Minimum subscription level for the offer, which will close on July 2, is
Pounds 500.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lookers surges to Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKERS, the motor dealer with Rover, Nissan, Daihatsu and Seat franchises,
lifted interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 615,000 to Pounds 1.54m.
An added boost in the six months ended March 31 1993 was a Pounds 377,000
profit on the sale of 51 per cent of the contract hire business to
Woodchester Credit Lyonnais. That led to gearing being reduced from 98 per
cent at September 30 to 53 per cent.
Mr William Martindale, chairman, said the first two months had been hit by
an exceptional fall in used car values. But then profits of the dealerships
improved as sales rose; in particular, profitability of the Essex depots
were 'markedly improved'. Total sales moved up to Pounds 163.8m (Pounds
154.4m).
The agricultural business was expected to produce a better result over the
year, while the caravan division should correspond closely to last year.
Mr Martindale said current trading was more profitable than last year, but
the climb out of recession would continue to be slow.
Earnings per share came to 2.6p (losses 0.9p). The interim dividend is again
2p.

MCLEOD Russel Holdings, the paints producer and distributor which in March
acquired Wheway, the environmental engineering group, announced a reduction
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.05m to Pounds 1.91m for the six months to
March 31.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 21m) and operating profits edged
ahead to Pounds 1.59m (Pounds 1.55m). However, lower net interest received
of Pounds 326,000 (Pounds 500,000) cut the pre-tax line.
The interim dividend is maintained at 2.75p, payable from earnings of 3.01p
(3.13p) per share.
Mr Nigel Openshaw, chairman, said the full year's result would depend on the
success in turning round the Wheway businesses. He added that in spite of
little improvement in market conditions, the McLeod Russel companies
continued to be cash generative and traded satisfactorily.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Airsprung's 22% growth prompts share price
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Airsprung Furniture Group rose 11p to a record 518p after
Britain's second-largest bed manufacturer reported a 22 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 6m.
Sales rose by 12.9 per cent to Pounds 65.6m in the year to March 31 and
operating profit was 14.9 per cent higher at Pounds 5.8m.
The group said its beds division, which accounts for 50 per cent of
turnover, had performed well. Sales and profits were well ahead of last
year, although it suffered from a shortage of demand at the top of its
range.
The upholstery division, which accounts for 30 per cent of turnover,
increased sales, but severe competition had substantially reduced margins in
the manufacturing companies.
The pine furniture division, which produces 15 per cent of turnover, showed
a substantial improvement in both sales and profits.
Last month Mr Michael Coppel was appointed joint chairman alongside Mr John
Yates, 77, whose family controls 42 per cent of Airsprung. Mr John Pierce
replaced Mr Coppel as chief executive, Mr John Mack became chairman of the
upholstery division and Mr Peter Ziemnak was appointed managing director of
Airsprung Beds. Mr Coppel said those appointments would ensure continuity of
management into the next century.
The group said: 'The current year seems to be fraught with uncertainties.
However, we have planned for further growth and are confident that this will
be achieved provided we get a reasonable climate in which to operate.'
Earnings per share fell from 33.1p to 31.4p, although the previous year's
figure benefited from the release of deferred tax previously provided, worth
6.5p per share. A final dividend of 5.85p gives a total for the year of 9p
(7.5p), a rise of 20 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Blick rises 19% to Pounds 4.4m on back of
communications side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS AT Blick, the communications systems and time products company, rose
19 per cent to Pounds 4.37m pre-tax in the six months to March 31.
The rise from Pounds 3.67m was underscored by the performance of the
communications division which lifted its pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.86m
(Pounds 1.61m) on turnover up at Pounds 9.52m (Pounds 8.11m). Mr Michael
Lee, finance director, ascribed this rise to organic growth and the GPT
contracts, the portfolio for rental and maintenance of public address and
other communications systems acquired from that company in April 1992 for
Pounds 3.8m.
Mr Ian Scott-Gall, group managing director, said that satellite television
contracts covering some 52,000 homes had been added over the past eight
months, though Mr Alan Elliot, chairman, pointed out that this was through
only eight customers.
Pre-tax profits in the time division, however, fell from Pounds 2.06m to
Pounds 1.51m on turnover slightly ahead at Pounds 6.78m (Pounds 6.55m). Mr
Scott-Gall said that the causes were: the recession, given that the division
has many small customers; the high overhead structure; stiff price
competition; a squeeze on margins - many products are sourced in Belgium;
and that the rate of cancellations has reverted to the levels of 1989.
Future rentals under contract - 'the bedrock' of the group - grew 27 per
cent to Pounds 85.8m (Pounds 67.5m).
Cash balances stood at Pounds 9.65m at the period-end and Mr Elliot said
that any acquisitions were likely to come in the communications side. Group
turnover rose to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 14.7m). Acquisitions - Electrelay, the
car park equipment maker based in Northern Ireland, the majority stake in
Databip, the French radio pager distributor, and contracts from Cheshire
Communications for Pounds 2.1m - contributed Pounds 796,000 and incurred
operating losses of Pounds 5,000, from a total of Pounds 4.08m (Pounds
3.42m). The interim dividend of 3.3p - up 10 per cent - was payable from
earnings of 12.79p (11.52p).

MORRISON Construction, the privately-owned Scottish construction company,
increased turnover in the year to March 31 by 8 per cent to Pounds 208m, but
saw pre-tax profits decline 32 per cent from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 3.3m.
Nevertheless, Mr Fraser Morrison, chairman and chief executive, described
the results as 'quite outstanding' against a background of the 'worst
trading conditions I can remember.'
Earnings per share were 150p (284p). Gearing at the end of March was 51 per
cent.
Morrison Construction is largely owned by the Morrison family. In 1989 it
increased its size two and half times when the family acquired the
outstanding 80 per cent of the company from Charter Consolidated.
Mr Morrison pointed out that few UK construction companies were reporting
good profits and many were incurring losses. The group was helped by the
fact that it does not operate in south-east England.
In 1989 Morrison was the only British company to win emergency repair orders
in Kuwait after the Gulf war from the US Corps of Engineers. This work has
now been completed, but Morrison is carrying out work for private clients in
Kuwait and has won a contract In Bahrain.
Yesterday it was announced that Morrison was part of a consortium of
international construction companies formed to build the second Forth road
bridge in Scotland. The consortium, Forth Link Group, includes Taylor
Woodrow, Sir Robert McAlpine, John Mowlem, Dragados of Spain and Monberg &amp;
Thorsen, the Danish bridge builder.
A number of other consortia have been formed and have expressed interest in
building the bridge.
Mr Morrison said that a Stock Exchange flotation was 'very much on the
agenda as an option we hold open' but no date had been identified.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: CE Heath shares rise 15p despite profits
tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES IN aviation insurance and on the disposal of investments depressed
the group pre-tax outcome at CE Heath, the insurance broker. Profits fell
from Pounds 19m to Pounds 1.48m over the year to March 31.
However, the core brokerage and computer services operations performed ahead
of expectations, prompting a positive response from the market which pushed
the shares up 15p to 338p.
Before exceptional items pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 25.1m, compared
with Pounds 31.5m.
After tax, dividends and minority interests, Heath had a reatined loss of
Pounds 24.6m (profit of Pounds 11.2m). The loss per sahre was 22.5p
(earnings 46.4p). As anticipated the final dividend is 11p, cutting the
total to 16p (25.875p).
The group provided Pounds 18.4m against claims from aviation reinsurance
contracts underwritten by its Australian subsidiary between 1987 and 1991.
Losses on sale of investments came to Pounds 5.58m (Pounds 113,000).
Direct comparison of the two years' results is also complicated by the sale
in November 1991 of the former Bermudian reinsurance subsidiary, Pinnacle
Re, and the flotation in June 1992 of a majority stake in CE Heath
International Holdings, the Australian insurance subsidiary. In addition
1991-92 results were restated in line with the provisions of FRS 3.
Brokerage income rose 13 per cent to Pounds 114.8m (Pounds 101.6m), with
rises in premium rates, especially in the London and catastrophe reinsurance
markets, helping to offset a recession-inducted drop in demand.
'There has been a very significant contraction in the overall size and
capacity of the market, leading to increased self-insurance and retention of
risk,' said Mr Michael Kier, chairman.
Against this background UK wholesale and corporate risks operations
performed well and the recently established Latin American operations also
reported profits. Heath's expense ratio was cut from 110.2 per cent to 98.8
per cent.
Computer services income rose to Pounds 42.9m (Pounds 39.2m). Investment and
other income fell to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 16.3m), as a result of lower
interest rates in both the UK and US.
Overall brokerage profits fell to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 16.7m) because of
lower investment returns, underwriting profits fell to Pounds 6.98m (Pounds
12.7m) and computer services profits to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 5.04m).

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Electrocomponents at Pounds 52m after
disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTROCOMPONENTS, the UK-based electronic, electrical and mechanical
components distribution group, yesterday reported sharply higher full-year
profits despite a decline in sales which reflected December's disposal of
the loss-making Misco businesses.
Under the new FRS 3 accounting rules, pre-tax profits in the year to March
31 jumped to Pounds 51.9m from a substantially restated Pounds 25.2m.
The year-on-year comparison was flattered by Pounds 24.7m of exceptional
items under FRS 3 in 1992 - including Pounds 18.1m of provisions for Misco -
compared to Pounds 7m in the latest period, again mainly related to the
disposal of the remaining Misco businesses.
Earnings per share under FRS 3 increased to 14.9p (3.5p) out of which the
group is paying an increased final dividend of 5.9p (5.1p) making a total up
13 per cent to 7.9p (7p). Sir Keith Bright, chairman, said the increase
reflected the group's strong trading performance and cash resources. Group
turnover fell by 4 per cent to Pounds 387.5m (403.7m) mainly reflecting
disposals. Continuing operations' sales increased by 9.6 per cent to Pounds
346.6m and their operating profits grew by 4.5 per cent to Pounds 60.1m.
The core RS business increased its sales by 12 per cent to Pounds 308.4m,
including Pounds 59.2m from international operations, and posted operating
profits of Pounds 59.8m (Pounds 56.9m). The gains reflecting the success of
marketing initiatives - including the division of the RS catalogue - as well
as the gradual improvement in the UK economy during the year.
The group's push into continental Europe continued last year with the launch
of new subsidiaries in Denmark and Italy. Sir Keith said this strategic
expansion meant that all the important European countries were now served by
wholly-owned subsidiaries. He said the task now was to bring the new ones,
including the two-year-old German operation, into profit within three years
of the start of trading.
COMMENT
Electrocomponents' underlying performance continues to impress. Following
the sale of Misco, the refocusing back to the core activity of delivering a
high quality fast distribution service to engineers is now complete and the
benefits are beginning to show. Meanwhile the expansion into continental
Europe is gathering steam. Although the new international operations set up
over the past two years are still losing money, they are all on target to
break even within three years of start-up. The balance sheet remains strong,
with net cash of Pounds 31m. This will be used mainly to fund organic growth
including a hefty Pounds 15m capital investment programme this year. The
shares gained 7p to close at 393p yesterday. With pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 66m expected this year and earnings of about 20.3p, the stock is
trading on a lofty but deserved prospective p/e of 19.3.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Administrators plan quote and rights for
Moran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORAN HOLDINGS, the tea producer, freight forwarder and property developer
placed into administration last August, yesterday announced plans to be
readmitted to the Unlisted Securities Market and launch a Pounds 2.3m rights
issue.
Mr Ian McIsaac and Mr Tony Houghton of accountants Touche Ross, the joint
administrators, said they believed it was the first time that a company had
been restructured and refinanced under the administration procedure of
English insolvency law without using a company voluntary arrangement.
The administrators yesterday applied to the London Stock Exchange for a new
quote for the company, and will apply to the High Court to lift the
administration order if shareholders approve the restructuring package at an
extraordinary general meeting on July 5.
Trading in the shares, which were suspended at 33p, is expected to begin on
July 7.
Shareholders must approve an increase in the company's sharecapital of
Pounds 1.65m and loan and underwriting arrangements agreed with Darnforth, a
British Virgins Islands-based subsidiary of Volkart Brothers Holding, part
of a Swiss commodity group.
Shareholders will be offered 2-for-1 rights in 8.9m new shares at 30p each
to raise up to Pounds 2.3m.
The issue is fully underwritten by Darnforth, which will also provide a
secured loan of up to Pounds 1.15m.
Unaudited accounts for the six months to December 31 1992 show pre-tax
losses of Pounds 398,000 after a non-recurring charge of Pounds 434,600. An
extraordinary charge of Pounds 243,000 covers the cost of the
administration.
The accounts show outstanding litigation against the company from Sissmore,
a provider of secretarial and registrar services, for Pounds 690,000 and
against Moran India and the Reserve Bank of India in Calcutta.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Amersham Intl advances to Pounds 26.3m -
Management culture more attuned to focused customer base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERSHAM International, the health science group based on the handling of
radioactive substances, increased profits by 27 per cent in the year to
March 31 as higher margin business accounted for an increased part of sales.
Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, said the group had made progress towards
changing a management culture that had been 'cynical and reactive' to one
more attuned to developing specific markets and a focused customer base.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 26.3m on sales of Pounds
269m (Pounds 274m).
Earnings grew 28 per cent to 30.4p (23.7p) and the proposed final dividend
of 9.5p raises the total by 8 per cent to 13.5p.
Life sciences - the largest division which sells reagents to medical and
pharmaceutical research establishments - produced sales of Pounds 98.9m
(Pounds 92.7m) and operating profits of Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 20.9m) after a
24 per cent increase in research and development spending. Growth in the US
and the UK contrasted with flat markets in continental Europe and Japan.
Healthcare, which is dominated by low margin generic products, produced
sales of Pounds 95m (Pounds 83.8m) and operating profits of Pounds 3.9m
(Pounds 100,000m).
Ceretec, used in brain scanning and one of the three proprietary
developments which could transform the division's fortunes, continued its
rapid growth, with sales of Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 14m). Metastron, used in
handling prosthetic cancer, and Myoview, used in cardiac imaging, are behind
Ceretec but in the launch phase.
The industrial quality and safety assurance division, which provides
services like non-destructive testing of aircraft wings, produced operating
profits of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 4.6m) on sales of Pounds 43.8m.
The group moved from a small net debt position to net cash of Pounds 2.6m.
Cash flow was strong - Pounds 23.6m before investment in fixed assets,
acquisitions and restructuring costs.
COMMENT
Amersham International has transformed itself from a company led by
scientists to a management exploiting its science base. Previous errors in
currency hedging and product development have been corrected. Indeed, the
new hedging regime means that Amersham did not see the benefit of
devaluation at all last year. This year, however, the fall in the pound will
increase profits by about Pounds 8m. Joint marketing of its healthcare
products, such as the co-promotion of Metastron with Zeneca, allows the
company to use the heavyweight sales forces of larger healthcare companies
to open up new markets. Profits should reach Pounds 40m this year, putting a
strong recovery stock back to a market rating, which looks cheap. Yet the
management is running a complex portfolio and there must be concern that
they can keep all of the plates spinning. On current form, however, they
deserve the benefit of the doubt.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Shareholders attack Saatchi's failure to
pay dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's annual meeting yesterday expressed
dissatisfaction at the advertising group's failure to pay a 1992 dividend,
though a Pounds 73m rights issue announced on May 19 received overwhelming
approval at the extraordinary meeting which followed.
One shareholder criticised director Mr Charles Saatchi for again failing to
attend the meeting while receiving what the speaker described as 'the
infamous salary' of Pounds 312,500.
Mr Saatchi, like his brother Maurice, chairman of the company, was entitled
to twice that figure, but agreed to waive half.
The two men have sold the rights to buy 502,417 ordinary shares, raising
Pounds 145,700, which they will use to subscribe for 116,718 of the shares
in the rights issue.
Three other company directors have also disposed of ordinary share rights.
After the June 11 rights issue the brothers will have a combined holding of
1.7m shares. The company is offering 59.4m new ordinary shares at 130p each,
on the basis of 10 new shares for every 27 held.
Mr Charles Scott, chief executive, told the meeting he expected the company
to return to dividend payments for 1994.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sizeable premium expected for Quayle Munro
debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING IN Quayle Munro Holdings, a small Edinburgh-based merchant bank with
a portfolio of holdings in unquoted companies, begins on the main market
today.
Analysts believe that the shares will rise to a substantial premium.
The bank is coming to the market via an introduction by Williams de Broe.
It follows a reverse takeover of Quayle Munro by East of Scotland Industrial
Investments, the unquoted investment company which Quayle Munro manages.
The shares will be quoted initially at 118p per share, which implies a
market capitalisation of Pounds 4.74m. The company will have net worth of
about Pounds 6m, of which Pounds 4m is in unquoted investments and the rest
in cash and listed securities.
Analysts believe that the discount to net asset value will narrow and that
investors will also be attracted by the high dividend yield. The company
will pay an interim dividend of 3p next month and another 3p in October; and
in future will pay interim and final dividends in a ratio of one third to
two thirds.
Assuming the interim dividend is maintained that implies that next year's
final will be 6p, making 9p in all. Analysts believe the shares could go to
a premium of more than 20 per cent.
Quayle Munro was founded in 1983 by Mr Ian Jones and Mr Michael Munro. It
advises quoted companies such as Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste disposal group,
and Pittencrieff, the oil company.
It worked for the Scottish Office on privatising the Scottish Bus Group and
recently advised it on the possible privatisation of Scotland's water and
sewerage services.
Mr Jones, chief executive, explained that one aim of the transaction with
East of Scotland Industrial Investments was to give shareholders an exit
route at a smaller discount to net asset value than was available under the
old structure. The deal involves repaying about Pounds 10m of capital.
'Quayle Munro will be unusual in being both a merchant bank and an
investment banking house,' said Mr Jones. 'There will be two kinds of play -
fee income and capital performance.'

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Question over Alpine funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT Pounds 50,000 of pension money contributed by employees of Alpine
(Double Glazing) is in a solicitor's account, the receiver to the UK windows
company said yesterday, although it is unclear who has rights to the funds.
The money is believed to have been deposited at the end of May with
Beveridge Ross and Prevezers, a firm of London solicitors. The firm was
involved in the initial purchase of Alpine out of administration in February
1992.
The status of the account is not yet clear to the receiver, Mr Grant Jones
of City accountants Morison Stoneham. He is unsure whether the monies are
being held in trust for employees or whether the funds have been deposited
in a client account.
It is believed that a trust account was set up. However, the monies may be
found to belong to the company rather than employees. The solicitors
yesterday refused to comment due to client confidentiality.
It is also unclear how much money was deducted from employees' salaries in
the 14 months since the new owners took over. At least one employee, who
held a senior position, claims he is owed Pounds 7,800 including the
company's contribution. Alpine employed some 250 people around the country,
about 100 of whom are believed to have had payments deducted from salaries.
Mr Jones, appointed receiver on Friday, said yesterday he was investigating
the status of the account.
Separately, questions have emerged over the claim to many of Alpine's assets
by Finchfleet, a Bahamas-registered, but Channel Islands-based company. It
appears that in March 1992, when Finchfleet claims it had reached agreement
with Alpine to take over ownership of the company's plant, machinery and
office equipment, a third party had a charge over Alpine's assets.
The original administrator, who sold the business to a group backed by
Midlands entrepreneur Mr Clive Smith, had a charge over the assets until the
final purchase payment was made in August 1992.
Finchfleet had been the corporate vehicle originally suggested by BR&amp;P to
purchase the Alpine business for buyers represented by Mr Robert Pollock,
Alpine's current chairman. However, as there were difficulties in securing a
charge over an offshore company, it was rejected by the administrators.
The receiver said yesterday he was also investigating the documentation
surrounding Finchfleet's claim.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Daily Mail advances to Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from its national newspapers helped the Daily Mail &amp;
General Trust to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 21.2m for the six months to
April 4.
This represented an 11 per cent increase against the restated figure of
Pounds 19.1m for the same period of 1992.
'The Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday have both produced an exceptional
circulation performance and this has contributed to improved display and
classified advertising revenues,' the company said yesterday.
Against the overall downward trend in the industry, the Daily Mail increased
its circulation by 5.5 per cent to 1.77m between November and April and the
Mail on Sunday, which has been running regular 96 page issues, had a 3.8 per
cent increase to 2.07m.
The Evening Standard circulation suffered from disruption caused by train
strikes and security scares and classified advertising volumes were down on
the previous year.
Overall the company said its main businesses had performed well, with little
benefit from any general improvement in the economy.
Northcliffe Newspapers, the local and regional group, maintained
profitability, despite a small revenue fall.
Euromoney has already announced a 29 per cent increase in pre-tax profits.
Whittle Communications in the US 'continued to meet difficult trading
conditions.'
Group net borrowings totalled Pounds 209m, a decrease of Pounds 102m, but
Pounds 3.9m was charged to the profit and loss account because the sterling
value of dollar debt liability had increased.
The company warned that the outcome for the full year might be effected by
non-trading items, such as the sterling-dollar rate and the impact of
year-end revaluation of investment properties.
Only a slow improvement in advertising volumes was expected.
The interim dividend is raised 4p to 36p. Earnings per share came to 121.9p
(102.7p).
Mr Guy Lamming, media analyst at stockbroker James Capel, yesterday praised
'a really good performance' by the Mail and Mail and Sunday and said the
result was slightly ahead of forecasts.
He is looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds 66m for the year, although this
could depend on the extent to which currency movement go against the
company.
The A shares rose Pounds 3.25 to Pounds 94.50.

GREENCORE, the Irish sugar, milling and malting group, reported a 5 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 17.1m (Pounds 16.8m) on turnover up 7
per cent, for the half year to March 26.
Operating profits for the period increased by 15 per cent to IPounds 23.4m,
but a 50 per cent jump in interest charges to IPounds 6.4m due to last
autumn's currency crisis cut into the improved profit margins.
Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, chief financial officer, said that the increased
interest charge 'has been a short-term phenomena which will not affect
future results'.
Operating profits improved substantially in the sugar and other food
divisions, while the agribusiness division suffered a squeeze on margins as
CAP reforms put downward pressure on prices for fertilisers and animal
feeds. Agribusiness turnover, however, increased by 8 per cent.
Earnings per share rose 1p to 17p, while the interim dividend goes up 10 per
cent to 3.3p.
The result was slightly ahead of market expectations, and the shares
strengthened to 295p.
The company said that the impact of green currency realignments under EC
agricultural policy and the stabilisation of interest and exchange rates
'will have a net favourable impact on our second half trading figures and
for 1993-94 as a whole'.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: High debt levels continue to dog Lep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEP GROUP, the freight forwarding and security group which was last year
restructured by its banks, yesterday reported continuing heavy losses for
the year to December 31.
Turnover fell from Pounds 1.51bn to Pounds 1.47bn, mainly reflecting the
sale of the Swift physical distribution businesses in the UK, the
Netherlands and Belgium.
Operating profits before exceptional items were flat at Pounds 26m.
However, exceptional items of Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 47.3m) and net interest
of Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 38.3m), resulted in a pre-tax deficit of Pounds
34.3m, compared with Pounds 59.1m last time.
Mr David James, the company doctor who was appointed chairman by the banks,
said the maintenance of operating profits was particularly encouraging,
given the recessionary conditions afflicting the world markets in which the
Freight Forwarding operation was engaged, and the US domestic market in
which the National Guardian Corporation operated.
Last August Lep's banks agreed to convert Pounds 180m of debt into 85 per
cent of the group's enlarged equity, after the group had been brought to the
brink of bankruptcy by debts of more than Pounds 500m.
Despite the debt-equity swap, Lep's bank borrowings fell during the year by
only Pounds 76m, from Pounds 469m to to Pounds 393m.
The group said the scale of the reduction was limited by the devaluation of
sterling and the crystallisation of certain liabilities.
The group said the need to service and ultimately discharge this very
substantial level of debt would significantly influence future strategy
options.
Under the three-year facility granted by Lep's banks last summer, interest
can be rolled up, but the group will clearly have to contemplate significant
disposals at some stage.
Mr James said the financial reconstruction had provided the company with the
time and financial resources needed to develop and improve the the trading
prospects of the group's principal remaining subsidiaries.
Losses per share were 8.7p, compared with 45.6p last time.
No dividend was declared and it is not expected that the distribution will
be resumed in the foreseeable future.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Leasehold accounting review - Task force
issues draft rules on property holdings for discussion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES will be required to promptly show any loss between the sale or
rental of vacant leasehold property and their obligations on the lease,
under draft rules from the urgent issues task force of the Accounting
Standards Board, published yesterday.
Any difference between the recoverable amount and future obligations on
leasehold property which they have ceased to use and are unlikely to
reoccupy must be deducted from profits.
The shortfall should be recognised in the accounts as soon as it is
identified and not in the periods to which the rent and other expenses
relate.
Since there will generally be no open market evidence, the task force
recommends a valuation technique from the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors.
It says companies should assess the capital sum which would need to be set
aside to offset the negative cash flow over a given period.
Any provision should take account of other on-going expenses, such as rates
and security, as well as costs associated with vacating the property.
Mr Eugene Bannon, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said the impact of the
proposals on some companies could be 'tens of millions of pounds.'
They would be particularly likely to affect companies in London and the
south-east, where rents have declined most steeply.
Companies most likely to be affected are those which are rationalising their
property portfolios, such as banks and building societies.
The impact might also be felt by retailers who were closing high street
shops to move to out-of-town shopping centres.
The proposals were circulated for consultation and will be discussed at the
task force's meeting on July 14. If approved, they are likely to be
compulsory from September.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: ASB ruling on subsidiaries' results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES WILL be required to adjust their accounts to eliminate any
distortions created by subsidiaries operating in hyper-inflationary
economies, under a ruling issued yesterday.
The ruling eliminates the practice used in the past by companies such as
Polly Peck International, the conglomerate founded by Mr Asil Nadir, which
showed interest in soft currency deposits as profits but the falling value
of those deposits in reserves.
The ninth abstract from the urgent issues task force of the Accounting
Standards Board will be compulsory from accounting periods after August 23,
although the board is encouraging early adoption.
In line with international practice, the new approach will apply where the
cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching or exceeds 100 per
cent, and the operations in the hyper-inflationary economies are material.
The task force said there were two methods to adjust for distortions:
Adjust local currency financial statements to reflect current price levels
before translation, taking any gain or loss on the net monetary position
through the profit and loss account.
Using a relatively stable currency as the currency of measurement for the
relevant foreign operations.
If neither is adopted, companies must state the reasons and alternative
methods to eliminate the distortions.
The abstract amends the existing rules under SSAP 20, the accounting
standard dealing with foreign currency translation introduced in April.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hambros fall curbed by insurance float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMBROS, the merchant bank and financial services group, yesterday reported
a 12.5 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits as contributions from direct
investments dropped and losses from retail financial services increased.
Profits in the year ended March 31 fell from Pounds 74.3m to Pounds 65m.
The shares fell 5p to 332p on a day the market rallied.
Investment profits fell from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 12.5m after what the
bank described as a lack of selling opportunities in a subdued market. Most
of the profits were generated from the flotation of Hambro Insurance
Services.
Losses from retail financial services increased from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds
12.2m. This was mainly because of the Hambro Countrywide estate agency chain
which incurred a loss in its year to December 31. The bank has subsequently
said that Hambro Countrywide had returned to profit.
Central finance and overhead costs increased from Pounds 16.8m to Pounds
18.6m mainly because of the higher interest payments on the Pounds 54m
increase in the bank's medium-term loan capital.
Profits from banking remained broadly static at Pounds 73.8m (Pounds 73.4m).
Provisions for bad debts were higher at Pounds 24m (Pounds 13m),
representing 1.2 per cent of lending assets.
Profits from the insurance services rose from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 9.5m
after the flotation of Hambro Insurance services in which the bank has a
54.1 per cent stake.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell to 20.8p (25.4p).
The recommended final dividend is increased to 9.8p (9.6p) making an
increased total of 14p (13.8p).
COMMENT
The bank's flotation of Hambro Insurance Services could not have come at a
better time given the disappointing result from investments in the first
half. Banking continues to perform adequately, even if its return on capital
slipped from 21 per cent to 19 per cent because of provisions for bad debts.
The year is already looking better with Hambro Countrywide back in the black
and the bank confidently predicting a recovery in its main markets. But the
test for Hambros will be what it can do with its earnings per share which
have shown no real growth for the past five years. That was mainly due to
the problems associated with retail financial services. With those at an end
shareholders will be expecting better things next year.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Hanson power provokes concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is facing growing shareholder concern
over its proposals to give its chairman, Lord Hanson, greater control over
its annual general meetings.
The proposals, which need the support of 75 per cent of investors, will be
put to an extraordinary general meeting on June 25. Some of Hanson's biggest
shareholders have raised the matter with the National Association of Pension
Funds.
Mr John Rogers, secretary of the association's investment committee said: 'A
number of large institutional shareholders are concerned about the proposals
and have raised the matter with Hanson.'
The EGM was called to approve a scrip dividend plan which requires the
modification of the company's articles of association.
Lord Hanson, in a letter to shareholders, said: 'At the same time we are
proposing to introduce a number of other alterations to the articles.' These
are 'mainly designed to facilitate the orderly conduct of meetings' by
giving the chairman of Hanson's AGM (which is always Lord Hanson) greater
powers.
Under the new articles, the chairman would be able to prevent shareholders
speaking more than once on any item of business; prevent a member from
speaking if it was 'prejudicing the orderly conduct' and reject any demand
for polls which in his opinion is 'irrelevant, or vexatious to, or
inconsistent with, the business of the meeting'.
Shareholders would no longer be able to nominate directors unless supported
by 10 per cent of the share capital.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said: 'We are tidying up matters by
helping improve the efficiency of our meetings.'
Some of the proposed changes, such as the retirement by rotation and
re-election of directors, are supported by shareholders, as is the scrip
dividend plan.
However, some big shareholders, including Postel, the UK's biggest pension
fund, are seeking meetings with Hanson to discuss the proposed changes.
Ms Anne Simpson, joint managing director of the Pension Investment Research
Consultants, said: 'The spirit of Cadbury needs to be taken on board by
extending shareholders rights not by restricting them.'

FT  10 JUN 93 / Ferruzzi shares tumble as swap makes investors wary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Italy's heavily indebted Ferruzzi group plunged yesterday as
investors digested the implications of a possible debt-for-equity swap by
its leading bank creditors.
The price falls came ahead of a meeting between four senior Ferruzzi
executives and a committee of five creditor banks, led by Mediobanca, to try
to resolve difficulties with the rescue plan.
Dealers were unhappy at the prospect of state-controlled banks being obliged
to take Ferruzzi equity in return for their loans: 'It's just like
nationalisation through the back door,' one said.
Prices were also hit by press reports that the group's consolidated debts
amounted to L31,500bn (Pounds 14bn), more than double the official figure.
Ferruzzi furiously rejected the higher estimate, saying it was 'completely
without foundation.'
Fondiaria, the insurance group controlled by Ferruzzi through a joint
venture is expected to reveal total debts of about L2,000bn, much higher
than previously thought.
The group's latest accounts say Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the listed
holding company, had net borrowings of L15,123bn at the end of last year, of
which Montedison, its main industrial subsidiary, accounted for L11,511bn.
Further details of the group's debt position and the methods used to
calculate it may emerge at the general meetings of Montedison and Ferfin
later this month. Dealers marked down the group's shares after growing
doubts about the feasibility of the rescue plan and fears that Ferruzzi
might cut the nominal value of its equity.
Shares in Ferfin, which already sank below their L1,000 nominal value on
Monday, fell to L795 yesterday from L883 on Tuesday. Montedison shares fell
by almost 7 per cent to L1,027, before sinking below their L1,000 nominal
value to L983 after hours.
Ferfin last month announced record losses of L1,519bn, compared with 1991
net profits of L115bn, while Montedison's net losses were L1,244bn, against
net profits of L168bn. The group said the family-owned Serafino Ferruzzi
holding company, which controls Ferfin, would open to outside investors,
while other subsidiaries would be sold or put into joint ventures to raise
cash.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Racal spells out demerger benefits as profits treble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RACAL Electronics, the communications and electronics company from which
Chubb Security and Vodafone, the cellular telephone operator, demerged in
the past three years, yesterday reported a threefold increase in profits.
The pre-tax increase from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 51.5m followed a cut in
restructuring charges and recovery in the data communications division.
Margins remained modest at 3.4 per cent.
Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman, said recession in continental Europe was
still affecting the business, but he was looking forward to further recovery
this year.
Announcing its results a day after Vodafone produced another set of
impressive profits, Racal underlined the benefits of the demergers to
shareholders. Exceptional restructuring charges also fell by Pounds 10m.
The group generated Pounds 71m of cash from operations, reducing net
borrowings to Pounds 35.5m after currency adjustments. Gearing fell to 6.8
per cent from 12.3 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 4.31p to 11.52p and the group is proposing to
pay a final dividend of 2.75p, giving a total of 4.25p.
Racal made provisions of Pounds 13.8m including Pounds 7.1m for further
reorganisation and rationalisation in defence radar, marine and radio. Sir
Ernest said further provisions for restructuring should be expected.
Sales for the group were almost unchanged at Pounds 946m.
Operating profits in data communications rose from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds
12.3m, boosting group operating profits to Pounds 60.98m.
The cost of preparing a tender for the Ministry of defence's Bowman radio
contract, depressed the results in the radio communications division by
Pounds 2.5m.

FT  10 JUN 93 / SmithKline sells bodycare brands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRYLCREEM, the preparation which slicked back the hair of pre-war England
cricketer Denis Compton, of 1950s teddy boys and the youth of today, is
being sold.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, yesterday announced
sales of a range of brands for about Pounds 260m. But it said there would be
a Pounds 100m restructuring charge set off against the profit on the sales
in this year's accounts.
SB has agreed to sell Brylcreem - which has expanded to a range of men's
toiletries - and other bath and bodycare brands, such as Badedas and Body
Mist, to Sara Lee, the Chicago-based consumer products group, for Pounds
211m.
It is also selling its hair care brands, including Silvikrin, Vosene and
Bristows, to Wella, the German hair care group, for an undisclosed sum.
Analysts speculated this was between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m.
SB said the deals almost completed its programme of disposals since it was
formed through a merger four years ago. It would now concentrate on its
prescription and over-the-counter drugs, oral care products such as
toothpaste and mouthwashes, and drinks such as Ribena and Lucozade.
Mr Harry Groome, head of SB's consumer brands division, said: 'Our goal is
to become the world leader in consumer healthcare,' although he admitted
this was a 10-year aim. It claims to be fourth currently.
SB would pursue its goal through alliances and acquisitions, expanding
existing brands and converting prescription drugs to over-the-counter
medicines.
The business being sold to Sara Lee has assets of Pounds 55m, including five
plants in continental Europe, and made trading profits of Pounds 36m on
sales of Pounds 164m in 1992. Wella is buying a business with assets of
Pounds 5m and sales of Pounds 46m.
Mr Hugh Collum, chief financial officer of SB, said the sales would be
slightly dilutive in the short term but the payback from the restructuring
would be rapid.
Sara Lee's household and personal care activity is the smallest of its four
main divisions. It combines such brands as Kiwi shoe polish, Sanex skin
care, Zendium toothpaste and the Zwitsal baby-care lines, all of which sell
in continental Europe.
The former SB brands will significantly enlarge the division, where sales
and operating profits fell to Dollars 1.23bn and Dollars 107m respectively
last year following the sale of an over-the-counter drugs business.
Sara Lee said the deal would take it into the German personal care market
for the first time, and it expected manufacturing and marketing synegries.
Wella said the purchase would more than double its UK market share from 5 to
11.3 per cent. The deal also gives it a strong position in the Middle East.

FT  10 JUN 93 / New EC car legislation helps drive Johnson Matthey profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON MATTHEY, the precious metals and specialised materials group,
yesterday announced higher than expected profits, helped by strong growth in
its catalytic systems division.
EC legislation, in force since January, means all new cars must be fitted
with catalytic converters. JM's catalytic systems division, with about 35
per cent of the EC market, increased operating profits 20 per cent to Pounds
27.1m.
Mr David Davies, chairman, said further growth was expected this year,
helped by a recovery in the US car market.
Pre-tax profits increased nearly 10 per cent to Pounds 73.8m in the year to
March 31 on sales of Pounds 1.85bn, up 6 per cent. After three years of
cutting costs, ongoing operating profits advanced 16 per cent to Pounds
70.7m.
JM's materials technology division increased profits 18 per cent to Pounds
20.8m. Precious metals profits were flat at Pounds 20.5m, affected by
falling platinum and rhodium prices.
Year-end net borrowings almost tripled to Pounds 116m, pushing up gearing
from 12 to 35 per cent. This reflected exchange rate movements,
rationalisation costs and a change in the credit terms of the company's
exclusive marketing contract with Rustenburg of South Africa, the world's
biggest platinum producer. Interest costs were Pounds 1.5m, compared with
income of Pounds 1.9m. After a slightly higher tax charge, earnings
increased 4 per cent to 27.1p. The company recommended a final dividend of
7.1p to make a total 10.3p, a 6.7 per cent rise.
There is also an enhanced scrip alternative with a value of 10.65p, a 50 per
cent increase.
BZW will offer cash of 10.437p under the scheme, equal to 98 per cent of the
enhanced scrip's value. In February the UK industrial group Charter
Consolidated disposed of its 38.3 per cent stake. JM's biggest shareholder
is now Garrick, a joint venture between Minorco and Johannesbburg
Consolidated Investment Company of South Africa, with 20 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Northern Foods tastes benefit of Express buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Foods has reaped early benefits from its Pounds 359m acquisition of
Express Dairies and Eden Vale, announcing a 21 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 153.2m.
Mr Chris Haskins, chairman, said yesterday the results were 'pretty
satisfactory', though a little lower than the group had expected a year ago.
The integration of Express and Eden Vale, acquired early last year, had gone
well.
But on the downside, the recession had lasted longer than expected and had
hit the retail trade, in particular Marks and Spencer, one of Northern's
four largest customers. Discount food retailers had intensified competition.
Raw material price increases, caused by sterling's exit from the ERM last
September, were only now being fully passed on.
Looking forward, Mr Haskins expected good progress in the current year. He
could see no reason why the group should suffer any disadvantages from
changes in the milk industry next year, which were still under discussion.
He said the group planned to buy all its milk direct from producers and had
already had indicative signatures from suppliers of half its 2bn litre
requirement.
Group sales in the year to March rose 40 per cent to Pounds 2.03bn, but
leaving aside acquisitions the growth was 8 per cent. Mr Martin Clarke,
finance director, said that excluding Northern's doorstep milk sales, the
group's four largest customers - M&amp;S, J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway -
accounted for nearly half group turnover.
Operating profits increased 31.5 per cent to Pounds 180.8m, with an
underlying growth of 6 per cent. The Express/Eden Vale businesses were
included for two months of the previous year.
Higher borrowings led to higher interest charges, from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds
23.8m. Profit sharing increased from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 3.8m. Earnings
per share rose 5 per cent to 20.09p, as the Express/Eden Vale acquisition
was partly financed by a Pounds 227m rights issue. A final dividend of 5p,
up from 4.64p, is proposed, to give a total of 8.4p, against 7.87p.
Year end net debt was Pounds 212m (up from Pounds 199m) with gearing at 66
per cent and interest cover 7.4 times. Acquisitions totalled Pounds 34m
(against Pounds 398m) and capital expenditure was Pounds 95m (against Pounds
93m). Operating profits in the dairy division were Pounds 92m, against
Pounds 62.5m, with an underlying rise of 8 per cent. Margins dipped to 9.6
per cent (from 11 per cent) for the year, because of the Express
acquisition, but had recovered to 10.4 per cent in the second half. The
group's Pounds 4m deal to buy the Belfast Co-op's milk business was cleared
by the competition authorities yesterday.
Convenience food profits rose 51 per cent to Pounds 44.4m, with an
underlying gain of 14 per cent. Meat profits fell 16 per cent to Pounds
20.2m as van sales to small shops were affected by the competition from
large supermarkets. Grocery products increased profits by 13 per cent to
Pounds 24.2m.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Steps agreed to defend Moslems: US and EC still divided on
strategy for ending conflict in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the European Community yesterday agreed on minimum steps to
defend the besieged Moslem population in Bosnia and pledged to reinforce
efforts to prevent the conflict from escalating into a wider Balkan war.
But after a meeting of EC foreign ministers and Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, profound divisions remained over a wider strategy to end
the conflict in Bosnia and reverse Serbian and Croatian territorial gains.
The divisions became explicit during a news conference at the end of the
Luxembourg meeting originally intended to provide a show of western alliance
unity ahead of the Nato summit which opens today in Athens.
Mr Niels Helvig Petersen, foreign minister of Denmark, which holds the
rotating EC presidency, said there was no point in finger-pointing. But he
promptly laid bare transatlantic differences by saying the Vance-Owen peace
plan was 'the centrepiece of EC policy' towards Bosnia.
In response, Mr Christopher declined to endorse the Vance-Owen plan,
declaring only that the UN-EC plan had 'many positive aspects' which could
be built on. He also said that the US had not abandoned its preferred option
of arming the Bosnia Moslems - despite a French statement that this was 'a
policy of despair'.
More fundamentally, Mr Christopher's references to the Vance-Owen 'process'
left the impression that the US believes the original EC-UN plan to divide
Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces is no longer viable because of
Serbian and Croatian territorial gains in Bosnia.
This assessment gained tacit support in Luxembourg, with some delegations,
notably Belgium, calling for a basic reassessment of the Bosnian conflict.
A new approach would include sanctions against Croatia to deter further
aggression and a possible redrawing of the Vance-Owen map, an EC official
said.
It would also reinforce what Mr Christopher identified as a prime US goal -
the territorial integrity of Serbia's province of Kosovo and the former
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
The immediate requirement is to plug the gaps in the UN peacekeeping force
and give effect to last week's UN resolution to defend the six UN 'safe
areas'. Both the EC and UN are seeking recruits from Moslem countries,
Scandinavia and the former Soviet Union, but EC diplomats said it would take
at least six weeks to put the force of about 5,000 troops together.
Mr Christopher repeated that the US was not willing to provide ground-forces
in the 'safe areas' operation. He rebutted criticism from Lord Owen, the EC
peace negotiator, saying that the US would provide troops only after the
warring parties have reached a watertight political settlement.
The limited nature of US military engagement became clear when Mr
Christopher avoided a commitment to send aircraft to defend civilians.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Abbey National to charge fees on all current accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END of free banking for current account customers who remain in credit
was signalled yesterday when Abbey National said it intended to introduce
charges for current account customers within a few months.
Abbey National, with 1.2m current account customers, said it could not
afford the Pounds 45m annual cost without some charges for accounts in
credit. The bank said it had not yet decided on a charging structure.
Mr John Fry, Abbey National's group services director, said it was not
afraid to be the first bank to re-introduce charges on current accounts in
credit. Charges were abolished by Midland Bank in 1984, shortly followed by
the other banks.
'We would rather be first after listening to what charges our customers
would prefer, than to be dragged along on the coat-tails of other banks,'
said Mr Fry.
Abbey National's move is likely to be followed eventually by other banks,
most of whom have said they regard 'free' banking as unsustainable. But its
competitors said yesterday they had no immediate plans to follow the Abbey
National initiative.
Mr Fry said he believed Abbey National would introduce current account
charges by the end of the year, but did not specify their form. The bank,
formerly a building society, ruled out charging for each customer
transaction.
Abbey National said a survey carried out on behalf of the bank found
customers were more worried about the location of branches, and prompt
cheque clearance, than being offered all transactions without charge.
It said 88 per cent thought fees for 'core' services such as providing
cheque books, cards and statements were unfair, but fees for 'additional'
services such as stopping cheques were fair.
Abbey National said it was taking seriously a recent study by Mr David
Llewellyn, Loughborough University professor of banking, which recommended a
flat rate quarterly fee plus some discretionary charges.
Barclays, National Westminster and Midland said they had no current plans to
re-introduce account charges for customers in credit.

FT  10 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline's sale of two batches of consumer brands seems odd. Sara Lee
appears to have negotiated a striking bargain in picking up a business with
trading margins of 22 per cent on a multiple of just 9 times after-tax
profits. The price of the disposal to Wella was not disclosed. But it is a
fair bet that the two deals will dilute SmithKline's earnings this year.
SmithKline's logic is that it will now be able to rationalise the
manufacturing plants in its consumer products division. A hefty Pounds 100m
rationalisation charge emphasises the scale of the task. Whatever the
industrial sense, SmithKline will have to work hard to generate better
financial returns than those squeezed from bubble baths and Brylcreem.

FT  10 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Johnson Matthey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A cursory glance at Johnson Matthey's share price suggests the company has
successfully detached itself from swings in metals prices. But with Charter
Consolidated's stake now in friendly hands, progress from here on will have
to come without the benefit of bid speculation. Johnson has also exhausted
big restructuring provisions taken in 1990. Although cost savings of Pounds
25m a year suggest the money has been well spent, profits growth must be
found elsewhere.
Strong metals prices cannot be counted on for assistance. The platinum price
is healthy enough, but rhodium remains painfully weak. Bargain basement
prices should eventually lead to a new round of stock-building, but there is
no sign of that yet. Meanwhile, Johnson's precious metals division remains
in the doldrums. Promising positions in electronics materials and medicine
are being built, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that demand for its
catalytic converters is getting a timely boost from European legislation on
vehicle emissions.
Thanks to the new rules Johnson expects to produce more converters in Europe
this year, even allowing for a slide in new car sales. Tougher environmental
standards in the US are also good for business. Assuming margins can be
defended against the tough new breed of purchasing managers at Volkswagen
and elsewhere, at least modest profits growth from converters looks assured.
But it will take a rising trend in car sales before Johnson is really
insulated from the metals cycle.

FT  10 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Northern Foods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market may fret about the death of the brand but Northern Foods, at
least, shows that there can be life beyond the grave for food manufacturers.
Acting as the hired hand for the big supermarket chains can be a healthy
enough business as Northern's 21 per cent advance in annual pre-tax profits
demonstrates. The company's extensive rationalisation programme may even
enable trading margins to climb above 10 per cent this year. Few food
manufacturers, branded or otherwise, can boast that.
Such considerations make Northern's 16 per cent underperformance against the
food manufacturing sector over the past year rather puzzling. The company's
earnings growth may tend towards the respectable rather than racy, but a
forward multiple of under 12 hardly demands a lot.
Northern's rating has been depressed by the uncertainties in the dairy
market ahead of the reform of the Milk Marketing Board. With half its
profits flowing from its dairy businesses, Northern has a critical interest
in the outcome. But although the industry's profitability may well decline
over the long run, Northern should still be able to skim off a fair amount
of cream. Unlike many commodity food businesses, milk may retain some
premium for quality. The challenge facing Northern will be to recycle its
cash flow quickly enough into higher margin businesses to ensure continued
growth. The 51 per cent rise in operating profits from convenience foods
suggests it could well be up to the mark.

FT  10 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Lamont's last lament
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lamont's appeal for the government to lead has struck a blow at the prime
minister, but looks a little rich coming from a victim of events. The
markets' most likely response to such homilies is a hollow laugh -
especially since the City has seen little leadership from the government
since the general election. Calls for an independent Bank of England will
get equally short shrift, given that Mr Major looks unlikely to act on the
suggestion.
What is perhaps more influential is final confirmation from Mr Major
yesterday that the UK is unlikely to re-enter the ERM during this
parliament. That leaves the policy focus unequivocally on domestic concerns,
and by implication on the PSBR. It may be that such concentration will
eventually prove misguided, if a significant part of the deficit proves
cyclical. Yet that will depend upon how far the UK economy is running below
capacity, and the extent to which the tax base has been eroded or made more
volatile by the tax reforms of the 1980s. Such judgments are extremely
difficult to make. The government is therefore forced back on to some kind
of medium-term framework for balancing the public finances that carries
credibility with the markets. This, rather than headline spending cuts,
should be the focus of the current review.
Still, if the new chancellor decides to use his political clout to cut
spending significantly, there may be an interest rate cut to soften the
blow. By the autumn, however, the strength of the economy may make lower
rates unnecessary. And the market's hopes of an earlier cut look distinctly
misplaced.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD have sounded unduly pessimistic, as recently as a few weeks ago, to
predict that the disarray among western countries over what to do in
Bosnia-Hercegovina could get any worse. It has. As the fighting between
Moslems, Serbs and Croats has flared again in recent days, the international
community has plumbed new depths of incoherence. Yet the western powers
persist in pretending, against all the evidence, that they are serious about
intervening - if not to keep the peace process on track, at least to afford
some protection to the victims. Events have proved that threats without the
will or means to back them up are not just futile; they fuel the fighting
and put a settlement even further out of reach.
The mess was on full display at yesterday's EC meeting in Athens. The
Vance-Owen peace plan is as good as dead, with neither the European
Community nor the US showing any sign of more than rhetorical readiness to
resuscitate it. Sanctions on Serbia are not being supplemented as they
should be by similar measures against Croatia, nor by a serious effort to
choke off supply routes to the Bosnian Serbs by placing monitors on Serbia's
western border.
Worse, even the meagre plan adopted as a short-term substitute - aimed at
setting up UN-protected 'safe areas' for Moslem communities - looks
still-born, since none of the countries that blithely agreed on the idea in
Washington last month seems ready to provide the forces needed to put it
into practice.
All sides carry some blame. The Clinton administration - by dithering,
half-heartedly presenting a plan to arm the Moslems and strike at the Serbs,
and then just as hesitantly withdrawing it - arguably helped to kill off
Vance-Owen without producing anything substantial in its place. European
governments - by failing to elaborate a credible way of building on the
existing, and decreasingly effective, UN relief effort - have undermined the
idea that anything useful can be achieved by external forces. The US, by
refusing to provide troops to help establish safe areas, has left a gap
which other UN member states will find it nigh impossible to fill.
There is, of course, nothing glorious about the safe areas idea. At best, it
will create protected pockets of misery in Bosnia for a community that once
formed 40 per cent of the ravaged republic's population, and that only for
as long as western countries are prepared to keep their troops on the
ground. But at least implementation of the plan would demonstrate western
commitment to securing a place for the Moslems in the Bosnia that will have
to be reconstructed from today's ruins. Failure to provide the extra troops
necessary for this bare minimum of a strategy will not just leave UN forces
already deployed in Bosnia vulnerable to attack; it will be tantamount to
western acquiescence in complete partition of the republic between Serbs and
Croats.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NORMAN LAMONT lacks the political credibility to mount a devastating attack
on the prime minister. But the prime minister lacks strength to brush off
even a weak one. Mr Lamont was right to charge this government with being in
office, but not in power. Mr Major must respond. Otherwise, as the former
chancellor also argued, the government will not survive and will not deserve
to.
Understandably, Mr Lamont resents having been made the scapegoat. Why, he
asks, should he have resigned when no other European finance minister did
so? Why should he have suffered for the collapse of the government's policy?
Why should he be dismissed now when it was the prime minister who insisted
he stay on?
It is a funny old world. The collapse of the ERM policy destroyed the
credibility of the minister who probably believed in it least. But it did
destroy his credibility, which was why he had to go. The question is whether
the government will make itself stronger by his absence. If it is to do so,
it must heed what Mr Lamont had to say both about its style and about
economic policy.
Mr Lamont made three principal policy recommendations: that the budget
deficit - 'the greatest threat to our long-term position' - must not be
tackled by further tax increases; that there could be no question of
rejoining the ERM during this parliament; and that the Bank of England
should be made independent.
On the first, the former chancellor is only partly right. Higher taxation
looks inevitable. On the ERM, he is closer to the truth. There can be
neither political nor economic benefit in returning to an unreformed ERM.
It is on the last recommendation that he was wisest of all. Two out of the
last three chancellors concluded that untrammelled discretion makes sound
monetary policy more difficult to implement. The reason is, as Mr Lamont
said, that 'interest rate changes should never be used to offset some
unfavourable political event. To do so undermines the credibility of policy
and the credibility of the chancellor.' But the suspicion that policy is so
motivated will always be there, whatever the government's true intentions.
Unfortunately, it is the third of these recent chancellors who is now prime
minister. He opposes a policy of central bank independence, because he wants
the central bank to be 'accountable'. But, in fact, only under an
independent central bank with a clear mandate can monetary policy be made
accountable. Right now it is unaccountable to anybody, except, every four or
five years, to the electorate.
Mr Major does, indeed, need to take strategic decisions. He should decide
that for him to insist on responsibility for monetary policy awakens
suspicions that are bound to make exercise of the policy more costly and
less effective. To govern is to choose. But sometimes it is best to choose
to let others choose.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Student fees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM Boswell, the higher education minister, has distanced the government
from the decision by the London School of Economics to charge students an
extra tuition fee of up to Pounds 1,000. The move had not been initiated by
him or the education department, he said, and there were no plans to
encourage other universities to follow suit. The minister doth protest too
much, for it is only a few weeks since the government cut the tuition fees
it pays for classroom-based courses from Pounds 1,850 to Pounds 1,300. Other
universities may soon follow the LSE's lead to recoup the cut in income.
If they do, it will be only the first step in an irresistible move to compel
students to pay a greater share of the bill for higher education. The
government target is for one in three school-leavers to enter university by
the year 2000, two-thirds more than in 1990. The Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals recently said that investment of well over
Pounds 3bn would be needed to achieve this. The extra student grants and
fees could add up to another Pounds 1bn. Such sums are unlikely to be
available from a Treasury already struggling to contain public sector
borrowing.
There may be scope to save money by ending subsidies for students who wish
to study away from home. Since there are now more than 80 universities, most
could find a suitable course close to home. Universities might be able to
raise more from appeals, sponsorship and other sources. They could make more
productive use of their facilities by adopting a semester system. And they
could be given greater freedom to borrow against their assets, as
recommended by the Pearce report.
But there will remain a funding gap which it is unreasonable to expect the
taxpayer to bridge. The students who benefit from higher education should
make a contribution to the fees, with appropriate help for those from
low-income households. Such a system would allow the government to give
additional support to national priority subjects such as science and
technology through higher subsidies. It would also encourage students to
make more rational decisions about their courses, since they would bear more
of the costs as well as reaping the benefits.
Moving towards a greater element of funding from students would require an
overhaul of the student loan system, however. Students would need to be able
to borrow larger sums over longer periods in this new world of higher
education. Lending against human capital is a risky business for banks and
institutions, since it can be hard to collect debts and trace debtors. The
government could help by collecting repayments through a graduate surcharge
on national insurance contributions. Rather than disowning the LSE's
initiative, ministers should be looking at ways of extending it if the
promised expansion in higher education is not to founder through lack of
funds.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Observer: Aunty George?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who's to be next chairman of the BBC governors? Even though Marmaduke
Hussey's term runs until November 1996, there are persistent rumours he will
go sooner rather than later.
With his vice-chairman, Lord Barnett, standing down at the end of next
month, the next chairman could well be among the clutch of new governors to
be enshrined shortly. True, judging by how often Bosnian peace envoy Lord
Owen's name is bandied about, the government can hardly have overlooked him.
But there's a much more obvious candidate - businessman Sir George Russell.
Better known as chairman of the Independent Television Commission than head
of building products group Marley, he'll probably have time on his hands
next year. His term as chairman of the ITC runs out in 18 months or so, and
he seems intent on bowing out of Marley.
If the government wanted Aunty led by a business type, as opposed to a
political has-been, then Russell seems an ideal fit to take on the BBC
poisoned chalice. His commercial acumen is not in doubt, and he made a fair
stab at sorting out the ministerially created mess over the ITV franchise
awards. He is also a former chairman of Independent Television News and
deputy chairman of Channel 4.
Nor should the fact that he works for the opposition be a problem. Lord Hill
of Luton was chairman of the Independent Television Authority before he took
over the BBC chair. If Sir George were to be offered the job, it would be
good news for Bob Phillis,the current BBC deputy director general. A few
years ago Russell helped Phillis become chief executive of ITN.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Observer: Asian Swan hunt?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Could ownership of Newcastle shipbuilders Swan Hunter soon be embarking for
the Far East? After all, Indonesia has bought most of the East German navy -
39 ships at a knockdown Dollars 12.7m - so a shipyard used to men o'war
would be a useful back-up.
Anyone who still thinks the idea outlandish might care to consider the size
of the advertisements Swan Hunter's receivers have been placing in the
newspapers in Malaysia and Singapore. Investors in the region are invited to
take over Swan Hunter lock, stock and barrel, including outstanding MOD
contracts for three frigates.
Moreover, the idea of flogging assorted bits of Britain's industrial
rustbelt to far easterners seems to be catching on. A joint
Malaysian/Indonesian group, for example, is in the final stages of
negotiating the purchase of the Ravenscraig steelworks in Scotland.
What might strike some speculators as a more interesting deal, however, is
apparently in the offing at the Milan bourse which is soon to move back into
its lavishly restored Palazzo Mezzanotte. Its idea is that countries
ambitious to set up their own stock exchanges might want to buy the
six-year-old transportable building used in the meantime - although whether
the Italian bourse officials are included in the deal is not specified.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Washington ears cocked as the very senior Japanese diplomat began confessing
over dinner who he'd ideally like to be US ambassador in Tokyo. It was 'Mike
Mansfield, 20 years younger'.
And lo] his wish has come as near true as possible with Walter Mondale
taking up Bill Clinton's offer of the posting.
Mansfield, from Montana, went from the majority leader's desk in the Senate
to Japan, where memories of his tenure from 1977-87 are still venerated.
Mondale, from Minnesota, served not only in the Senate but four years as
Jimmy Carter's vice-president. Both are wise old owls with lots of friends
in Congress, twin qualities that the frequently battered Japanese have come
to value.
There's nonetheless a little mystery behind Mondale's acceptance. After
being variously tipped as a candidate for the London, Paris and Moscow
embassies, he made some pretty dismissive remarks about the diplomatic life.
Also, Tokyo had long seemed in the bag for Richard Holbrooke, the investment
banker and Asian specialist from the Carter administration.
Then last month Holbrooke's name suddenly dropped off the table, without
explanation. Rumour was that the Japanese government was so upset with
Clinton trade policies as even to threaten to deny 'agrement' to Holbrooke -
who, the latest scuttlebut has it, is a leading candidate for Bonn.
But now that Washington is making more emollient noises towards Tokyo on the
trade front, no such resistance to the Mondale appointment can be expected.
Mansfield, still going strong at 90, was already 74 when he took up the job
and survived all attempts by subsequent Republican administrations to remove
him. Mondale is a mere 65 and perfectly capable, if he so chooses, of
serving longer in Tokyo than Clinton in Washington.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Initial prize in the power game: An Anglo-US consortium may
soon become the first outsider to break into Germany's utilities market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many years, Germany's utilities resisted attempts to open them up to
outside buyers. But following unification, foreign investors saw an
opportunity to gain a foothold in power generation through acquiring plants
in east Germany. An Anglo-American consortium, headed by Britain's PowerGen
and NRG of Minneapolis, will soon sign two contracts which will allow
outsiders to penetrate the country's highly regulated utilities market for
the first time. The deal may act as a catalyst to break down Germany's
monopolistic industrial structures and could provide east Germany itself
with a solid base for nurturing competition throughout the country.
It all started with wax. In late 1991, NRG, a subsidiary of Northern States
Power Company, one of the leading US utilities, wanted to buy the Romonta
high-quality wax works. Romonta, a subsidiary of Mitteldeutschen Braunkohle
AG, or Mibrag, has 85 per cent of the world market for wax. NRG approached
the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising east German industry,
which owned Mibrag, the vast complex of lignite pits straddling the eastern
states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony.
'We were passed from official to official,' said Mr Manfred Raschke,
chairman of the Massachusetts-based International Strategic Information
Services, a consultancy firm which was advising NRG.
The Treuhand's New York office was told about the foot-dragging in Berlin.
Mr Klaus Schucht and Mr George Lange, the agency's energy and mining
experts, met NRG and astonished it by their offer. 'We were told the whole
of Mibrag was up for sale,' said Mr Raschke.
NRG needed a partner for such a big investment, so it turned, through Mr
Raschke, to Britain's PowerGen. From day one, however, the consortium
decided that utilities, not mines, were its primary interest. 'The Treuhand
made it clear from the beginning that it was unable to give us the entry
into power generation without the purchase of Mibrag,' said Mr Alf Roberts,
commercial director of PowerGen. 'Nevertheless, we saw it (buying Mibrag) as
an opportunity.'
In short, if the consortium presented a viable strategy for Mibrag, it could
use the acquisition to clinch a contract to build a power plant in east
Germany. The Treuhand needed the consortium's cash; the consortium needed a
powerful partner.
The Treuhand wanted a success story. This meant finding a buyer to keep
Mibrag open. Before 1989, the pits were producing 106m metric tons of
lignite a year, and employing 54,600 people. By 1992, the number of workers
had dropped to 16,000, and production had fallen below 30m tons. There were
fears Mibrag might be shut down.
But not everybody wanted the pits kept open. Germany's principal utilities,
RWE Energie, Bayernwerke and PreussenElektra, known as the Big Three,
appeared determined to see Mibrag closed to keep any competitors to their
own monopoly position out of east Germany. Early last year, Rheinbraun, the
brown coal subsidiary of RWE Energie, said Mibrag's coal was worthless, and
the pits should be either closed or merged with Laubag, the large lignite
pits three times the size of Mibrag. Rheinbraun was promoting its own cause;
it wanted to buy Laubag.
'Rheinbraun was not thinking about jobs in eastern Germany. It wanted to
keep out competition and keep energy prices high,' said Mr Paul Achleitner
of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank advising the Treuhand on the Mibrag
deal.
Mr Thomas Klante, spokesman for RWE Energie, holds a different view. 'We
believed it would be commercially more viable to merge Laubag and Mibrag. It
would reduce administrative and other overheads.'
Unknown to Rheinbraun, the Treuhand had commissioned McKinsey, the
management consultant, to assess the commercial viability of Mibrag. It
found that the coal quality in two of Mibrag's four mines was higher than in
Laubag's. The report helped convince the government of Saxony-Anhalt to keep
the Mibrag mines open, and save jobs. Following talks with the European
Community in June 1992, Saxony-Anhalt provided a DM600m (Dollars 375m)
subsidy to help transform a planned power station at Schkopau, near Leipzig,
from imported hard coal to local lignite. By supplying brown coal to
Schkopau, Mibrag might survive. The Treuhand now needed a buyer for the
pits. The consortium was interested.
Again, the Big Three had other plans. At an international conference of
utilities on June 10 in Dortmund, Mr Friedhelm Gieske, RWE Energie's
chairman, said foreigners trying to buy Mibrag were wasting their time. 'The
message was clear,' said an NRG negotiator at the meeting. 'Foreigners were
told to keep their hands off Mibrag.'
As the consortium continued its exploratory talks with the Treuhand, the
workers' councils at Mibrag were questioning the pits' sale to foreigners.
'Mibrag employees were told that the consortium intended to sack all the
workers and replace them with Mexicans. This was a blatant attempt to drum
up anti-foreign sentiment,' said an NRG official.
The workers expressed their concerns in a letter to Chancellor Kohl on
September 23. Signed by the workers' councils of Mibrag, Laubag and
Vereinigte Energiewerke AG (or Veag), the main east German utilities
company, it was timed to coincide with a federal government discussion on
east Germany's energy outlook on September 28.
In the letter, Mr Kohl was asked to block the sale of Mibrag to the
consortium, because 'foreign investors' would flout Germany's labour laws
and destroy jobs. Echoing Rheinbraun's earlier proposals, it suggested
merging Mibrag with Laubag. The letter never reached Mr Kohl. It was
intercepted by a senior official who did not want it to become the focus of
the meeting. In a later statement, Mr Kohl said: 'The trust agency (the
Treuhand) will do a fair and competition-based review of the offer which has
been made earlier by an American-British group . . .'
Nobody, publicly, would confirm who masterminded the letter. 'I do not know
the precise source of the letter,' said Mr David Petersen, president of NRG.
'It smelt of Rheinbraun,' said a consortium negotiator.
Rheinbraun denies any knowledge of the letter. Mr Jurgen Stotz, a board
member of Veag, said the workers had written it themselves. 'You must
understand what was going on in the minds of the Mibrag people,' he said.
'They were fighting for their survival. They were unsure about their
future.'
The Anglo-US consortium persisted in its negotiations with the Treuhand.
Despite mounting opposition from Rheinbraun and lack of support from the
influential economics ministry, its determination to acquire Mibrag grew
stronger.
It had already won some political support from other quarters. During the
Munich summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised countries last
July, Mr James Baker, then US secretary of state, met Ms Birgit Breuel, the
Treuhand president. Besides stressing the commitment by NRG and the US to
investing in east Germany, he said the Treuhand should encourage foreign
investors as a means of opening up competition there. The finance ministry
in Bonn agreed.
'I always said we cannot privatise eastern Germany as a closed shop, and
that is not restricted to any sector,' said a senior finance ministry
official. 'I think we have got to use this (the consortium) to begin the
break-up of the German power generation system,' he added.
However, this bulwark of political assistance could not remove the single
overriding obstacle facing the consortium: how to go from building a power
plant to selling electricity in east Germany or abroad. The Treuhand could
help with power generation but it could not guarantee access to the
transmission grid.
The consortium had made its purchase of Mibrag contingent upon building one
of the two 800MW electricity-generating units at Lippendorf, in
Saxony-Anhalt. Lippendorf is owned by Veag, which controls the high-voltage
grid in the east. Although technically under the Treuhand, which will
privatise it later this year, Veag is controlled by the Big Three west
German utilities as a result of the Stromvertrag, or 'electricity contract'.
The contract, signed in August 1990, gave each of the Big Three a 25 per
cent stake in Veag. To underwrite large investments in east Germany,
including modernising equipment and building brown coal-fired power
stations, the Stromvertrag stipulated that east Germany's regional utilities
had to buy 70 per cent of their power from Veag over the next 20 years. In
practice, this created an electricity distribution monopoly for Veag and
thus the west Germans.
Last August, Bayernwerke and a smaller utilities company offered to build
one of the two power generating blocks at Lippendorf. The consortium was
interested in building the second unit, stressing it wanted to co-operate
with the Big Three. 'There was no other way,' said Mr Raschke, the US energy
consultant who was a negotiator for the consortium. 'You have got to
remember that the German utilities are too big, too rich, and too
politically well-connected to take head-on.'
Bayernwerke did not want to co-operate. 'They were never happy that we
should own a power plant (in eastern Germany),' said Mr Raschke. Mr Hans
Werner Klein, the Treuhand's expert on privatising coal and electricity,
said: 'Even if the consortium managed to build a power block at Lippendorf,
we could not guarantee it access to the grid which is controlled by Veag.'
Attempts by the consortium to build at Lippendorf ended abruptly at a secret
meeting with the Big Three at the Sheraton Hotel at Frankfurt airport, on
November 17. 'We were bluntly told to give up, and get out of Lippendorf
because we would not have access to the grid,' said Mr Petersen of NRG. 'But
in return for getting out of Lippendorf, they offered us a majority stake at
the (900MW) Schkopau power plant.'
The consortium returned to the drawing board. Despite the reduced power
generation capacity at Schkopau, the station had several advantages over
Lippendorf. Schkopau would come on line by 1996; Lippendorf, three years
later; and Schkopau could be fuelled by Mibrag's coal. With Schkopau in
play, the Treuhand put Mibrag out to tender.
The deadline was December 18. The consortium drew up a detailed plan, on
time. The Big Three, now interested in Mibrag, presented the same old plan -
the merger of Mibrag with Laubag. 'Rheinbraun was arrogant enough to believe
we would get out, and arrogant enough to believe that it could secure
Mibrag, even though it had earlier condemned the pits to die,' said Mr
Petersen.
On January 22, the Treuhand announced that the consortium had secured sole
negotiating rights for Mibrag until the end of this July. Rheinbraun had
misjudged the stubbornness of the Anglo-Americans, and their ability to sway
the Treuhand.
Developments moved in the consortium's favour. On March 8, the Treuhand
secured long-term coal contracts for Mibrag, guaranteeing it a secure
economic basis. Spread over 40 years, Mibrag will supply an annual 15m
metric tons of coal to Lippendorf and Schkopau. By mid-May, the coal
contracts had been signed, and the consortium had started evaluating
Mibrag's assets and drafting a contract in which it is expected to pay DM2bn
for the pits. By the end of May, it had virtually secured a 44 per cent
stake (or 400MW) in Schkopau, and obtained an agreement that Veag would buy
its energy. By this time, Veag was starting to acknowledge the commitment of
the consortium to east Germany's utilities market and was becoming more
flexible.
To have reached this stage, the consortium has made considerable
concessions. The stake at Schkopau, which will cost about DM1bn, is
considerably below the consortium's intended 800MW access to power
generation. The terms of the contract with the Treuhand will guarantee
several thousand jobs at Mibrag, which negotiators say involves some
overemployment. 'It was part of the price, and our commitment in eastern
Germany,' said an NRG official.
In addition, the consortium has won widespread credibility by standing its
ground against the Big Three. 'It was difficult. But if the concept of a
European single market means anything, then what we are doing in eastern
Germany seems perfectly natural,' said PowerGen's Mr Roberts.
'I expected it to be tough. But not this tough,' said Mr Petersen, who
believes the foothold in east Germany could give the consortium a launching
pad into eastern Europe. 'You see, the German utilities thought they could
keep us out. But our company, and PowerGen, have a reputation. Unless there
is nothing there, we don't give up at all,' he added.
They might even acquire the coveted wax works.

than Pounds 100m', suggests that substantial progress has been made towards
meeting the shortfall in the Maxwell pension schemes. This view, which
reflects comments that I have heard elsewhere, is misconceived.
The misappropriations from the Common Investment Fund (CIF) were in the
region of Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m. The Mirror Group Pension Scheme's share
of these losses is roughly one half. In addition, more than Pounds 100m was
misappropriated from the Mirror scheme's own funds outside the CIF. Thus,
the Mirror scheme alone has lost more than Pounds 200m. The other Maxwell
schemes taken together have also lost sums approaching Pounds 200m.
One aspect of the more optimistic assessments that I have seen is that they
include a suggestion that it is not necessary to recover all the missing
funds since the Maxwell schemes used to have actuarial surpluses. However,
this ignores the fact that, in the end, benefits will have to be secured
either (a) by the purchase of annuities and deferred annuities from a life
office, or (b) by running down the schemes over the lifetime of their
members and therefore pursuing a restrictive policy of investment in fixed
interest securities that as nearly as possible match the scheme's
crystallised liabilities.
In both cases, the funds required to secure the benefits will be greater
than the provision normally appropriate in a healthy, on-going scheme, and
so the former surpluses will be needed to meet the additional cost. It is
nowadays common for a scheme to have an actuarial surplus in relation to its
on-going funding target but to be in deficit on winding up.
The liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management (responsible for the
CIF) and the trustees of the Maxwell pension schemes have traced most of the
missing funds, but finding out where they went is not the same as getting
them back. So far, the only significant asset recovery has been the return
of some 25m Teva shares to the CIF by National Westminster Bank a year ago,
which is taken into account in the above figures.
So far support from the government's Pounds 2.5m 'drip feed' and now from
Sir John Cuckney's Pounds 6.25m Maxwell Pensioners Trust has ensured that
Maxwell pensioners have generally continued to receive their pensions in
full, but this support will run out in about three years. Unless there have
been very substantial asset recoveries by then, thousands of current
pensioners will be in danger of suffering a reduction in their benefits and
thousands of prospective pensioners could lose their benefits altogether.
Employees and former employees of MGN are not counted among these victims,
since MGN has undertaken almost entirely to refinance their benefits over a
period of up to 14 years. This commitment resulted in a provision in MGN's
accounts of roughly Pounds 200m.
Thus MGN shareholders are also Maxwell victims. Of course, the actual cost
to MGN will depend on the level of asset recoveries achieved by the pension
schemes.
The Mirror scheme trustees are pursuing legal actions for the return of
Pounds 88m, and for unliquidated damages for losses generally, against
Invesco MIM, Capel Cure Myers, Lehman Bros, Bank of America and Credit
Suisse. So far, these are the only legal proceedings issued against
financial institutions or professional advisers either by Maxwell scheme
trustees or by the BIM liquidators. Many other possible claims are still
being examined and there is in prospect a welter of litigation on a massive
scale.
I therefore welcome your call on the regulators to use all powers available
to them to encourage or impose a global settlement, and would much prefer to
obtain redress for the Maxwell victims in this way than by litigation - so
long as the amounts are realistic.
Finally, with a total shortfall in excess of Pounds 400m, it seems unlikely
that a global settlement or maximum recovery through litigation will fully
compensate the Maxwell victims. In view of the failure of law and regulation
to which you refer, and which is being put right for the future, there is an
overwhelming case for government to underwrite the Maxwell pension schemes.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Why German costs now look so high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A spectre is beginning to haunt the European Community, that of
Euro-competitiveness - or rather the lack of it. It is invoked by
protectionists in industries such as steel, coal and textiles, who ask how
western European industry can compete - to use the fashionable exaggeration
 -with Czech workers on a 10th of the EC wage, or south-east Asian workers
on a 40th. It is used as an argument against fuel taxes or other
anti-pollution measures. The threat of 'Europe becoming uncompetitive' is
even used in support of good causes such as flexible working hours, or when
arguing against social chapter-type proposals which would raise labour
costs.
It is also likely that, for want of anything else, Euro-competitiveness will
be the rabbit that the European Commission president, Jacques Delors, will
pull out of the hat when he presents his own document on recession and
unemployment to EC leaders at the Copenhagen summit. For it will appeal both
to the protectionists and to the more superficial free market advocates. It
will also give the Community a ragged flag around which to rally when trying
to act tough in trade matters with the US or ex-communist countries. Yet it
is mostly a muddle.
There is a vague sense in which western Europe is losing relative position,
and China and the other Asian developing countries are catching up -
although that is not the same thing as lack of competitiveness. The average
growth rate of the EC since 1975 has been about 2 per cent a year and that
of the US a shade higher. On the other hand, Asian countries have been
growing as a group by 6 to 7 per cent a year.
The more successful developing countries will thus account, if they maintain
their momentum, for a larger part of world output, relative to the older
industrial countries. This is a natural and desirable catching-up process. A
small group of North Atlantic countries cannot hope to stay in the lead
forever.
How about another conventional, if disputable, index of competitiveness, the
current balance of payments? In the EC as a whole, a deficit has emerged
equivalent to just under 1 per cent of its combined GDP with the rest of the
world, and its financing causes no trouble.
If there is a problem of uncompetitiveness in the mundane sense of a pattern
of costs and exchange rates so high as to price products out of world
markets, it is almost exclusively a German one.
There have been many French business complaints about losing competitiveness
to Italy, Spain and the UK as a result of recent devaluations. This,
however, has been made up by the improvement of competitiveness against
Germany which started in 1988 and has been increasing in momentum.
The measurement of the real exchange rate is difficult and controversial.
But IMF indices of normalised unit labour costs, adjusted for exchange rate
variation, suggest France is just as competitive as it was two years ago -
although slightly less than one year ago - and has retained most of the
gains of the late 1980s.
Germany, on the other hand, suffered an explosive increase in unit labour
costs after unification. The adjoining chart may give an exaggerated
impression because of the inclusion of rapidly rising east German wages
unconnected with productivity gains. That surely, however, is part of
Germany's problem.
If the German authorities did not care about inflation, cutting interest
rates sharply and letting the D-Mark fall would be a way of stimulating the
economy in a short-term and superficial way. It would remove one source of
tension with its neighbours by allowing European interest rates to fall, but
probably gain another by giving rise to complaints of competitive
depreciation.
Of course, the Bundesbank has no desire for a D-Mark depreciation - a high
real exchange rate helps to damp down German inflationary pressures.
Nevertheless, the chart does make the case for a French depreciation against
the D-Mark, on which so many market scribes were recently keen, seem
ludicrous. Indeed a bigger, if slightly longer-term, problem is the risk of
the D-Mark taking an undesired drop. The fact that George Soros has come
independently to the same conclusion does not make it true. But it is at
least a straw in the wind.
Even with the present policy of small and stately cuts in German interest
rates, there is clear downside risk on the D-Mark. But France and Germany's
smaller neighbours have inflation rates up to 2 per cent less than
Germany's, which makes their own real interest rates correspondingly higher
and more painful at a time of general recession.
Maybe the increase in German costs can be treated as once and for all, and
the D-Mark can be kept high on the basis of a tough monetary policy
offsetting a big budget deficit and swollen internal costs. Yet this is no
basis for a stable European Monetary System. A comparison can be made with
the strong dollar of President Reagan's early years, when Fed tight money
was offsetting a large US budget deficit. The combination would have been no
basis for a worldwide monetary system.
Ideally, France should take over the role of anchor country from Germany.
Taking over the anchor role is not something that can be done overnight by
firing a gun from the Elysee Palace. The Banque de France has got away in
recent weeks with periods when very short-term interest rates have been a
tiny fraction below Germany's. But the tie-up with German rates is still
close.
What could happen in the period ahead is a gradual differential fall in the
interest rates of the countries which form the hard core of the exchange
rate mechanism. In other words, a sizeable interest rate differential could
eventually develop against Germany, as French and other interest rates fall
slightly faster. The interest rate gap would be the insurance premium
Germany would have to pay to offset the risks of a D-Mark depreciation.
This would be a sharp break with the image that people have formed of the
German economy and currency. But stranger and sharper breaks have occurred
in the past.
Similar charts show that Japan has also had a sharp rise in its real
exchange rate. In the past, Japan has been better than other countries at
reversing such movements through a mixture of productivity gains and wage
moderation. Its ability to do so is now more open to question, and the
American campaign for a higher yen is singularly ill-advised. The Bank of
Japan could, however, help to reverse at least part of the yen appreciation
by still easier and cheaper money, and not assume that present 3.3 per cent
short-term interest rates are necessarily rock bottom.
The country that has gained the greatest competitive advantage is
undoubtedly the UK. On an IMF unit labour cost basis, costs corrected for
exchange rates are 15 to 20 per cent below what they were before departure
from the ERM, and about 10 per cent lower than when the British government
was shadowing the D-Mark in the winter of 1987-88. It is hard work
persuading continental friends that this depreciation was forced on the
government.
Any further depreciation of sterling - whether intentional as the Red/Black
coalition of critics on the government's left and right would like, or as a
by-product of attempts to push recovery faster - would lead to accusations
of competitive devaluation in earnest and could even put the single market
at risk. The ERM may have had its fault lines, but these are nothing
compared with the defects of unbridled currency nationalism.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article by Frances Williams, 'Soft bark and not much of a bite'
(June 2), betrayed a lack of perspective regarding the influence and role of
the International Labour Organisation and gave an unbalanced account of its
position and achievements. The ILO is not alone in having to come to terms
with the social, economic and political debris left by the communist regimes
in central and eastern Europe. But it is worth noting that most of the
countries of the region are using ILO conventions as the basis for the
development of labour legislation, putting their trust in tripartite
consultation and reaffirming commitment to freedom of association in
tackling vast economic problems.
The ILO alone provides comprehensive accounts of the extent of bonded and
child labour, poverty, unemployment, and risks to safety and health round
the world which must be the starting point for efforts to eradicate those
evils. It alone exposes repressive governments to detailed public scrutiny
and cross-questioning about violations of conventions protecting human
rights which it authoritatively identifies. From our experience, I know ILO
criticisms and condemnations have had some impact even on the UK government,
despite a shameless offensive of misrepresentation and disparagement of the
organisation on those occasions.
Recollection of the catastrophic experience of social breakdown and
injustice which led to two wars, to the foundation of the ILO and inspired
its development after 1944 seems to be unfashionable now. However,
increasingly we see that reputable economic commentators are joining the ILO
in exposing the abject failure in economic, as well as social terms, of the
Thatcher experiment to show that the values of solidarity, justice,
consultation and commitment to gradual social improvement are central to
long-term economic success and to peace.
There may be just criticism of the ILO for buying uncritically so much of
the neo-liberal message and for failing to give a lead in fighting mass
unemployment. That, too, in my view, arises from pursuit of a passing
fashion; it does not bring any discredit to the principles on which the ILO
was founded. They are still relevant and the international community will
return to them.

Sir, The proposal by Postel to vote against the re-election of directors who
are on rolling service agreements longer than 12 months is welcome ('Pension
fund move to limit directors' contracts', June 5). However, voting such
directors off the board would itself be a breach of many service agreements,
so triggering the excessive pay-offs Postel's move seeks to deter.
Short of new legislation or stock exchange rules, shareholders should ensure
company boards are made up of a majority of directors prepared to take
shareholder opinion into account before such agreements are entered into.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Mouse that roared: Small fire can destroy a small prime
minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was no Geoffrey Howe; his quarry no Margaret Thatcher. The ultimate
effect could, however, be the same. Yesterday's resignation speech by the
former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, lacked the subtlety, and the force, of
Lord Howe's remarks of November 14 1990. As was evident within seconds of
its launch on that fateful day, the former foreign secretary's verbal Exocet
devastated the House of Commons and destroyed the prime minister who had so
recently forced his resignation.
His final words, those that triggered the explosion, still ring in political
ears. 'The time has come for others to consider their response to the tragic
conflict of loyalty with which I have perhaps wrestled for far too long,' he
said. It was amazing, coming from a soft-spoken diplomat whose previous
political assaults had been likened to attacks by a dead sheep. Mr Michael
Heseltine sat just a few feet away. The eternal pretender was quick to seize
the moment. The drama of November 1990 began. Its denouement was certain.
Within eight days the huge figure of the Iron Lady crashed to the ground.
Less predictably, Mr John Major, not Mr Heseltine, was selected to replace
her.
We cannot expect the history of 1990 to repeat itself, except perhaps as
farce. Lord Howe commanded the sympathy of many in the Conservative party,
then at least outwardly united under a strong leader. Mr Lamont may win a
more appreciative audience from historians than he presently enjoys, but for
the moment the sad truth is that he is a discredited figure, with relatively
few friends even among his own colleagues. However powerful his words may
be, the fact that they are ut-tered by him weakens their impact.
Against that, you do not need the full blast of a Howe resignation speech to
cut the ground from under the feet of a John Major. The smaller prime
minister can be destroyed by smaller fire, aimed by smaller fry. Mr Major is
the opposite of a strong leader; the Tories are not one but two parties.
Their anti-European Bolsheviks, still wedded to their great heroine, are
engaged in deadly battle with their conservative Mensheviks.
Everyone will have heard the ex-chancellor's observation that the government
gives the impression of being 'in office but not in power'. It was a
perfectly-aimed rifle-shot. In a few short sharp sentences Mr Lamont painted
an unforgettable picture of a frantic prime minister dominated by opinion
polls and his party managers. There is some self-serving intent in this. Sir
Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief
whip, are regarded in the Lamont camp as the former chancellor's direct
assassins.
His call for an independent central bank, now becoming a tradition in
chancellors' resignation speeches, served to underline the impression of a
nervous head of government manipulating both the extent and timing of
interest rate changes in order to manipulate public support. This will be
remembered. Mr Lamont's advice to Mr Major to consider what is right before
deciding on the manner of its presentation, to have thought for the good of
the country rather than the headlines of the next 36 hours, may reverberate
long after some of the more arcane apologias on his conduct of economic
policy have faded away.
'Unless this approach is changed,' said the ex-chancellor, 'the government
will not survive - and will not deserve to.' Mr Major's subsequent
explanation, that he is supported by a small majority in the House of
Commons, revealed his continuing inability to understand why people hold his
ministry in such low esteem. Certainly he is obliged to trim his sails to
the realities of the Commons, but he must also indicate, by spoken intent
always and by deed where possible, that he is guiding us in some established
direction. This, the electorate told him by its votes in the recent Newbury
by-election, he has failed to do.
What may save the prime minister is that there is no obvious pretender, no
Michael Heseltine, waiting to challenge him for the leadership. Mr Kenneth
Clarke, who is often spoken of as such, has first to prove himself as
chancellor. He is anyway no friend of the Bolsheviks; he announced firmly
yesterday that he stands at the 'hard centre' of his party - pro-European,
fiscally responsible, and socially aware.
His address to the parliamentary press gallery was an object lesson in how
these things should be done; Mr Major could never be so articulate, so
frank, and so clear in so short a speech.
The voters of Christchurch may now have the prime minister's political life
in their hands. A by-election in that archetypically safe Conservative seat
is expected to be held on July 8 or 15, unless the government gets itself
into a blue funk and holds off for longer. A Liberal Democrat triumph in
Christchurch could not be blamed on the incumbency of Mr Norman Lamont, as
was the loss of Newbury. There is only one man who could carry the can for
such an electoral disaster.
It is still prudent to aver that if the turn in the economy begins to be
felt by the electorate, the Conservatives' fortunes will improve and with
that Mr Major's chances of survival in office. Who knows, with the good
candidate they have put in, the Tories might even hold Christchurch. Against
that, a more deadly intention of fate is beginning to become apparent. Only
a year or so of demonstrably competent government can erase the image of Mr
Major's style of administration held in so many people's minds and etched in
our memories by Mr Lamont yesterday. It is not clear that a year is
available.

THE VANISHING (15) George Sluizer
CLOSE TO EDEN (15) Sidney Lumet
SWING KIDS (12) Thomas Carter
UNTAMED HEART (15) Tony Bill
SOFIE (15) Liv Ullmann
'There must be other national disaster areas we can go to,' suggests the
hero's girlfriend in the new thriller The Vanishing, as they drive through
the stricken wastelands of Mount Saint Helen.
There certainly are. All America is at their feet to judge by this week's
movies. There is Hasidic New York as dottily depicted by director Sidney
Lumet in Close To Eden: a place where each new day brings a fresh fall-out
of cliches about Jewish life and tradition. There is the Disney-imagined
1930s Hamburg of Swing Kids, shot in Europe but spiritually based in
Burbank. And there is the multi-ethnic Minneapolis of Untamed Heart where
romance-bitten Latin waitresses jabber tirelessly about life and love.
Multi-ethnicity is a la mode today. But Hollywood's grasp of how to deal
with foreigners and immigrants sometimes seems no surer than in the bad old
days when every Frenchman wore a beret, every Italian was Rossano Brazzi and
every sortie into a European subject became a kamikazi raid on a hostile
culture.
The Vanishing, this week's only US film with all-WASP main characters, has a
major country-of-inspiration problem. Directed by Holland's George Sluizer,
it is a remake of his scarifying thriller about a Dutch girl's disappearance
while holidaying in France and her boyfriend's confrontation with horror as
 -years later - he tracks down her kidnapper-killer.
Transplanted to an American setting and American genre tradition, the film
withers on its stalk. Scripted by Todd Graff (Used People), it has no
apparent understanding, even with the same man in the director's chair, of
the Euro-spooky qualities that made the first film so indelible. From the
continent of Kafka came a film with the courage of its comfortlessness. A
true mystery (girl's baffling disappearance at motorway service area) turned
into a true nightmare (hero's encounter with her abductor and voluntary
re-living of her fate), passing through tunnels of fear, despair and
horrific psychopathology.
Now we have Jeff Bridges advertising that he is Mr Villain from scene one:
playing with his chloroform bottle, waddling like Sydney Greenstreet and
speaking with a clipped and 'sinister' accent. And we have a love interest
(Nancy Travis) thrown in to keep the hero half-happy (Kiefer Sutherland)
even as he pursues his monomaniac quest for his ex-love's destroyer.
The final reel brings cross-country car chases, crunching fights in and
around log cabins and hairsbreadth 'scapes from premature burial-places.
Battered by melodrama and mugged by contrivance, the new Vanishing bears as
much resemblance to the old Vanishing as Mickey Spillane does to Friedrich
Nietzsche.
Close To Eden is also about two races blindly, brain-damagingly colliding.
For Dutch existential darkness meeting American action cinema, read New York
policewoman Melanie Griffith meeting - nay, going undercover in - the city's
Hasidic-Jewish community.
'What's new and exciting?' is Griffith's daily catch-line in the cop shop:
to which the correct answer would be 'Nothing so far and the outlook is
grim.' Sounding like a toddler on tranquillisers, Griffith pipes out her
questions about Hebrew life and lore as she commutes between police HQ and
the Jewish family with a murder in its midst. You know which place you are
in from the lighting alone. Cameraman Andrzej Bartkowiak, of Lumet's The
Verdict and Daniel, gives a harsh brusque daylight to the cop scenes while
bathing the old-world Hasidic household in browns and golds and ambers. So
subtle. One moment we could be in Cagney And Lacey; the next we feel we are
drowning in a Rembrandt painting.
The film's obviousness pervades every pore. To italicise her outsider status
Griffith is scripted (by writer Robert J. Avrech) as if her character
description read 'Single-figure IQ, dippy manner, could be convincing
undercover agent in kindergarten.' When not reporting back to her boss with
vital new findings on Jewish culture - ''Chutzpah'. It's a new word I've
learned' - Griffith gropes towards a romance with a young aspiring rebbe or
community leader (Eric Thal). 'Guess you're not used to a woman like me' she
flutes one night out on the post-barmitzvah patio. 'Is anybody?' he replies.
Close To Eden finally dies in a blaze of garish implausibility. We cannot
leave without commenting on Griffith's disguise wig for Jewish ceremonies
(Kiri Te Kanawa out of Norman Bates's mother); or on composer Jerry Bock's
determination to accompany our heroine's trips to Little Israel with the
kind of cod-Yiddish music that went out, or should have done, with Fiddler
On The Roof.
The only reason that Swing Kids and Untamed Heart seem preferable is that
their foreignness/ethnicity are not rammed down our ears and into our
brains. Swing Kids is a German-set film about the rise of Nazism. But no
one, thank heaven, puts on a 'Cherman' accent. Not even Kenneth Branagh as
the Gestapo officer bearing down on two jazz-loving Hamburgers, Robert Sean
Leonard and Christian Bale, who insist on bopping to Herr Benny Goodman
rather joining the Hitler Youth. Jonathan Marc Feldman's script claims - and
who are we to argue? - that a whole generation of these rebel 'swing kids'
actually existed before Adolf pulled the plug.
It all ends in tears, as Nazi Germany herself did. The film is simplified,
sentimentalised and directed with rationed bravura by TV graduate Thomas
Carter. But at least it evades the worst strut-and-hiss nonsenses of
National Socialist cinema.
As for Untamed Heart, its 'at least' is Marisa Tomei. Miss T won this year's
Oscar for best supporting actress - she was the human whirlwind in My Cousin
Vinny - and now deserves another for best unsupported actress. As a
lovestruck Minnesota waitress she wipes the screen with her co-performers:
including Christian Slater as the heart-diseased, introverted busboy she
loves, who when not clearing plates reads books and listens to music and
rescues our heroine from rape attempts.
Tomei's ethnicity is blissfully laid-back and unlabelled. (Is she Italian in
origin? Hungarian? Spanish? The press notes are mute.) All we know is that
she acts straight from the heart and funny-bone: a distrait diva whose
line-readings have a concussed, eccentric, husky freshness we have not known
since - well, I almost said since Melanie Griffith in Working Girl. But if I
do that, Miss Tomei will end up playing undercover policepersons in
certifiable crime dramas.
Untamed Heart is directed by ex-actor Tony Bill. Hence perhaps its
resemblance to a teledrama. The camera follows the human face, the close-up
is king, and other cinematic values go hang. Liv Ullmann's directing debut
Sofie has the same affliction. The screen-filling mug shots in this tale of
a Jewish dynasty in turn-of-the-century Copenhagen are merciless.
Unhappy Sofie (Karen-Lise Mynster), pushed into a loveless marriage by her
matchmaking, prosperity-hunting parents (Erland Josephson, Ghita Norby),
pines away under the giant lenses like a soul trapped in amber. We peer into
her struggling features through the film's succession of amplifying golden
twilights. And we are released from intimacy with Sofie only when the camera
cuts to someone else's face and blows that up to fill the screen.
We cannot fault the performances. Many of the actors come from the Ingmar
Bergman repertory company and know how to suffer under all kinds of
microscopes. But Ullmann has little sense of emotional rubato and less of
visual rhythm. The sacrificial torments pound on through 2 1/2 hours. And
while the faces register all the bruises that life and society can bring,
the camera never pulls back far enough to show what that life and society
really consisted of.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Arts: The Stuttgart Ballet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Stuttgart Ballet meant a great deal to Sir Kenneth MacMillan. His friend
and contemporary, John Cranko, directed the troupe. Cranko it was who
invited MacMillan to stage The Song of the Earth when, in 1965, Covent
Garden had thrown its hands up in horror at the idea of a ballet using
Mahler's symphony. Subsequently, Macmillan was to create other major works
on the Stuttgart dancers, responding to such artists as Marcia Haydee,
Birgit Keil, Richard Cragun - My Brother, My Sisters, one of his finest
portraits of the ensemble - and his Requiem was made for Stuttgart in 1977
as a memorial to John Cranko.
It is fitting, then, that Peter Wright should have invited the Stuttgart
Ballet to give two commemorative performances in Birmingham this week, in
tribute to MacMillan. And very properly the repertory comprised Song of the
Earth and Requiem. On Tuesday night I found Song of the Earth an inevitable
and heart-searching journey, as ever in the Stuttgart interpretation. The
central figure of The Woman is safe with Annie Mayet. Her dancing had the
dignity in grief, and the integrity of utterance, which are central facts of
the ballet itself, and her reading was beautiful because without
affectation: movement as essence of experience.
I thought Benito Marcelino a powerful Messenger; Wolfgang Stollwitzer rose
to the great moments of the Man's role, though it is a part which can
benefit from a denser physical presence. Musically, the performance by the
Royal Ballet Sinfonietta under Davor Krnjak was distinguished - texture
clear; sonorities pungent - and Peter Jeffes' tenor blazed grandly in his
three songs.
About Requiem I had reservations. From the first, the ensemble showed that
directness of response to MacMillan's daring imagery - fists raised to
Heaven; mouths agape - which is essential if the piece is to convince us.
Both Richard Cragun and Birgit Keil, in the roles they created, maintain
that purity of intention (no mannerisms; not one beatific or mock-anguished
spasm) which is vital the the sense of the choreography. But Susanne Hanke
performed the Sanctus as if opening a charity bazaar, and Marcia Haydee -
paying her own tribute to MacMillan by returning to the Pie Jesu that he
made for her - seemed all too consciously innocent. (The choreography was
inspired by MacMillan's very young daughter dancing to this same music, and
Haydee's original performance was transparent.) And though we are taught
that diamonds are forever, this is not part of the text of the Mass, and I
find the glitter of ear-studs worn by the leading women less than convincing
as theology or emotion.
The lighting of the set was far from happy. In the first production, the
action seemed bathed in a luminosity which filled translucent columns and
spilled over the stage and was absorbed into the dance itself. On Tuesday
night, the light was misty, dull, and the set glum. The ballet suffered.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Arts: Artistic life of Athens transformed - Max Loppert
confirms his initial impression of the Megaron Mousikis Athenon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Athens has acquired for itself one of the great arts centres of Europe: of
this there can now be not the smallest doubt. The Megaron Mousikis Athenon,
a superbly finished building which sets its two differently-sized
performance halls amidst airily handsome white-marble foyers, has
transformed the artistic life of the city. Everyone you meet says so, in
tones of passionate conviction characteristic of the born-again believer.
I first visited the Megaron in May last year, some months after the centre
had been inaugurated. An invitation to make a return tour of inspection last
week revealed previously missing finishing touches now in place. The
magnificent organ in the Friends' Hall (the 2,000-seater) will shortly be in
action. Beautifully planted gardens have been opened for concert-interval
strolling. A well-ordered buffet restaurant in the basement operates for
post-performance dining.
Every detail - apart, perhaps, from the slight shortage of leg-room in
upper-tier seating - seems precise in purpose, exactly executed,
un-ostentatiously right. The practicability of the Megaron, which was
designed to place up-to-date technology at the service of all the various
purposes for which the building was intended, is a remarkable achievement -
and, in the light of the various impracticable opera theatres and
concert-halls that have recently been unveiled elsewhere in Europe, one
rather too obviously exceptional.
Its flexibility was fully demonstrated during my two-day sojourn. On my
first morning the Friends' Hall was a conference venue for the presentation
of the annual Onassis Awards (worth Dollars 100,000, and given this year to,
among others, Vaclav Havel and Peter Brook). That evening it was a
music-theatre space, with an orchestra pit opened out front-of-platform, for
the semi-staging of a Gluck opera. The next evening the side-boxes of
additional seating had been slid back into position, the pit was closed and
on stage the full Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under Claudio Abbado was
assembled for a concert of Schubert and Mahler symphonies.
Two thematic strands dominate seasonal programme-building at the Megaron:
these two successive events exemplified them. A 'Great Orchestras of the
World' series is the first strand. The Berlin Philharmonic concert was its
concluding and, indeed, culminating item: this is the first of the world's
super-elite orchestras to appear in the Megaron, and its playing of the
Mahler Fifth Symphony drove the Athens public into ecstasies.
These were easy enough to understand. In a hall of such marvellously
well-balanced, responsive acoustics, where the full range of Mahler scoring
device is permitted to 'sound' with ideal clarity and exactitude of
perspective, the Berlin orchestral ensemble was displayed in all its glory.
A nit-picker might sense, as I did, that in middle age Abbado has loosened
his grip on Mahlerian symphonic drama - memories of LSO Mahler performances
suggest, perhaps unfairly, that he now tends to dull its cutting edge of
irony, soften its lyrical contours, make less jagged its heights and depths.
But under his musical directorship the great qualities of an orchestra for
so long thought of as 'Karajan's band' are certainly not lost: the Athens
concert hall experience proved as much.
The second seasonal strand is the cyclic representation of a figure from
Greek mythology - last year Electra, this year Helen, next year Medea - by
means of operas, plays, symposia, lectures and other related events.
Strauss's Aegyptische Helena (with Anna Tomowa-Sintow) had a full-scale
staging last month; a brand-new Greek opera entitled The Return of Helen and
the Euripides play Helen are due in the next few weeks.
Alongside these, the choice of Gluck's Iphigenie en Tauride (in which Helen
figures only tangentially, as the offstage provoker of the various tragedies
visited on the house of Agamemnon) rather than the admittedly less
well-known Paride ed Elena (in which Helen is the heroine) proved distinctly
odd. Nevertheless, since the performance itself was a triumph of restrained
yet passionate Gluck interpretation, and had clearly an overwhelming effect
on the huge audience, excuses for its addition to the Helen cycle were in
the end unnecessary.
Ellen Shade (Iphigenia), Francois le Roux (Orestes), and Donald Kaasch
(Pylades) led the eloquently expressive cast; the Austrian Concentus Vocalis
choir and the English Chamber Orchestra were conducted by Marc Soustrot.
There was no scenery to speak of. The chorus stood in serried ranks, the
singers moved on and off a central dais, changes of lighting played on the
organ in the background. One of the supreme examples of opera-as-drama
economy was rendered with extraordinary accuracy, tact, directness and
emotional force. As always happens in successful operatic accounts of this
sort, one came away brooding about the amount of fuss, tat and wasted effort
that goes into the average modern opera production.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Arts: 'Joe Egg' and 'The Pan Beaters' - London Fringe
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

<TEXT>
If you missed the 1960s, just hang around. You'll soon catch. Flares and
long hair are back. Radio 3 has run a series of 10-minute meditations about
1968's iconic songs. And several 1960s plays have been making return
appearances: such as Billy Liar at the National this winter, Total Eclipse
at Greenwich last month, and now Peter Nichols's A Day in the Death of Joe
Egg (1967) at the King's Head. The last two (so dissimilar) have both been
excellently directed by Lisa Forrell.
A Day in the Death is the bitterly funny story of a family triangle.
Severely handicapped 10-year-old child; young parents Sheila and Brian. At
regular intervals, both parents are doting parents to the 'vegetable'
Josephine, keeping up conversation to her, for her, about her, as if she
followed their every word. So it is the more appalling when (repeatedly)
they focus on themselves, often talking as if she could never understand.
Brian - very Billy Liar - keeps switching out of his home life's emotional
claustrophobia into black fantasy humour.
What makes Nichols's play so striking is its daring and fluent construction
 -with characters coming forth to confide in us as if we were neighbours. As
Sheila winds up a monologue addressed to the audience, Brian enters and says
'What are you telling them?' - as if she had been sneaking.
Clive Owen is a wonderful Brian - ironic, expansive, urgent, sexy, cynical.
Though it looks unlikely that Elizabeth Garvie's tight-lipped Sheila has
enjoyed many previous lovers (as stated), she has a real talent for nervous
tension, both for comic and poignant ends. Katey Crawford Kastin
(Josephine), John Warnaby, Gabrielle Cowburn (friends) and Pauline Delany
(mother-in-law) keep the level high throughout.
Never in a million years could I have imagined that the story of Phaedra and
Hippolytus would be told as a will-the-show-go-on musical about a
Trinidadian steel band. (Phaedra sins not only by seducing her stepson but,
worse, in keeping him from rehearsals.) Never in a million years did I
expect to see Phaedra and Hippolytus aboard the Harley Davidson motorbike
she has just given him, with him saying (to her as much as the bike) 'I'm
going to ride you hard to Hell', while (get this) the pan-beaters of his
band play Act IV of Swan Lake. Oh yes. But you know what? The show is a hit.
Not, however, a hard-hitting hit. 'Pan', as we initiates have just learnt to
call steel band music, is hardly the kind of music to help a tragedy along.
Pan is sensuous stuff, buoyant and lotus-eating. (It's the main reason the
audience has a good time.) And the story, as told here, is paced like a
comedy about illicit love that (cf. Carmen) gets drastically out of hand.
Theseus, now a rich businessman, returns to his native Trinidad with his
white American wife Phaedra. Neglected by him, she finds his black son
Hypolite (sic) an easy lay.
The play is not interested in the erotic affliction that makes Phaedra a
tragic heroine. Here she is mere interloper. The Pan Beaters, directed by
Felix Cross, is about Trinidad and its black menfolk. Theseus has forsaken
the culture of his roots for self-advancement, he has lost touch with both
Hippolytus and himself, and now he pays the price.
As black drama, there is no special power or depth here. But the re-telling
of the old story keeps up a certain suspense. And - apart from Joanna
McCallum's blousy Phaedra, heaving an American accent like a boulder - its
performers are always lively and cute.
A Day in the Death of Joe Egg at the King's Head Islington until July 10;
The Pan Beaters at the Greenwich Theatre until July 17

With so many people these days calling themselves 'consultants' it is
interesting to be able to watch one who manages to charge Pounds 4,000 a
day. Business Matters considers the service offered by Michael
Hartley-Brewer, a negotiation consultant who trains executives such as those
in the Irish division of the computer company Hewlett Packard (7.30 BBC2).
Mavis Nicholson presents the first of eight programmes called Moment Of
Crisis (8.00 C4). The first subject is Annie Maguire who, in 1976, was sent
to prison for allegedly playing a part in the Guildford pub bombing. It took
nine years and four months for her conviction to be quashed. Her daughter
Annemarie was nine when Mrs Maguire was imprisoned. The two women talk about
the effect it still has on their lives. ITV begins a three-part crime drama
set in Wales: Telltale (9.00). The over-used Bernard Hill plays a detective
who becomes involved with a supergrass. True Stories (9.35 C4) investigates
the sort of animals on sale in Moscow's Bird Market. Under The Sun (9.35
BBC2) looks at'fraternal polyandry' in Nepal.

FT  10 JUN 93 / People: Nomura raids CSFB to upgrade treasury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nomura International is upgrading its treasury operations in Europe by
creating a separate division and hiring Nicholas Alicabiotis from CSFB as
managing-director to run it from the beginning of next month. Hence there
are now five divisions, with investment banking being the only area run by a
Japanese executive.
Greek-born Alicabiotis, 41, was executive director in charge of funding
CSFB's European businesses, with previous experience at both Citibank and
Bank of America.
Rival market participants give him high marks for his performance at CSFB,
where he has been since 1990, pointing out that funding an investment bank
is a very considerably greater challenge than funding a UK clearing bank.
Nomura set up its treasury operation when it first gained a banking license
in 1986, a move which enabled the securities house to gain crucial
experience at a time when it could not operate as a bank in Japan.
Market observers surmise that the collapse in the Tokyo stock market,
combined with the Japanese preference for measured growth, means that the
group had perhaps taken its eye off the treasury function for a while.
'This time I think they will go for it,' was the comment of one UK clearing
banker, although a Nomura spokesman said that plans were solely to optimise
the operation's cost of funds, rather than selling treasury services to
clients, at least at this stage.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Technology: A quick-fix telecoms solution - DHL is using
microwave frequencies in Moscow to bypass the city's overloaded exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many western companies operating in Moscow have reason to be grateful to
the KGB. But when the courier firm DHL set up its new Moscow telephone link
this month, it marked not only an innovation in Russian telephone
technology, but also a considerable coup in terms of post-cold war
co-operation.
What makes DHL's telephone system unusual - and the co-operation of the KGB
necessary - is its use of microwave technology.
A radio transmission system popular in military communications, microwaves
have been used in telephone systems since the end of the 1980s, either to
circumvent existing cable or copper networks, or to provide extensions to
them.
But though now commonplace in the west, they have been slow to appear in
eastern Europe, where microwave frequencies have been controlled by the
local military and the emerging western-style telecommunications
infrastructure has focused on satellite, cellular radio and fibre-optic
systems.
'This is the first time microwave has been used in Russia,' says Kevin
Edmond, director of Hermes telecommunications company which installed the
link.
Hermes hopes microwave will provide a viable telecommunications alternative
for other businesses in eastern Europe.
Judging from DHL's story, the system does seem to have some advantages of
speed and flexibility, particularly for smaller businesses which want to use
satellite services.
In common with many companies operating in eastern Europe, DHL had arrived
in Moscow to find a familiar saga of telecommunication woes.
Although it had originally asked the local telephone authorities to supply
30 lines on one number, it had received five lines, each on different
numbers - resulting in engaged telephones and frustrated customers.
Since the local exchange was already heavily overloaded, there was little
hope of gaining any extra lines through the local system.
'There is such a shortage, they said they could only give us new lines when
another user died,' explains Steve Csikai, DHL's IT manager.
Since establishing its own satellite link would have been extremely
expensive, DHL began to explore ways of using those run by Comstar, a joint
venture between the British company GPT and Moscow Telecommunications
Network (MGTS), through the existing UK-built System X exchange in Moscow.
But because DHL's offices were located 38km from the exchange, linking into
this presented a problem - either they would have to use the local network,
which would place them at the mercy of the Russian telephone system again,
or lay a new fibre-optic cable which would be a lengthy process.
'Putting wires across Moscow means digging up roads, which all takes a lot
of time - in our case at least six months,' says Csikai. At that point,
Hermes suggested a microwave link, which was potentially quicker and
cheaper, representing a total investment of around Dollars 150,000 (Pounds
97,400).
Establishing the link required extensive negotiation with the local security
services and considerable engineering innovation. To ensure a clear
transmission path between DHL's low-lying offices and the Comstar exchange,
an antenna had to be suspended from a nearby tower block, surrounded by
metal cages and locked steel doors to guard against theft.
But a month after the operation started DHL received the 40 new lines,
offering international phone calls at a cost ranging from Dollars 1 to
Dollars 5 a minute.
As other telecommunications operators point out, the system still has
drawbacks, especially for larger businesses.
Compared with optical fibre, microwave's capacity is relatively limited  -
the DHL link, for example, carries 4 channels of 2 megabits - or the
potential equivalent of 120 lines. The optical fibre cables being laid by
Comstar carry 32 optical fibres, each carrying 34 megabits, soon to be
upgraded to 155 megabits, representing the potential for thousands of lines.
Another problem lies in transmission. Because laser-thin signals are beamed
between stations which have to be in line of sight, the receivers cannot be
more than a horizon apart - usually about 40km.
Although this distance can be extended by relay stations, transmission can
be affected by obstructions - severe weather conditions for example, can
cause delays - and if any new buildings are constructed in the pathway, the
signal must be re-routed.
'Microwave is a quick-fix solution,' says Ken Norman, project director of
Comstar, who insists that the real future for telecommunications in Russia
lies with optical fibre systems. Comstar, for example, has already laid
1,060km of optical fibre cable across Moscow.
Nevertheless, DHL insists that as far as its own telecommunications needs
are concerned, the link is effective. Furthermore, for a courier company
which relies on advertising a well-known number, the system has one big
advantage - if it moves premises, it will be able to take its telephone
number without needing to lay more cable.
'In the end our customers don't care what the 'phone system is, just so long
as they just can rely on getting through,' says Csikai.

FT  10 JUN 93 / People: Henderson Crosthwaite boost for oil coverage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Henderson Crosthwaite Institutional Brokers is sticking to its strategy of
building a research boutique by hiring Tony Mackintosh to boost coverage of
the oil and gas sector.
Mackintosh's heyday was in the late 1970's and early 1980's at Wood
Mackenzie when he was judged the best in his sector for nine years. He
admits that a long time has elapsed since he was a specialist; he
subsequently went on to run the research team at Wood Mackenzie, then became
a corporate finance director at Hill Samuel before moving, for just nine
months, to CL Laing and Cruickshank as head of research and marketing, at
which point he disappeared from the City.
Since then, he has 'been getting fit after a serious back operation, and
being a house husband' while his wife takes an arts degree. Now that she is
ready to graduate, 49-year-old Mackintosh is returning to the City, though
with 'no grand title' as he feels his way.
He joins Charles Hue Williams, a main board HCIB director, who left
Kleinwort Benson in 1990 when a bought deal for Premier Consolidated went
badly wrong, but who retains a prominent profile in the oil sector.
Is there not a danger that the preference at HCIB, which prides itself on
its old style partnerhsip feel, for hiring mature and experienced analysts
is confused with a readiness to employ a string of 'has-beens'? 'You always
had to have a thick skin in the City' Hue Williams riposts, whilst
acknowledging there is hard work ahead before the team builds a reputation
for being 'the sort of commentators the institutions cannot afford to miss
out.'

FT  10 JUN 93 / People: Hollidge to head venture capitalists
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment yesterday of Ron Hollidge, managing- director of the venture
capital arm of Lloyds Bank, as chairman of the British Venture Capital
Association, represents a break with tradition.
Hollidge, 49, is the first head of a bank-owned venture capital company, to
lead the association. The previous 10 chairmen, going back to the founding
of the organisation in 1983, were all in charge of 'independent' funds,
owned by their managers.
Hollidge spent 20 years in retail banking at Lloyds before becoming head in
1984 of Lloyds Development Capital (LDC).
LDC has recently been reported to have pulled back from active investment
but Hollidge says this was an impression created by a decision to back out
of one particular investment and he is currently investing about Pounds 15m
a year in a dozen or so deals.
Hollidge's deputy and automatic future chairman is Brian Larcombe, 39,
finance and planning director at 3i, Britain's largest venture capital
group. Larcombe's appointment is intriguing because 3i, grandfather of the
UK venture capital industry, has traditionally had an uneasy relationship
with the rest of the industry. Rivals detected a sensitivity at 3i to the
challenge they presented to its previous dominance.
A year or so ago the appointment of the Hollidge and Larcombe might have
been seen as a symbol of the waning power of the independents. Many expected
their dependence on raising outside funds to finance investments would make
them particularly vulnerable to swings in investor moods.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Technology: Flying higher and further - Victoria Griffith
reports on a replacement for Concorde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unveiling of the supersonic Franco-British Concorde two decades ago
mortified many in the US aerospace industry.
Although Concorde enjoyed limited commercial success - only a handful are in
operation today - the sleek aeroplane gave the European industry a
tremendous technological base to build upon, and served as a very visible
reminder of the technological competition from the other side of the
Atlantic. The US aerospace industry is determined that it will not be left
on the ground when the next generation of supersonic craft is launched.
At one time, the country had its own supersonic transport programme. But
this ended in 1971, when the US Congress cut off funds for the SST project -
with environmental arguments playing a strong role - after a contract had
been awarded to Boeing.
However, the launch date for the next generation of aircraft built to fly
faster than sound may not be far away. A joint government and private sector
research project in the US - officially known as the High-Speed Research
Programme - has made a significant amount of progress in supersonic design
and is expected to have a product ready for the market in the early part of
the next decade.
If everything turns out as the US aerospace industry plans, the new
aeroplane should represent a substantial improvement on Concorde. The
desired aircraft would probably not fly much faster, but it would be a lot
kinder to the environment. Among the project's goals are a 90 per cent
reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions and much lower noise levels.
According to its architects, the new aeroplane would also be cheaper than
Concorde, would offer much more passenger space and would be able to travel
far greater distances. Whereas Concorde can only be used for medium hauls,
the new supersonic aircraft would be able to travel from Tokyo to Los
Angeles in only four hours, compared with 10 hours today.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), which runs the
supersonic research project, foresees a large market for the new aeroplane.
According to the agency, as many as 2,000 new supersonic craft may be in use
by 2015, generating sales of at least Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.32bn) for the US
sector.
The research project receives financial and personnel support from aerospace
manufacturers McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, as well as from General Electric
and Pratt &amp; Whitney, which participate in engine development. Established
three years ago, the programme is about to move into its second phase, which
will require the testing of large models in flight simulators.
Much research has focused on new materials to help designers achieve the
desired results. High-speed flights generate a great deal more heat than
that produced by ordinary subsonic craft, for instance.
Part of the project's research concentrates on the use of ceramic matrix
composites and other new materials which can withstand extremely high
temperatures.
'The engine will have to stand temperatures 1,000'F (550'C) higher than the
engine in a normal aircraft,' says Richard Hines, programme manager at Pratt
&amp; Whitney. High-temperature resistance - not only within the engine, but
within the airframe as well - will be essential if the new aircraft is able
to travel the long distances hoped for.
The programme is also working on new materials to increase the temperature
tolerance of the airframe to 175'C. Another priority is the development of a
low-emission engine. The project hopes to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by
90 per cent, in a bid to cut ozone depletion.
The key to this, according to Nasa, is to burn the fuel in a way that avoids
excessive flame temperatures, which produce the offending gas at a high
rate. One possibility is to cool the engine by mixing fuel vapour with air
upstream of the burning zone.
Much of the research into emissions and heat resistance feeds into another
key element of the programme - reducing the high sound levels of supersonic
air transportation. Anyone who has been visually impressed by Concorde in
flight knows the technology's downside - the extremely high noise levels.
The new materials with which Nasa has been experimenting should produce an
aircraft up to 50 per cent lighter, according to Louis Williams, director of
the High-Speed Research Division at NASA. The lower the weight, the less the
drag on the aeroplane and the lower the sound level.
Researchers are also focusing on noise at take-off. The faster the aircraft
reaches high altitudes, the less annoyance it will give to people on the
ground. One possibility is an engine that has a lower jet velocity at
take-off than it does in flight.
Another solution to the noise problem may come from new exhaust nozzle
technology.
'The less thrust we have on take-off, the lower the noise,' says Bruce
Bunin, programme manager at McDonnell Douglas. To reduce the thrust, the new
engine may take in slower-moving air from the outside and mix it with the
high-velocity air of the engine. Without substantial progress on the
environmental front - both in terms of noise levels and emissions - the Nasa
programme may have a short life.
'We're not even going to touch this in the final development stage unless
we're sure it's environmentally sensitive,' says Samuel Gilkey, programme
manager at General Electric. 'If we're restricted from flying into certain
airports for environmental reasons, as happened with the Concorde, we just
won't have a big enough market to make it worthwhile.'
Even if the research yields a relatively low-noise aeroplane, noise
pollution worries make it unlikely that supersonic flights will occur over
land. Still, an easy-listening sonic boom would encourage more airports to
open their runways to over-the-ocean arrivals and take-offs. That and the
added improvements in increased space, price, and lower emissions could make
the final product extremely desirable.

Pat Retief, chairman of Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, and
Minorco director Peter Burnell, have been appointed non-executive directors
of Johnson Matthey, the world's leading platinum refiner.
The appointments, which follow the recent restructuring of the ownership of
JM, underlines the increasingly close relations between South Africa's Anglo
American Corporation and JM. Anglo owns 39.8 per cent of JCI, another South
African mining finance house, and 39.1 per cent of Minorco.
Retief is a non-executive director of Anglo and Burnell, who joined the
Minorco board last year, spent nine years as managing director of Anglo's
South American operations.
JM and JCI have links that go back to the last century and platinum metals
are the key to both companies' businesses. At the end of last year JM signed
an extension of its marketing agreement with the JCI-controlled Rustenburg
Platinum Mines. the world's biggest platinum producer.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Accountancy Column: Game set matched for audit negligence -
Andrew Jack reports on a mock trial which provides important training for
observers and participants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Garth Tweedale, looking haggard and alone, leaned against the wall for
comfort and lit another cigarette. It was his third in succession during the
short morning break, before he had to head back into court for
cross-examination. He was looking forward to the end of his ordeal at
lunchtime.
His job was to justify his expert's report, which was a damning indictment
of the work of accountants Bowles, Marsh and Wegerle in failing to pick up
evidence of fraud at one of its audit clients, Low Ball.
Bowles had failed to detect fraud during its audit of Low Ball's Italian
subsidiary, which was conducted under tight time and budget pressures
imposed by the firm's Atlanta office - tempting more than one observer to
wonder whether the names of the client and the accountant might just as well
have been reversed.
But it was a rather unorthodox court to which Mr Tweedale returned. While in
many civil cases the stacks of paperwork easily out-number the people, this
room was full. There was a strictly obeyed timetable, which pushed the
entire case through in a single day. The verdict was determined by a show of
hands. There was even tea and coffee on tap just behind a partition at the
back.
In fact, this was a mock trial, held at the Law Society's offices in London
last week, located very near to the real law courts but at a safe enough
distance to allow for a little more experimentation and error.
Mr Michel Kallipetis, QC, played the judge, and two more junior barristers
from 2 Crown Office Row were the counsel for plaintiff and defendant. Mr
Garth Tweedale and Mr Francis Small, both from Ernst &amp; Young, played the
expert witnesses on the two sides.
Most of the other names of individuals and companies mentioned during the
day were fictitious: Bowles' audit partner was Dave Fendant, Low Ball's
finance director was Brad Boondoggle and Globio, the company's Italian
subsidiary, was headed by Giovanni Mafioso.
But there was a serious point behind the game. The problem is that audit
negligence cases rarely get as far as court, settling - normally without
publicity, details or admission of guilt - on the steps or before. That
might be cheaper and less time-consuming for all those involved, but it also
causes problems.
Certainly, it means there is little case law or precedent to guide others on
accounting and auditing issues in the future. But there is also an
intriguing logistical snag: it is difficult for expert witnesses and their
forensic teams from accountancy firms to gain experience of the ultimate
scrutiny of barristers and judge.
Mr Robert Hughes, head of Ernst &amp; Young's litigation support unit, explains
that the mock trial provides important training - both for observers and
participants. It is also a rare chance for lawyers to see members of his
department - not to mention barristers - working under court conditions, so
they can assess whether they would hire them on a real case.
As a result, the 40-strong audience was divided between accountants in
training and solicitors at least partly talent-searching. All no doubt also
took a little sadistic satisfaction in watching the unfolding events.
The day was the culmination of several weeks' work to exchange writs,
statements of claim and experts' reports compiled from specially prepared
material. The morning was set aside for cross-examination of the plaintiff's
expert witness, and the afternoon for that of the defendant.
Those watching had to flick frequently back and forth through several inches
of documents, following a rambling flow as different documents and
assertions were compared.
Several previous trial runs of the case in the past had allowed for careful
tweaking to try to ensure that the material was balanced and did not
automatically point to a victory for one side or the other. The skill of the
experts' reports and the barristers was vital.
It was a case riddled with nuances: Bowles used an Italian associate firm
and - to save costs - able but very junior staff. There were difficulties
over language and differing national auditing and accounting standards. What
distinction should be drawn between a review and a full audit from London?
Were there enough signs of fraud at the time or was the criticism only
justified with the benefit of hindsight?
But aside from the facts, the fickle psychology of the courtroom was
stressed by Mr Kallipetis. 'Regardless of the strength of the evidence, the
mood can suddenly change and the case turn to shreds in your hands,' he
said. 'It may be unjust but it is human nature.'
Indeed, he lamented the growing trend for exchange of witness statements in
advance, which has cut down on the level of examination which takes place in
court.
Kallipetis would take over the cross-examination from time to time, picking
up on a point that had not been satisfactorily answered and which showed the
expert's report or views in a bad light.
He would tenaciously persist as the expert squirmed with a 'yes, but' or 'on
the whole, perhaps' response while growing increasingly frustrated as the
question was honed more precisely until Kallipetis got his very simple if
unfair 'no', at which point he would abruptly stop the examination with a
curt 'thank you' (case destroyed).
He would also personalise everything, demanding the expert to speculate when
it suited, but rejecting speculation in the report or in answers when it did
not. Tweedale argued that failure from the Italian associate auditors to
meet deadlines should have raised concerns from the British firm. 'Have you
ever been late on a deadline? Does that make you incompetent?' probed
Kallipetis.
Tweedale suggested concerns over quality because of the low audit fee. 'If
my learned friend did this case for nothing would you question the adequacy
of his work?' Kallipetis asked mischievously. 'And I might be tempted to ask
about your fee, Mr Tweedale]'
Afterwards, Tweedale said one of the most important lessons for him was
remembering to study the statement of claim on the legal action rather than
simply the experts' report.
Another, related, point was the importance of ensuring that every single
assertion could be justified individually, rather than simply the impression
given by a series of factors which overall suggested negligence or cause for
concern.
One point which also emerged was the difficulty in building a case around
current auditing guidelines, to which both expert witnesses frequently
referred in their reports. 'I suggest you are being selective in your use of
the guidelines,' said one barrister. 'They really say 'how long is a piece
of string', don't they?'
Kallipetis had a final word for prospective expert witnesses. 'Try not to be
partisan,' he said. 'It is a very difficult line. There are times you wake
up at night and think 'did I do the right thing?' Just ask yourself 'what
would I have done, what would a competent accountant have done?''
And the verdict? At least among a democratic consensus from lawyers and
accountants, it was bad news for Bowles the auditor.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Merchandising
monster on the rampage - Louise Kehoe on the set of a big Hollywood gamble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'AND then there is the merchandising. The picture books, T-shirts, video
games, caps, stuffed toys, comic books, and pets. . .The zoo is the
centrepiece of an enormous enterprise' - Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton.
Even by Hollywood standards, the hoo-ha surrounding 'Jurassic Park' is
mammoth. The new MCA/Universal dinosaur film, directed by Steven Spielberg
and based upon Crichton's best-selling novel, is at the centre of a
publicity blitz fuelled by the entertainment industry's biggest licensing
and merchandising programme to date.
In common with Crichton's fictional zoo in which cloned dinosaurs run amok,
the film of Jurassic Park has become the centrepiece of an enormous
enterprise involving more than 100 companies licensed to sell over 1,000
products carrying the film's distinctive emblem: a dinosaur skull
silhouetted against a blood-red sky. Advertising for Jurassic products is
expected to top Dollars 65m this year.
With Jurassic Park opening at thousands of US cinemas tomorrow, stores are
already loaded with everything from pyjamas and boxer shorts to video games,
sweets and toys, trading cards, stickers, board games and puzzles, baseball
caps and, inevitably, breakfast cereal.
Ferrara Pan Candy expects to sell Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.8m) to Dollars 40m
of fruit gum dinosaurs, dinosaur fruit snacks and jellies. Then there are
stuffed animals from Dakin - a 30-inch brachiosaurus, smaller spitters,
raptors and triceratops.
Winterland Productions of San Francisco will turn out 30 to 40 different
T-shirt designs based on scenes from the film.
'We will take dinosaur mania to a new level,' gushes Linda Berkeley, senior
vice-president of development and head of merchandising for MCA/Universal.
'All the enthusiasm, all the excitement has been building. We have such a
comprehensive programme in play. Jurassic Park merchandising will far exceed
that of any other movie.'
With MCA aiming to break the record of Dollars 1bn in retail sales set by
Batman, merchandising revenue could also dwarf box office returns. Jurassic
Park is expected to be the most expensive movie of the year, with production
costs of Dollars 60m and costs of film prints and promotion estimated at
more than Dollars 40m.
For all the hype, however, there is bound to be apprehension with so much
money at stake. However, as Marisa Carcio of the Toy Manufacturers of
America, an industry trade group, points out, 'the success of the
merchandising programme all depends on how well the movie is received. We
are all anxious to see the public reaction.'
US toy makers have profited enormously in the past from tie-ins to movies
such as Star Wars, but there have also been disappointments such as Dick
Tracy and Hook.
Jurassic Park merchandisers also face a significant challenge in
differentiating their products from the wide range of dinosaur-related
paraphernalia already on the market, and with which they may have to share
shelf space in some stores.
Another uncertainty is the appeal of toys, sweets and clothing aimed at
young children that carry the logo of a film many will not see. Jurassic
Park has received a 'PG13' rating in the US, meaning that children under the
age of 13 must be accompanied by an adult. The film's makers acknowledge
that its 'intensity' may be frightening for children aged under about nine
or 10.
Yet as Carcio points out, even R-rated (for adults only) movies such as
Terminator 2 can spawn successful toy products, while there are plenty of
Jurassic Park products for older children. Sega of America is planning
hand-held and TV video games and Nintendo fans will be offered dino-games by
Ocean of America.
McDonald's is selling 'dino-sized' meals: a triple cheeseburger, extra large
portion of fries and a 32-ounce drink served in a Jurassic Park collector's
cup; its restaurants have been designated 'Jurassic Park visitor's centres'.
Advance ticket sales suggest that Jurassic Park will be the hit movie of the
summer. Already, cinemas are scheduling extra showings to accommodate
demand. What cannot be predicted is just how long the movie will pull the
crowds.
MCA is already planning follow-on products including a TV series and a theme
park attraction that could cost more than the movie itself. Nobody is yet
talking about Jurassic Park II, but who knows? The original dinosaurs roamed
the earth for millions of years. Spielberg's creations may well have enough
life in them for a sequel.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): When the bubbles go
flat - France's champagne houses have been forced to reduce prices in an
attempt to maintain sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The streets of Epernay in eastern France were last week filled with angry
champagne workers protesting against proposed job losses at some of France's
finest champagne houses.
The redundancies are the culmination of three intensely difficult years
which have seen the champagne industry hit by falling sales, rising raw
material prices and, since September, by the impact of the strong franc on
exports. Stocks have risen to record levels. Some small companies have
serious cashflow problems.
The champagne houses now face the challenge of trying to regenerate sales
without jeopardising the exclusive image of their product.
To some degree the industry's difficulties are a hangover of its success in
the 1980s. Champagne sales soared from 147m bottles in 1982 to 249m in 1989.
The price of champagne, and of the grapes used to make it, rose accordingly.
The grape price peaked in 1990 (at FFr32.00 per kilo against FFr19.00 in
1982) the same year that sales started to decline.
The producers retaliated by raising their prices just as they had in the
1980s. But the market could no longer absorb the increases. Champagne sales
fell to 232m bottles in 1990 and fell again as the recession deepened to
214m in 1991 and 1992.
The conventional marketing response to such a decline in demand would be to
try to boost sales through advertising.
LVMH tried this last Christmas by running a campaign in France for Moet, its
flagship brand. Taittinger also advertised in France. But these campaigns
failed to stop the decline in sales as the industry's problems are too
complex for advertising to offer more than a partial solution.
Although the market appeared to stabilise last year, the total of 214m
bottles disguises a rapid rise in sales of low-quality petits champagnes
dumped by smaller cash-strapped producers and which retail for as little as
FFr35.00 (Pounds 4.20) a bottle in France.
These petits champagnes have not only eroded the position of higher-quality
brands, but also imposed intense pressure on prices and profitability across
the market.
Some large houses have retaliated by launching their own petits champagnes.
Taittinger last year re-introduced Irroy, a product that dates back to the
1860s but has been 'remaindered' for many years. Irroy now sells for 25 per
cent less than the Taittinger brand. The relaunch has been so successful
that Taittinger has developed a new, cheap champagne, Saint-Evremond, which
reaches the shops this month.
'There have always been secondary champagnes, just as there are second and
third pressings of Bordeaux,' said Philippe Court, chief executive of
Taittinger. 'The secondary brands come out at certain times and then
disappear. We decided the time was right to bring them out again.'
But the industry's chief response to the crisis has been to cut prices. In
past recessions the champagne producers have been able to avoid this because
they could shelter behind high inflation.
The current downturn, however, has taken place at a time of low inflation in
most leading champagne markets. The leading houses have this time held
prices for as long as possible, for fear that discounting lower prices would
intensify the pressure on their profits and, in the long term, jeopardise
their product's prestigious reputation.
Some of the grandest houses, notably Bollinger, have held prices. 'Bollinger
is at the very top of the market,' says Christian Bizot, chairman. 'We would
never do anything that might devalue it.' Others have bowed to market
pressure.
'Taittinger has reduced prices along with most of the other houses,' says
Court. 'We might not like it, but we had no choice.'
Even price cutting has been problematic. The franc's strength against the
UK, Spanish and Italian currencies since last autumn's ERM crisis has not
only depressed the repatriated profits from the champagne sold in those
countries, but raised the risk of parallel imports coming into France and
Germany, where currencies are stronger.
LVMH, after struggling for months to maintain prices, announced in February
it was 'temporarily' cutting the wholesale price of Moet and Mercier by 10
per cent in France, Germany and Switzerland. However it was also forced to
raise the price of those brands by 5 per cent in the UK, Italy and Spain to
prevent parallel imports.
These changes are now filtering through to the shops. LVMH says it is still
too soon to assess their effect on sales. But the group faces the additional
problem of how its retail customers will react to reductions in wholesale
pricing. LVMH might finish in the unenviable position of having reduced its
margins through price cutting, without deriving any benefit from higher
sales.
That said, there are some positive signs for the industry. The petits
champagnes may have depressed prices, but the availability of so much cheap
product has at least prevented sparkling wines from taking market share from
champagne.
Meanwhile, sales are starting to improve in the US, as the economy emerges
from recession. This augurs well, not only for that market, but also for
champagne's prospects in other countries as their economic problems ease.
'It's important to remember that the level of champagne sales last year, at
214m bottles, was significantly higher than the last low of 147m in 1982,'
says Sylvain Massot, European drinks analyst at Morgan Stanley. 'This
suggests that champagne's success in the 1980s wasn't a temporary phenomenon
and that the product has substantial underlying strengths.'
Some champagne houses are less optimistic. One issue is that the continuing
trend towards low inflation poses serious problems for pricing in the
future. They also fear that the proliferation of petits champagnes could
cause long-term damage to the industry's image.
Bollinger is mooting plans for the grand houses to lobby for greater
differentiation (in terms of labelling and product classification) between
grands champagnes and cheap bubbly.
'It's ridiculous to expect Bollinger to carry the same name as something
selling for FFr36.00,' says Bizot.
'A grand champagne is recognised as one of the world's great products and,
whatever happens, we must make sure that it stays that way.'

FT  10 JUN 93 / Inquiry calls for power-sharing system in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDEPENDENT com-mission of inquiry into Northern Ireland yesterday urged
the government to replace direct rule by a system of power sharing and to
open 'informal channels of communication' with Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the IRA.
The recommendations form part of a 400-page report prepared by the
commission, which is chaired by Professor Torkel Opsahl, an international
human rights lawyer and United Nations adviser. Other commissioners include
Mr Eamonn Gallagher, the former EC director-general of fisheries, and Lady
Faulkener of Downpatrick, a former BBC governor for Northern Ireland whose
husband, Brian, was the last Stormont prime minister.
The report recommends that a 'government of Northern Ireland should be put
in place, based on the principle that each community has an equal voice in
making and executing the laws or a veto on their execution, and equally
shares administrative authority'.
But the proposal received a cool response from both sides of Ulster's
political divide. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline
Democratic Unionist Party, which has boycotted the inquiry, described power
sharing as a 'blueprint for the destruction of the union'. Sinn Fein said
the report was 'ambiguous'.
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic Labour
Party, said he wanted time to study the report in depth.
The commission has avoided elaborating the precise form power sharing should
take. The report says, however, that new legislation should be brought in to
reinforce the rights of the minority Roman Catholic community.
Prof Opsahl said the commission had wanted to avoid being seen to usurp the
role of government or local politicians. Rather, it had set out to act as a
channel for the views of ordinary citizens whose voices might not otherwise
be heard.
'The publication of the report is perhaps the end of the beginning but we
expect the discussion to go on.' he said.
In its proposals on future government the commission rejects the conflicting
positions taken by some local politicians - the unification in the short
term of Ulster and the Irish Republic or the alternative of a full
integration of the province into the United Kingdom.
But the report is as critical of the government as of Ulster's political
leadership in contributing to what it dubs a 'democratic deficit' in
Northern Ireland. 'The British government's insistence that it is an honest
broker, and that the ingredients of a settlement must be worked out between
the two communities (Roman Catholic and Protestant) adds to the recipe for
conflict.'
The commission says that it found wide agreement among those giving oral
evidence that a settlement excluding Sinn Fein would be 'neither lasting nor
stable'.
It insists that Sinn Fein should renounce violence before being allowed into
full political talks, although it sees informal contacts with government as
a useful way of exploring the prospects for an IRA ceasefire. The
commissioners also want the government to lift its broadcasting ban on Sinn
Fein.
Among the other key recommendations in the report are the reform of the
local police force and the strengthening of human rights with the enactment
of a bill of rights.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Group 4 concerned about London contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH COMPLICATIONS over the legal rights of public employees transferring
to the private sector may arise when the government puts London's prison
escort services out to tender soon.
Group 4 - the private security company which is seeking the contract and has
been shortlisted to manage Strangeways prison, Manchester - might withdraw
from the bidding if it is forced to operate on public-sector rates.
In April Group 4 started operating Britain's first privately managed prison
escort service - in the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside  - using
newly recruited staff. It is a leading contender for the Pounds 25m-a-year
contract for escorting prisoners in the London area.
But Group 4 managers have written to the government pointing out that unlike
other police forces, the Metropolitan Police has its own dedicated team of
officers working exclusively on prison escort duties. Mr Jim Harrower, Group
4 chief executive, said yesterday the company was concerned that this might
mean the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
Regulations (Tupe) might apply. These guarantee public-sector employees
transferred to private companies maintenance of pay and conditions.
'If the London court escort service had to operate on police pay rates and
conditions it would radically alter our attitude to the contract,' said Mr
Harrower. 'We have expressed concern to the government.'
Group 4 has received formal notification from the Prison Service Agency that
it has been shortlisted from among seven bidders to manage the rebuilt
Strangeways.
It already manages Wolds remand prison, Humberside. 'But we do not want to
just be involved in prison management,' said Mr Harrower. 'Even though most
prisons will remain under public-sector management we want to become an
alternative prison authority, providing a complete range of training,
education and other services.'
He said the company would bid to run the new Doncaster prison, which will
follow Strangeways as the next candidate for market testing.
The Doncaster contract has particular attractions for Group 4, as it is in
the same region as Wolds and the company's current prison escort contract,
opening the possibility of one private-sector company providing all penal
services in an area.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Teachers oppose training proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday added fuel to his
confrontation with teachers' unions by announcing plans to allow
non-graduates to teach in primary schools.
The proposal, which is intended to take effect from September 1994, met with
a furious response from teachers and head teachers on the day that the
controversial national curriculum tests on Shakespeare for 14-year-olds were
widely boycotted.
One-year courses would be introduced for teaching children up to the age of
seven. These would be open to mature students without degrees, provided they
had experience of dealing with children, and had sufficient academic
qualifications to gain entry to higher education.
Mr Patten also intends to diversify entrance to the teaching profession with
a new three-year BEd course which would qualify students to teach all six
subjects of the national curriculum for primary schools.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers said he strongly opposed the move away from graduate entry.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said the union was considering a
boycott of the new training arrangements. He said: 'There's certainly no
requirement in our contracts to train people from scratch.'
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said:
'The government's plan is an attack on the all-graduate agreed by Margaret
Thatcher in 1974. Lady Thatcher must be turning in her ermine.'
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, described the plan as 'one of
the barmiest government schemes to date'.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Recession reduces regional divide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIAL CHANGES in the 1980s and the effects of the recession are challenging
traditional images of the UK's north-south divide, Regional Trends, the
annual government statistical publication, shows today.
Ms Alison Holding, associate editor, said this year's edition showed the
recession had proved 'quite a leveller'.
By the start of this year unemployment in the south-east, at 10.5 per cent,
was higher than in Scotland, Wales or the east Midlands.
Families in the south-east outside London are still most likely to own their
own homes - 75 per cent do so, compared with a national average of 68 per
cent - but other regions have caught up. Owner-occupation in the north grew
from 48 per cent to 61 per cent between 1981 and 1991.
The report shows a relatively even spread of professional and managerial
employment across the country.
While the south-east comes first with 8.1 per cent of its population being
professionals and another 30.7 per cent of its male working population in
managerial occupations, East Anglia and the south-west both have 6.5 per
cent professionals and about 27 per cent in managerial work.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Ifma attacks long-term contracts for directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTIONAL Fund Managers Association said yesterday that three years
was far too long for any board director's service contract under most
circumstances.
The trade body said the Postel pension fund's announcement that it would
vote against any director's rolling three-year contract 'does not go far
enough'. Mr Richard Weir, group's director-general, said: 'It is Ifma's
concerted view that we do not approve of long-term contracts.'
Ifma believes directors' contracts should be no longer than one year except
in unusual circumstances, such as where a newly recruited chief executive is
required to relocate or has been recruited with great difficulty.
Ifma's view is that in those circumstances a three-year contract is
appropriate only at the initial appointment, with future terms limited to
rolling one-year contracts.
Mr Alastair Ross-Goobey, chief executive of Postel, last week sent a
strongly worded letter to companies in which Postel has a significant
holding, telling them it opposes three-year rolling contracts.
The contracts are effectively renewed every year so that firing a director
costs the company the equivalent of three years' pay and benefits.
But while Postel said it intended to vote against the re-election of
directors on rolling contracts of more than a year, Ifma said it was up to
each of its individual board members to decide how to vote.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Factories fail 'world class' test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 2 per cent of British factories are 'world class', a study claimed
yesterday. But nearly 75 per cent of UK manufacturers believe that they can
match the best international standards, with some of the lowest-ranked
companies most confident of their ability to compete.
The study, by IBM Consulting Group, the consulting arm of the US computer
giant, examined 202 manufacturing sites across the UK. Plants were rated on
such criteria as lean production, quality, logistics and manufacturing
systems. Those scoring more than 80 per cent were defined as 'world class'.
The study found a further 42 per cent of plants had potential to attain
'world class' standards on the basis of their working practices and
performance. 'It is good to see we have a significant number of strong
contenders', IBM said.
The best-performing industry in world terms was found to be food
manufacturing. That is attributed to the buying power of the big food
retailers. The worst-performing industry in world terms was found to be auto
and aerospace components.
Professor Chris Voss of the London Business School, co-author of the study,
said he believed the proportion of world-class companies in the US or Japan
would be very much higher. No comparative data had yet been collected.
Companies in the south of England scored well above average. Those in the
north-east were weakest. The study suggests that is because the south has a
high concentration of electronics and electrical companies, which have more
sophisticated manufacturing practices. The north-east relies more on older
industries.
Suppliers to the information technology industry scored above average. 'It
has been typical in the IT industry to form very open partnerships with
suppliers and to invest in their success at the same time as making very
strong demands upon them', the study says.
Prof Voss said the poor performance of auto and aerospace suppliers, while
slightly surprising, was borne out by other recent studies. He said that
unlike the IT industry, the Japanese motor manufacturers had perhaps not
been operating long enough in the UK to have an effect on the supply chain.
Possession of the UK's coveted BS5750 quality standard made no difference
unless it was part of a wider quality programme.
There was a marked difference in business priorities between high-ranking
and low-ranking companies. The top 10 per cent of companies gave it as their
chief objective to be world class. The bottom 10 per cent preferred to
concentrate on customer service and market share.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Unions call for role in forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADE union movement made a plea yesterday for greater recognition of
the role it can play in developing a long-term strategy to boost industrial
competitiveness.
In evidence to the Commons trade and industry committee the Trades Union
Congress said that since the demise of the National Economic Development
Office last year there had been no national forum to discuss industrial
competitiveness. The TUC said: 'For the government to talk only to employers
is to narrow the focus of debate, and is more likely than not to lead to the
kind of corporatism they seek to avoid.'
Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the MSF technical union, told MPs that
'the most successful companies listen to their employees. But the Department
of Trade and Industry does not seem to want that information'.
The committee, investigating the competitiveness of UK manufacturing, also
heard evidence from the Engineering Employers' Federation.
Illustrating the degree of common ground between unions and employers on the
need for a long-term industrial strategy, Mr Neil Johnson, the federation's
director-general, said the government should take a 30-to-40-year view of
the direction of industry and technology.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Ban urged on sale of non-approved modems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRONICS manufacturers in the UK are urging the government to declare
illegal the sale of computer communications equipment that has not been
approved for connection to the public switched network.
They are angry that US and Asian companies are able to undercut their prices
by supplying equipment that has not been subjected to or passed the
extensive tests required by the BATB, the UK telecommun-ications equipment
watchdog.
It is not, at present, illegal to sell non-approved data communications
equipment although it is against the law to attach it to the public
telephone network.
An industry lobby, the Modem Approvals Group, has been established which
next Wednesday will launch a campaign at the Commons to spread awareness of
the need to establish a 'level playing field' for manufacturers prepared to
comply with the regulations.
Modems are pieces of electronic equipment which convert computer data into
signals which can be transmitted down a telephone line. They are an
essential component in the construction of computer networks which
represents one of the fastest growing areas of the information technology
business and a potential source of significant revenues to UK suppliers.
Mr Joe Korner, a marketing executive with the UK manufacturer Dataflex
Design which has been in the forefront of the campaign, said that 'grey'
importers could sell for about Pounds 100, a modem that Dataflex priced at
Pounds 199.
The modem market is worth some Dollars 310m in the UK at present, according
to the marketing consultancy Dataquest, equivalent to 340,000 units. Between
20 per cent and 40 per cent of the total is thought to be accounted for by
grey imports.
Members of the Modem Approvals Group include Dataflex, Cray
Communications,Racal, Motorola Codex, British Telecom and Psion Datacom.
The group has already brought the issue to the attention of the Department
of Trade and Industry and to Oftel.
Mr Barry Gilder, marketing director of Cray Communications, said there was a
question of safety but the real issue was establishing fair trading
conditions for manufacturers.

It should then set policy, preferably on a cross-party basis, to create a
framework in which normal market decisions can be made. 'This is not to
suggest a return to the days of picking winners and losers,' he said.
Mr Johnson welcomed the department's recent more positive attitude to the
manufacturing industry.
At a federation briefing on its own industrial strategy proposals, launched
six months ago, Mr Johnson praised prime minister Mr John Major's support
for manufacturing in a recent speech.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Minister digs in on terror insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday refused to back down from its plans to increase
premiums charged for terrorism insurance, in spite of protests from the
City, business organisations and insurers.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister for corporate affairs, said 'there was no
option' but to go ahead with the rate increases. Last month Pool Re, the
government-backed reinsurance company, announced rises that would come into
effect for all policies sold after July 1.
Owners of the largest properties in areas most vulnerable to terrorist
attack face increases of more than 300 per cent in premium rates. Mr Bernard
Harty, the chamberlain of the Corporation of London, which manages about a
third of properties in the City, said the increase would 'add to cost at a
time of recession'.
However, Mr Hamilton said that the insurance represented 'good value for
money'.
A building in central London valued at Pounds 100m would pay Pounds 144,000
for terrorism insurance, which he said was a relatively small amount
compared to rental and other costs. Businesses in some areas will benefit
from rate reductions, he added.
Insurers fear that the rate rises could persuade many businesses to run the
risk of not carrying insurance protection, and undermine the effectiveness
of the Pool Re scheme. This was agreed last year after insurers decided to
withdraw terrorism cover from standard commercial policies following
bombings in the City.
Matters have been complicated by the Bishopsgate bomb this year which
exhausted funds collected to date by Pool Re. Increasingly, business appears
to favour the addition of a compulsory levy to all insurance policies,
spreading terrorism cover costs more widely across the country.
Mr Harty said organisations attending a meeting at the Department of Trade
and Industry yesterday were looking into alternative schemes that they hoped
to present to Mr Hamilton before the end of the year.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Licence for sleeping pill revoked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HALCION, the controversial sleeping pill, yesterday had its licence revoked
by the UK licensing authority. The drug remains on the market in the US and
other countries.
While Halcion sales have been banned in Britain since October 1991, other
countries recently returned the drug to their markets following scientific
reviews. Upjohn, the US company which makes Halcion, had hoped the drug
would enjoy a similar reprieve in Britain.
Mr Ley Smith, Upjohn's president and chief operating officer, said the
company was 'outraged that the findings of two independent review bodies
have been ignored and that patients are being deprived of this treatment
option for short-term insomnia'.
Halcion was banned in the UK after Upjohn refused to withdraw it
voluntarily. The drug has faced international scrutiny since August 1991,
when, in the US, a Salt Lake City woman claimed she had killed her mother in
a Halcion-induced rage and sued the company. The case was settled out of
court.
In the US it remains on the market in smaller doses with stricter labelling
in the wake of the controversy, while a new generation of sleeping pills has
reduced reliance on Halcion. Although a Food and Drug Administration
advisory committee found the drug safe and effective when used as
recommended, FDA staff said Halcion patients suffered from higher rates of
anxiety and memory impairment.
Mr Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said the regulatory
discrepancy between the US and UK indicated a grey area in Halcion's safety.
He said: 'The FDA has chosen to let the marketplace take care of the
problem. One of the key reasons why the FDA kept the drug on the US market
was the active campaign to reduce the usage of Halcion.'
According to Upjohn the UK licensing authority ignored a report by the
appointed persons panel, a government-appointed committee of scientific and
legal experts, which concluded that Halcion should be available in the UK.
Upjohn said the medicines commission also recommended Halcion's return to
the UK market.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Access to Cyprus sought for SFO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is negotiating with the authorities in northern Cyprus in an
attempt to win access to the island for the Serious Fraud Office regarding
its investigation of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman and former head
of Polly Peck International.
It hopes the SFO will be able to gain informal access to information and
individuals in the region.
Formal diplomatic requests for co-operation with the authorities have
failed.
The discussions form continued pressure by the British authorities on the
self-proclaimed Turkish republic of northern Cyprus, under the threat of
trade or other sanctions.
Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO lawyer handling the Nadir case, last night returned
to London after three days of what the British Embassy in Ankara called
'constructive discussions' relating to Mr Nadir's abscondment. She met a
range of government officials including those in the Ministry of Justice.
Mr Colin Jennings, British deputy high commissioner for Cyprus, confirmed
yesterday that he had met Mr Rauf Denktash, the president of northern
Cyprus, and Mr Dervish Eroglu, the prime minister, on Monday.
He said British High Commission representatives had met officials in
northern Cyprus about six times since Mr Nadir jumped bail last month.
The renewed pressure comes in advance of a preparatory hearing in the High
Court to consider the case on June 15.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE High Court will today begin hearing a case brought by a 77-year-old
woman against the Law Society, the solicitors' professional body, which
could have important implications for all self-regulating organisations.
Miss Peggy Wood is suing the society for its alleged failure to investigate
properly her complaints against her former solicitors after she lost her
home and development land.
If she wins, the case could set a precedent by deciding that regulatory
bodies owe a duty of care to the public in investigating complaints and that
they must pay damages to those who suffer loss as a result of their failure
to uphold that duty.
The society admits it was wrong to dismiss her initial complaint but denies
that it owes a duty of care to anyone who loses because of its failure to
investigate properly.
On Tuesday the High Court ruled that Miss Wood, who had her legal aid
withdrawn last November and who lives on income support and so cannot afford
a barrister, could be assisted by a 'friend', Mr Ole Hanson, a solicitor and
journalist. Because Miss Wood is in poor health and partially deaf Mr Hanson
is to be allowed to address the court on her behalf. Normally 'friends' are
restricted to taking notes and giving advice.
The court ruled that because the case raised issues of public importance a
barrister should be briefed by the Official Solicitor as amicus curiae to
assist the court with the legal issues raised by her claim.
Miss Wood was also given permission to amend her claim against the society
to allege conspiracy to injure her cause by the leaking of confidential
legal aid information.
Her complaint against her former solicitors, Hubbard &amp; Co of Chichester,
West Sussex, dates back to 1973 when, left without any income, she consulted
Mrs Sylvia Hubbard about obtaining four loans totalling Pounds 10,000
secured against her home.
When she was unable to repay the loans the firm acted against her on behalf
of the lenders. The main lender, Mobile Homes, was 50 per cent owned by Mrs
Hubbard's husband, Joseph, then also a partner in the firm.
Miss Wood was evicted and her house sold leaving her with just Pounds 1,400
after all her debts had been paid. Following modernisation, the house and
another house built on the land were resold for almost Pounds 200,000.
Miss Wood complained to the society of conflict of interest and professional
misconduct by Hubbards. The society initially refused to investigate but
later issued a reprimand. In 1987 she accepted Pounds 2,500, which had been
paid into court, in settlement of her claim for negligence and breach of
duty against the firm.
The hearing is expected to last two weeks.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Export shake-up strategy unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORT promoters, strategic alliances, one-stop shops, a list of 80 priority
markets, and 'a strategic reappraisal of how government and the private
sector can work more closely together' are at the heart of the British
Overseas Trade Board's forward plan, David Dodwell writes.
The plan was presented yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary. Defining competitiveness as a matter of 'incremental excellence',
Mr Heseltine pointed to the 'comprehensive deregulation' at the Department
of Trade and Industry that was intended to provide 'the most competitive
climate within which industry can operate'.
The reorganisation involves civil servants taking direct responsibility for
export promotion to specific markets, and an eventual total of 100 'export
promoters' seconded from industry to link small and medium-size companies to
specific markets. The forward plan identifies western Europe, North America,
Japan and the Asia Pacific rim as top priority areas, along with
environmental goods and services.

FT  10 JUN 93 / South-west hit by defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENCE CUTS are having a more damaging impact on the south-west of England
than anywhere else in the UK and are likely to lead to a slower recovery
from the recession, says a survey of 331 companies in the region.
Half of the companies - representing nearly a third of the region's gross
domestic product - said they received some defence-related orders.
Twenty-eight per cent said that defence cuts had been significant in
limiting their performance.
The survey, published yesterday, was produced jointly by the Confederation
of British Industry south-western region, accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and
the University of the West of England.
In the defence supply chain, over a third of the businesses that supplied
goods and services to the defence industry said they needed aid for
investment and to develop new markets.
Mr Chris Curtis, the CBI's regional director, called for assistance from the
European regional development fund. 'The impact of defence cuts in the
south-west is akin to the effect on south Wales of the rundown of the coal
and steel industries,' he said.
Mr Chris Tillett, associate director of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'It came as
no surprise that defence cuts were a key concern to south-west business.
What is striking, though, was the spread and depth of exposure of south-west
firms, and the scale of the knock-on impact.'
Mr Derek Braddon, the university's research director in defence economics,
said the survey confirmed the worst fears about the scale of job losses and
economic shockwaves caused by defence cuts. Already, about 25,000 jobs in
the region had been lost in consequence. A forecast two years ago that
40,000 jobs would go by the end of the decade was probably now an
underestimate.
He said that if Devonport dockyard at Plymouth lost a pending
nuclear-submarine refitting contract to Rosyth in Scotland, it would be 'a
very big disaster' for the south-west.

FT  10 JUN 93 / MPs urge probe of VSEL dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLEGATIONS of insider trading in the shares of VSEL, the armaments and
submarine consortium, before it received the government's Pounds 160m
helicopter carrier contract were made yesterday by two Labour MPs.
Mr Nick Brown, MP for Newcastle East and Mr Stephen Byers, MP for Wallsend,
have written to the Stock Exchange demanding an investigation into share
dealings in the Cumbria-based company, and to the National Audit Office
which has already launched an inquiry into the bidding war over the
contract.
The inquiry by the NAO, the government's spending watchdog, will have to
decide, among other issues, how the consortium of VSEL and the Kvaerner
Govan merchant shipyard in Glasgow was able to undercut Swan Hunter, the
last shipbuilder in north east England, by Pounds 50m. Swans went into
receivership last month after failing to win the contract.
The MPs said yesterday that the sharp increase in the price of VSEL shares
between October, 1992 and last month, when the order was announced,
'strongly suggested some form of insider dealing,' and had 'all the
hallmarks of a stock market scandal'.
The letter to Mr Michael Feltham, head of the Stock Exchange surveillance
department, says that the 'extraordinary move' in VSEL shares during the
period suggested that 'someone may have had inside knowledge of the
government's real intention and, having had access to market sensitive
information, used it to purchase shares in VSEL prior to the public
announcement of the helicopter carrier order.'
They believe the government made the important decisions on the contract
last October and constructed the rest of the tender process in such a way
that Swan Hunter could not win.
Only a limited number of insiders would have had access to the information.
The Stock Exchange said yesterday it never commented on any inquiry into
dealings.

FT  10 JUN 93 / George warns against cut in interest rates:
Governor-designate highlights fears on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG though veiled warning against imminent cuts in interest rates was
delivered last night by Mr Eddie George, who will soon be governor of the
Bank of England.
Mr George, the current deputy governor who steps up to the top job next
month, said in a speech to business leaders in Cambridgeshire that
inflationary pressures were far from dead in spite of Britain's long
recession. While he cast doubt on the notion that further cuts in base rates
would stimulate any significant economic activity, he also signalled that
they might spark rising prices, which would hold back any sustainable
recovery.
Mr George's speech was set in the context of a long-term vision of how he
would like to control monetary policy, an area where the bank at present
advises the Treasury.
However, it was given special resonance by the revelation yesterday that Mr
Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, has secretly pushed the idea of giving
the bank independence to remove politicians from interest-rate judgments.
The governor-designate said there was a worry that 'bringing interest rates
down too far would increase the risk of the re-emergence of inflationary
pressures'. That 'might make lower interest rates difficult to sustain', he
added.
He said Britain had a 'solid platform' for future growth, with unmistakeable
signs of recovery. But he said that with long-term gilt yields relatively
high at 8 per cent, as opposed to base rates of 6 per cent, financial
markets were still unconvinced that Britain had got on top of inflationary
pressures.
Sounding a warning against any further loosening in economic policies, Mr
George said that if people had the confidence that inflation would remain
low, 'then relatively low and relatively stable interest rates will tend to
follow'.
He said it was wrong to opt for lower interest rates and assume that
inflation would also remain low.
In an apparent swipe at those arguing for fresh cuts in base rates, held at
their present levels since January, Mr George said that even if borrowing
costs were lower people would not necessarily spend or borrow more.
That was because of the 'bitter experiences of the late 1980s', in which
many individuals and businesses took advantage of relatively low interest
rates to step up loans and expenditure, only to find themselves in financial
difficulties when the recession began to bite a few years later.
In a further distancing by the bank of any goal to rejoin the European
exchange rate mechanism, Mr George said exchange rate stability, though a
useful goal, could not be achieved at the expense of a 'distortion of
domestic (economic) policy'.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Mersey barrage project shelved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR a Pounds 1.4bn electricity-generating barrage across the River
Mersey have been shelved after 11 years of studies and Pounds 8m of
expenditure since 1987. The project would have been the largest renewable
energy scheme in the UK.
The decision follows final government refusal to help keep the project in
place until the economic and political climate improved. Funding has been
shared equally between public and private sectors.
The barrage was expected to have a capacity of 700MW, enough for
three-quarters of Liverpool's needs. It would also have created about 5,000
jobs and made a substantial contribution to the legal obligation of Manweb,
the local electricity supplier, to take 20 per cent of its electricity from
non-fossil fuel sources.
The shareholders include Alfred McAlpine, Barclays Bank, BICC, Blue Circle,
Costain, Ocean Marine, Rolls-Royce Engineering, Royal Insurance, Shell,
Tarmac and Trafalgar House. Local shareholders are represented by
Littlewoods, Mersey Docks, Manweb, Trinity International and Liverpool
University.
They believed they could raise about Pounds 400m, but wanted advance
payments from the government's non-fossil fuel levy on consumers to fund the
rest, with eventual repayments.
Mr James McCormack, company secretary of Tarmac Construction and general
manager of the barrage company, said yesterday: 'In years to come
environmental issues will assume greater political significance. The next
general election could be a watershed for future policy. We would hope there
will eventually be the political will to proceed.'

GOVERNMENT plans to privatise most of the ship inspection work carried out

Mr Roger Nixon, chairman of the Lloyds' Underwriters Association'sjoint hull

He warned that contracting-out ship safety checks would weaken Britain's

The hearingwas told that ship safety checks might be carried out in future
by private ship classification societies, whose standards have been
continually criticised during the hearing.
Mr Nixon said every society needed 'its policemen'.
Mr Nixon revealed that London underwriters are in dispute over the
sea-worthiness of oil tankers which Salvage Association surveys had found to
be sub-standard after being passed safe to sail by five reputable societies.
Mr Nixon told Lord Donaldson, who is chairing the hearing, that he had
photographic evidence of one tanker inspected in Hong Kong which
demonstrated that the crew had covered up rust holes 'with painted canvas'.
The hearing continues.

and steel industries,' he said.
Mr Chris Tillett, associate director of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'It came as
no surprise that defence cuts were a key concern to south-west business.
What is striking, though, was the spread and depth of exposure of south-west
firms, and the scale of the knock-on impact.'
Dr Derek Braddon, the university's research director in defence economics,
said the survey confirmed the worst fears about the scale of job losses and
economic shockwaves caused by defence cuts. Already, about 25,000 jobs in
the region had been lost in consequence. A forecast two years ago that
40,000 would go by the end of the decade was probably now an underestimate.
He said that if Devonport dockyard at Plymouth lost a pending nuclear
submarine refitting contract to Rosyth in Scotland, it would be 'a very big
disaster' for the south-west.
The report finds that overall job prospects in the region are unlikely to
improve substantially in the foreseeable future, with 40 per cent of large
companies expecting to shed more staff. Even with European aid, growth in
employment would be slow. 'Without (aid),the prospects for growth in
employment opportunity give rise to considerable concern.'

FT  10 JUN 93 / Retirement-age women work longer than men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST a quarter of women in Britain are working or looking for jobs up to
five years after they have reached state pension age, compared with just 9
per cent of men, according to Department of Employment figures published
today.
Much of the difference between the sexes is accounted for by the gap in the
state pension age - 60 for women and 65 for men. Just 4 per cent of women
over the age of 65 are still working.
The reason that women commonly continue working may be linked to the fact
that far more retired men than women receive pensions.
Separate government figures have shown that 69 per cent of retired men aged
65-69 were receiving an occupational pension in 1992, compared with 40 per
cent of retired women aged 60-64.
The report on the Labour Force Survey figures concludes that the 'decline in
labour market participation of older people in Great Britain and in other
European countries has slowed down, and, in the case of older women in Great
Britain, has been reversed.'
Since a similar survey in 1987, there has been an increase in economic
activity among women aged 50-59 from 60 per cent to 62 per cent; for those
aged 60-64, the figure has risen from 19 per cent to 23 per cent.
Among men, there has been a fall since 1987 of those working aged 50-59 from
85 per cent to 84 per cent; the proportion of men aged 60-64 still working
fell from 55 per cent to 53 per cent. All the latest Labour Force figures
are for spring 1992.
Older women are far more likely than men to be working part-time: 66 per
cent of women aged 60-64 are part-time workers, compared to 14 per cent of
men.
Over the age of 65, 83 per cent of women still working are part-time, and 65
per cent of men are part-timers.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Builders increase housing starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVIVAL in the private housing market is encouraging builders to
increase new housing programmes, official figures published yesterday show.
With housing sales and prices steadily rising, construction activity is
recovering after one of the worst periods for new house building for more
than a decade. Builders are also reporting large price increases for some
development land.
Although figures vary between building societies, the country's largest
mortgage lenders agree that house-sale activity and prices have resumed an
upward trend earlier than many had originally expected. Builders have also
been encouraged by a reduction in the large number of empty homes, which
have inhibited revival in the housing market.
The Department of the Environment said that total housing starts in the
three months to the end of April reached 47,400, a 20 per cent rise from the
previous three months and 6,800 more than in the same period a year earlier.
In April alone, building started on 16,400 homes, compared with 14,000 in
April last year. Builders also completed 14,200 homes for sale during the
month, nearly 2,000 more than a year earlier. Last year private housing
starts reached 121,000 - 100,000 less than the 1988 peak of 221,000.
The latest figures suggest output this year will rise sharply.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Backbench Tories underwhelmed by
'best leader they have' - Ralph Atkins on how despair among Conservative MPs
betrayed the damage done to the prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   DESPAIR on the Conservative benches
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and the near absence of the usual waving of order papers for Mr John Major -
yesterday betrayed the injury Mr Norman Lamont's resignation speech had done
to the prime minister's credibility.
Even loyalist MPs admitted Mr Lamont's comments were deeply damaging to Mr
Major. They said the prime minister had failed to respond by creating a
sense of purpose for his government in his own speech. Questions about his
leadership were renewed and reinforced. Rumours about a leadership challenge
later this year were heightened.
Labour MPs's ironic cries of 'more, more,' after Mr Major sat down added to
the sense of disappointment.
Private criticism of Mr Major's leadership style was both scathing and
widespread. 'If he isn't acting as a prime minister soon, he won't be prime
minister at all,' said one Tory.
There was public criticism too, with critical speeches by senior Tories in
the Commons debate.
But, with no challenger to the leadership having yet emerged, there was a
sense of floundering among Conservative MPs. A usually loyal member of the
government said: 'I have got to think about it. We can't make a considered
view. He hasn't shored up his position certainly.'
One minister said: 'We got no other choice'.
Sir Anthony Grant, Conservative MP for Cambridgeshire south west, captured,
perhaps unwittingly, the predicament as he tried to sound supportive: 'He is
certainly the very best leader that we have.'
During Mr Major's Commons speech, as many Tory MPs were sucking fingers in
contemplation - perhaps of the stings inflicted by Mr Lamont - as were
indulging in more traditional attempts to goad the Labour party.
No one expected the prime minister to make a great speech. It is not his
strength. But there was a sense among Conservatives that he could have done
better.
One backbencher suggested that he should have brushed off the jibes from Mr
Lamont, by ignoring them in a statesman-like manner.
But to some Tories the fall-out from Mr Lamont's address was less damaging
than might have been expected.
The prevailing view was that the party had to rally around the government,
rather than create further divisions.
Almost all Tory MPs agreed that the former chancellor's intervention was not
on the same scale as the resignation speech of Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe.
Others criticised the former chancellor's motives.
One junior minister said: 'Lamont is not popular out there. Geoffrey was
respected.'
One moderate MP said: 'Norman Lamont wanted to wound rather than to kill -
though I suppose to want to wound the government these days is bad enough.'
A more careful assessment will precede tonight's meeting of the executive of
the Conservative's 1922 backbench committee, the infamous 'men in grey
suits' who tell prime ministers - frequently bluntly - what the infantry at
Westminster are thinking.
Since the committee is usually ruled by conventions of absolute secrecy,
details of the message which will be sent to Mr Major were unclear last
night. However, at least a few of the 18 executive members were deeply
worried at the Tory party's plummeting morale. 'We are prepared to give him
time, but not indefinitely,' said one.
Another said: 'Morale is definitely low and there is a great deal of anxiety
about but that hasn't manifested itself in a feeling that the government is
about to collapse, a general election is brewing, or that the prime minister
should go.'
But the 1922 executive is also split - with many privately furious at what
they regard as disloyal and injudicious remarks made by colleagues to the
newspapers.
There is disagreement too about tax rises.
Right-wing executive members want none, while the centre-right members want
any public spending cuts balanced by tax increases.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, said Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, should, 'forget any idea that he might
have of increasing income tax, particularly the standard rate.'
Adding to the government's embarrasment, Sir Peter Hordern, Tory MP for
Horsham and 1922 executive member, backed Mr Lamont's call for an
independent central bank. 'Monetary policy is not as credible as it might be
if our central bank were to be independent,' he said.
Sir Peter also said that VAT on fuel and power, if needed, should have been
imposed immediately. 'To be blamed without getting any revenue for a year
seems perverse.'
Sir Terence Higgins, Tory MP for Worthing and another member of the 1922
executive, was also critical of the VAT move, saying he thought the
government needed to do more to protect those on incomes just above benefit
levels.
Ironically, last night Mr Lamont's Kingston-upon-Thames constituency was
among those earmarked for re-organisation by the Boundary Commissioners. In
the latest provisional plans the seat is set to be divided between the
Richmond and Barnes constituency and a new one for Kingston and Surbiton.
When the commission started its work there were forecasts that the
Conservatives could benefit by as many as 20 extra seats, but last night's
plans indicate that the figure could be as few as half a dozen - with many
desperately close marginals.
Tory-dominated Essex is set to gain an extra seat but sweeping changes are
planned to the party's flagship marginal at Basildon.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Buoyant Smith raises his stock -
Smith calls government 'foolishly inept'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUOYANT Mr John Smith yesterday acted to defuse recent criticism of his
leadership style by unleashing a withering assault on the government's
credibility and competence.
Exploiting a rare opportunity to grapple with Mr John Major head-to-head in
a full-length Commons debate, the Labour leader hit back at recent internal
rumblings about his 'Horlicks leadership' with a bravura performance which
combined sober economic analysis with good jokes.
Making the most of his opportunity to take aim at an opponent softened up by
former chancellor Norman Lamont's extraordinary resignation statement, Mr
Smith dubbed the hapless prime minister 'the man with the non-Midas touch.'
The government was 'consistently incompetent, hopelessly accident-prone, so
foolishly inept,' he said, listing a panoply of mishaps stretching from
Black Wednesday to last month's 'botched' reshuffle.
It was no wonder we were living in 'a country where the Grand National does
not start and a hotel falls into the sea', he said.
Introducing a motion condemning Mr Major's 'betrayal' of election promises,
Mr Smith started by concentrating on tax increases announced in Mr Lamont's
final Budget, including the extension of VAT to domestic fuel which he said
amounted to a 'staggering' Pounds 17.5bn.
In the 1992 election campaign the prime minister had promised tax cuts year
upon year and said that his party had 'no plans and no need' to extend the
scope of VAT.
Instead it was 'tax increases year on year,' Mr Smith said. 'The stark truth
is that every family in the land will have to foot the cost of this
government's perfidy.' The government was 'prepared to promise anything to
get elected.'
The Labour leader was at pains to emphasise that the less well-off would be
disproportionately affected by some of the Budget changes.
The main difference between putting 1 per cent extra on national insurance
contributions and levying another 1p on income tax was that national
insurance hit the lower paid harder, he said.
Nor had the Conservatives said in their general election campaign that they
would freeze personal income tax allowances in their first post-election
Budget, Mr Smith continued. 'National insurance increases, VAT and frozen
allowances; not quite the double whammy we kept hearing about (in the
election). It has turned out to be the Tories' triple whammy on the British
taxpayer.'
Brushing off a string of angry interventions from the Tory back benches, Mr
Smith argued that what the country was starting to resent was the 'low
ambition' the government had for Britain.
The people of Britain did not want a 'low-wage sweatshop' economy, or 'high
and debilitating' unemployment, or 'confrontation and dogma' in the
classroom.
What they wanted was a government they could trust. No amount of
reshuffling, repackaging and representation could disguise 'the stark
reality of a discredited government presided over by a discredited prime
minister.'

FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont warns PM on 'short-termism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, yesterday warned the prime minister
that his government would not survive unless it concentrated on credible
policy objectives and stopped making decisions for short-term presentational
reasons.
In an electrifying resignation statement to a crowded Commons, Mr Lamont
also revealed that the prime minister had vetoed his attempts to give the
Bank of England independent status with control over interest rate policy.
The prime minister and his increasingly grim-faced frontbench colleagues
listened attentively as Mr Lamont, in breaking the self-imposed silence he
has observed since being sacked 10 days ago, condemned the government for
allowing opinion polls and Conservative party managers to exercise too much
influence over its actions.
Mr Lamont insisted: 'In politics you should decide what is right and then
decide the presentation - not the other way round.
'Unless this approach is changed, the government will not survive - and will
not deserve to.'
After recalling his leading role in securing Mr Major's appointment as prime
minister in succession to Mrs (now Baroness) Thatcher, Mr Lamont said he
still believed that he had made the right choice.
In a passage addressed directly to the prime minister he stressed that the
over-reliance on opinion polls went to the heart of the way in which the
government conducted itself and resulted in too much short-termism.
Mr Lamont said: 'We give the impression of being in office but not in power.
Far too many important decisions are made for 36 hours' publicity.'
Dealing with his decision not to resign after Black Wednesday, when sterling
was forced to leave the European exchange rate mechanism, he revealed that
Mr Major 'made it clear to me in writing that he had no intention of
resigning himself and that I should not do so either'.
The prime minister had told him that he regarded 'attacks on his chancellor
as coded attacks on himself'.
Mr Lamont emphasised that membership of the exchange rate mechanism had been
the policy of the whole government, and that he had played no part in the
original entry decision made in 1990 by Lady Thatcher, Mr Major - the then
chancellor - and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.
While admitting that he would probably not have supported sterling's entry
into the ERM in 1989 he said he had not believed then that a fixed exchange
rate system was doomed to break up.
'Those who hold that view presumably blame Lady Thatcher for commiting us to
a policy that was bound to fail, but I do not take that view now, and I did
not then,' he said.
He explained that on becoming chancellor in 1990 he believed that membership
of the exchange rate mechanism could be made to work, and that he had done
all he could to make it work.
The former chancellor told the House: 'It certainly did enable us to get
inflation down dramatically. Indeed, without the ERM, I doubt whether the
government would have had the courage and determination to get it down.'
The ERM policy, he said, had broken down because German policy developed in
a way which he believed to have been mistaken and which had not been
anticipated, not least when German interest rates were raised last year.
The restrictive effect had caused him increasing concern last summer, and he
had put the idea to the prime minister that sterling's membership of the ERM
should be temporarily suspended.
'He made it clear that he did not want to do that. Probably he was right. I
accepted it.'
Mr Lamont acknowledged that it would not have made any difference because
'we would have been overtaken by the same events in September that
ultimately hit us'.
He defended his decision not to increase interest rates last summer in a bid
to keep sterling in the ERM, maintaining it was not an option because of the
position of the domestic economy.
Mr Lamont said: 'I did not believe that it would have been credible, and I
am sure that I was right.'
He had not devalued within the ERM because it would have meant higher
interest rates at a time when lower interest rates were needed.
Mr Lamont said there should be no question of rejoining the ERM being on the
agenda during the present parliament, and he welcomed statements already
made by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, expressing the same view.
Mr Lamont urged the prime minister and the chancellor to accept that nothing
would be more effective in establishing the government's credibility than
making the Bank of England independent of the Treasury.
'It is my greatest regret that after two-and-a-half years of trying I have
failed to persuade the prime minister of this essential reform,' he said.
While confirming that he had been in general agreement with the prime
minister on interest rate policy, Mr Lamont said he did not believe that
even the timing of interest changes should be affected by political
considerations.
'Interest changes should never be used to offset some unfavourable political
event. To do so undermines the credibility of the policy and the credibility
of the chancellor.'
There was laughter from the opposition when in commenting on the cabinet
changes after his dismissal, Mr Lamont said he wished the prime minister
well and hoped that they would produce 'whatever advantage for him and the
government that he intended'.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Analysts cool on independent bank
suggestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY ANALYSTS were less than impressed by Mr Norman Lamont's call for an
independent central bank.
Although many are in favour of rescuing control of monetary policy from
politicians' hands, the response to yesterday's speech was that once again
the UK was searching for a panacea to its enduring problem of inflation.
'Nigel Lawson made a similar plea when he resigned, but I am afraid it
misses the point,' said Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort
Benson. 'What you really need is not so much a constitutional change which
allows for an independent central bank, but an aversion to inflation on
behalf of the population.'
One fear was that an independent central bank would become to the 1990s,
what entry to the European exchange rate was to the 1980s.
'In the late 1980s, everyone thought that ERM entry would be the answer to
inflation,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank. 'I think it
is rather depressing that we are again looking for a holy grail. In the end
it all boils down to whether we have the right policies or not, and an
independent central bank isn't going to change that.'
This view was echoed by Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburgs. 'I
am not sure that an institutional change will solve the UK's underlying
macroeconomic problems,' he said. 'An independent central bank would help,
but it isn't necessarily the panacea for inflation that people think it is.'
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets said it was
remarkable how retired chancellors appeared to see the attraction of handing
over monetary control to an independent body as soon as they left office.
'It probably would be an advantage,' he said. 'But I think the advantages
are grossly over done.'
Even an independent central bank would have to earn its own credibility,
said Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank. 'Just having one does
not automatically prove your credibility as a low inflation country.'
Analysts are still unsure about how to assess the views of the new
chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke.
'He is still an enigma,' said Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS. 'I
think he will control public spending, tax areas that are not politically
sensitive, fiddle the PSBR figures, and hope that growth does the rest of
the work for him.'

FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Statement from Bank of England on
political independence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England yesterday said: 'We believe that the key objective of
monetary policy is to safeguard the value of money, but that for so long as
policies are in place which secure that, the precise constitutional status
of the central bank is less important. That is the position now, in that the
government is committed to an inflation target and the Bank of England has a
role in monitoring its achievement. Nevertheless as the governor has said on
many occasions, there are clear advantages in making the central bank
directly responsible for achieving price stability, if only because this may
enhance the credibility of policy.'

FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bank officials cheered by victory
of inches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS AT the Bank of England were last night congratulating themselves
in the belief that their long campaign for independence in monetary policy
was inching towards success.
No one would have been more pleased at Mr Lamont's call for an independent
central bank than Mr Eddie George, who takes over as Bank governor next
month. The anti-inflation hawk has made plain that achieving stable growth
without undue price rises would be made easier if the Bank rather than
politicians controlled interest rates.
Mr George, the current deputy governor, was heartened not only by Mr Norman
Lamont's statement that for 2 1/2 years he had tried to persuade Mr John
Major that the Bank should be independent but by the prime minister's
refusal to rule this out, so long as Threadneedle Street could be
accountable to parliament.
Mr Lamont's campaign to change the prime minister's mind was known only to a
few people. Mr Warwick Lightfoot, who was one of Mr Lamont's economic
advisers between his taking over as chancellor in November 1990 and April
1992, said last night: 'The chancellor never discussed this idea within my
earshot.'
But it emerged last night that top Treasury officials worked on the plan
early this year, providing papers which Mr Lamont gave to Mr Major before
the Budget.
The Treasury refused to divulge any details of discussions on the issue
between Mr Lamont and Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary. Sir
Terry, then the Treasury's chief economic adviser, was among several top
officials instructed in 1988 by Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, to work
on a secret scheme to give the Bank independence.
That plan was vetoed by Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister. It
only came to light in Lord Lawson's resignation speech in 1989 which, in
putting the case for taking control of borrowing costs away from ministers,
was an uncannily similar to Mr Lamont's address yesterday.
One comment last night from someone who knows Mr Lamont is that the deposed
chancellor - possibly subconsciously - was in his speech paying homage to
the ideas of Lord Lawson, to whom he had been politically close.
Bank officials yesterday said they had no knowledge that Mr Lamont had been
trying to change government policy on this issue. During his tenure as
chancellor Mr Lamont continually backed the government line that ministers
should set interest rates.
In an interview with the FT in December 1991 Mr Lamont said: 'Ministers are
accountable to parliament for economic policy, including monetary policy,
and I have no plans to change the status of the Bank of England in stage two
(of European economic and monetary union which is supposed to last until
close to the end of the 1990s).'
In the interview he answered 'none whatsoever' to a question as to whether
there were policy differences between him and the prime minister.

   THE GRIM sense of despair on Conservative benches
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and the near absence of the usual Order Paper waving - as Mr John Major
finished his speech was as telling as any snap appraisals or television
soundbite from Tory MPs afterwards.
Mr Norman Lamont's resignation speech was deeply damaging to Mr Major, even
in the eyes of loyalist MPs. The prime minister had failed to respond by
renewing a sense of purpose into backbench troops; questions about his
leadership were only confirmed.
Labour MPs's yelps of 'more, more,' added to the sense of disappointment.
'We have got to think about it, we can't make a considered view,' said a
usually loyal member of the government, asked about Mr Major's speech. 'He
hasn't shored up his position certainly.' One Euro-sceptic Tory said: 'Let's
say it wasn't a blockbuster.'
As Mr Major spoke, as many Tory MPs were sucking fingers in contemplation as
indulging in more traditional attempts to goad the Labour party. No one
expected the prime minister to make a great speech, it is not his strength,
but there was a sense among Conservatives that he could have done better.
To some Tories, however, the fall-out from Mr Lamont's address was less
damaging than might have been expected. The prevailing view was that the
party had to rally around the government, rather than create yet more
divisions - and there were many public expressions of loyalty and support.
The former Chancellor's intervention was not on the same scale as the
resignation speech of Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, almost all Tory MPs
agreed.
'Lamont is not popular out there. Geoffrey was respected,' said one junior
minister. 'Norman Lamont wanted to wound rather than to kill - though I
suppose to want to wound the government these days is bad enough,' said one
moderate Tory MP.
A more careful assesment will proceed tonight's meeting of the executive of
the Conservative's 1922 backbench committee, the infamous 'men in grey
suits' that tell prime ministers - frequently bluntly - what the infantry at
Westminster are thinking.
Usually ruled by conventions of absolute secrecy, details of the message
that will be sent to Mr Major was unclear last night but at least a few of
the 18 executive members were deeply worried at the Tory party's plummeting
morale. 'We are prepared to give him time, but not indefinitely,' said one.
'Morale is definitely low and there is a great deal of anxiety about but
that hasn't manifested itself in a feeling that the government is about to
collapse, a general election is brewing or even that the prime minister
should go,' said another.
But the 1922 executive is also split - with many privately furious at what
they regard as disloyal and injudicious remarks made by colleagues to
newspapers. There is disagreement too over tax rises. Right-wing executive
members want none, the centre right members want any public spending cuts
balanced by tax increases.
Sir Terence Higgins, Conservative MP for Worthing and 1922 executive member,
said that the government needed to do more to protect those on incomes just
above benefit levels. He blamed much of the government's policy on the
media.
'The constant tendency of the press to take as hard news what is either
speculation or a leaked document saying such and such is being considered
when no decisions have been reached has given a wholly misleading impression
of what is going on,' Sir Terence said.

FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Kantor outlines US policy towards Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A broad defence of the emerging controversial US Japan policy, Mr Mickey
Kantor, the US trade representative, said the US could lead the world out of
recession only if Japan reduced its huge and still growing trade surplus.
'It is our responsibility to get our budget deficit under control, invest in
our infrastructure and lead global growth,' he said. 'But we have just got
to do something about the Japanese trade surplus, which creates an
asymmetrical economic situation in the world, costing US jobs.'
In the US-Japan talks set to begin tomorrow, Mr Kantor said he would be
flexible on demands for numerical indicators to measure progress in reducing
that surplus. Other options would also be considered ..'
'We're not telling the Japanese how to reach these goals, how to structure
their economy,' he said. 'We're trying to say we have a problem that needs
to be addressed.'
US concerns were shared by the EC, he said. 'We understand that the
Europeans are currently in the middle of negotiating 20 different sectors
with the Japanese ..'
The US has proposed a negotiating framework which divides the disputes into
five baskets: government procurement, regulatory reform, motor vehicle and
vehicle parts, compliance with existing agreements and economic integration.
Various solutions - some without numerical indicators - will be sought.
Negotiators are expected to move quickly, with a comprehensive framework
scheduled for completion by the Tokyo economic summit next month.
The US approach arises out of the conviction that the structural impediment
initiative, negotiated by the Bush administration with no measures for
progress, was a failure. The new 'holistic' approach is designed 'to
intersect structural and sector problems,' Mr Kantor said.
A July 1 deadline for Japan to open its government procurement market on
construction is likely to pass without sanctions, although, after years of
negotiations and four pacts, less then 1 per cent of Japanese central
government procurement has been going to foreign suppliers.
The criteria could be the number of procurement opportunities open to
foreign suppliers, the transparency of the process, or the foreign market
share.
'We're flexible in dealing with these, but we are not flexible in looking
for results in terms of measurable success,' Mr Kantor said.
The US specifically will push Japan to increase its imports of manufactured
goods. Even a one-third increase would bring Japanese imports up to only
half the level of most industrialised countries.
It is not the US approach that is managed trade but Japan's, according to Mr
Kantor.
'I would say classic managed trade would be not opening your markets and
protecting your industries, while you export critical high-value products to
other countries.'

</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, chairman of Allied Irish Banks and former EC
competition commissioner, was yesterday elected by acclamation to be the new
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Sutherland said his immediate priority was to help push the Uruguay Round
of global trade talks to 'a quick, comprehensive and far-reaching
conclusion'. The talks, launched in 1986, are due to end this December,
three years behind schedule.
Mr Sutherland, who takes over from Mr Arthur Dunkel on July 1, has been
appointed for an initial two-year term renewable for a further four years.
The split reflects proposals in the draft Uruguay Round agreement drawn up
by Mr Dunkel in December 1991 to create a new more powerful multilateral
trade organisation. This would subsume the 111-nation Gatt and proposed
sister bodies on trade in services and intellectual property.
If the MTO comes into being, Mr Sutherland's terms and conditions would be
renegotiated for the remaining four years. For the first two years, he will
be paid Dollars 190,000 a year plus a 'representation allowance', a package
worth about Dollars 28,000 more than Mr Dunkel.
Mr Sutherland yesterday paid tribute to Mr Dunkel for bringing the Uruguay
Round negotiations so close to a deal and said the round would remain his
personal legacy to the world. The 47-year-old Irishman will be Gatt's fourth
director-general since its creation in 1947.

THE EC has set aside protectionist instincts and reached broad agreement on
measures offering more generous market access for central and eastern
Europe.
Apart from minor outstanding differences, the package is expected to be
endorsed at the EC summit in Copenhagen on June 21-22. In addition to lower
tariffs, the measures call for closer political ties with six former
communist countries as a step to eventual membership.
EC foreign ministers agreed the package in Luxembourg last Tuesday after the
European Commission offered minor changes to its original proposals for
greater trade liberalisation with Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic,
Slovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria.
After objections from France and Portugal, the Commission shelved its
proposal to shift from a rigid 'quota-based' system in favour of more
flexible 'ceilings'. As a result, east European exporters will still face
automatic duties if they breach import restrictions.
The Commission also retreated from its plan to allow the east Europeans
greater flexibility in importing components from the European Free Trade
Area but EC member states agreed to a study on the impact of changing these
'rules of origin'.
EC leaders still have to resolve differences over how far to deepen
institutional ties with the east Europeans. Some member states such as the
UK want to convene an early conference to assess their progress toward
membership.

opposed on the grounds that it would inflate expectations.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, said the
Luxembourg accord was a 'clear signal' that the east Europeans' future was
'with the European Community and ultimately in the European Community.'
Sir Leon ruled out a agreement on an EC-US partnership accord at the
Copenhagen summit. Many differences are outstanding, including anti-dumping
rules, Russia's insistance on full Gatt treatment, and a clause on human
rights to which Moscow objects.

FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Brody's path from ancient Greece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ken Brody, newly confirmed chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, is one
of those earnest, cerebral and industrious presidential appointees of the
'60s generation, whose descent on Washington has been obscured by the
miniflaps over Mr Clinton's assorted stumbles.
A former general partner at Goldman Sachs, the investment bankers, and a
specialist in real estate and high technology investment, he said he found
his way into the US government by way of ancient Greece. Four years ago, he
and a group of friends embarked on a Great Books course, meeting most
Sundays at the Harvard Club in New York.
'The early Greeks got to me with their notion that the highest duty of
citizenship is politics and government,' Mr Brody said. 'It changed a good
deal of what I thought of things.'
Like most Americans he had always been 'somewhat removed' from politics; he
had concentrated his efforts on 'working very hard,' his family and his
tennis game. A few years ago he went hunting for a presidential candidate,
and met then-Governor Bill Clinton (who he still believes has 'the capacity
to be a great president,' once he learns the job) through the Democratic
Leadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats.
The two talked for hours, and Mr Brody signed on to the campaign, eventually
becoming one of Mr Clinton's principal money raisers. His reward was the
Eximbank job, his first choice because it is a comparatively small
bureaucracy (about 400 employees), making 'a significant impact on exports'.
Exports means jobs, and this administration holds job creation as its
highest priority. At the bank, Mr Brody has already presided over some
changes, such as the 'letter of interest' plan, which gives customers
tentative financing approval within seven days. He's hoping to expand a
Dollars 143m programme which provides working capital to small and middle
sized businesses which want to export.
'We're trying to figure out how to get the banks to do more of the work,' he
said. Eximbank's resources are spread very thin. He'd also like American
banks to do more export finance; that yawning need is being met by US
subsidiaries of foreign banks.
Mr Brody's enthusiasm for his new post has made an impression on the
Washington business lobby. Ms Peggy Houlihan, an official with the Coalition
for Employment through Exports, said he is creative, 'a quick study' with
all the right connections and, highly qualified by virtue of his training in
both engineering and finance.
The chairman was surprised when Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary,
appointed him to help run the day-to-day operations of the inter-agency
Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee, which is expected to recommend
far-reaching changes in US trade laws.
He was told each member of inter-agency committees has one goal: protecting
the interests of his agency. 'We're trying to do it differently,' he said.
'We are going to promote the interests of the American people.'

FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Clinton embarks on broad review of US
trade laws - Anti-Bribery Act Under Scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration has embarked on a broad review of US trade laws
and practices to root out internal obstacles to American exports.
'We are looking at A-Z,' said Mr Kenneth Brody, chairman of the
Export-Import Bank and co-chairman of the inter-agency Trade Promotion
Co-ordinating Committee, which is conducting the review. Among laws under
scrutiny are the US export control regime and the foreign corrupt practices
act, which forbids US companies from bribing local officials.
The US export licensing system and the anti-bribery law have long been seen
by American business as burdens not borne by their foreign competitors.
Export controls are time-consuming, expensive and uncertain. The
anti-bribery law is considered vague and ambiguous and troublesome to small
companies which cannot afford high legal fees.
'If bribery is acceptable form in another country and every other country in
the world accepts that and we don't, what does that mean for our exports?'
Mr Brody said.
Business lobbyists say it is a particularly critical issue for operations in
the former Soviet Union, where US investment is being encouraged but, by
most accounts, it is impossible to operate without bribery.
The administration is working closely with its business sector to examine
these obstacles and to co-ordinate the more than 150 export promotion
programmes spread over 19 agencies in the US government.
In part, this new pragmatism is a recognition by the administration that
this is no longer a world of two superpowers but one in which 'our economic
strength will determine our diplomatic and foreign strength,' Mr Brody said.
It is also an indication that the US may do more than pay lip-service to the
ideal of an open trading system. Many trade experts see exports as the best
medicine available for the manufacturing sector, which needs to supply
overseas as well as domestic markets if it is to achieve the highest levels
of efficiency.
The Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee, which is headed by Mr Ron
Brown, the commerce secretary, was created by Congress last year to produce
by next September a strategy to promote US exports and a unified budget
consistent with trade priorities.
One of its early targets may well be the US budget for promotion of farm
exports. The General Accounting Office last year released a study finding
that Dollars 2bn, or 74 per cent of total US outlays for trade promotion,
went to support agriculture, which comprises only 10 per cent of US exports.
The political might of the congressional agriculture committees accounts for
the distortion, and it is not clear the administration can alter it.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Bolivia rewards radical reformer: Christina Lamb on an
unlikely victor in presidential elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GONZALO Sanchez de Lozada is living proof that radical economic reform
can bring political rewards. Since implementing a tough structural
adjustment programme as Bolivia's planning minister in 1985, he has twice
finished ahead of his rivals in presidential elections and this time seems
assured of winning his prize by actually being named president.
After polling strongly in the popular vote on Sunday, he found his way
virtually clear yesterday when former military ruler General Hugo Banzer,
his nearest rival, withdrew from a run-off vote in Congress in August. Gen
Banzer said that Mr Sanchez de Lozada would be named president.
He is an unlikely head for South America's poorest country. Raised in the
US, 62-year-old Mr Sanchez de Lozada owns Bolivia's largest private mining
concern and is one of the country's richest citizens.
He jokes: 'When I was campaigning in the interior, many people thought I was
a foreigner who'd got off a plane in La Paz and decided to run for
president.'
But he is deadly serious in his desire to build on his neo-liberal reforms
of 1985 which brought down inflation from 24,000 per cent and created a
market economy - the first Latin American country to do so under democratic
government. After eight years of austerity, Bolivia now has inflation of 9
per cent - the lowest in South America and both democracy and stability seem
consolidated.
But growth has been minimal and poverty is described by the World Bank as at
sub-Saharan Africa levels.
'The problem now is to get the economy moving again, get the money to the
people and make sure no one steals it,' says Mr Sanchez de Lozada. His
ambitious targets are for 8 per cent annual growth for the first three years
in office and 11 per cent in the last, creating 500,000 jobs and practically
wiping out unemployment.
An obvious way to start raising investment would be to privatise the main
utilities following the lead of neighbouring Argentina. But it was Mr
Sanchez de Lozada's party, the MNR, which nationalised these companies in
the 1950s and privatisation is sensitive in highly unionised Bolivia. He
explains: 'The state oil company was born out of the Chaco war in which
50,000 Bolivians died. How can I sell it to foreigners?' Instead, he has
devised an innovative 'capitalisation' plan under which investors can buy 49
per cent of the companies. While this leaves control nominally with the
state, the companies will be run by a foundation comprising 'notables' and
the private investors.
Once the companies are running efficiently, the state's part will be handed
back to the Bolivian people as freely tradeable shares worth an estimated
Dollars 4,000 per person - five times per capita income. Mr Sanchez de
Lozada believes in this way he can transfer 50 per cent of gross national
product to the people in five years, easing the massive income gap.
To carry out this 'popular capitalism' will require foreign investment.
Although local businessmen are doubtful about the attraction of investing in
companies of which they do not have control, they say that Mr Sanchez de
Lozada with his native English, sharp mind and considerable charisma is the
best possible salesman for the country.
Pointing out that 'in a country with just 7m people, a small amount of
investment has tremendous impact', he believes that capitalisation of the
six largest state companies will be 'like a motor to start up the economy'.
Estimating their assets at Dollars 2bn, he hopes to attract as much again,
boosting state and private investment, including borrowings, to Dollars 8bn
over four years - double the current rate.
Before he can do all this, Mr Sanchez de Lozada must be formally approved as
president by Congress. In the 1989 elections, he narrowly topped the polls
but a deal between the runners-up led Congress to choose the third-placed
candidate. This time his main rival has cleared the path by stepping out of
the run-off.
'I'd like to be president, not just the guy who keeps winning elections,' he
says.

</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENATORS and lobbyists yesterday jostled to push their preferred form of
energy tax after the Clinton administration admitted that its plans to levy
a tax on the thermal content of fuels was dead.
Suggestions ranged from a transport fuel levy, to a general energy tax based
on value, to a far-reaching consumption or value-added tax.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, said the tax details would be worked
out with the Senate finance committee. 'I'm confident it will not be based
on the British thermal unit,' he said, as the administration had originally
proposed.
Mr Bentsen, who as former senator for Texas is no stranger to the ways of
the petroleum industry, sharply criticised the big oil companies for a
lobbying campaign that turned senators from energy states against the BTU
tax.
'Special interests did quite a job. . . They had some hired guns that
frankly presented some quite distorted figures,' he said in a television
interview yesterday.
One leading participant in the energy tax debate is Senator John Breaux from
the oil-producing state of Louisiana, who yesterday suggested a 7 cents a
gallon levy on all transport fuels.
The administration has been reluctant to adopt a tax focus-ed purely on
transport because of its uneven impact on plains and western states where
much longer distances often have to be driven than in the more densely
populated east.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Riordan LA win setback for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD RIORDAN, a white conservative Republican lawyer and financier,
has been elected mayor of Los Angeles, in an upset for the Democratic party
and a setback for President Bill Clinton, who had endorsed his opponent, Mr
Michael Woo, a Chinese American liberal Democrat.
Mr Riordan's election reflects a high voting turnout among the affluent
suburban and predominantly white segments of the electorate, where he has
drawn strong support. Although only 40 per cent of Los Angeles voters are
white, they typically make up two-thirds of those who cast their ballots.
However, his victory signals a deepening chasm between racial and
economically disparate groups in the second largest US city, sections of
which were devastated by last year's riots.
'Fear and despair must come to an end. We must create a will in every
Angeleno to turn this city around,' Mr Riordan declared at a victory rally
on Tuesday night. However, critics give him low marks as a consensus-builder
and question his ability to unite the city's diverse population.
Mr Riordan, 63, will succeed Tom Bradley, a Democrat and one of the first
black mayors of a large US city, who is retiring after 20 years in office.
Mr Riordan spent Dollars 3m of his own money and raised an additional
Dollars 3m to sell himself to Los Angeles voters as a political outsider who
is 'tough enough to turn LA around.' Citing his business accomplishments,
including the turnaround of Mattel, a toy manufacturer that faced insolvency
in the mid-1980s, Mr Riordan succeeded in persuading voters that he could
bring new jobs to the city at a time when local industry is being hit by
cutbacks in defence spending.
During the election campaign, Mr Riordan tried to distance himself from such
former business associates as Michael Milken, the junk bond dealer who was
convicted of securities fraud. 'My involvement with Mike Milken has been in
a charitable context,' said Mr Riordan, who serves on the board of the
Milken family Foundation.
The centrepiece of Mr Riordan's election campaign has been a plan to lease
the LA International airport to private industry and to use the income to
hire 3,000 additional police officers. He reasoned that if people feel safer
in LA, businesses are more likely to be attracted to the city.
Opponents of Mr Riordan question the viability of the airport deal. They
also charge that Mr Riordan represents a throwback to the days when
political power in LA was held by an elite of predominantly white
businessmen. One of the biggest challenges facing Mr Riordan when he takes
office on July 1, will be to win over the city council, which is dominated
by Democratic liberals and holds veto power over some of the city's most
important commissions, including those that run the airport and water and
power departments.
Mr Riordan, a Princeton philosophy graduate and a University of Michigan
graduate in law, moved to Los Angeles in 1956 to work for a law firm. He is
a land developer and investment banker. Mr Riordan has long exerted his
influence in LA politics through large campaign contributions and service on
various commissions.

US officials yesterday said some Gulf war veterans may have a mysterious
illness and possible causes could include depleted uranium as well as the
Kuwaiti oil fires, Reuter reports from Washington.
The commander of the army's main hospital, Major Ronald Blanck, told the
Veterans Affairs subcommittee that there were a small number of cases in
which soldiers may have inhaled depleted uranium dust.
'We have decided that it will be prudent to conduct annual medical
evaluations for a period of at least five years' to determine whether the
depleted uranium has caused any illness, he said.

<TEXT>
CONNECTICUT'S Senate yesterday narrowly voted to ban the sale of assault
weapons in the state, marking the third legislative victory for gun control
advocates in the US this year.
Governor Lowell Weicker immediately signed the bill, which bans the sale of
63 rapid-fire semi-automatic weapons such as AK-47s and Uzis.
The bill even prohibits the Colt Sporter, made by Connecticut-based Colt
Industries. The manufacturer has been controlled by the state pension funds
since its near-bankruptcy in 1990.
National gun control legislation is expected to be introduced soon in
Congress: polls show that voters overwhelmingly favour the imposition of a
five-day waiting period for handgun purchases, and a recent Harris poll
suggested a slim majority for an outright ban on possession of handguns.
Connecticut followed New Jersey and Virginia in voting for gun controls.

VENEZUELA'S new president, Mr Ramon J Velasquez, made his first important
cabinet changes yesterday, replacing the ministers of finance, agriculture
and the interior.
Mr Velasquez, who began an eight-month interim presidential term on June 5,
appointed Mr Carlos Rafael Silva to head the finance ministry; Mr Carlos
Delgado Chapellin to be minister of the interior; and Mr Hiram Gaviria as
minister of agriculture.
He also named one of the country's most respected attorneys, Mr Allen Brewer
Carias, to the newly created post of state minister for government
decentralisation. So far, Mr Alirio Parra has kept the job of energy
minister.
Mr Silva, who has been central bank president and minister of education,
said he did not expect the transition government to make any 'radical
changes' in economic policy but rather to maintain 'certain rules of the
game to assure investors and businessmen'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has reiterated its commitment to Japan and Germany becoming permanent
members of the UN Security Council.
In the clearest statement so far of the Clinton administration's position,
Mrs Madeleine Albright, the US delegate to the UN, said the council must
'adjust to new realities and new responsibilities.'
In the early days of the Clinton administration, Mr Warren Christopher,
secretary of state, also spoke in general terms of the desirability of
reforming the Security Council. This prompted a sharp rebuttal from Mr
Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, who had been asked if Britain was
prepared to lose its permanent seat.
On this occasion, however, senior British diplomats in Washington said that
Mrs Albright's remarks merely reaffirmed existing US policy, which does not
seek to displace any present members nor, as she put it, 'to sacrifice the
council's new-found effectivness on the altar of reform.'
They pointed out that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general,
had been inviting suggestions for reform. Various discussions with the
administration had not resulted in even the hint of a disagreement between
the US and the UK, they said, noting with satisfaction that the US was
understood to have no interest in the suggestion that the EC be given a
seat.
In her address to the Foreign Policy Association in New York on Tuesday, Mrs
Albright did not mention the earlier British objections to changes in
council membership.
The collapse of communism has revived the council as a political force after
decades when it was hamstrung by vetoes. These were cast mostly by the
former Soviet Union but also by the other permanent members - the US,
Britain, France and China. The new spirit of co-operation was evident
particularly during the Gulf conflict.
Japan, currently an elected member, wants a permanent seat by 1995, the UN's
50th anniversary. Although less strident in its claim, Germany is believed
seeking permanent membership at the same time.
Britain argues that economic clout should not be the criterion, and it has
yet to be determined whether new permanent members would have the power of
veto. Several third world nations also want seats alongside Japan and
Germany. These include India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Brazil.
A big change in council composition would require amendment of the UN
charter.

FT  10 JUN 93 / HIV treatment trials show promising results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRELIMINARY trials of a treatment for HIV infection being developed by a
Franco-US joint venture have shown that it boosts the immune system, helps
prevent weight loss and can reduce the presence of the virus in patients'
blood.
But shares in Immune Response Corporation, the San Diego-based US partner in
the venture, fell Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 16 in New York yesterday, after
Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading Aids researcher at the US National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned against over-enthusiasm.
'The data are quite promising and statistically significant. But the
differences between those on vaccine and those on placebo are quite small.
We mustn't explode into over-enthusiasm again,' he said in Berlin at the
annual international conference on Aids.
Dr Jonas Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine, who is involved in the
project, said HIV-positive individuals should not rush to their doctors to
otain the vaccine. 'These are simply trends. But it is a first whiff of
spring,' he said. The other partner in the venture, called Immunization
Products (IPL), is Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, majority owned by Rhone-Poulenc of
France.
IPL has developed a therapeutic vaccine consisting of HIV virus which has
been deactivated and then cultivated in human cells before being injected
into patients. The vaccine is not designed to prevent infection, but to
assist the immune system of patients who already have the virus.
The trial involved testing 103 HIV-positive patients in nine US medical
centres over 12 months. Before that, studies were undertaken which showed
the vaccine does not cause significant adverse reactions and does not
accelerate the virus's replication, said the company.
IPL said additional studies were required to see if the vaccine slowed
progression to disease and death. The company said the vaccine might be used
in combination with other treatments such as AZT, the medicine offered by
Wellcome of the UK.
Dr Dennis Carlo, vice-president and chief scientific officer at IPL, said:
'These are a lot of significant trends in the right direction. We do not
know what this means exacty. But we do know that the more virus you have,
the faster the disease progresses. If you can affect the levels of virus,
you should have an effect on progression to Aids and death.'
The trials suggest the vaccine gives patients' immune system a statistically
significant boost, says the company. Those given the vaccine experience
relatively stable levels of virus, while those on placebo (a non-active
dummy) experienced a 48 per cent rise in viral load. Some patients on the
vaccine experienced a fall in the amount of virus in their blood. There was
also a significant difference in weight loss between the two groups, with
those on vaccine benefiting.
Immune Response Corporation shares have been as high as Dollars 28 1/2 in
the last 12 trading days. According to some Wall Street analysts, the
sell-off was a technical reaction to the release of information that the
market had already absorbed.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Aboriginal land claim row jolts investors

   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in the Australian mining, pastoral and timber industries were
yesterday thrown into confusion by a deadlock in talks between federal and
state governments on how to deal with aboriginal land claims.
And while the officials grappled with a definition of 'native land title'
the Australian High Court has been flooded with aboriginal claims covering
vast tracts of land, including the whole of the Canberra region. Large areas
in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland are also being claimed.
The meeting between Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, and state premiers was
to have drawn up a national procedure to deal with aboriginal land claims
triggered by the so-called Mabo decision handed down by the High Court a
year ago. The court recognised that native titles existed before European
occupation of Australia.
The decision abolished the accepted doctrine that Australia was no one's
land when the Europeans arrived. As a result of the decision, aboriginal
groups able to demonstrate a continuing link with an area of land are now
able to claim native titles.
Mr Keating's Labor government has accepted the principle of native titles,
and has tried to get agreement from state governments to establish tribunals
to hear and resolve claims to them. And in a move to protect mining and
business leases that might be covered by aboriginal claims, Mr Keating has
proposed to introduce legislation validating leases granted between 1975 and
the time of the Mabo decision in 1992. He has also proposed compensation be
paid to Aborigines suffering losses from such leases.
While the state governments agreed to legislate and validate leases, two of
the most resource-rich states, Victoria and Western Australia, have rejected
the Mabo decision, arguing that state parliaments could legislate to
extinguish native titles.
Mr Keating has now threatened to introduce federal legislation to force
state governments to come into line.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Australia finds way to ease student debt pain: Kevin Brown
looks at a possible fee repayment model for other countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN 21-year old Georgina Young graduates next year from Sydney's University
of Technology (UTS), she will emerge into the workforce with a degree in
communications and tuition debts of up to ADollars 10,000 (Pounds 4,440).
Ms Young is one of a growing number of university students forced to pay
part of the cost of degree courses under Australia's Higher Education
Contributions Scheme (Hecs), introduced in 1989 but just beginning to bite.
Australia's Labor government was criticised for introducing the scheme,
which many supporters saw as a betrayal of the party's ideals - an earlier
Labor administration abolished fees in 1974.
But the Hecs pill was made easier to swallow by a unique income contingent
repayment mechanism which means that graduates make no repayments until they
begin earning higher than average incomes.
A year after the first students with full Hecs liabilities graduated,
academic studies suggest that the scheme has had a negligible impact on the
size and composition of the university intake.
At the same time it is providing a growing contribution to the government's
ADollars 4bn university budget, which might otherwise have strained to keep
pace with growth in enrolments of more than 10 per cent a year.
The message has not been lost on other governments seeking an equitable way
to make students contribute to university costs.
The system has been watched closely in the UK, where a proposal by the
London School of Economics to charge students additional tuition fees from
September 1994 has brought the issue to the fore. The UK government's stated
position is to leave universities with the autonomy to charge tuition fees
if they wish to do so. However, the LSE has suggested that charging fees
would be easier if a system of long-term student loans was made available.
Canada and the Czech Republic have also inquired about the Australian
scheme.
Undergraduate students pay 20 per cent of the average cost of courses,
currently equivalent to ADollars 2,328 a year. About 10 per cent of students
(or their parents or employers) pay in advance.
But the scheme also allows students to defer their liabilities at zero real
interest until they have graduated and are earning more than the average
wage, now ADollars 27,748.
The debt is repaid through the tax system in instalments equivalent to 2 per
cent of taxable income, rising to 3 per cent if income reaches ADollars
36,000, and 4 per cent for incomes above ADollars 44,146.
There is no time limit on repayments, and although the liability is retained
for life, graduates who never exceed the earnings threshold will never have
to repay the debt.
The scheme raised about ADollars 185m in 1991-92, of which about ADollars
100m was in advance payments. However, deferred payments quadrupled over
1990-91, and will continue to increase rapidly as more Hecs students enter
the workforce.
A report by Mr Bruce Chapman, director of the Centre for Economic Policy
Research at the Australian National University, concluded that Hecs is
fairer than the loan systems used in many other countries.
This is because the repayment system ensures that graduates who reach higher
income brackets quickly repay their liabilities earlier than those who
remain in low income occupations or achieve higher incomes late in life.
Officials say the government is considering extending the scheme to cover 25
per cent of course costs. It may also be extended to technical education if
state governments agree.
Would the scheme work abroad? Mr Chapman said it could, but it would have to
be adapted to local conditions, including finding a way of replicating
Australia's watertight taxation system, which makes it impossible for
graduates to dodge their liabilities.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Nigerians promised the world: Paul Adams looks at the
elections that will end military rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF NIGERIANS believed half the campaign promises for the polls on Saturday
they would be looking forward to a golden era of prosperity when the elected
civilian president takes office on August 27 and ends a decade of military
rule.
Mr Moshood Abiola, the candidate of the Social Democratic party, will
'banish poverty from the nation'. Mr Bashir Tofa, his rival from the
National Republican Convention (NRC), will 'make Nigeria work again'.
Both parties are the creation of President Ibrahim Babangida, and neither
has a coherent set of policies which differ clearly from the failed attempt
at economic restructuring by the outgoing military regime.
After becoming president in a military coup in August 1985, Gen Babangida
promised to hand over power when he had established civilian politicians fit
to run the country. His legacy looks like being a civilian regime which
reflects his own choice far more than the will of the people.
Hope is the message which both the Tofa and the Abiola party machines are
trying to convey, and mismanagement is their culprit for the decline in
standards of living. Both candidates are wealthy businessmen who have risen
through the system of patronage which many Nigerians blame for the country's
economic decline.
The American-style advertising and the big-spending rallies of this election
campaign have swept through most of the country since mid-April, but left
the issues which matter almost untouched.
The debate on possible changes to the federation of Nigeria's diverse 30
states has been suppressed by a military decree last month and the president
has ignored appeals to reform the system of government.
Mr Abiola has a bigger list of promises, while Mr Tofa's campaign is closer
to the popular mood of discontent with the state of Nigeria.
Mr Abiola's economic plan alternates between promises to improve fiscal
management and spending on a grand scale, including free education and a
scheme to build 30m housing units. He rejects the structural adjustment
programme of the Babangida regime as a failure and says the SDP has its own
policies which will not be dictated by outsiders.
He has also abandoned his talk of reparations from the western powers for
African slavery to wipe out the Dollars 27bn (Pounds 17.8bn) external debt.
Both he and Mr Tofa intend to negotiate debt relief from the international
donors but their hastily assembled economic plans do not meet the terms
recently set out by the joint IMF/World Bank mission to Nigeria.
Mr Tofa is more cautious on the structural adjustment programme, blaming its
failure on implementation rather than the policies.
The NRC's economic programme is a mixture of state planning and free market
reforms. Mr Tofa gives top priority to the exchange rate of the naira which,
he says, 'cannot be controlled by the government simply fixing it'. His
remedy is to bring down the budget deficit through fiscal discipline to
around 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996, which would be
acceptable to the IMF. The deficit has averaged nearly 8 per cent for the
last seven years.
But Mr Tofa would also instruct the Central Bank of Nigeria to devise
'short-term methods to shore up the naira that are consistent with having a
free market'.
It is also unclear how he would reduce the budget deficit. 'My government
will concentrate its resources on infrastructural developments,' Mr Tofa
promises. He also plans to increase spending on health and education and
would maintain the oil subsidy, which costs almost as much as the budget
deficit of 1992 and whose removal is a condition of official debt relief.
In the twilight of the Babangida regime power failures in most urban areas
have been more frequent and prolonged, fuel shortages have paralysed public
transport and trebled the cost of food - although strikes by oil workers
have now been called off - and failed water supplies increase the spread of
disease.
Although there is no surge of support for the candidates, Nigerians do not
want to rock the boat when at last the end of military rule is in sight.
The hard choices ducked by the military government have been left for the
new civilian regime and the qualifications of both candidates for the task
are unconvincing.

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK seeks easing of poor countries' debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK is seeking to ease the official debt burden of the poorest, most
heavily indebted countries, by extending the scope of the so-called Trinidad
terms.
Mr Anthony Nelson, UK economic secretary, said yesterday he would visit
Washington shortly to urge members of the US administration and Congress to
back an international consensus on the terms which, when fully implemented,
imply a one-off cut of up to two thirds of eligible debt and an extended
repayment period.
The US has been the only member of the Group of Seven leading economic
nations to withhold its support for the Trinidad terms. However, the new
administration is seeking congressional approval for legislative and
budgetary measures to allow the US to implement debt or debt service
reduction.
The Trinidad terms are intended to help some 19 countries, mainly in
sub-Saharan Africa. Mr Nelson points out in a speech he is due to deliver
today that the total outstanding long-term debt stock of severely indebted
low income countries is over Dollars 150bn (Pounds 9.9bn).
Reduction of debt would help to ensure creditor nations get some return on
the remaining stock of debt outstanding, said Mr Nelson.
Concern about the plight of the poorest countries was also highlighted
yesterday by Actionaid, the UK charity. It released a report showing badly
targeted aid and cuts in public spending mean help is not reaching these
countries. With 13 out of 20 donor countries set to cut or freeze official
aid to the Third World, the report suggests that rich countries could double
the impact of help by targeting donations at those who need it most. Such a
move would not compromise public spending targets, it said.
Mr Martin Griffiths, Actionaid director, said estimates indicated only
around 10 per cent of the Pounds 32bn given by the biggest donor governments
was targeted directly at poverty alleviation.

FT  10 JUN 93 / US urges EC to curb high-tech sales to Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday pressed the European Community to curb sales of high
technology to Iran on the grounds that the Tehran regime is seeking to
develop nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, launched the initiative during
a meeting with EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg in which he implicitly
criticised European companies for selling 'dual use' technology to Iran -
items with both civilian and military applications.
Mr Christopher noted pointedly that the US had curbed its sales in this area
'at considerable cost' to its export industries. He urged the Europeans to
support the idea that Iran should not enjoy normal commercial relations.
After the meeting, both sides agreed to launch a joint EC-US study on Iran's
effort to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the problem of nuclear
non-proliferation.
This will include sharing of intelligence, and is intended to be part of a
collective western effort to prevent more countries joining the nuclear
club.
Mr Christopher painted Iran as the lead villain in its efforts to acquire
weapons of mass destruction. He called non-proliferation 'the most important
issue of the 1990s.'
In the past 12 months, the US has become increasingly concerned about Iran's
effort to develop nuclear and chemical weapons technology. But it has tended
to direct its warnings more at China and Russia rather than the EC.
In the 1980s, both US and European companies sold dual-use technology to
Iraq to bolster President Saddam Hussein during his war with Iran. The sales
were carried out with the approval of western governments, including the
Bush administration, because of the fear of the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism into the Middle East.
The US focus on Iran appeared to take aback some EC member states. Though
all of the Twelve agree with the need to step up non-proliferation efforts,
the consensus is that other countries such as Syria and Iraq also need to be
put on the watch-list.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Aboriginal land claims deadlock jolts investors

INVESTORS in the Australian mining, pastoral and timber industries were
yesterday thrown into confusion by a deadlock in talks between federal and
state governments on how to deal with aboriginal land claims.
And while the officials grappled with a definition of 'native land title'
the Australian high court has been flooded with aboriginal claims covering
vast tracts of land, including the whole of the Canberra region. Large areas
in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland are also being claimed.
The meeting between Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, and state premiers
was to have drawn up a national procedure to deal with aboriginal land
claims triggered by the so-called Mabo decision handed by the high court in
June last year.
The court recognised that native titles existed before European occupation
of Australia. The decision abolished the accepted doctrine that Australia
was no one's land when the Europeans arrived.
As a result of the decision, aboriginal groups able to demonstrate a
continuing link with an area of land are now able to claim native titles.
Mr Keating's Labor government has accepted the principle of native titles,
and has tried to get agreement from state governments to establish tribunals
to hear and resolve claims to them. And in a move to protect mining and
business leases that might be covered by aboriginal claims, Mr Keating has
proposed to introduce legislation validating leases granted between 1975 and
the time of the Mabo decision in 1992.
He has also proposed that compensation be paid to Aborigines suffering
losses from such leases.
While the state governments agreed to legislate and validate leases, two of
the most resource-rich states, Victoria and Western Australia, have rejected
the Mabo decision, arguing that state parliaments could legislate to
extinguish native titles.
Mr Keating has now threatened to introduce federal legislation to force
state governments to come into line.
Mr Richard Court, the premier of Western Australia, said that his state
would become ungovernable if security of title under the state's land
management system was undermined by Mr Keating's proposal.
Mr Jeff Kennett, the premier of Victoria, warned that the public would be
'baying for blood' of politicians if key investment projects were
jeopardised by the proposal.

FT  10 JUN 93 / India to seek fresh IMF loan facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA plans to begin negotiations next month with the International Monetary
Fund on a new loan to help fill its need for Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1.98bn) of quickly disbursed official lending, Mr
Manmohan Singh, finance minister, said yesterday.
Mr Singh said during a visit to London that the loan, under the IMF's
extended fund facility providing medium-term finance to support economic
reform, was not needed at present because of India's healthy balance of
payments and reserves position.
However, it would be required partly to repay the two-year IMF standby
credit which expired last month. Mr Singh would not say how much of the
total financing need was expected to come from the Fund and how much from
other official lenders such as the World Bank.
The IMF, he said, had been 'very understanding' about a slippage in the
budget deficit for the financial year which ends this month, which he put at
5.6 per cent of gross domestic product compared with the 5 per cent target.
The target for the next year is 4.7 per cent.
Communal violence had cut government revenue from export and import duties
in January and February by about Dollars 2bn, and the stock market scandal
had caused delays in selling off stakes in public sector enterprises.
Meanwhile, inflation was down to 6 per cent with an underlying trend less
than 5 per cent, the economy was set for annual growth of 5 per cent or
more, and exports were expected to rise by between 10 and 15 per cent.
Mr Singh hoped that within three to four years, a new social safety net
would be sufficiently well established to enable the government to close
public sector entities which had no future. Meanwhile, subsidies had been
stopped and this had spurred some industries such as coal which was now
self-financing.
Asked about fund managers' concerns about capital gains tax on stock market
investments made by institutions, Mr Singh said he intended in the long term
to cut them for foreign and domestic investors - who pay higher rates than
foreigners - but cautioned on allowing free investment flows until its
economic fundamentals were secure.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Chinese leadership drifts and divides: Overheating economy
hinders easy transition to life-after-Deng
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST TWO months after China's media hailed a showcase parliamentary session
designed partly to bolster collective leadership, the best-laid plans for a
smooth transition to a post-Deng Xiaoping era appear shaky.
The continued absence from public view of Mr Li Peng, the ailing premier,
intensifying concerns over Mr Deng's own health, worries over economic
overheating, clear signs of factional manoeuvring within the leadership and
a hesitant performance by the ruling Communist party, are all factors
contributing to an impression of drift.
'I feel that things are quite unstable, almost like 1988. Things seems to be
running away, lacking direction. The overwhelming impression is one of
drift,' said a western official who monitors internal developments.
While China's economy continues to rocket ahead, the political ground
appears to be shifting and leadership foundations that Mr Deng had put in
place seem more insecure; not that his choices of personnel to carry on his
work ever inspired a great deal of confidence.
Mr Li Peng's illness - he is believed to have suffered a heart attack in the
last week of April - and thus his withdrawal from an active leadership role
has merely served to expose flaws in the collective structure that the
88-year-old Mr Deng had hoped would be an enduring legacy.
Among more revealing developments recently has been the conspicuously more
assertive performance in Mr Li's lingering absence of Mr Jiang Zemin,
China's party boss and recently-appointed state president. Mr Jiang, aged
67, whom Chinese propaganda has been referring to as the 'core' of the new
leadership based on the seven-member politburo standing committee, is being
accorded much more prominence in the government-controlled media. This has
been accompanied by reports of him moving political cronies from his days as
mayor of Shanghai into key positions in the central government, the security
apparatus and the media.
He has also intervened in the economic debate, urging restraint on growth
and an intensification of the campaign against corruption and 'money
worship'. In forthright comments on the economy he was trespassing into an
area not previously in his domain, and which risked bringing him into
conflict with the reformists patronised by Mr Deng.
In a speech delivered on April 1, immediately after the annual session of
the National People's Congress endorsed Dengist 'high growth' policies, Mr
Jiang warned of 'major upheavals' unless the economy was reined in. He
mentioned specifically dangers of inflation and a widening gap between rich
and poor.
His intervention - discussion about an overheating economy has been raging
for months in the Chinese leadership - was not revealed until it was
published in late May in a Chinese-funded Hong Kong magazine. His remarks
were then given prominence in the mainland press, but, what is intriguing,
the People's Daily put its report of Mr Jiang's speech beside an editorial
calling for faster reform of the 'socialist market economy'.
Such juxtaposition of apparently contradictory views on the central issue
facing China tended to give credence to talk of divisions in the leadership,
with the economy providing the battleground for a broader contest.
In this uncertain period the military is assuming more than usual
importance, and already there are signs that leadership contenders are
courting key military personnel.
Amid fears that the economic boom will bring about a political loosening,
and thus an erosion of party control, political campaigns aimed at
'strengthening ideology', such as the present appeals to altruism, appear
forlorn.
'I think they're very confused,' a western official said of party
propagandists. 'It's almost as if they're trying to remind themselves of
what communism is. They really have no new ideas. People don't want to hear
about struggling hard. That's what they've done all their lives.'

FT  10 JUN 93 / Parties favour voting systems that favour them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE choice between one or two rounds of voting has become the major point of
difference among Italy's political parties as they struggle to agree on
electoral reform.
Having accepted the principle of majority voting for the chamber of
deputies, attention has now focused on whether to adopt a French-style
run-off among leading candidates or the British first-past-the-post system.
Politicians' views have been influenced by the experience of last Sunday's
municipal elections involving nearly a quarter of the electorate. The
elections for mayors used for the first time the majority voting system with
a second round run-off between the two leading contenders due on June 20.
The results showed it is almost impossible on the first round for any
candidate to win an outright majority since there are so many parties and
none had overwhelming support. The same would almost certainly apply in a
general election. Sunday's elections also demonstrated which parties are
likely to benefit most from different methods of voting.
The populist Lombard League, fresh from its success throughout northern
Italy, is arguing strongly for a single round of voting. With this system
the League would secure more parliamentary seats since its vote is now on
average double that of its nearest rivals.
Until Sunday the Christian Democrats favoured a single round because the
party believed it could count on a minimum 25 per cent of the vote
nationwide and stood to do well with one round of voting. Mr Sergio
Mattarella, the Christian Democrat head of the electoral reform commission,
not surprisingly proposed in his draft earlier this month the single round.
The Mattarella draft also contains a proposal to limit the majority vote to
30 per cent, the remainder on the basis of proportional representation.
Voters would have two votes: one for a candidate to be elected on the
majority system, a second for a party list elected via proportional
representation. In this way, the many small parties would be guaranteed
representation.
These proposals no longer satisfy all the Christian Democrats and are
opposed by many others outside the party. With the Christian Democrat vote
falling to 18 per cent nationwide, several influential members believe the
party could build a broader support base on a second round run-off. They
also regard the idea of two votes, split between candidate and party list,
as clumsy. One commentator termed this idea as 'one vote from the head, the
other the heart'.
The most vociferous backer of the second round run-off is the Party of the
Democratic Left (former communists). The PDS is too weak nationally to rely
on a single round, but as a centrist force around which other parties could
ally it could do well in a run-off. Mr Mario Segni, the leader of the
referendum movement, responsible for the April 18 referendum introducing
majority voting to the Senate, also favours a second round. He has
recognised that in Italy votes for alliances offer greater stability than
backing individual parties.
In arguing for a run-off, the PDS would like to see the second round open to
all those who achieve 12 per cent of the vote - not limited to two
candidates. This is another issue likely to split the parties if and when
they accept the principle of two rounds of voting.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Brittan admits flaws in aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is to reform its Ecu1.5bn (Pounds 1.18bn) aid
programmes in the former Soviet bloc, following allegations that they are
slow and poorly managed.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, yesterday
promised to streamline and decentralise the Ecu1bn Phare programme - aimed
at central and eastern Europe - and the Ecu500m Tacis programme for the
former Soviet Union.
Addressing the European Parliament's external relations and budgetary
control committees, Sir Leon said the Community needed 'to learn from its
mistakes as well as its successes'.
MEPs attacked the Commission, manager of the Phare and Tacis programmes, for
the slow disbursement of funds, which are used for technical assistance and
advice in areas such as food distribution, privatisation, banking and civil
service reform. The deputies also took up the criticisms of some east
European beneficiaries that the programmes rely heavily on costly
consultants, favouring northern EC member states which are strong in that
sector.
Sir Leon conceded that bureaucratic procedures and a lack of specialist
know-how had hampered the work of the EC in eastern Europe. 'We are
increasingly discovering that the pool of qualified know-how is limited and
sometimes less qualified than we and the beneficiaries expect,' he said.
He also promised to take tough action to prevent member states from
influencing the selection of projects in favour of their own commercial
interests.
'Phare and Tacis are not a form of outdoor relief for member state
consultants,' Sir Leon said, adding that the Commission would try to ensure
that projects were selected 'purely on objective criteria' in future.
Sir Leon said the main elements of reform would include greater involvement
of beneficiary countries in helping to make the projects work, with the EC
restricting itself to development of the framework policy.
'Such a change would lead to less bureaucracy, more flexibility and a
greater appreciation of the Community's efforts by the recipient countries,'
he said.

FT  10 JUN 93 / EC applicants overcome the first hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST and easiest round of EC membership negotiations with Austria,
Sweden, Finland and Norway was largely concluded yesterday, after two days
of meetings in Luxembourg between foreign ministers of the 12 and the
applicant countries.
These set the seal on a four-month review of EC and applicant country
legislation, to ensure a match and iron out the wrinkles. EC officials said
this process was now 85 to 90 per cent complete.
The enlargement negotiations are aimed at bringing the four countries -
members of the loose European Free Trade Association (Efta) - into the EC in
1995.
Anti-EC sentiment is running high in all four countries, which are committed
to holding referendums before entry. They and the EC hope that Danish
voters' change of heart in ratifying the Maastricht treaty in their second
referendum last month will overcome Nordic and Alpine reticence.
If all four were to enter, that would be the biggest expansion of the EC.
The UK, Denmark and Ireland entered in 1973 - when Norwegian voters
overturned their government's recommendation to join. Greece joined in 1981,
followed by Spain and Portugal in 1986.
'I think it's fair to say the first part of the enlargement negotiations has
been very successful,' said Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, foreign minister of
Denmark, the current EC president.
But the screening of legislation, supposedly easy after the EC and Efta
agreed on a common free trade zone last year, has already thrown up
problems, and far greater hurdles lie ahead.
A range of problems has been ironed out, ranging from training regimes for
Austrian dentists, Norwegian seatbelt regulations, and the number of bears
Swedes can cull.
The only really substantial agreement is to exempt Finland's privately
administered public pensions scheme from current EC regulations, provided
the companies concerned separate their life assurance operations from their
other business. Finnish industry and trade unions regarded this
accommodation as essential.
After the summer, however, the placid flow of the negotiations will hit the
rapids.
All four want expensive regimes for their Arctic and Alpine farmers,
subsidised at up to eight times the already high EC average.
The Scandinavians also want to retain lavish regional policies to keep
people in their empty northern territories. And Norway is determined to keep
control of its own fisheries and energy. All four, moreover, fear the EC
will lower their environmental standards, arguing that they constitute
barriers to trade.
The applicants also risk becoming embroiled in an emerging intra-EC struggle
over whether to lower the threshold for decision-taking under the EC's
weighted majority voting system.
Federalist countries want a lower threshold - making it harder for countries
like the UK to block EC decisions. The applicants are primarily concerned to
get enough votes in the new arrangement.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Brussels proposes HCFC limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission wants to set strict limits on the EC's consumption
of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which deplete the ozone layer, and end their
use by 2014.
The Commission yesterday proposed tough restrictions on HCFCs, which are
used in the making of foam insulation, and two other ozone-depleting
chemicals - adding to a list of limits and bans headed by
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
But the Commission is not proposing to outlaw EC production of HCFCs, which
could still be exported to developing countries as a substitute for CFCs in
refrigeration and air conditioning systems.
Use of CFCs has affected the ozone layer, which screens out much
ultra-violet radiation, increasing the risk of skin cancer and eye
cataracts.
HCFCs are 20 times less harmful to the ozone layer than CFCs, but the
Commission is still proposing that their use in the EC should be cut to
7,300 tonnes a year from January 1995, and eliminated by 2014. Officials
said yesterday the final date might be brought forward if reliable
production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the most benign substitute for
CFCs, could be established earlier.
The plans drew a sharp response from the EC chemicals industry, which
criticised the Commission for overreacting when the question of how to limit
the more dangerous CFCs had not yet been properly resolved.
Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EC environment commissioner, hopes the
proposals will be approved by EC environment ministers on June 28.
He underlined that as in the case of CFCs - the use of which will be
outlawed from January 1995 - the Community was improving on the deadlines
laid down last November in Copenhagen by the Montreal Protocol, the
93-nation pact on the ozone layer.
The Commission also plans to limit the use and production of
hydrobromochlorofluorocarbons (HBFCs) and methyl bromides, used for
firefighting equipment and soil fumigation respectively. HBFCs will be
outlawed by January 1, 1996, while use and production of methyl bromide will
be frozen on January 1, 1995 and cut by 25 per cent a year later.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Italian MPs to curb 'suspect' secret service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian parliament is to seek broader powers to monitor more closely the
activities of the country's intelligence services.
The tighter controls were promised yesterday by Mr Ugo Pecchioli, a senator
for the Party of the Democratic Left and newly elected head of the
parliamentary intelligence committee. The move follows the shake-up last
Friday by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, of the senior ranks
of the intelligence services.
The government and parliament are anxious to bring the intelligence services
under strict scrutiny following suspicions that some of their members or
ex-members may have had a hand in recent bombings in Rome and Florence,
formally attributed to the mafia. The authorities suspect a repeat of the
1970s when it is thought that the mafia, right wing organisations and the
secret services sought to create tension in order to swing public opinion
away from the left.
The intelligence services are divided into the SISMI and SISDE. The SISMI is
responsible for intelligence gathering and operations to protect national
security and carries out most of the services' foreign activities. The SISDE
is concerned with domestic intelligence.
Under legislation approved in 1977 when the services were first reorganised,
parliament can only be informed of their activities by the prime minister.
However, Mr Ciampi discovered after the May 27 car bomb at the Uffizi
Gallery in Florence that the intelligence services are not obliged to inform
fully the prime minister of their activities.
This, coupled with the suspicion that the two services harboured agents
linked to the mafia and extreme-right wing groupings, led to last week's
personnel changes. New deputy directors were appointed for both services and
new heads were appointed to three of SISDE's four operational divisions.
Yesterday Mr Pecchioli, who fought with the partisans during the second
world war, said it was vital to establish 'if there had been people acting
outside orders or if there have been lapses of inefficiency' in the recent
car bombings. He said parliament's control was far too limited, especially
now that the cold war had ended. He said insufficient effort had been made
to clean out an intelligence community compromised by links with the secret
masonic lodge P2.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Japan carworkers top of earnings league in world motor
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN, the world's biggest car producer, had the highest gross hourly wage
rates in the world automobile industry last year, according to a study by
the German motor industry federation (VDA). Japanese car assembly line
workers also worked the highest number of hours.
Germany and Sweden had the highest total motor industry wage costs, however,
because of a much heavier burden of social costs such as payroll tax or
national insurance. Carworkers in Germany and Sweden, along with Italy, also
worked the fewest hours.
Britain had the lowest total wage costs (gross wages plus social costs such
as payroll tax) in the developed world's motor industry last year, a
position it has held for six of the past seven years.
At the same time UK carworkers worked longer hours than anywhere else in
Europe, and Britain had one of the lowest levels of corporate taxation.
The German motor industry, which is facing severe problems as new vehicle
sales plummet, has suffered a sharp decline in its competitiveness,
according to the VDA figures. Total industry wage costs at DM47 (Pounds 19)
an hour were the highest in the world last year based on average exchange
rates.
The position deteriorated further in the wake of last autumn's turmoil in
European currency markets. Based on exchange rates in December 1992 German
vehicle makers had total wage costs two-thirds higher than the average of
DM28.3 in the rest of Europe, and 37 per cent higher than in both the US and
Japan at DM34.4 per hour.
Adding to the German industry's problems its carworkers enjoyed some of the
shortest working hours at 1,483 hours per year in 1991 (the latest VDA
figures available), a third less than the 2,181 hours worked on average by
their Japanese counterparts and 27 per cent less than the 2,022 hours worked
annually in the US.
According to the VDA figures, German carworkers worked 350 hours a year less
than their equivalents in the UK (1,830 hours a year) and more than 100
hours a year less than in France (1,608) and Spain (1,654).
Carworkers in Sweden and Italy had the shortest annual working hours at
1,388 and 1,409 respectively.
The VDA claims that German motor industry competitiveness is further
burdened by one of the highest levels of corporate taxation, with a tax rate
of around 66 per cent compared with 52 per cent in France and only 33 per
cent in the UK.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Milosevic pressed over UN sanctions

THE international mediators on Bosnia, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, flew to Belgrade yesterday in an attempt to persuade Serbia's
president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, to lift his objections to posting UN
monitors along Serbia's border with Bosnia.
Serbia claims its authorities are enforcing sanctions against Bosnia
following the Bosnian Serbs' rejection last month of the Vance/Owen peace
plan. However, fuel and other supplies are continuing to cross the border.
As UN sanctions bite more deeply Mr Milosevic may be more willing to have
international monitors posted along the Serbian side of the river Drina that
marks the border. The dismissal last week of Mr Dobrica Cosic, the federal
president and an opponent of monitors, removes an important obstacle to the
proposal.
Lord Owen also stressed that the Vance-Owen plan remained 'the framework for
a settlement,' adding that the creation of six safe areas for Moslems was
only a 'short-term solution, to stop Bosnian Serb attacks on areas that are
clearly and unequivocally Moslem or Croat'. However, his admission that he
had failed to convince Bosnian Serb leaders to allow UN observers and relief
convoys into Gorazde, one of three UN-designated safe areas in eastern
Bosnia, underlines the problems involved in trying to set up safe areas
without a ceasefire in effect.
Gorazde, an industrial town close to the border with Serbia, has come under
heavy artillery attack by Bosnian Serb forces in the past two weeks. Its
population doubled to 70,000 with the arrival of Moslems from surrounding
villages. Earlier this week, the town's last supply route was cut as Serb
forces closed in.
'It's clear the Bosnian Serbs intend to consolidate their territorial gains
by squeezing the safe areas in eastern Bosnia out of existence,' a western
diplomat said.
Serbian commanders have prevented UN relief convoys from reaching Srebenica,
another safe area in eastern Bosnia, where 300 UN troops are responsible for
protecting more than 20,000 Moslems.
Bosnian radio reported that Ukrainian soldiers serving in the UN protection
force yesterday fired on unidentified armed groups trying to reach Zepa, the
third safe area, a small town in a mountain ravine where 16,000 Moslems have
sought refuge.
The future of the other three safe areas may be decided by the outcome of a
new Moslem offensive against Croatians in central Bosnia, aimed at
tightening control over areas with a mainly Moslem population. Moslem forces
this week captured Travnik, strategically placed between two
Moslem-controlled strongholds, also burning surrounding villages.
After Sarajevo, the largest safe area would be Tuzla, an industrial centre
with 340,000 residents, where there has been little fighting. One reason is
that both Serbs and Moslems fear provoking massive destruction if a chemical
factory in the city was shelled.
The Bihac district, a mainly agricultural area with 200,000 residents, has
also remained relatively quiet with UN convoys facing few problems in
getting through.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday invited parliamentary deputies to join his
constitutional convention in an attempt to give it more legitimacy and head
off opposition from Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker.
The deputies agreed to send Mr Khasbulatov, who is waging an increasingly
desperate campaign to make parliament the centre of Russian political power,
to the convention. But they set tough conditions for his participation,
including a retraction by Mr Yeltsin of his statement that the old system of
soviets (Bolshevik mini-parliaments at local level) was incompatible with
democracy.
The stage is now set for yet another confrontation between the two men. The
rules of Russia's political jungle - which lacks a strong party structure or
any sense of personal responsibility - mean individuals tend to follow
whoever is stronger at any given moment. Hence the desertion of Mr
Khasbulatov following Mr Yeltsin's referendum victory by some of his top
lieutenants in parliament's praesidium.
Leading this rebellion is Mr Nikolai Ryabov, a hardline Communist, who only
recently, when the president appeared to be on the ropes, jeered at both Mr
Yeltsin and his market reform plans.
Mr Khasbulatov, however, shows no sign of abandoning his campaign even
though his support is shrinking. His strategy centres on delaying as long as
possible the convening of a Congress of People's Deputies, or full
parliament, which he commands, to consider a new constitution. This will
allow time for the country's economic troubles to worsen further and for Mr
Yeltsin's referendum victory last month to be be forgotten. For the same
reason, Mr Yeltsin wants to push through a new constitution as quickly as
possible.
In addition, both men are appealing to Russia's constitutent regions and
republics for support. But in so doing they are only encouraging the
country's disintegration by weaking the credibility of the federal
institutions in Moscow.
When all the constitutional complexities are set aside, the only really
intractable issue is how powers should be divided between a previously
bloated parliament and an over-weak executive. In an apocalyptic speech to
parliament yesterday, Mr Khasbulatov warned of the dangers of bypassing the
Congress in enacting a new constitution, accused the president of wanting to
set up a dictatorship, and said a corrupt administration was destroying the
economy.
He has everything to lose from a dissolution of the Congress of People's
Deputies if a new constitution is ushered in. A native of Chechnya, which
has declared independence from Russia and declared him a persona non grata,
Mr Khasbulatov will not even be able to stand for parliament at the next
election.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Gonzalez back into battle - with his own party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, fresh from his triumph in Sunday's
general election, is being thrown quickly back into a battle for control of
his Socialist party, the outcome of which could make or break his fourth
term in office.
The row, buried during the election campaign, has resurfaced as Mr Gonzalez
prepares sweeping cabinet changes and tries to decide with which parties his
minority government will make policy arrangements solid enough to allow him
to govern for a full term.
The infighting, which became public two days after the election, is between
supporters of Mr Gonzalez, politically centrist or liberal, and the
left-wing party machine, suspicious of the conservative drift of government
policies and led by Mr Alfonso Guerra, party vice president and former
deputy prime minister.
Mr Gonzalez inclines towards making a four-year pact with the conservative
Catalan CiU while the Guerristas, fearful that Catalan fiscal rectitude
might damage their influence over the budget, prefer rolling pacts, with the
government siding with different parties on different issues.
Mr Gonzalez has to solve this. He is head of both the government and the
party but was unable earlier this year to force party administrators to
accept responsibility for a scandal over illicit party financing. The
ensuing row, during which Mr Guerra and his associates attacked the liberals
for calling themselves 'renovators who are renovators of nothing',
threatened to split the party and forced Mr Gonzalez to call the election.
While Mr Gonzalez was taking a post-election break in Andalucia on Tuesday,
Mr Guerra said on television that while much of the credit was due to Mr
Gonzalez for the Socialists' surprisingly strong performance on Sunday - in
which they lost their parliamentary majority but ended well ahead of the
conservative People's party - the party took a great deal of credit, too. By
that, he meant himself.
He and his supporters point out that the big Socialist vote was concentrated
in the left-wing strongholds of Andalucia and Extremadura and that he
produced a huge Socialist vote in his own constituency, Seville. The
Socialists also increased their vote in the Basque country, which
strengthens Mr Guerra's close party aide, Mr Jose Maria Benegas, who heads
the Basque Socialists
Most analysts agree that if Mr Gonzalez does not manage to redesign the
party executive - perhaps at a party congress to be held next January at the
latest - he will find it difficult to implement the austere fiscal policies
necessary to help Spain survive its current recession. He also needs to
address the party financing scandal much sooner, before it gets to the
courts.
Any credible way out involves finding new positions for Mr Guerra and Mr
Benegas, both of whom would resist fiercely any pressure to leave their
posts. To get their hands off the party levers, Mr Gonzalez may even try to
bring one or both of them into his next government.
But the big public test of strength between Mr Gonzalez and Mr Guerra will
come in about three weeks when the parties select their parliamentary
spokesmen. The current pro-Guerra Socialist incumbent is likely to be
removed and there is speculation that Mr Gonzalez wants to replace him with
Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, who is deeply resented by the left.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Russia wants change in G7 aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA would like to use part of its Dollars 43.4bn aid package from the
Group of Seven industrialised countries to help cover some of its Dollars
6bn unpaid debts to western companies, Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy
prime minister, indicated yesterday.
Speaking in Paris after the first meeting of the World Bank's consultative
group of 21 aid donors to Russia, Mr Shokhin was not precise about his
request for changes in the G7 aid package agreed in April and due to be
endorsed at next month's Tokyo economic summit.
But he said that Russia's inability to pay western companies was now leading
to litigation, raising at the very least the problem for Moscow of how to
pay legal fees.
He acknowledged that 'the G7 tell us not to change the (aid) package'. But,
he added, 'we feel that we need to be able to react' to developing problems.
Mr Shokhin also said that Russia 'will not be able to use about Dollars 5bn
of the Dollars 10bn it has been offered in bilateral credit, because it is
on purely commercial terms'. If Moscow were to take up the entire Dollars
43bn in aid and credit this year, it would add Dollars 3.5bn to the
country's debt servicing next year, he said.
He said Russia hoped to receive the first Dollars 1.5bn, half of its special
loan from the International Monetary Fund, by the end of this month. He
suggested that much of the second Dollars 1.5bn instalment might be used to
finance trade between Russia and its ex-Soviet partners in the Commonwealth
of Independent States.
Mr Wilfried Thalwitz, the World Bank chairman of the consultative group,
said that Mr Shokhin had strengthened donors' confidence in the Moscow
authorities' determination to proceed with reform, fight inflation and curb
money growth, and that the World Bank now planned to disburse its Dollars
4bn portion of the G7 package in 12 projects over the next 15 months.

FT  10 JUN 93 / A budget balancing act beyond the wit of man: Quentin Peel
assesses the German fiscal nightmare facing a hapless Mr Waigel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's long-suffering finance minister, let it be
known last month that he wanted to go home to the job of prime minister in
Bavaria, cynics in Bonn immediately assumed the worst.
They reckoned he had re-done his calculations and decided that the task of
balancing the budget was beyond the wit of man, even of a witty man from
Swabia.
They may well have been right. For in the few weeks since Mr Waigel tried,
and failed, to land the job in Munich, the financial figures for the coming
years have got steadily gloomier.
In the blunt words of Mrs Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy leader of the
opposition Social Democrats in the German Bundestag: 'Sheer chaos reigns in
the financial policies of this government. All the fundamental financial
figures have proved to be false, and miles removed from reality.'
Only last July, the government presented its medium-term financial plan,
suggesting a combined net borrowing requirement between 1993 and 1996 of
DM115bn (Pounds 46.7bn). According to the latest figures presented by Mr
Waigel to the finance planning council last month, that four-year deficit
will now be more like DM258bn - assuming that painful new savings of at
least DM20bn a year can be agreed. In just 10 months since the last
medium-term plan was agreed, that is an increase of 124 per cent.
Mr Waigel has been forced to go back to his colleagues in the ruling
coalition, and to the parliament, and call for a whole raft of new spending
cuts. This time, he says, they will have to include the sacred area of
social spending - whether the Social Democrats in opposition like it or not.
The finance ministry is caught between the inexorable demands of the
impoverished 'new' federal states of east Germany, the soaring costs of
paying unemployment benefit to more than 3m jobless, and the shrinking,
recession-hit tax base of once-prosperous western Germany, now feeling the
full force of the economic downturn.
Things have been looking bleak ever since the much-vaunted solidarity pact,
agreed last March between the government and opposition, and the 16 federal
states, fixed on a long-term formula to divide up their tax revenues and
responsibilities in the new united Germany.
First, the deal meant a long-term commitment to public spending transfers to
the 'new' federal states of eastern Germany, starting from a base of DM110bn
in 1995, when all their consolidated debts become a direct burden on the
federal government budget. Second, to persuade the wealthy western Lander to
go along with the deal, Mr Waigel had to give them extra tax revenues from
his own kitty of DM20bn a year. The squeeze was just beginning.
It was already clear that the 1993 budget was going to shoot way past its
planned spending of DM435.6bn, based on a modest 2 per cent growth rate from
1992, with a deficit of just DM43bn.
According to the supplementary budget now submitted to the Bundestag, the
new spending level will be DM458bn, and the new net borrowing requirement
almost DM68bn.
Since then, the joint working group which advises the finance ministry on
its future tax revenues has produced a series of devastating figures
suggesting that the recession will wreak havoc with its income expectations.
Revenues will be down DM12.76bn this year, DM45.75bn in 1994, DM56.19bn in
1995 and DM66.68bn in 1996, the experts said. The tax changes agreed in the
solidarity pact will be totally inadequate to make up the difference.
That suggests that even for 1993, a second supplementary budget will be
necessary just to keep the deficit down to a maximum DM70bn.
For 1994 and the years ahead, the deficits are set to stay around that
level: a deficit of DM71bn on spending of DM482bn in 1994; DM71bn again on
spending of DM485bn in 1995; down to DM51bn on spending of DM495bn in 1996;
and DM41bn on DM505bn in 1997.
The cost of soaring unemployment - expected to rise by 500,000 this year,
and 300,000 next, even if the economy picks up - is one big factor in the
equation. The jobless qualify for generous welfare benefits, just as they
stop paying taxes. In eastern Germany, the 1.1m officially unemployed are
more than matched by at least 1.5m 'disguised' unemployed, who receive even
more generously finance in the form of job creation schemes, retraining
allowances, and early retirement pay.
Mr Waigel wants to cut the rates of welfare benefits by around 3 per cent,
to freeze state spending, including civil service salaries, and to tackle
another sacred cow: to postpone the move to Berlin until after the year
2000.
Senior government officials believe that adequate savings will only be
possible with a new cross-party agreement - a solidarity pact mark two. They
know that any deal without cross-party support could be blocked in the
Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, where the SPD has an effective
majority. With no fewer than 19 elections looming next year at national,
state and local level, they fear that the political will to take unpopular
decisions will evaporate towards the end of the year.

FT  10 JUN 93 / New French pact aims to avoid 'second Yugoslavia'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday produced its outline for a new European security pact, to
be set in motion by the European Community as 'the first exercise' of its
common foreign policy enshrined in the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, said the aim was to draw lessons from
the 'painful experience' of the break-up of Yugoslavia and the war in
Bosnia, and to create 'a pact on security and stability in Europe' so that
wars over frontiers and minorities would not erupt elsewhere.
The plan figured in Mr Balladur's maiden speech as premier two months ago,
but President Francois Mitterrand, who himself proposed a grand European
confederation in late 1989, has actively collaborated on it since.
The two men will present the plan, which has already been discussed with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the British prime minister, Mr John Major, to
France's EC partners at the Copenhagen summit on June 21-22.
French officials denied that by calling for a new European security pact to
prevent 'a second Yugoslavia' Paris was effectively conceding the failure of
United Nations intervention in that region. But ministers told Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in Paris yesterday that France, with
nearly 5,000 troops under UN command in ex-Yugoslavia, could do no more,
though it might shift some troops from Croatia to Bosnia to help widen 'safe
havens' for Moslem refugees there.
The geographic scope of the French plan, which would involve the US and
Canada, would be focused on central and eastern Europe. But after
yesterday's cabinet discussion, Mr Balladur's spokesman said it could be
extended to the Baltic states, Russia and the most westerly states of the
ex-Soviet Union, including Ukraine, whose tug-of-war with Moscow over
nuclear missiles is worrying the west.
Nevetheless, the French plan will be seen as marginalising the 53-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose role in conflict
resolution was supposedly reinforced after the cold war.
France believes that a somewhat smaller number of European states, with the
EC taking the lead, can come up with firmer security commitments and
incentives for the continent. 'Countries wanting to join the EC could only
do so on the express condition that they first settle problems which could
threaten European security,' a cabinet statement suggested.
The security pact would not just try to freeze existing frontiers, officials
say, pointing out that early adjustments to Tito-era boundaries might have
headed off trouble in Yugoslavia. 'We want to establish agreements on good
neighbourliness, and one cannot exclude that these would lead to minor
modifications to frontiers which would then be endorsed by the (planned
security) conference,' the government spokesman said yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS should encourage economic growth by cutting subsidies to dying
industries and farming, and by squeezing social spending, Mr Otmar Issing, a
member of the Bundesbank's directorate, proposed last night.
A recent wave of suggestions for increased public expenditure to boost weak
economies reflected obsolete ideas which had been proven not to yield
permanent benefits.
'One should dispense once and for all with the illusion that public spending
programmes can produce more than a flash in a pan,' he told a meeting in
London. All that usually remained after the 'flash' was debt which had to be
serviced, he warned.
Policy-makers should instead revert to removing impediments to growth, he
demanded. European labour markets were especially inflexible because the
differential between earned income and unemployment pay was too narrow.
'Efforts to implement high social standards throughout the Community are
particularly counter-productive in periods of high unemployment,' he added.
'At a national level unnecessary regulation must be lifted and subsidies for
preserving non-viable structures must be reduced.'
He noted that problems with 'obsolete and rigid structures, such as
agriculture, steel and shipbuilding' were particularly acute in lean times.
At the international level, wide-ranging liberalisation of trade would also
improve conditions for growth. Breaking the current deadlock in the Uruguay
Round of world trade talks would in the long run result in considerable
additional growth.
Central and eastern European countries had to be given access as soon as
possible to all market sectors, 'including the sensitive ones,' Mr Issing
said. That was the only way to make real and lasting progress with reform in
the region: a process which was in other countries' interests, 'not least
those in western Europe'.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Clarke stresses growth as key to economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE yesterday set sustained economic recovery as the 'first
aim' of his chancellorship, holding out the prospect of a significant shift
in the balance of Treasury policymaking.
Emerging from two weeks of self-imposed purdah, the new chancellor stressed
that the core of the welfare state would emerge unscathed from the
government's public spending review. He flatly rejected suggestions that he
was already considering raising taxes in his November budget.
In his first detailed policy statements since replacing Mr Norman Lamont, Mr
Clarke insisted he would not abandon his predecessor's commitment to
controlling inflation and cutting the budget deficit. Low inflation and
sound public finances were a prerequisite for sustained recovery.
But, setting out his priorities in a series of speeches and interviews, he
indicated that his chancellorship would be guided by his desire to
strengthen the 'real' economy - with industry, employment and providing the
opportunity for people to 'make a living' the main concerns.
Exhibiting a streak of populism long absent from the Treasury, Mr Clarke
told the parliamentary press gallery: 'That's the point of the whole thing -
growth and employment'. The chancellor was opaque on the prospects for a
further cut in interest rates but did little to damp speculation at
Westminster that if the recovery falters he will be prepared to cut rates.
Against that he also underlined his public commitment to relative stability
of exchange rates - even though he expects sterling to remain outside the
European exchange rate mechanism during the rest of this parliament.
Last night Mr Eddie George, who be-comes governor of the Bank of England
next month, delivered a veiled warning against imminent cuts in interest
rates. Mr Clarke, while keeping his options open for the November Budget,
left the firm impression that he intends to rely on sustained economic
growth rather than further large tax increases or swingeing spending cuts to
erode much of the Pounds 50bn annual public borrowing requirement.
Mr Clarke said it was essential for the government to agree a tight spending
round in this summer's negotiations. But he added: 'Anybody who thinks I
came into politics in order to dismantle the welfare state knows nothing of
me nor my record.' His objective was to constrain tightly the growth of
public spending rather than impose absolute cuts.
Breaking with the government's insistence up to now that it would not rule
out individual possibilities, he mocked suggestions that it was planning to
introduce 'hotel' charges in NHS hospitals or to remove the exemption from
prescription charges of the elderly.
Mr Clarke dismissed as equally 'absurd' reports that he was already planning
tax increases in the November budget.
Though he refused to close any options he said: 'I'm not in favour of
raising income tax. My instincts are tax cutting . . . certainly I would not
increase taxes that might cause damage to our industrial recovery because my
first aim is to sustain that.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Bitter Lamont savages Major: Speech plunges premiership deep
into crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SAVAGE attack by Mr Norman Lamont last night plunged Mr John Major's
premiership into its gravest political crisis since he replaced Mrs Margaret
Thatcher in 1990.
The former chancellor, sacked two weeks ago in a cabinet reshuffle, told a
spellbound House of Commons that Mr Major's beleaguered administration acted
as if it was 'in office but not in power'.
Clearly relishing his revenge, Mr Lamont warned that unless it abandoned its
preoccupation with opinion polls and newspaper headlines, 'the government
will not survive and will not deserve to survive'.
Directing his comments at the prime minister's leadership, he said: 'There
is something wrong with the way we make our decisions. The government
listens too much to the pollsters and the party managers . . . There is too
much short-termism, too much reacting to events, not enough shaping of
events.'
His speech lacked the devastating political force of those delivered by the
then Mr Nigel Lawson and Sir Geoffrey Howe in the final stages of the
Thatcher era.
After the crises of the past few months, ministers and Conservative MPs were
left wondering nonetheless whether Mr Major's premiership would now survive
the rest of the year.
But there is no obvious challenger to the prime minister. His close friends
were also taking comfort last night from signs of a backlash against Mr
Lamont for what one minister described as the former chancellor's
'self-serving disloyalty'.
With the prime minister sitting, white-faced, in the Commons chamber, Mr
Lamont said he had tried vainly for two-and-a-half years to persuade him to
give independence to the Bank of England.
As the bitterness seeped slowly through his 20-minute resignation speech, Mr
Lamont also accused the prime minister of undermining the credibility of
economic policy by allowing bad political news to dictate the timing of
interest rate cuts. Friends said later he had been referring to the 1
percentage point cut in rates to 6 per cent at the start of this year.
Exposing the struggle which led eventually to his dismissal, Mr Lamont
claimed that, after the humiliation of sterling's withdrawal from the
European exchange rate mechanism last September, Mr Major had told him not
to resign.
By implication he also blamed Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party
chairman, and Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, for forcing Mr Major to sack
him.
Mr Lamont's attack - the latest in a series of blows to Mr Major's political
authority - overshadowed a concerted attempt by the prime minister and by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, to relaunch the government's economic
strategy.
Mr Major told MPs that he saw little prospect of sterling's return to the
ERM during this parliament, while Mr Clarke emphasised in a series of
interviews and speeches that his priority was to sustain the economic
recovery.
Mr Lamont's speech also provided a perfect platform for Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader, to launch a scathing personal attack on the prime minister's
leadership.
While Mr Smith ridiculed the government's economic management, Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, predicted that Mr Lamont's on-slaught
marked the beginning of the end of Mr Major's leadership.
The prime minister struggled to play down the significance of the attack -
suggesting, for example, that he would have supported the idea of an
independent central bank if ways could have been found to preserve
democratic accountability.
Mr Major was driven to respond to Mr Lamont's uncompromising defence of his
record in the Treasury with the sharp retort: 'A strong government needs
political skills as well when leading a democratic society and, in
particular, handling a lively House of Commons with a small majority.'
Mr Clarke strongly defended the prime minister and dismissed suggestions
that he was poised to replace him. He said he did not recognise the former
chancellor's description of the way the government operated.
But the grim faces on the Tory benches and the lack of conviction with which
many called on colleagues to rally round the prime minister suggested that
Mr Lamont's charges had struck a dangerous chord. Mr Lamont's accusation
that Mr Major prefers to react to events rather than shape them mirrored
recent grumbling among Tory MPs. Some senior figures warned that unless Mr
Major re-established his grip on the government by autumn there would be
strong pressure for him to stand down.
During a speech in which he absolved himself of any blame for the economic
problems of the past few years, Mr Lamont dwelt on the events which had led
to last September's ERM debacle.
He said that at one point he had suggested sterling's suspension from the
system, although he admitted that this would not have been in time to
prevent Black Wednesday. Suggesting that he had then been ready to resign, a
view rejected immediately by the prime minister's office, Mr Lamont said he
had remained as chancellor because of loyalty to the prime minister.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Lloyd's agent applies to hardship fund over losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY GOODA, who re-cruited Names to some of the highest loss-making
syndicates at Lloyd's, has applied to the insurance market's hardship
committee to help him avert possible bankruptcy.
Mr Gooda's losses from syndicates 164, 290, 298 and 299, between 1988 and
1990, amount to just over Pounds 1m.
It has also emerged that Gooda &amp; Partners, the 'members' agency' formerly
chaired by Mr Gooda, is under investigation by Lloyd's regulators as part of
a wider probe into the affairs of Gooda Walker's Lloyd's agency businesses.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, wrote to a Gooda Name last
week confirming that an inquiry was under way and that its terms of
reference were 'as wide as they need to be to address all the issues that
have been raised and that this embraces the activities of both the members'
agency and the managing agency'.
Seven insurance syndicates managed by Gooda Walker account for about one
sixth of the more than Pounds 6bn in losses suffered by Lloyd's in the past
five years. Lloyd's is expected to report record losses of up to Pounds
2.8bn for 1990 - its latest underwriting year - later this month.
Speaking from his home in Coneyhurst, West Sussex, this week, Mr Gooda said
he still had to supply additional information to the hardship committee and
had received 'no offer as yet'.
The committee reschedules the debts of those Names - the individuals whose
assets support the insurance market - who are unable to pay their losses,
allowing them to avert bankruptcy and retain a home and a modest income.
More than 250 Names joined the market through Mr Gooda's agency. Many of
them face losses of more than Pounds 500,000 each and are among the hardest
hit in the insurance market.
A number of Gooda &amp; Partners' Names allege they asked Mr Gooda not to be
placed on high-risk syndicates when they joined the market.
They also allege they were not advised to buy stop-loss insurance - a
personal reinsurance policy - and that they were not kept informed about the
deterioration in their results.
When questioned about these concerns, Mr Gooda said it was the policy of
Gooda &amp; Partners, now in liquidation, to channel smaller Names' investments
into Gooda Walker syndicates, three of which were leaders in the catastrophe
reinsurance market, where syndicates covered high-level losses of other
syndicates and companies. He said he told Names he had no stop-loss
insurance for himself, and had 'explained the principle of unlimited
liability', although 'no promises were made for the future'.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Andreotti may face murder link charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROME magistrates yesterday announced that they wanted to press charges
against Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister of Italy, for
allegedly organising the murder of a journalist in 1979.
It is the first time a former European leader has been faced with such
allegations. The announcement is a further devastating blow to the
reputation of the veteran Christian Democrat politician. Last month
parliament agreed to waive Mr Andreotti's immunity as a life senator to face
charges of consorting with the Mafia.
Mr Andreotti reacted strongly to yesterday's announcement. 'I don't wish to
avoid facing justice like any other citizen, but I must raise my voice in
moral indignation at this attempt to lynch me. I hope it can be unmasked as
soon as possible,' he said.
The latest move follows a long interrogation of Mr Andreotti on May 25 in
connection with the killing of Mr Mino Pecorelli. He was a journalist who
published OP, a small magazine that peddled, in cryptic language, inside
information about politics, the security services and the Mafia.
Mr Pecorelli was a member of the secret masonic lodge P2. His death is
widely believed to involve some of the murkiest aspects of recent Italian
history linking politicians, the Mafia and the security services.
The murder was seen as an attempt to silence an inconvenient voice. He is
reported to have had sensitive information about the kidnap and murder of Mr
Aldo Moro, the Christian Democrat prime minister, by the leftwing terrorist
group, the Red Brigades. Ten years of investigations ending in 1992 failed
to find those responsible for Mr Pecorelli's death.
But last April Palermo magistrates are understood to have questioned Mr
Tommaso Buscetta, the Mafia 'supergrass' living in the US, about his
allegations that Mr Andreotti was linked to the Pecorelli killing. Mr
Buscetta claimed the murder itself was carried out by Cosa Nostra, the
umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia.
He also alleged that Mr Andreotti was behind the murder in 1982 of General
Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa, the Palermo police chief, who was reported to
have been killed because he too knew secrets about the Moro kidnap.
Rome magistrates yesterday indicated they were asking parliament to waive Mr
Andreotti's immunity not solely on the basis of Mr Buscetta's information.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: New brands help Seton Healthcare to Pounds
6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SETON Healthcare, the medical products and sports equipment group which has
expanded rapidly since coming to the market two years ago, has turned in a
strong growth in profits.
Under FRS 3, restated pre-tax profits for the year to February 28 increased
from Pounds 2.84m to Pounds 6.1m, but last year's figure was depressed by an
exceptional charge of Pounds 1.49m. Adjusting for the exceptional losses,
profits growth was 41 per cent.
Turnover rose by 4 per cent, from Pounds 37.2m to Pounds 38.6m. The group
said operating profit as a percentage of sales had increased from 13.7 to
17.1 per cent and a further improvement was predicted.
Seton's acquisition focus has been on over-the-counter brands, which now
account for more than 25 per cent of sales. Four acquisitions - Mycota,
Betadine, Cupal and some brands from Crookes - were completed during the
year at a cost ofPounds 14.2m.
The healthcare division's sales increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 33.6m.
Taking account of acquisitions and disposals, its underlying organic growth
rate was 8 per cent, and operating profits rose from Pounds 4.54m to Pounds
5.98m. The group said the brands acquired had helped it to become one of the
top 10 companies in terms of OTC sales to UK pharmacies.
The sports and leisure division's sales dipped from Pounds 5.56m to Pounds
5m, but its operating profits were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 605,000,
which Mr Iain Cater, Seton's chief executive, described as an outstanding
performance.
Adjusting for the exceptionals, earnings per share rose by 28 per cent to
16.3p (12.7p). A final dividend of 4.1p (3.6p) gives a total for the year of
5.8p (5.1p).
COMMENT
These results maintain Seton's impressive track record. The increased
profitability partly reflects the group's move towards higher-margin OTC
products, but also shows the benefits of increased economies of scale in
manufacture and distribution. The sports business - selling shin guards and
goalkeeper's gloves - is also well placed for any recovery in spending.
However, the group now has quite a lot to digest, and will invest Pounds
4m-Pounds 5m in a new facility in Oldham over the next two years. Forecast
earnings of Pounds 8.1m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 19.5.
That looks up with events, particularly since the company will not hesitate
to come to the market to fund further acquisitions.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: US-style home shopping for
Europe

<TEXT>
ROUND-the-clock TV shopping will be imported to Europe next October,
according to an agreement reached yesterday between QVC, the US 'home
shopping' specialist, and BSkyB, the satellite broadcasting company, which
is 50 per cent owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and in which
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, also has a significant stake.
The two companies announced that they had agreed to form a 50:50 joint
venture company to create an 'electronic retailing' programme service in
London. The programmes will be produced live, and are due to be broadcast
from October 1.
The plan provides for the TV shopping service to be available 24 hours a
day, and the service will be dis-tributed through the same satellite and
cable systems as BSkyB.
Neither QVC nor BSkyB would comment on the costs of setting up the venture,
nor on the type of merchandise which is likely to be displayed. However, QVC
said it would be broadly similar to its existing US service.
Of the two biggest home shopping networks in the US, QVC - which reaches 47m
homes via cable and satellite - is the more upmarket. It recently struck a
deal with Saks Fifth Avenue, for example, under which the New York-based
retailer agreed to sell merchandise through the QVC network.
The deal also reunites Mr Barry Diller, former head of Fox Inc, with Mr
Murdoch's media network. Mr Diller, who resigned as chairman of the Fox film
and television studio in February 1992, became chairman of QVC in January
this year, having acquired a tranche of the home shopping network's equity.
Home shopping has had a mixed history in the US, and is still dogged by a
downmarket image.
A number of big retailers, such as J. C. Penney and Dayton Hudson, toyed
with the concept, but eventually decided against it.
However, partly due to Mr Diller's programming skills and partly due to
technical advances, there have been suggestions that home shopping may be
gaining more respectability.
A number of department store chains have expressed renewed interest in TV
shopping, and R. H. Macy has revealed plans to launch 'TV Macy's', a home
shopping service, on Cablevision systems.

NEWPORT News Shipbuilding, a subsidiary of the US industrial conglomerate
Tenneco, will close its Asheville Industries plant, and lay off 1,000
workers, in response to declining submarine and aircraft carrier work.
Newport has recently suffered from cuts in spending by the US navy, its main
customer, which have only been partly offset by efforts to diversify into
the commercial shipbuilding market.
The company posted revenues of Dollars 2.3bn last year, 17 per cent of
Tenneco's total turnover.
Newport News will close the Asheville plant by June next year, gradually
laying off its 500 workers over the next 12 months, and cut back operations
in Newport News shipyard where 500 workers are to lose their jobs, most from
next week.
Mr Pat Phillips, chief executive at Newport News, said that because of
delays in US navy orders, the lay-offs and closure were essential in order
to keep the shipbuilder competitive.
In recent years Tenneco has cut costs in various subsidiaries, with
improvement most marked in Case, the troubled farm and construction unit.

<TEXT>
CONTROL OF Canada's second largest food distributor, the Montreal-based
Univa, with sales of more than CDollars 5bn (USDollars 3.9bn), is again in
play.
E. M. Warburg Pincus, the New York investment group, has dropped its offer
to buy 26 per cent of Univa from Montreal entrepreneur Mr Bertin Nadeau's
Unigesco. The price was to have been CDollars 8.85 a share, or about
CDollars 200m. This would have allowed Unigesco to repay debt due in the
next year.
Unigesco said it had begun negotiations to sell its Univa holding with
unidentified Quebec institutions.
The second biggest holder of Univa is the Sobey family of Novia Scotia with
25 per cent. However, this block is potentially for sale.
The next biggest holder is the Caisse de Depot, Quebec's CDollars 42bn
public pension fund, with 13.5 per cent. The Caisse has already indicated it
wants to keep effective control of Univa in Quebec.
Earlier this year the Caisse opposed a CDollars 11 a share bid from New York
investment bankers Blackstone Group for all Univa shares, totalling about
CDollars 1bn. The Caisse said the leveraged buy-out proposed would have
loaded Univa with excessive debt.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Recruitment widens Proteus loss to Pounds
3.55m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROTEUS, the computer-aided molecular modelling company, reported increased
losses of Pounds 3.55m in the year to end-March, but said it was making
'exceptional' progress in its development programme.
Increased expenditure - including the cost of boosting the number of PhD's
employed to 80 - led to an increase from the previous year's deficit of
Pounds 2.41m, in line with the company's expectations.
This expenditure meant all scheduled work could be supported for the
foreseeable future.
Losses per share rose from 10.86p to 13.52p.
Despite not making a profit since it floated on the Unlisted Securities
Market in 1990, the share price has almost defied gravity, rising from a
launch price of 84p to yesterday's 368p, down 11p.
This capitalises the company at over Pounds 100m, the largest of the blue
sky high-technology pharmaceutical companies quoted in the UK that are yet
to make a profit.
Mr Kevin Gilmore, chairman said there had been particular progress in
HIV/Aids, DNA-binding drugs, fish fertility control, animal immunocastration
and arthritis.
Shareholders had to date invested on faith and belief; but within 18 months
to two years, the group should produce its first revenue streams, he said.
Within the next year the group would be forming joint ventures with large
international companies for the marketing of the drugs coming through.
Among the first likely to come to the market were a diagnostic for
Tuberculosis and one for BSE and scrapie in cattle and sheep respectively.
Mr Gilmore said the value of the potential markets these could serve was not
reflected in the share price.
He added that six products were now heading for clinical trials or the
veterinary equivalent.
Mr Gilmore said he would not hesitate to go back to the market to raise more
capital if there was proper justification.

The sale of Cosipa, Brazil's third largest steel firm, has been postponed
from July 13 to August 4, Bill Hinchberger writes from Sao Paulo. The delay
will allow the government time to cut Cosipa's debt and restructure the
sell-off so that it retains a number of non-voting shares.
The Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange has also cancelled the sale of the
government's 35 per cent share in Petrocoque, a petrochemical company. Its
three private sector partners declined to raise their participation, and no
other bidders were found for the shares, valued at Dollars 20m. The
Petrocoque shares will now be sold along with Petroquimica Uniao (PQU), the
anchor of the Sao Paulo petrochemical complex, on August 20.

BILFINGER und Berger Bau, the German construction group, said domestic
orders rose by 11.4 per cent during the first four months of 1993 to
DM1.20bn, Reuter reports from Mannheim.
However, foreign orders fell by 16 per cent to DM813 m for an overall 1.6
per cent decline, Mr Christian Roth, the chairman said.
Output in the period fell by 4.5 per cent to DM1.73bn. Domestic output rose
by 13.2 per cent to DM1.06bn, but foreign output fell 23.5 per cent to
DM667bn. The decline was due to the winding down of major foreign projects
which has not yet been compensated for with new orders.
Bilfinger's biggest foreign contribution to output in 1992 came from
Nigeria, where it handled a number of projects stemming from the move of the
Nigerian capital to Abuja from Lagos.
Other projects included the completion of the Challawa Gorge Dam near Kano
and a mosque and hospital in Minna.

<TEXT>
EKOSTAHL, eastern Germany's large steel plant, will make another attempt at
seeking subsidies from the European Community aimed at modernising the
plant, preparing it for privatisation and saving the remaining 3,200 jobs.
Officials from the Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising eastern
German industry, and which owns Ekostahl, yesterday said a revised plan
designed to modernise the cold rolling mill and construct a mini-mill would
be presented to Brussels by the autumn.
'Without subsidies and giving Ekostahl a chance to compete in Germany, it
will be impossible to find buyers for the mill,' a Treuhand spokesperson
said yesterday. Treuhand officials, however, are concerned about what social
and political impact Ekostahl's closure would have on the local region which
is dependent on the mill.
Ekostahl applied last April for subsidies totalling DM1.2bn (Dollars 740m),
but had insisted they would be linked to reducing capacity. The EC rejected
that application on the grounds it would add to overcapacity in Europe.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Abkhazia firm on independence demand: Georgia's stubborn
Black Sea secessionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Vladislav Ardzinba, leader of Georgia's secessionist region of Abkhazia,
says the Black Sea resort strip is not retreating from its declaration of
independence, and that he is formally seeking federation with Russia.
Although a ceasefire in Georgia'a nine-month war seems to be holding, Mr
Ardzinba's position illustrates the difficulties of achieving sustained
peace in the region.
In refusing, at least publicly, to budge on the question of Georgian
sovereignty over Abkhazia's 530,000 people, Mr Ardzinba matches the severity
of Georgian nationalists, who insist that Abkhazia must stay firmly in their
country.
'A big nation cannot force its will on a small nation. Otherwise we would
not be living in the 20th century. It would be like the past,' Mr Ardzinba
said in the breakaway Abkhazian capital of Gudauta.
After months of acrimony between officials in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi and Gudauta war broke out last August when Georgia's National Guard
leader, Mr Tengiz Kitovani, sent tanks into the port city of Sukhumi. Mr
Ardzinba retreated to Gudauta, and the Georgians dug in at Sukhumi.
Abkhazians have been fighting for greater autonomy since at least 1978, when
an uprising was crushed. Georgia points out that Abkhazians comprise just 17
per cent of Abkhazia's population, and so do not merit independence, but Mr
Ardzinba asserts that former Soviet leader Josef Stalin purposely diluted
the population by resettling Georgians, Russians and Armenians.
The fighting since has raised tensions between Russia and Georgia and,
according to Georgia's leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, threatened to bring
Moscow and Tbilisi into direct conflict. Mr Shevardnadze has long accused
Russia of giving military help to the Abkhazians, and Russian complicity on
the rebel side is evident.
In one example, a Russian airborne unit based at Gudauta has enforced an air
exclusion zone over Abkhazia and, though a few Georgian sorties have
penetrated, has warned Georgia not to bomb.
At the same time, the Russians have placed no such net over Georgian forces,
and Georgia-controlled Sukhumi is often the target of bombing runs. A
separate matter is who is flying the bombers over Sukhumi.
Mr Shevardnadze blames Russia outright, though Moscow denies this.
Tensions have eased since Mr Shevardnadze dismissed the hawkish Mr Kitovani,
and he and Russia's president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, signed a ceasefire
agreement that went into effect last month.
The truce requires both sides to withdraw heavy artillery from the front
line. Meanwhile Mr Yeltsin's special envoy on Abkhazia, Mr Boris Pastoukov,
has been shuttling between Mr Ardzinba and Mr Shevardnadze to find common
ground. But the gulf separating the combatants remains wide.
Mr Ardzinba compared Mr Shevardnadze to some of history's most brutal
leaders. 'His policy toward Abkhazia is like Hitler or Mussolini, because it
is based on the ideology of Nazism,' said Mr Ardzinba, who is an academic
specialist in cuneiform, Hittite language.
Saying that Georgia was increasingly alienating itself from Abkhazians, Mr
Ardzinba said he would agree only to ceding some matters, such as foreign
policy, to Georgia or Russia.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa will meet Solidarity leaders today to discuss pay
demands over which the trade union is threatening to call a general strike,
Reuter reports.
According to Mr Marian Krzaklewski, Solidarity chairman, the talks in Warsaw
will cover union demands for pay rises in the public sector and changes in
economic policy. 'I do not expect that after these talks everything will
change in Poland, but we would be satisfied if we got a positive response to
some of our demands,' he said.
Solidarity helped bring down Poland's government last month by calling a
parliamentary confidence vote after Ms Hanna Suchocka, the prime minister,
refused their pay demands. The union repeated threats to call a nationwide
strike if its demands were not met after Mr Walesa dissolved parliament and
asked Ms Suchocka to stay on until elections on September 19.

and commerce - The area's universities have a key role
</HEADLINE>

AS in many other British cities, the universities in Sheffield are playing a
growing role in developing the regional economy, an inevitable result of
government pressure on institutions of higher learning to be more
businesslike in running themselves.
This has meant looking for sources of finance other than government grants.
In turn, this has led to closer links with industry through research and
study contracts.
But it also owes something to the phenomenon that with the shrinking of
manufacturing, the universities are becoming important players in new
service and high technology sectors, both as employers and businesses in
their own right and as trainers and teachers of skills for new as well as
traditional industries.
Sheffield now has two universities. The University of Sheffield was created
in 1905 out of the Sheffield Medical School, Firth College and the Sheffield
Technical School. This university has a staff of 4,017, which makes it the
third largest employer in the city after Sheffield City Council with 25,000
and Sheffield Health Authority with 12,800.
There is also Sheffield Hallam University which until last autumn was
Sheffield Polytechnic. Sheffield Hallam employs 2,559. Between them the
universities have over 20,000 full time students and over 30,000 part-time
and full time.
Ms Denise Annett, head of communications at Sheffield Hallam, dates the
strong growth of the university as a business institution not from the
change to university status last year but from its release from local
government control in 1989.
'It was then that student numbers and, accordingly, income, really began to
climb,' says Ms Annett. 'With 20,000 students, income in 1991-92 was Pounds
70m, 46 per cent from national funding.'
There has been a significant increase in income from other sources since
1986/87, albeit from a low base.
Whether as a increasingly independent institution or an adjunct of local
government, Hallam has always had a strong vocational bias. Ms Annett says:
'Courses in our 12 schools are drawn up in consultation with both local
employers and national employer institutions. We run a lot of sandwich
courses and we're always on the lookout for sponsorship and funding. We want
our students to go into jobs when they leave here. In hiring staff we try
and ensure a strong teaching background.'
Research is not spurned altogether, although research and consultancy only
accounted for 4 per cent of income in 1991/92. There is a Metals Research
Institute. It earned Pounds 2.5m through consultancy and other projects in
1991/92. Various of the schools also undertake research and consultancy -
the business school is undertaking a project on the coalfield closures for a
nearby local council. The school of leisure and food management is involved
in tourism and leisure projects.
Other ways that Sheffield Hallam University is involved with the local
community include close links with the local training and enterprise council
and the Sheffield Development Corporation - 'we are usually included when
there are delegations to London to see ministers or government departments,'
says Ms Annett.
In contrast to Sheffield Hallam, the University of Sheffield emphasises both
teaching and research. In his foreword to the 1991/92 annual report,
Professor Gareth Roberts, the vice-chancellor says: 'It seems inevitable
that an even more diverse system of universities will emerge during the
nineties. The University of Sheffield can expect to be in the top echelon of
institutions that combine teaching and research in almost equal measure.'
The university has 30 research units grouped in the eight faculties. There
are also three trading companies and 19 specialist advisory services for
industry and commerce operating within the university. Research grant
contract income was Pounds 23m in 1991/92, an increase of 19 per cent over
the previous year. This was out of a total income of Pounds 119m in 1991/92.
The university has strong links with the local economy through its research
programme. In order to take this process further the university last month
launched the University of Sheffield Regional Office. This will provide a
focal point for the establishment of partnerships with local private and
public sector organisations.
One of the first tasks for the Regional Office was to set up Plus the
acronymic title for Project Link University of Sheffield. It is a scheme
which helps businesses and public sector organisations such as hospitals to
harness specialist expertise through collaborative student project work.
Dr Marilyn Wedgwood, director of the regional office says: 'Undergraduates
and post-graduates will work on project topics which bring practical
benefits to organisations. Project topics are identified by the organisation
and students complete the project as part of their work.'
It is still early days for Plus, but a directory of subjects shows that out
of 300 topics available for post graduates, some 175 are in the field of
landscape, 45 in computer science and 120 in the field of leisure.
The regional office is looking at ways the university can involve itself in
local economic regeneration and how it can establish fora and clubs. This
should help the university to become more closely involved in the Sheffield
economy.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (6): The omens are good - Groundwork
paves the way for further investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ON PAPER, the Sheffield Development Corporation, established in 1988 to lead
the drive for new investment, has done well.
It has spent Pounds 65.6m, largely on land acquisition and reclamation, in
the last five years and has levered out Pounds 511m of private sector
investment. Around 9,000 full-time equivalent jobs have been created.
However, a large portion of this private sector investment has gone into the
Meadowhall shopping complex. This cost Pounds 270m to build and substantial
further investment was made on fitting out the centre. Meadowhall now
employs 7,000.
Planning permission for Meadowhall was granted in 1987, before the SDC was
designated by government, so it does not claim credit for it. Elsewhere on
the 2,000 acres of the Lower Don Valley covered by the SDC, the Don Valley
Stadium and the Sheffield Arena have been built. But these were initiated
and paid for by the city council for the World Student games in 1991.
However, Abbey National has taken up a some 60,000 sq ft of space in the
Carbrook Business Park, close to Meadowhall and Junction 34 of the M1,
although the company employs only 200.
Sheffield's two big relocations were long before the SDC's time - and
outside its area. The Manpower Services Commission - now the Training Agency
 -brought in 2,000 jobs, while Midland Bank set up a headquarters operation
in the late 1970s, which also now employs about 2,000.
The only significant recent job-creating relocation has been Norwich Union
in 1990, with 1,300 now employed. Also, the SDC received a blow last year
when the Royal Armouries museum - an important tourist attraction - looked
certain to relocate from the Tower of London to Sheffield but switched to
Leeds after failing to agree Sheffield's terms.
The overall result is Sheffield has clearly not done as well as other
northern cities out of Britain's buoyant economy and vibrant property
developments of the late 1980s. However, there are good reasons for this.
Sheffield had been a predominantly industrial town right up until the 1980s.
Service companies tended to go to Leeds or Manchester. There was, and
remains, a shortage of office space in Sheffield. Little was built
speculatively.
Moreover, the SDC did not have time to get sites ready to bid for the main
wave of government department relocations, which were decided on at the end
of the 1980s: it had far too difficult a job on its hands.
The Lower Don Valley had been the heartland of the old steel industry. It
was full of heavy, dirty, ground-contaminating factories. The land they
stood on was in widely fragmented ownership and there were still working
factories there employing 18,000 people.
The SDC had to spend its first years not only assembling land but also
reclaiming and servicing it.
So far, it has bought and assembled 430 acres, and reclaimed 290 acres. Some
80 acres have been landscaped. The SDC has also done something about the
internal infrastructure. Several kilometres of a spine road have been built.
Work has started on the first phase of the Pounds 240m Supertram project, a
light rail system running from Meadowhall to the city centre, which will
eventually form part of a citywide network.
Recession has also bitten: a proposed short-take-off-and landing airport has
stalled because the developer has gone out of business. However, much of the
work has been done on the project and there are hopes another developer will
take over.
NOW that the ground work has been completed what are the prospects for
Sheffield? The omens are good.
Mr Graham Kendall, the SDC's chief executive, estimates there is room for
7.5m sq ft of floorspace on the sites either prepared or being prepared.
A start has been made in speculative development. The SDC has an agreement
with Glenlivet Properties for a high quality office development close to the
city centre to be called Nunnery square. Eventually this could amount to
150,000 sq ft. This year Pounds 3m is being committed to the first 20,000 sq
ft.
Mr Kendall says: 'We feel high technology companies related to the steel
industry will be attracted because of the infrastructure and the skilled
labour.'
There is also a good chance back-office, white-collar jobs will come because
of the availability their kind of labour. Relocation
of the Norwich Union insurance company helps explain why.
The company was having difficulty filling jobs in Norwich. It was 1988, the
height of the economic boom. The Norwich was running out of labour: it could
already provide jobs for every school leaver in Norfolk with 3 GCSEs.
In Sheffield - fundamentally a blue-collar city with a relative imbalance
between manufacturing and service sector jobs - it found white-collar labour
in abundance.
Mr Stuart Reynolds of the Development Office says: 'Unlike Leeds and other
popular relocation cities in the 1980s the potential office labour had not
been mopped up.'
Also, the accommodation was cheap - Pounds 10 a sq ft. It is now Pounds 13 a
sq ft, which is substantially different to the current Pounds 19 a sq ft in
Leeds.
Mr Andrew Sabire, the chairman of Glenlivet properties says: 'We are hoping
to establish Pounds 15 a sq ft as a prime rent for Sheffield. Our
development will be only a minute or two from the M1 and there will be
plenty of free car parking. I feel that Sheffield could be the big people
provider of the 1990s.'
The SDC has had its lifespan extended by two years until 1997 to ensure the
regeneration process continues, much to the relief of Mr Hugh Sykes, its
chairman, who feels its task has proved bigger than the government first
anticipated.
The cost - at Pounds 10m of year of government funding - is modest, but the
impact ought to be telling. Mr Sykes is keen to improve some obvious
lingering eyesores, such as the canal basin end of the SDC's territory near
the city centre, where recession caused two false starts to attempts at
regenerating it.
He has also been a key influence with the city council on encouraging an
ongoing study of what to do about the city centre, which looks rundown and
shabby in parts. The two universities and the chamber of commerce are
involved.
Importantly, the city council and SDC now seem more of team than ever
before, the previous council regime having initially felt it should have run
any development corporation and giving the SDC only grudging acceptance.
Mr Sykes, a prominent Conservative with good government contacts, is a
central player in Sheffield with Mr Mike Bower, who became the Labour
council's leader only a year ago.
'It would be foolish to say everything will be choc-a-bloc by 1997,' Mr
Sykes says, 'but we will have changed the nature of the Lower Don Valley by
then. It certainly will not be derelict.'

FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (5): Grasping sharp nettles - Pragmatism
at the Town Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Sheffield City Council staged the World Student Games last year, it was
a bizarre mixture of triumph and fiasco. This year, it persuaded most of its
25,000-strong workforce to accept a pay cut to avoid job losses, winning
widespread approval for its pragmatism.
These two events say much about how the Labour-controlled council is
changing from the Thatcher era when it was one of the most radical on the
left.
Mike Bower, leader for the last 12 months, explains: 'In the mid-1980s it
was deliberate council policy to maintain employment. Employment in the
steel industry crashed from 52,000 to 16,000. The council's reaction was
understandable.'
The council fell out with the business community as unemployment worsened
and business rates - the tax it levy could locally on the private sector -
rose.
Detente was not widely apparent until the Conservative general election
victory in 1987, when both sides realised they had got to recognise reality
and work together.
The World Student Games were supposed to cement relations and spark
regeneration, but everyone discovered too late they were virtually
unmarketable to television, the crucial medium for attracting enough
sponsorship to run them at a profit.
By then, the council had borrowed Pounds 157m to build sports facilities and
the city was committed.
After bitter recriminations in the winter of 1990-91, council and private
sector tried to patch up the problems, but the company set up to run them
had to be liquidated. The council then took over, staged an impressive
games, but overran their budgeted loss by Pounds 5m and could not explain
why.
The District Auditor, the government's watchdog on council spending, blamed
bad management and incompetence. Sheffield's embarrassment was tangible and
many in the private sector still cringe about it.
'However, the games were good and enjoyable,' says Mr Alan Bamford of Henry
Boot, who was president of the chamber of commerce at the time.
'We should make the best use of the facilities now we have them.'
Mr Ray Douglas, the Master Cutler, says: 'The council made a cock-up of the
finances, but in every other respect the event was successful and we now
have some excellent facilities.'
'Forget the games,' says Mr Vernon Smith, chief executive of BSC Industry,
the economic regeneration arm of British Steel.
'We should not be looking at a city of 500,000 people and saying all we have
by way of facilities is a couple of Victorian football grounds. What we have
now are the sort of things good cities of this size actually need. Everyone
has to live, work and play.'
Mr John Hambidge, chief executive of the chamber, says public attitudes are
softening as the arena - voted one of the best in Europe for concert tours -
swimming pool and stadium bring in events and revenue to the city. The
dimming of memories of the fiasco will undoubtedly help Mr Bower. He is a
former journalist, trades union official and head of the Co-operative
Development Agency in Sheffield.
'A practical man with a background in negotiations who is used to stitching
deals together,' says Mr Hambidge. This appeals to business leaders.
The vote by the council workforce to help solve a budget crisis and avoid up
to 1,800 sackings by taking a pay cut has particularly impressed them.
Mr Bower meets business, development corporation, university and local media
leaders once a month for breakfast to discuss strategy. Meetings are
discreet, with no publicity. The group is known as the 'A-Team.'
'The city and the development corporation are the most important players,'
says Mr Hugh Sykes, chairman of the latter.
'The old partnership between the council and the city was more of a front
which took a high profile and claimed too much credit. The A-Team is
deliberately lower key.'
The team is planning to appoint a chief executive to act as enabler and
progress chaser. This will overcome Mr Hambidge's criticism that too many
things are as yet merely talked about rather than done.
Meanwhile, everyone knows the pay-cut-for-jobs deal will buy only a year's
respite because the council is still overstaffed from the days when it saw
its priority as providing jobs. The introduction of the uniform business
rate by the government has stopped it making local businesses bridge
deficits.
Mr Bower wants to trim numbers but not services - 'there are savings to be
made in middle management,' he says.
'We employ a lot of people on supervision or in administration. I don't
believe it's all necessary. Lots of people are not adding value. We will
eliminate many of these posts.'
He will have the necessary political support because the Labour group of
backbench councillors last month voted out of leadership seven of the left's
more prominent figures.
Ever the diplomat, Mr Bower plays down this shift towards the centre of the
political spectrum as an internal convulsion in the Labour group, but it is
obvious a sea change has taken place, or he would not be able to act as he
does.
'It is better to work with government than against it. The climate seems to
be improving,' he says. Budgetary constraints are regretted, but will be
addressed - 'the former impression of chaos and crisis has been replaced by
an orderly approach to a difficult situation,' he adds.
On the World Student Games: 'It was not bad luck; it was bad organisation.
We didn't organise properly and it's a mistake we don't intend to repeat,'
he avers.
'Our strategy now is to maintain the manufacturing base and develop it. No
one believes that is going to get us back to previous levels of employment,
but we have to concentrate on getting the ingredients needed for investment
right.'
Even the most grudging members of the private sector will not quarrel with
that.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (4): Restructured steel industry cuts
costs - The city's traditional manufacturing sector has greatly improved
productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS befits the director of marketing and product development of British
Steel, Raymond Douglas is fierce advocate of his industry. 'Contrary to
popular belief,' he growls, 'the steel industry has not, and I repeat not,
collapsed in Sheffield.'
He is also Master Cutler this year - for ceremonial purposes the symbolic
embodiment of Sheffield manufacturing. 'The last peak in steel production
here was 1942. There were 176 furnaces and they produced 1.9m tonnes. Last
year we made 2.25m tonnes out of seven furnaces,' he says.
Why people think steelmaking collapsed was because of the loss of jobs from
1974 as the industry restructured. In 12 years of turmoil, eight large
companies closed, creating instant dereliction in a third of the Lower Don
Valley, a seven-mile stretch of industrial history.
At least 18,000 jobs were lost in the valley alone and Sheffield's
unemployment rate was more than quadrupled to 18 per cent. Small wonder
people thought Sheffield's steel industry had gone the way of Corby's,
Scunthorpe's or Consett's.
Last year's production proves otherwise, but tells only half the story, for
the 2.25m tonnes from seven furnaces were produced with only one-eighth of
the labour force it would have taken 20 years ago.
Reconstruction continues. In the last 12 months, British Steel Stainless has
merged with Avesta, the Swedish producer, to form Avesta Sheffield. The new
company is bidding for European leadership, claiming a wider range of grades
and products than any competitor.
Meanwhile, United Engineering Steels, with plant at Stocksbridge and nearby
Rotherham, is larger than Thyssen and Krupp in this sector, producing high
integrity steels for the aerospace, power generation and automotive
industries.
Inevitably, recession is hurting. Mr Douglas says: 'Everyone is going flat
out, but prices have dropped 30 per cent in two years. We are surviving only
because we are now the lowest-cost steel producers in the world.'
There is a large element of vertical integration in Sheffield's steel
industry, with steel makers supplying local steel processors. Restructuring
has ensured their survival, despite uncontrollable outside economic factors.
Mr William Cook, chairman of Andrew Cook, which makes steel castings, adds:
'Had it not been for our ejection from the ERM we would have been in
desperate trouble.
'About 80 per cent of my products are exported, either directly or
indirectly in things like construction or mining equipment, power generation
plant, offshore oil equipment, fork lift trucks or general engineering
products.'
Sales have gone from Pounds 135m at their 1980s peak down to Pounds 100m
now. Cook's jobs peak was 3,300 in 1989-90. It now employs 1,900.
'We are down from 15 plant to seven and looking at reducing to five. And we
are definitely getting rid of another 500 jobs in the next 18 months,' Mr
Cook warns.
Sheffield Forgemasters, which was bought by its management five years ago
and now has 400-employee shareholders but no debts, has invested more since
1988 than it did in the previous ten years.
The effect has been startling. The company has 1,700 people now, compared
with 7,500 in 1982, but it produces up to 30 per cent more. Wages were 50
per cent of total turnover in 1982, but are under 25 per cent now. Despite
job losses, however, Forgemasters has never stopped taking on apprentices.
As one of few companies left in the world which can cast 300-tonne pieces
and produce huge machined components weighing 120 tonnes, Forgemasters is
also scoring in export markets, despite 200 per cent overcapacity in its
sector.
Mr Philip Wright, chief executive, says: 'On exports, you have to be
accepted technically before you can get further.
'The first order is critical. It's why we have put so much into improving
manufacturing. We now simulate and rehearse manufacturing before we actually
do it. We try to eliminate variability in processing.
'We have a 90-point check list now, where there was no check list at all
previously. Defects cost us Pounds 5m a year in the past and are probably
under Pounds 1m a year now.'
The payoff is showing most in Germany, where the company now has 50 per cent
of the ingots market, having started from zero four years ago.
Aurora, now owned by Australian National Industries, also exemplifies
Sheffield's metamorphosis. It takes billets from Stocksbridge and turns then
into specialised forgings which are now economically priced because of a
Pounds 27m investment programme over the last four years.
Mr Eric Brightmore, managing director, says Aurora has slimmed down to a
core business of forgings and castings in steel and superalloys,
distribution, metal melting, processing and specialist engineering.
'We shed construction-related companies and pulled back from Pounds 156m
turnover to Pounds 70m, but we created units with bigger critical mass,' he
says. Sales are now running at Pounds 80m a year, with profits at Pounds 7m
 -the same as in 1978 when the group was bigger.
Exports have doubled to Pounds 20m in six years. The human cost, however,
has been about 1,800 jobs since peak, with only 1,200 employed now.
Among these big players, however, Sheffield still has room for the small,
niche-market specialist. Mr Noel Edwards, chairman of Barworth Flockton, is
typical.
His family company - his son Richard has just succeeded him as managing
director - makes high-value special steels and does hire work for others,
turning their ingots into billets and billets into bars.
It turns over Pounds 8m but employs 350 people. The 200 in the main factory
been working round the clock in three shifts, flat out, throughout the
recession. Mr Edwards' only concession to downturn was to postpone a new
Pounds 4m rolling mill from GFM of Austria, but it is now being installed.
He sold on quality before Britain left the ERM, but can now undercut foreign
competitors as well, so he is exporting 30 per cent of output.
Only one thing concerns him - downturn in Germany. In that, however, he is
not alone. Every single one of his bigger brethren is at least equally
worried. Their industry has put Sheffield through a terrible ordeal to
become internationally competitive - only to find its most crucial European
export market heading for trouble.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (2): Still at the cutting edge - Export
orders for knives by the million
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a waiting list for jobs at Sheffield's youngest cutler. The company
has doubled its sales in the last three years and has just opened a sales
office in Heidelberg, where it expects to undercut German competitors by 30
per cent. Meanwhile, the management buyout team that now runs one of city's
oldest cutlers has doubled turnover in five years and made such advances in
its production technology it now claims the lowest production costs in its
sector in Europe.
Not to be outdone, Sheffield's largest producer of kitchen knives has just
had another record year, taken on more staff and developed a new process for
coating a cutting edge with titanium nitride carbide to keep it sharp five
times longer than its Taiwanese imitators.
Cutting edges are what Sheffield's industry has always been about. The
Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire in the County of York, a manufacturers'
guild empowered by law since 1624 to protect Sheffield's name worldwide, now
has 500 members.
They can be based within 26 miles of Sheffield, but they have to produce a
cutting edge, whether for tableware or tools, consumer markets or industry.
The sector looks in better shape than it has for years.
The popular conception used to be that it had died, with perhaps 30,000 jobs
destroyed by cheap foreign imports and the loss of traditional export
markets in the former British Empire. Rocketing silver prices in 1979 forced
a crisis in sterling cutlery sales and recession then bit, shaking out jobs.
But Sheffield has got over the shock. Making cutting edges is no longer an
industry employing large masses of people, but it has reconstructed itself
to work smarter, using new technology and modern marketing methods.
Arthur Price of England was one of the first cutlery companies to go in for
vigorous marketing, averaging Pounds 500,000 a year on promotion during the
latter half of the 1980s. Campaigns sold the company's products, but they
also promoted the long-term economic advantages of paying for good quality
and the name of Sheffield as its guarantor.
Other Sheffield manufacturers of cutting edges, such as Stanley Tools, are
household names among millions of do-it-yourselfers. Others remain largely
anonymous, mainly making branded kitchen knives for consumer products
companies or 'own-label' items for retailers. Taylors Eye Witness, founded
in 1838, is an example. It never discloses its turnover but employs 200
people.
'We make pen and pocket knives, catering trade and craft knives, scissors,
kitchen knives and tableware for many customers. This diversity has enabled
us to swim against the tide throughout the recession,' says Mr Alastair
Fisher, a director. Confidence is high enough for a September launch of
Taylors Eye Witness's 'European feel' range of top quality stainless steel
cutlery, designed by Robert Welch.
COMPANIES do not, however, have to be ancient to be part of the sector's
success - 'we were interlopers. Originally we were retailers but we didn't
like the quality of what we could get, so in 1983 we decided to go into
manufacture,' says Mr Hugh Foulerton, founder of United Cutlers of
Sheffield.
Some city cutlers were put out when he started paying more than the going
rate to recruit good craftsmen, but local suppliers soon warmed to his
regular orders. He went for high quality niche markets and direct marketing
via quality daily newspapers, cutting out retailers altogether - 'stores
can't afford to stock many lines. They double the price and then add VAT.
Cutting out the middle man means a bigger choice from a wide range of stock,
as well as enabling higher ex-factory prices and, hence, quality.'
He therefore produces and stocks 18 designs in silver or silver plate and
nine in stainless steel, involving 1,500 individual lines and a stock of
nearly 170,000 items.
His big breakthrough came when the falling price of silver enabled United to
get its price for six sterling place settings down to Pounds 1,250. This
sterling price is half that charged by good and within Pounds 300 of what
many charge for silver plate.
'We haven't had a recession or any short time working or redundancies,' says
Mr Foulerton. 'Everyone has been on overtime since last September and we
have just set up in Germany.'
Turnover passed Pounds 1m in 1989 and Pounds 2m last year. All growth has
been financed from profits and sales are now 5,000 pieces of cutlery per
week, with sterling the biggest success. The 28 employees get 10 per cent of
the company's profits between them as bonus. Recruits are picked from a
waiting list and have to agree to a trial lasting up to a week to see if
they fit in. Only two people have been sacked in 10 years.
Similar commitment is apparent at Hiram Wild, which was bought out by its
production, commercial and financial directors from an increasingly
disinterested conglomerate in 1988. Equity backing was from South Yorkshire
Pensions and the Leeds-based venture fund Capital for Companies.
Mr Barry Campbell, production director, says: 'We've hardly felt the
recession. There were a couple of months where we found the going difficult
but we had very successful results last year. I feel really confident.
'We have a basic philosophy. We as directors pay ourselves a wage. We plough
back all profits in reinvestment. The more successful we are, the faster we
can reduce unit costs.'
The payroll has been slimmed down from 240 to 170, but annual turnover is
now Pounds 6m. The company manufactures across the quality range, and has
stayed in low-margin, high-volume production.
'I tell my managers that if they have planned properly the work will flow
through on its own. Their job is to walk round looking at the process and
methods and seeing if they can reduce unit costs. One factory now has the
lowest production costs in Europe,' says Mr Campbell.
Investment in automation and robotics enabled one new machine with one woman
operator to replace six machines and six people. The company can produce a
basic stainless steel spoon for 12p. Last year Hiram Wild sold Pounds
120,000 of such cutlery to hospitals, a growing market.
It also makes cutlery for eight airlines. Margins are thin, but volumes are
high. In-flight cutlery sets average two take-offs before they 'disappear.'
The company is at present pitching for British Airways economy class
business, which got through 15.5m pieces last year. It already supplies BA's
first class cabins.
Meanwhile, the Australian-owned Richardsons Sheffield, manufacturers of the
'Laser' brand of kitchen knives, continues an inexorable progress. It
produces 32m blades a year now, turnover has passed Pounds 25m, 60 per cent
of output is exported, and the payroll of 500 is up from 469 last year.
Mr Gordon Bridge, managing director, reckons the company has 10 months
whenever it brings out a new design or product before cheap, lower-quality
imitations come out in the Far East.
However, he hopes the new titanium nitride carbide coating now being applied
to cutting edges will be hard to copy. The process was developed in
collaboration with Sheffield University and involves high-vacuum technology
and some trade secrets - just the thing for Sheffield to keep its edge.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (3): New road a priority - Sheffield's
transpennine links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWARD WOODCOCK, owner of an eponymous travel company, reckons he has found
the consistently fastest route by car from Sheffield to Manchester Airport.
Sheffield Chamber of Commerce gives copies to members.
The route goes through the Peak District national park over Winnats Pass and
via Chapel-en-le-Frith, Pott Shrigley and a myriad of Cheshire country
lanes, passing through a farmyard and over a stretch of cobbled road. The
distance of 38 miles takes 65 minutes.
The alternative and more obvious main routes take in either the Snake or
Woodhead Passes, converging on a notorious series of bottlenecks. With heavy
lorries on the roads the journey can take up to twice as long as Woodcock's
Trail.
With Manchester airport's increasing importance to the northern economy,
South Yorkshire is increasingly feeling isolated from it. The Coalfields
Communities Campaign this year pointed to the problems this created in
impressing potential inward investors.
There is now a growing clamour for an all-weather dual-carriageway between
Manchester and South Yorkshire, even though this would mean 15 miles of it
passing through the national park. The favoured route is the A628 over
Woodhead.
Conservation groups are unhappy, but the economic and politcal case is
growing, especially after the latest pit closures programme.
Mr Mike Bower, leader of Sheffield City Council, says: 'We certainly don't
get the number of relocations we could reasonably expect. We need a better
road link to Manchester. This is a pretty high priority.'
Mr William Cook of Andrew Cook, a steel castings specialist, has many US
customers to service - 'we've learned to live with the airport problem, but
how can we possibly expect inward investors to put up with it?' he asks. Mr
Cook thinks a spur to the airport from the Sheffield-Manchester railway line
would also help, but the road is critical. 'It's geographically, technically
and environmentally simple. What difference could it make to a few sheep if
traffic moves fast or slow?' he says.
'It's a burning issue,' agrees Mr John Hambidge, chief executive of
Sheffield chamber. 'Which pollutes more, fast or slow lorries? They crawl
over the Woodhead belching black exhaust fumes in low gear. It must be
cleaner and more economical to move them through faster. We should certainly
study this scientifically.
'Good landscaping of a well-designed road can actually protect the
environment. The A628 has been defined by the Department of Transport as the
worst transpennine route. There are few walks in that part of the park, so
few recreational walkers would be inconvenienced,' adds Mr Hambidge.
Indeed, one argument is that improving the Woodhead route and banning heavy
goods vehicles from the longer Snake Pass would protect the national park
better than now. Even Mr Hugh Sykes, chairman of the Peak Park Trust,
insists: 'The balance of advantage to all interests lies in developing
better transpennine links.'
Mr Sykes and others also see the issue as wider than mere access to
Manchester Airport. Greater Manchester's economic hegemony over the
transpennine belt makes easier access to its financial and professional
service sector increasingly important.
THE north's main wealth-generating areas straddle the Pennines. The M62 has
already created a potential European super-region by linking Greater
Manchester and West Yorkshire. A 'dualled' A628 would add South Yorkshire,
thus increasing the northern economy's central critical mass and improving
three-way commercial links between Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds.
Mr Sykes points to Japan, which now groups towns and cities into strong,
intra-trading regional economies - 'we need to strengthen the intra-trading
northern economy,' he adds.
Perhaps Professor Alan Hay, head of geography at Sheffield University, has
the answer to resolving the clash between economic and environmental
interests, however - 'there are two problems on transpennine links, so why
should there not be two solutions, one for lorries and one for cars?' he
asks.
A new link is planned in about five years time between the M1 and M62 to
'cut the Leeds corner.' This will will save traffic between the two
motorways having to travel to Leeds to interchange.
'This is the route most heavy goods vehicles should use. The Woodhead pass
could then be upgraded but confined to cars and light goods vehicles only,'
Prof Hay suggests.
Many will see this as common sense. In the meantime, the scenic Woodcock
Trail looks the best means of ensuring Sheffielders do not miss their
flights.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (1): City strives to shine - Sheffield
has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the last 20 years, but
not its manufacturing industry, now spread more widely in smaller companies
 -and some of them are very successful. Nevertheless the struggle out of
recession is hurting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE is belligerence in Sheffield these days. It is not the usual conflict
between city council and central government, but survivors in manufacturing
industry aggressively proclaiming they are alive and deserving of more
recognition for what they have done.
The mood is typified by Noel Edwards, chairman of Barworth Flockton, a steel
manufacturer and processor.
'Sheffield is not a post-industrial society,' he declares. 'We are
manufacturers and we are fighting back. We have been thought to be in
decline, but we are not. We never really have been.
'We have to be quick-footed and adapt. We have looked for niches where we
can compete and we have got on with it. We have ridden recession because we
had hard-working facilities and people.'
Sheffield's problem is that its manufacturing has survived at the expense of
jobs. In 1942, Sheffield made a record 1.9m tonnes of steel in 176 furnaces.
Last year, just seven furnaces produced 2.25m tonnes - but with only one
eighth of the 1942 manpower.
Mike Bower, who took over leadership of the Labour-controlled city council a
year ago, says 36,000 jobs disappeared from steel or associated industries
in the first half of the 1980s. Unemployment quadru-
pled, explaining the council's attempts 10 years ago to ease problems by
expanding its own workforce.
The spiral of ever higher business rates to pay for this antagonised the
private sector, but was broken in 1989 by the government's introduction of a
national uniform business rate. This reduced tension between public and
private sectors, which were by then struggling to co-operate after years of
slanging matches had proved counter-productive.
Last year it was all hands to the pump to save the World Student Games, to
which the council committed itself in 1987 as an aid to regeneration, not
realising they were virtually unsaleable to television, the only guarantor
of enough sponsorship to make them pay.
The games were a sporting success, but lost twice as much as budgeted and
left a Pounds 157m bill for facilities, to be cleared over the next 20
years. A damning report by the District Auditor, the government's council
spending watchdog, left Sheffield with egg on its face and appearing
incompetent.
A backlash is now ensuing. Backbench Labour councillors last month voted
seven left-wingers out of party office, leaving Mr Bower, a moderate
dealmaker, in a strong position. He has already persuaded town hall union
members to avoid job losses this year by taking a pay cut, even though
everyone knows the overstaffed payroll will eventually have to be trimmed.
In industry and commerce, there is grumbling at the damage the games fiasco
has done, but ranks are closing to stress the long-term value of the
facilities to the city.
Vigorous promotion of manufacturing achievement will now play its part in
trying to restore Sheffield's reputation - and there is much to boast about.
Last year's 2.25m tonnes of steel was top grade feedstock for precision or
high stress engineering fabrications. Recession has forced a 30 per cent
drop in prices over two years, but Sheffield has coped because - says Ray
Douglas, this year's Master Cutler and a British Steel director - it now has
the lowest unit production costs in the world. This month the Cutlers'
Company, the ancient guild protecting Sheffield's name for quality in
manufacturing, is mounting a 'trail of excellence,' with customers from
Britain and abroad visiting suppliers - and their suppliers' own suppliers
and other customers. The city's laboratories and universities are included.
Visitors will be fed at a special Cutlers' Feast. 'Sheffield Shines' will be
adopted as the city's equivalent of 'Glasgow's Miles Better.'
Peter Newman, former chief executive of Davy and now chairman of the
governors of Sheffield Hallam University and a director of Sheffield
Development Corporation, says: 'We are hoping to do our bit to end the
patronising British attitude to manufacturing. Don't run us down, is one of
the things we are saying.'
The trail will demonstrate the city's vertical integration between
steelmaking, steel and metals processing, testing, design and manufacturing
 -'intracity trading has been very important in local industry standing up
to recession. Sheffield has always had a village atmosphere but this has
only recently manifested itself industrially,' says Mr Newman.
But can the picture possibly shine this brightly? There is overcapacity in
European steelmaking. Mr Edwards and Mr Douglas would have been less
bullish, for example, had Britain not left the ERM. For some it has been a
close run thing. It seems impossible to find anyone in Sheffield to call
last September 16 black Wednesday - 'White,' 'platinum,' or 'diamond' are
the most common words.
William Cook is chairman of Andrew Cook, a company which now claims to be
Europe's largest manufacturer of steel castings. With 80 per cent of his
output exported directly or indirectly, he admits he would have been in
trouble by now had exchange rates stayed at ERM levels.
WHAT is left of British manufacturing 'is pretty good and exporting like
mad,' says Mr Cook. 'Things are certainly not getting worse, but many of my
customers in the UK have gone. If the government allows the pound to rise
again or we go back into the ERM, this will screw things up completely. Our
unit costs are already lower than they have ever been.'
Suppliers of professional services are equally revealing. Andrew Darwin of
Dibb Lupton Broomhead, the city's leading corporate lawyer, says:
'Insolvency has done well. We have been busy in Sheffield, although we have
had few high profile insolvencies. Litigation has also been busy, with a lot
of debt collection business.'
According to Nicholas Kemp, director of the Sheffield Association of the
Engineering Employers Federation: 'Most companies have had difficulties in
the recession but it's a mixed picture. Our April survey of members was the
most positive for two-and-a-half years, but there are still some companies
finding the going very difficult. One universal area of big concern is the
downturn in Germany - 'we can compete on quality, price, unit costs and
productivity, but the orders are just not there. We think we'd have an
advantage if they were because trading conditions pose problems for our
German rivals, who have never faced recession in the way we have.'
Mike Myerson, of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, says his clients remembered the
recession of 1980-82, battened down the hatches, shed labour early and
reduced costs. Only one failed.
Surviving recovery, however, may be equally difficult. David Campbell, of
accountants Grant Thornton, says: 'Everyone has orders now. These were few
and far between a year ago, when many had no orders at all. Now companies
are short of finance to pay for them and have no more security to offer.'
Most of Sheffield's manufacturing is now in small or medium-sized companies.
In 1979, Mr Kemp's association had several members with more than 6,000
employees each. Now it has none with more than 2,000. But he has 350 member
companies - 100 more than in 1988. Most employ under 50 people, with 31,000
jobs between them.
The structure of Sheffield manufacturing has thus changed dramatically, with
a much flatter distribution of businesses by size. Some have not felt the
recession because they have good niche markets, but Sheffield's future now
depends on as many as possible of these small, owner-managed business
growing bigger. Many are insecure.
Jonathan Hunt, is senior partner of Wake Smith, one of Sheffield oldest
legal firms, chairman of Sheffield Enterprise agency and a member of the
local training and enterprise council. 'There is a fairly good supply of
money, but there are gaps. We need more small scale venture capital
funding,' he warns.
As some of its manufacturers strive to exploit their impressive gains - or
even just to keep them - Sheffield's economy seems worryingly fragile.

FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE derivatives sector opened well in London as US buyers chased the June
futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index. The contract quickly advanced to
the 2,850 area, but then ran into a stone wall as the buyers faded away and
a handful of nervous sellers chipped away at the earlier levels.
US buying appeared to be no more than position closing in London by two US
investment houses seeking to cover overnight losses in New York. For the
rest of the session it was the London locals, or independent traders, who
held sway.
There was further switching of holdings from the June contract into the
September paper, which will take over leadership of the market later this
month. Dealers said the differential of around 20 points between the two was
in line with expectations at this stage.
Business in traded options fell to 19,037 contracts from Monday's 26,069,
with the FT-SE 100 option decreasing its contribution sharply to 2,893.
Among individual contracts, British Aerospace, feeding off a strong share
price, topped the actives with 1,762 lots. Dealers see the stock's strong
performance since the end of last year as confirmation of recovery
prospects.
British Airways was close behind with 1,423 lots dealt, and there was
renewed interest in TSB (1,223 contracts), although traders saw no reason
for the renewed bid speculation.

FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: US selling halts attempt to advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED selling of the drug stocks from across the Atlantic put an end to an
attempted rally in London's blue chip issues last night, although fresh
demand for the second line stocks took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to a new
closing peak. Rights issues in the property sector came as no surprise, but
the stock market again proved unable to move far from the Footsie 2,850
mark, which has established itself as the middle of the current trading
range.
The market at first brushed off Wall Street's overnight fall and some Pounds
119.4m in fund-raising moves by two UK property groups. At best the Footsie
was ahead by 10 points, helped by a momentary flicker of demand for stock
index futures. However, Footsie 2,854.9 proved the best the market would
accept and share prices drifted down in London towards the close when a fall
of 16 Dow points as Wall Street opened, coupled with selling of Wellcome as
first reports from a medical conference in Berlin reached London, took the
shine off the UK stock market, taking it briefly into negative territory.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 was a net 0.4 off at 2,844.4, having rallied
from an earlier 2.4 loss. But the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which takes in a
range of second line issues, jumped by 13.2 to a new all-time high of
3,198.1, comfortably surpassing the previous peak reached only a week ago.
Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up around 60 per cent of the day's Seaq
total of 551.7m shares, which compared with 456.78m on Monday. But retail or
customer business activity on the previous day fell to only Pounds 884m, the
second recent daily session to fall well short of the Pounds 1bn figure
regarded as the basis for profitable trading by the London securities
industry.
With the stock market clearly unwilling to break away from its current
trading range, the search for the investment traces of the big institutions
continued. Traders believed these large investment houses were not sellers
of UK equities but were ready buyers - but only at prices just below market
levels. 'They are certainly not chasing prices,' said Mr Michael Hicks at
Strauss Turnbull.
Hopes for a base rate cut have been placed on hold, at least until nearer to
the Mansion House speech in the City of London by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new
UK chancellor of the exchequer.
The market also continues to await clearer evidence that the recovery in the
UK economy is beginning to show through into company trading results. On
this front, there was a significant response to the continued recovery in
shares of British Aerospace, with several leading broking houses pointing to
the outperformance of the stock.
But the outlook for the market as a whole is now clouded over by the
persistent selling of drug stocks from the US. In addition to unsettling
leading market indices and the rest of the blue chip sectors, this is now
casting clouds over the progress of Zeneca, the new bioscience formed by the
former interests of ICI.
The Zeneca issue, although carried off successfully at first, has now become
a serious uncertainty for a stock market which is itself in doubts over its
own high valuation at a time when it has lost all the gains achieved since
the beginning of the year.

FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gt Portland rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Portland Estates, the property investment company, managed to pull off
the unusual achievement of a rise in share price on the back of a rights
issue and a dividend cut. The shares finally gained 8 to finish at 197p
after the market responded favourably to the one-for-four Pounds 95m cash
call that the company is making to mount acquisitions.
Great Portland is looking to spend Pounds 70m on retail properties and
office space. The company made its move in a generally optimistic climate in
the sector.
'This won't be the last rights issue we see in property and investors are
seeing them as an opportunity for the sector to regenerate,' said one
analyst. Another saw buoyancy continuing while the appetite of investors
remained strong.
Great Portland's clearly stated intentions for the cash injection, and the
fact that the dividend cut for this year from 10p to 8p had been flagged at
the interim stage last November, inspired the confidence of the market. And
at 150p per share the rights pricing was well viewed.
The UK's two principal quoted holiday companies, Airtours and Owners Abroad,
raced higher after leisure analysts adopted a much more bullish view of the
holiday travel business.
'Volumes and achieved margins look set to show good growth this summer,'
said Mr Roy Owens, a leisure specialist at Smith New Court, the stockbroker.
Airtours also continued to attract keen interest in the market amid
persistent talk that the company is about to launch a move to acquire Hogg
Robinson travel agencies.
Airtours, with interim figures due to be announced at the end of the month,
advanced 9 to 318p, while Owners Abroad rose 7 to 102p.
Other leisure stocks performed exceptionally well, led by Rank Organisation,
which added 24 at 744p.
Dixons slipped 4 to 208p. Analysts suggested that the stalling of the
planned flotation by Clydesdale, the chain of electrical retailers in
Scotland and northern England, may have dented confidence.
Vodafone's recent strong performance was halted by a bout of profit-taking
after the group announced profits at the very top of the market's range and
matched best estimates for the dividend. At the close Vodafone shares were
14 1/2 lower at 451p after turnover of 8m.
Strong demand for English China Clays early in the session saw the shares
forge ahead. Some of the early gain was surrendered and the stock finished
16 up at 435p.
Southend Properties did not match the success story of Great Portland when
it announced a Pounds 24m convertible issue and a cut in dividend. Its
shares slid from 82p to 70p. One analyst blamed the downward movement on a
feeling that the dividend cut was a surprise and seemed to be 'quite
defensive'.
Thorn EMI closed 5 lighter at 863p following a presentation to analysts.
Worries about the trading statement at next Monday's annual meeting left
Ladbroke Group 3 cheaper at 185p. Christian Salvesen softened 2 to 352p in
nervous trading ahead of tomorrow's results.

FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A clutch of broker's recommendations drove British Aerospace sharply forward
by 22 to 409p in heavy trading of 8.2m shares. The advance placed BAe on the
threshold of re-entry into the premier list of FT-SE 100 companies.
The stock was also among the most heavily traded in the stock option sector
with the equivalent of 1.7m shares dealt.
Kleinwort Benson, SG Warburg and Smith New Court all reiterated their buy
recommendations on the stock. Mr Chris Tarry at Kleinwort Benson said: 'The
impending Paris Air Show will focus attention on the positive developments
and the newfound confidence at the company,' a view echoed by rival brokers.
The recent advance in the stock began with last week's announcement of the
sale of BAe's corporate jets business at a price in excess of market
forecasts. It gathered momentum with speculation earlier this week that BAe
was likely to win an order for 200 Hawk aircraft with a value of up to
Pounds 4bn. Further good news is expected at the Paris Air Show next week.

FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Boots upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A warning over the risks of the heart drug Manoplax pushed down the shares
of its maker, Boots. The price of the retail and drugs company fell 5 to
435p in a volume of 2.5m after the Washington-based pharmaceuticals
newsletter the Pink Sheet highlighted problems with the drug.
Its 100ml dosage must now carry a warning after trial data found that
patients taking high dosages were more likely to die than those not taking
the drug. One analyst said the revelations added to a question mark over the
credibility of Boots and that there must be a long-term doubt over the
long-term risk.

FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: US pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US selling pressure, after a weak opening on Wall Street, saw Glaxo dip 8
more to 583p and SmithKline lose 14 to 435p.
Zeneca's Pounds 1.3bn rights issue looked increasingly under pressure as the
day wore on, with overnight US selling the trigger for another difficult
session in the stock. Zeneca 'old' opened a fraction better at 619p but
early selling soon told and the stock retreated to end a net 5 1/2 lower at
612p, having dropped to within 9p of the 600p rights issue price at one
point. Turnover in the 'old' was 6.5m, similar to that in the new
'nil-paid', which closed 5 lower at 14 1/2 p.
A leading drugs analyst said that, given the US's sharply diminishing
appetite for drug issues over the past year, 'the Zeneca issue could have
been better timed; drug stocks are on long ratings and there is not much
upside in sight'.
Even ICI, whose shares have raced ahead from 608p since the Zeneca demerger
became effective two weeks ago to touch 709p early yesterday, came under
pressure, ending a volatile session unchanged on balance at 697p.
However, traders were by no means downhearted over the Zeneca issue. 'There
are still buyers of the shares and this could well be a great buying
opportunity,' said one.
Fisons' US launch of its Tilade anti-asthma drug, the success of which is
seen by drug specialists as vital to the company's future, did nothing for
the shares, which dropped 8 more to 149p, the lowest level for more than
eight years, and ensuring the stock's departure from the FT-SE 100 list.
Turnover in the stock was a substantial 8.7m shares.

FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Blows to drugs sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRUG stocks sector acted as a major dampener on the UK equity market as
a series of unrelated developments drove share prices of most of the leading
drug issues sharply lower.
Comments from the US Food and Drugs Administration on Boots' heart drug
Manoplax, renewed weakness in Zeneca shares in the US overnight, and bearish
views on Wellcome's anti-Aids drug Retrovir at a Berlin conference on Aids,
combined to leave the sector in disarray.
Also important was the belief that the outcome of the Clinton
administration's review of the healthcare industry may not be known until
September. Dealers said the sector could remain under pressure until the
review is made public.
Wellcome was the main casualty, sliding 25 more to 728p as the Berlin
conference's main session got under way.
This was believed to involve criticism of Retrovir by the Anglo-French
'Concorde' study group. Analysts said 'nothing new' had emerged during
London trading hours and that much of the increased activity in Wellcome
during the day reflected marketmakers 'churning' the stock - actively buying
and selling without taking a decisive position on the shares.

FT  09 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks fall further ahead
of inflation data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices continued to lose ground yesterday as the stock markets
traded nervously ahead of Friday's important inflation figures, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.59 at 3,510.54.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 2.98 lower at 444.71, while the Nasdaq
composite fell 6.87 to 687.74. New York SE volume was 238m shares.
Prices spent the entire session lower across the board for the second
consecutive day as investors struggled to find incentives to buy stocks. The
recent run-up in share prices has worried some observers, who believe that
equity markets are vulnerable to a sharp downward correction if bad economic
news jolts investor confidence.
That bad news could come on Friday when the producer prices index for May is
due to be released. Recently, monthly inflation reports have been
surprisingly strong, heightening fears in both stock and bond markets that
the Federal Reserve might be forced to raise interest rates to subdue
inflationary pressures in the economy.
Currently, analysts are forecasting that the May PPI will have risen by no
more than 0.2 per cent. If the figure is anything bigger than that, then
bond and equity prices could tumble. It was a fear of just such an outcome
that kept stocks firmly anchored in negative territory yesterday.
Among individual issues, some of the biggest bank stocks posted gains. After
two days of heavy losses, inflicted by concern about rising interest rates
and the effect that they might have on bank margins, most of the sector
rebounded yesterday. Chemical rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 , Citicorp
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 26 5/8 , Chase Manhattan Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29
1/4 and Wells Fargo Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 96 3/8 . JP Morgan, however,
stood still at Dollars 64 1/4 , and BankAmerica, under pressure from recent
brokers' downgrades, slipped a further Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 in
volume of 3.7m shares.
Casino issues, strong recently in expectation of approval of new gambling
legislation in Missouri, ran into heavy profit-taking. Circus Circus lost
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 , Promus dropped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 39
1/4 and Caesar's World fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 , although all
three were off the day's lows.
Anheuser-Busch dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 after broking house
Merrill Lynch cut its short-term rating on the brewery stock from 'above
average' to 'neutral'.
Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber declined Dollars  5/8 more to Dollars 24 1/2 in the
wake of the company's profits warning.
On the Nasdaq market, technology stocks were hit by a series of brokerage
downgrades. Apple retreated Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 49 1/2 , Microsoft
Dollars 1 to Dollars 92 1/4 and Intel Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO weakened in busy trading, following the trend of Wall Street stocks.
The TSE 300 index finished 29.5 down at 3,862.7 and declining issues
outscored advances by 437 to 299 after volume of 71.5m shares valued at
CDollars 678.4m.
Twelve of the 14 sub-group indices closed lower, led by the golds group, off
2.1 per cent. The price of gold in New York declined just 15 cents to
USDollars 374 an ounce, but many observers were disappointed that the
precious metal did not rally as the US dollar fell to a new all-time low
against the Japanese yen.

FT  09 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses 1.3% as yen
surges to a record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN'S surge to a record high unnerved investors, and share prices lost
ground on arbitrage related selling in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell for the third consecutive day, losing 268.95, or 1.3
per cent, to 20,575.24, the lowest point of the day. The index opened at
20,842.49, the day's high, and declined on light selling.
Volume remained flat at 350m shares, as investors were reluctant to
participate ahead of the holiday today, and Friday's settlement of June
futures and options contracts. The market is closed today due to the royal
wedding of Crown Prince Naruhito and Miss Masako Owada.
Declines overwhelmed rises by 821 to 238, with 122 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks shed 16.82 to 1,655.03 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.06 to 1,250.59.
The higher yen gave investors the jitters, sending leading exporters down.
The dollar closed at a new Tokyo low of Y106.33, down Y1.14 on the day,
after hitting an intra-day low of Y106.24. Continued worries over THK, the
over-the-counter bearings manfucturer rumoured to be facing financial
difficulties, also weighed on the market.
Hopes that public funds would support shares ahead of the royal wedding
faded quickly in the early session, and US pension funds, seen purchasing
shares in small lots, were the only notable buyers. Royal wedding-related
shares were losers, with Tasaki Shinju, the pearl jewellery maker, down Y80
at Y1,420.
High-technology exporters lost ground. NEC receded Y20 to Y1,020 and Hitachi
declined Y15 to Y859, while Toyota Motor weakened Y50 to Y1,640 and Honda
Motor fell Y40 to Y1,360.
In spite of denials by the company over rumours of financial difficulties,
THK dropped by its daily limit of Y400 to Y2,120. The OTC market fell 28.89
to 1,616.62.
Regional banks were among the few gainers on the day. Buying by US pension
funds supported Ashikaga Bank, which advanced Y31 to Y980, and Bank of
Okinawa, Y200 stronger at Y6,600.
Punters sought speculative favourites. Kurabo Industries climbed Y19 to Y510
and Nippon Carbon was up Y3 at Y630.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 242.75 to 23,118.75 in volume of 21.5m
shares.
Roundup
TOKYO apart, equity markets on the Pacific Rim were generally happier than
they were on Monday.
HONG KONG staged a technical rebound, the Hang Seng index finishing 135.01,
or 1.9 per cent, higher at 7,259.74. Brokers noted medium-term bullishness
as Hang Seng index futures all traded at more than a 100-point premium to
the cash market.
Blue chips posted gains across the board. The most active, Hutchison, rose
90 cents to HKDollars 21.80 as its major shareholder, Cheung Kong, put on 30
cents at HKDollars 27.70 and HSBC Holdings climbed HKDollars 1 to HKDollars
72.50. Turnover expanded to HKDollars 4.7bn from the previous day's
HKDollars 3.2bn.
SINGAPORE gained ground after early weakness, the Straits Times Industrial
index finishing a net 14.55 up at 1,870.67. A recovery in speculative
Malaysian over-the-counter (OTC) stocks led the upturn.
KUALA LUMPUR itself featured increased buying of 'situational' stocks as the
KLSE composite index gained 8.12 at 736.28 in volume of 273.3m shares
(221.5m on Monday).
SEOUL's turnover was a record Won1,200bn as the composite index hit a new
31-month high, adding 1.91 at 768.19. Strength in financials, however, was
not sustained to the close.
JAKARTA absorbed light profit-taking in the afternoon session and the
Jardine Fleming index closed a slight 0.59 higher at 71.55.
AUSTRALIA reflected weakness in golds as the All Ordinaries index ended 15.4
lower at 1,723.1 in turnover up from ADollars 187m to ADollars 293m.
The gold shares index lost 4.5 per cent to 1.779.6. Newcrest Mining fell 30
cents to ADollars 3.85, down by 13 per cent in a week.
NEW ZEALAND was dampened down by higher yields on debt-market securities and
softer share prices in New York. The NZSE-40 index closed 1.40 off at
1,655.13 after a holiday on Monday.
TAIWAN extended Monday's losses, the weighted index sinking 39.58 to
4,277.42 for a drop of 114.08 over the past three sessions.
Selling of speculative shares was blamed for the decline.
BOMBAY shed early gains to close lower on profit-taking, the BSE index
losing 29 to 2,377, after a high of 2,423.
KARACHI saw buying by institutions and foreign funds. There was hope of some
improvement in the political climate, after the government and the
opposition formed committees to hold reconciliation talks. The KSE index
moved ahead 13.5 to 1,171.64.

FT  09 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Madrid decline broadens and
deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MUTED performance of the Eurotrack 100 masked the movement in one or two
senior bourses, and there was even more volatility on the periphery, writes
Our Markets Staff.
MADRID deepened and broadened its losses as the general index fell another
2.91 to 253.91. Banks continued to decline but disappointment over the
Socialists' general election win spilled over into oils and chemicals, where
Repsol fell Pta55 to Pta3,125, construction, where Cubiertas led the way
down with a Pta360 drop to Pta7,050, utilities and industrials.
Turnover climbed from Pta20.1bn to Pta23.6bn. Mr Javier de Frutos, who
covers international equity markets at Beta Capital in Madrid, noted a
conjunction of a strong peseta and a drop of 33 basis points in yields in
the secondary bond market with the continued drop in equities and said that
either bonds or equities will have to change direction soon.
FRANKFURT closed below its best, the DAX index ending 6.00 higher at
1,661.61.
Turnover rose from DM5.2bn to DM5.5bn as traders covered their shorts. In
chemicals, Hoechst eased DM1.50 to DM245.50 as the company, which faced a
storm of public and official criticism after a string of chemical accidents
earlier this year, announced a replacement for its retiring management board
chairman, Mr Wolfgang Hilger.
In the construction sector, falls in the leading contractors after rating
downgrades from Merck Finck and Bank Julius Bar were balanced by a DM45 gain
to DM1,185 in Heidelberger Zement, on the grounds that there might be more
potential in building materials suppliers.
MILAN continued to be dominated by activity in the debt-laden Ferruzzi. The
shares came off a further 8.7 per cent, to close L85 lower at L883.10.
Among other companies in the group Montedison slipped L20 to L1,100 and then
to L1,060 on the kerb, while Fondiara lost L460 to L27,865. However,
Mediobanca, which is leading the consortium of five creditor banks put on
L100 to L16,400.
The Comit index was barely changed, rising 0.72 to 521.40.
Elsewhere, a positive recommendation from Morgan Stanley, helped to lift
Benetton L707, or 4 per cent to L19,454: the report noted that 1994 earnings
should exceed this year's 'due to the benefits of the lira devaluation and
to a reduction in the size of the collections'.
PARIS was modestly higher with UAP rising FFr13 to FFr574 on news that the
Swiss insurer, Winterthur, might increase its 3 per cent stake. The CAC-40
index rose 5.79 to 1,893.65 in turnover of some FFr2.7bn.
Oil stocks remained firm with Total rising FFr1 to FFr273: the company is to
participate in a planned consortium bid to develop a Chinese onshore oil
field.
ZURICH saw profit taking which left the SMI index 14.4 lower at 2,294.5. In
insurances Winterthur lost SFr70 to SFr3,250 although it forecast higher
profits after a setback in 1992.
BRUSSELS saw early optimism in Petrofina, which jumped by more than 4 per
cent at one point on optimism about a presentation to London analysts, and
then receded a little to close BFr180, or 2.2 per cent higher at BFr8,350.
The Bel-20 index added 10.98 at 1,197.43.
STOCKHOLM fell back after profit-taking in Astra left the B shares down
SKr17 at SKr693. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 10.2 to 1,078.4 in
turnover of some SKr794m.
HELSINKI fell by a further 2.4 per cent, the Hex index losing 26.6 at
1,115.1; COPENHAGEN gained 1 per cent after a cut in interest rates, the KFX
index closing at 85.25.
PORTUGAL weakened slightly but attention is now being turned to the release
of May inflation data expected to be released on Friday. The BTA index
slipped 7.4 to 1,992.5.
Mr John Ferreira at Carnegie commented that forecasts were for a fall in
year-on-year inflation to 5.8 per cent compared to 6.2 per cent in April. He
added that if the figures came in as expected then a cut in interest rates
might be expected next week.
ATHENS shrugged off weeks in the doldrums as investors reacted positively to
the affirmation by the national economy minister, Mr Stephan Manos, that the
government's economic plan is still on track. The ASE index rose 23.64, or
3.2 per cent to 757.43. WARSAW dropped another 9.7 per cent, the 294 fall to
2,740.1 in the WIG index leaving it 1,006.9, or 27.6 per cent lower since
May 31.

FT  09 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Dutch equities hope for year-end
recovery - But this is dependent on a further easing in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL

<TEXT>
After getting off to a healthy start early this year, the Amsterdam stock
exchange is limping into the summer with little prospect of short-term
recovery and every expectation that things will probably get worse before
they get better.
Amsterdam's recent loss of steam is a sharp contrast to the first four
months of this year, when the market gained 12 per cent under the combined
influence of the lower trend in interest rates, the higher value of the
dollar and the hesitant emergence of recovery in the US economy. The gains
were concentrated mainly in traditional defensive sectors such as the
publishing and food industries, as well as in banks and insurers.
'The rally was fed entirely by a stronger than expected recovery in the US
economy and a sharp drop in interest rates,' says Mr Jacques Potuijt,
director of research at Deutsche Bank-de Bary in Amsterdam. 'What we need
now are better fundamentals such as improved profit expectations.'
However, the profit outlook is not expected to brighten until later this
year, ahead of a predicted economic upturn in 1994, meaning that the bourse
is likely to remain lacklustre until September.
To make matters worse, the outlook for the economy is deteriorating,
although a deep recession like Germany's does not seem a likely prospect for
the moment. All in all, most analysts predict that the bourse will face a
difficult summer at best before seeing an improvement around the fourth
quarter.
Mr Potuijt believes that, by the year-end, the CBS General index will stand
at around 235, a further improvement compared with the all-time high of
223.5 reached on April 19. The index ended yesterday at 219.4, while the CBS
Tendency index closed at 105.7, up 10.6 per cent on the year to date.
Mr Thibaud de Guerre, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Amsterdam,
believes that the timing of the bourse's next rise is heavily dependent on
further cuts in interest rates. 'The problem for the next three months is
that the bourse has already discounted the interest rate decline, and
companies across Europe are issuing negative and alarming reports,
especially in cyclical businesses,' he says.
Unfortunately, the cut in interest rates already discounted hardly looks
imminent if the Bundesbank's recent cautionary statements are to be
believed, he adds.
The decline in interest rates, when it comes, should release liquidity from
bond funds and from investors' saving deposits, providing an impetus for the
stock market later this year. Overall, Mr de Guerre believes that the EOE
index of the 25 most actively traded shares could fall to between 290 to 295
from yesterday's 309, before returning to 320 to 325 by the year-end.
The release of half-year figures in August is unlikely to provide an
immediate spur for share prices, and the figures are expected to underline
the difficult trading conditions faced by many companies.
Last week, for example, KLM reported a Fl 562m loss in 1992/93, highlighting
the malaise in cyclical sectors such as aviation. The airline's shares rose
briefly on relief that the losses were not worse, but they have since fallen
back, closing yesterday at Fl 26.10, barely higher than the level before the
release of the figures.
The uncertainty about economic prospects means that it is still too early to
expect a recovery in the prices of strongly cyclical companies such as KLM,
the transport group, Nedlloyd, or the steel producer Hoogovens, because they
will all be vulnerable if economic resurgence does not take place in 1994 as
predicted.
However, Mr de Guerre recommends investing later this year in 'solid
cyclicals' - financially strong companies such as the storage and transport
group Pakhoed, and Akzo.
This list also includes HBG and other construction groups, reflecting the
benefits expected to flow from increased infrastructural spending in the
Netherlands, UK and France, as well as from higher international dredging
activity.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Euromarks strengthen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate futures in both France and Germany were slightly stronger
yesterday, although most dealers assumed that the Bundesbank's repo rate
would be, at best, barely changed in today's money market operation, writes
James Blitz.
Bundesbank council members have raised concern about the potential weakness
of the D-Mark and the growth in M3 money supply - and an aggressive easing
of monetary policy is therefore unlikely in the near term.
The German central bank announced yesterday that it would be holding a
variable rate repo for both the 14-day and 28-day maturities.
Conditions in the cash market were also a little easier. German call money
was a few basis points lower in a quiet market which was supplied with ample
liquidity. Call money traded at around 7.87 per cent from 7.90 per cent
earlier in the day.
With slightly easier money market conditions, D-Mark interest rate futures
were stronger. The June Euromark contract was up 2 basis points on the day
at 92.48. The September contract, which is more heavily traded, was 7 basis
points higher at 93.30. At this level it is pricing three-month D-Marks in
the autumn at 6.70 per cent, some 85 basis points lower than yesterday's
cash level.
French franc interest rate futures were also stronger on the day, partly
helped by the firmer performance of the French franc on the currency
markets.
The June Pibor contract finished 3 basis points higher than its opening
level, at 92.60, while the September contract showed a rise of 5 basis
points from the day's opening level, at 93.39.
Sterling markets were fairly quiet as speculation about another near-term
base rate cut in the UK continued to subside.
In the cash market a Pounds 900m daily shortage forecast from the Bank of
England was fairly easily removed, with what one dealer described as a good
stock of bills. There was late assistance of Pounds 85m, and the overnight
lending rate hovered between 5 1/2 per cent and 6 per cent.
Three-month money closed unchanged at around 5 15/16 per cent. In the
futures market the June short sterling contract ended 2 basis points firmer
on the day at 94.04, while the September contract finished 3 basis points
higher at 94.22.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen breaks new records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese yen continued its sharp upward progress against the dollar
yesterday, touching a new high and defying several rounds of intervention
from the Federal Reserve, writes James Blitz.
In recent weeks the yen has been well underpinned in the run-up to the next
round of trade talks between the US and Japan, and the summit next month of
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. The US administration is
expected to call for a strong yen at both meetings to help reduce Japan's
overwhelming trade surplus with the US.
Yesterday's moves came in spite of the lack of any fresh news in the market.
However, the absence of any Fed intervention on Monday had surprised the
market, and tempted dealers to buy the Japanese currency yesterday.
The yen hit a post-war peak of Y105.90 per dollar in early US trading,
prompting the Fed to intervene. It later closed at Y106.35 in London (from a
previous Y107.30) and in New York at Y106.40.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London,
continues to believe that 'the dollar has Y100 written all over it'. He
believes that this week's tankan report on the Japanese economy is likely to
show the yen's appreciation continuing to hurt Japanese exporters, raising
speculation about the need to introduce a third fiscal stimulus to the
economy.
The dollar's plunge against the yen contrasted with another comparatively
good performance against the D-Mark, which was in the throes of all-round
weakness.
Part of the reason for the dollar's rise against the German currency was a
comment from Mr Lawrence Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, who said the
central bank's goal was to keep inflation down.
This raised speculation that the US might raise short-term interest rates
later this year, narrowing the differential between US and German rates. The
dollar closed  1/2 pfennig up at DM1.6235. In New York it ended at DM1.6260.
The D-Mark was also weaker in Europe, partly as a by-product of the peseta's
strength in the wake of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's general election victory.
The German currency slipped to a close of Pta76.51 from a previous Pta76.84.
It also lost ground to the Italian lira, ending at L909.1 from a previous
L915.2. Sterling failed to gain from the general strengthening against the
D-Mark, closing unchanged at DM2.4650.
The D-Mark's softness came in spite of the strong view in the market that
the Bundesbank would either leave its repo rate unchanged at 7.60 per cent
in its weekly intervention today, or cut it by 1 or 2 basis points.
The high level of German bond yields makes it unlikely that the Bundesbank
will ease policy quickly. Ten-year German bond yields were yesterday at 6.85
per cent to 6.90 per cent, having been as low as 6.4 per cent earlier in the
year.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Companies queue up for Caspian
plunge - Steve LeVine on reserves that will be relatively easy to exploit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CASPIAN Sea, at the centre of some of the most obscure states, is
growing into an oil and natural gas producing region that is believed to be
capable of rivalling some Gulf nations. Its prospects are making the names
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan familiar to oil men.
'Oil geologists are salivating at the formations they see,' says a western
consultant in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku.
Mr Dave Tayrien of Houston's Amoco Production Company, one of the western
companies scouring the area, says: 'A lot of regions in the Caspian either
have never been identified or never tapped. It's a highly prospective and
exciting part of the world to be doing business in'.
The development is likely to put pressure on other oil-producing countries
as competition in the industry is increasing. At the same time, expected
economic growth in the three republics, which together have just 28m people,
could spill over and fuel expansion in two of the former Soviet Union's most
backward regions, Central Asia and the Caucasus.
The region has broad prospects. In addition to the oil and natural gas it
boasts a wealth of non-ferrous metals and farm products.
Large oil and natural gas reserves are already proven. The fields are not as
vast as Siberia's largest, but they are almost as alluring because they are
far easier to exploit.
In Azerbaijan there are 7bn barrels of proven recoverable oil reserves;
Turkmenistan has at least 10 trillion (million million) cubic metres of
proven natural gas reserves and 1.6bn barrels of proven oil reserves; and
two of Kazakhstan's fields are among the world's ten largest, with a
combined 6bn-11bn barrels of recoverable oil and 20 trillion cu m of natural
gas.
The mostly undeveloped Caspian region could contain much more. 'Only the
drill bit will determine how big the wells could be. There are always going
to be surprises,' says Mr Tayrien.
The Caspian Sea, the world's largest lake, covers 232,000 square miles
(600,000 square km), but the geological region extends much further. The
Caspian Depression reaches across the northern Caspian Sea into western
Kazakhstan and includes the long-producing Russian oil and natural gas
fields of Astrakhan, Orenburg and Volgograd.
Another formation, the Northern Caucasian Mangeshlak plate, crosses the
sea's mid-section, and encompasses the fields of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan
and stretching to the Aral Sea.
Because the republics are all but broke they have eagerly received the
western oil executives that have poured into the region to compete for
contracts. But, still in the process of breaking away from their Soviet
past, they have been less eager to sign firm contracts. A problem hindering
development of the Caspian fields is the absence of a good pipeline system
to transport the oil and natural gas out of the area.
Each of the three Caspian republics is discussing differing,
multi-billion-dollar pipeline deals that probably will be financed as part
of the western contracts.
Azerbaijan has kept about half a dozen western companies on hold for months
while officials have repeatedly studied an estimated Dollars 10bn worth of
contracts for three large fields off the Baku coast.
So far, the government has signed only a Dollars 25m contract with the
Turkish company Attila Dogan Petrosan to refurbish the Neftchala field near
Baku.
Earlier this year, British Petroleum and the Norwegian company Statoil
signed a 'declaration of rights' to develop the Chirakh oilfield, which,
with 1 bn barrels of estimated reserves, is comparable with North Sea
fields.
A second field, the Azeri field, contains an estimated 1.8 bn barrels of
oil, and an Amoco-led consortium of six companies is negotiating a deal that
could be worth Dollars 6bn over 30 to 40 years.
In addition, Houston-based Pennzoil and Aberdeen's Ramco Energy. have allied
to refurbish the already-producing Guneshli field, which contains an
estimated 1.4bn barrels and now produces 130,000 barrels a day.
The deals are potentially bigger, but have been even more elusive, in
Kazakhstan's Caspian Depression. There, political debates over exploitation
of Kazakhstan's share of the Caspian's riches - and simple insecurity while
negotiating with seasoned western lawyers - have made the government
extremely cautious.
British Gas and Statoil are negotiating to develop the enormous Karachaganak
field. The Dollars 6bn deal was intended to be completed by April 1, but
government officials say it probably will not be signed until the autumn.
Chevron Corporation has closed a deal to develop the giant Tengiz oilfield,
which geologists say contains up to 25bn barrels of oil. The sulphur content
is high and the oil is under high pressure, so oil companies estimate that
6bn-9bn barrels - equal to Saudi Arabia's bigger fields - are recoverable.
The deal could be worth Dollars 20bn over 40 years.
Turkmenistan's fields have also attracted a lot of attention, but again
nothing has been signed. Italy's Tecnologie Progetti Lavori has been
negotiating for more than a year to build a Dollars 1bn oil refinery 180
miles (300km) north-east of Ashkabad, the capital.
The possibility of becoming wealthy and self-sustaining has been an
intoxicating experience in a region accustomed to surrendering its resources
to Moscow.
The republics' officials, intent on making the best of what is coming, are
savouring the moment. Mr Ural Akchulakov, the Kazakh government's chief oil
geologist says: 'The Caspian Sea's prospects could be richer than Saudi
Arabia'.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil consortium formed to
explore onshore field in north-west China
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of four oil companies has been formed to bid to explore and
develop a potentially vast onshore field in the Tarim Basin, north-west
China, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group official said in London yesterday.
The consortium comprises Shell and Amoco Corporation, with 36 per cent each,
Total, with 18 per cent, and Marubeni Corporation with 10 per cent.
The consortium has filed an application with China National Oil and Gas
Exploration and Development Corporation, the official said.
The Chinese government announced in February that bidding would be opened to
foreign companies for its onshore reserves. The deadline for compnies to
submit bids is the end of October.
Companies are understood to be worried, however, about the vast cost of
developing such a remote region and about political risks.

THE RUSSIAN authorities have effectively suspended all exports of oil by
foreign joint ventures in a fresh blow to the credibility of the country's
efforts to attract foreign investment to its ailing energy sector.
A western executive who declined to be identified said that Transneft, the
state-owned organisation that manages Russia's oil pipeline network, had
excluded all joint ventures from its monthly schedule for pipeline access
since the beginning of June.
Mr Lev Vainberg, head of the Association of Joint Ventures, told a news
conference that he had written to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime
minister, asking him to reverse what he described as an illegal decision. An
official at the Fuel and Energy Ministry said that the decision had been
taken by the first deputy minister but that he did not know the reasons for
it. Other officials at both the ministry and Transneft were yesterday said
to be unavailable to take telephone calls.
The move deprives joint ventures, companies jointly owned by Russian and
foreign partners, of their ability to generate hard currency to recoup their
investment and their share of profits.
'Cutting out revenues creates a lot of instability in the business
environment,' said the western executive. 'The Russians are shooting
themselves in the foot.'
Mr Vainberg said a number of foreign companies were considering legal action
against Transneft and the Fuel and Energy Ministry and that some had already
appealed to their governments to intervene in their support.
Earlier in the day Mr Yuri Petrov, head of a vaguely defined state
conglomerate set up to attract investment, chided foreign companies for not
rushing to help Russia rebuild priority industries including its energy
sector. What he failed to mention was the need to avoid arbitrary and
discouraging treatment of foreign companies already trying to invest in
Russia.
This latest unexplained move follows another decision earlier this year,
subsequently reversed, to deny export licences to some of the joint ventures
entitled to export oil. Other western companies are upset about the
government's failure to implement an exemption from an export tax granted
almost a year ago.

GOLD firmed on the London bullion market as renewed buying came into the
market. 'The market just seems to be probing higher, to see where the
selling is going to come in,' one dealer said. Initial resistance remains
around Dollars 376 a troy ounce at the moment, although the former range
between Dollars 372 and Dollars 378 is still in place. New York's Comex was
registering only small gains by midday despite bullish influences from
currency and stock markets. But New York dealers were expecting gold to
remain within its established pattern. London's robusta COFFEE attempted to
break back into the middle of its recent Dollars 900 to Dollars 950 range,
as New York seemed content to pull back some of Monday's losses. But the
absence of fundamental news failed to provide any real momentum and gains
were trimmed by the close. London COCOA showed little inclination to break
out of its present lethargy. Traders were paying little heed to talks this
week at the ICCO, where members must decide on whether or not to call a
fifth negotiating session for a possible new international agreement. On the
LME COPPER was steadier.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Klerk seeks more added value
from mining industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT FW de Klerk yesterday urged the South African mining industry to
add value to the resources it mines saying it was 'vitally important' that
the country's minerals be beneficiated to a much greater degree.
Addressing the annual general meeting of the Chamber of Mines in
Johannesburg, Mr de Klerk said: 'We simply have to achieve maximal
exploitation of our non-renewable natural resources.'
His comments came against the background of a mining industry facing
increased competition in some areas from new market entrants, and also
suffering the effects of a prolonged commodity recession.
Mr de Klerk said that given the enormous development challenges facing the
country, 'it is of the utmost importance that the future role of the mineral
industry should not diminish'.
Although the gold industry has experienced hard times, Mr de Klerk said 'it
need not be on a declining trend'. He said the government was keen to
stimulate expansion of the jewellery industry and to attract foreign
investors and their marketing skills. Recent moves include removing the ad
valorem duty on local jewellery sales and the introduction of a local gold
loan system for jewellery manufacturers. Mr de Klerk noted that, using
conservative price projections, South Africa still had at least 18,000
tonnes of refined gold that could viably be recovered.
He welcomed the Columbus and Alusaf projects, announced during the last
year, which, respectively, involve beneficiation of ferrochrome and offer
opportunities for the downstream manufacture of aluminium products.
In the presidential address, Mr Bobby Godsell stressed the need to achieve
an 'enabling environment' for the mining industry. Key ingredients include
political progress - Mr de Klerk expressed confidence that the negotiations
process was on schedule - social stability, constructive labour relations,
appropriate regulation and 'market friendly economic management'. On the
latter count, Mr Godsell made two pleas:
That the industry be taxed on its profits, 'not have impost after impost
placed on its costs in various forms such as resource taxes, mineral levies,
royalties and regulatory charges ..'
For special tax concessions, such as accelerated tax write-offs to take
account of 'the particular risks, the wasting asset nature, and the long
lead times in generating any return on mining investment'.
He acknowledged recent progress made by Mr Derek Keys, finance minister,
including:
Promising to remove the import surcharge for mining companies that export
more than 15 per cent of their product;
Promising a case-by-case lifting of ring-fencing tax provisions; and
Accommodating specific industry concerns relating to the new Secondary Tax
on Companies.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rain hampers US plantings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCESSANT SPRING rains have hampered plantings across the US maize and
soyabean belt and cool weather has put US winter wheat development as much
as two weeks behind schedule. Crop-watchers are fretting that final maize
plantings will be abandoned if the wet weather continues - and it appears
that it will.
The National Weather Service forecast on Monday above-normal precipitation
across the US heartland for the next 10 days.
Late plantings and cool, moist weather that encourages crop diseases like
mildew and fungus should add up to a weather rally in the grain futures pits
at the Chicago Board of Trade. Instead, maize and wheat prices in Chicago
are in the midst of seasonal declines, and soyabean prices are moving
sideways.
The reason? Around the world cereals crops appear to be in generally good
condition and demand for the US wheat crop is weak, with buyers sniffing at
export incentives and biding their time until the harvest pushes prices
lower. 'Everybody seems to have good crop prospects - the UK, EC, Canada,'
says Mr. Daniel Basse, analyst for the consulting firm Ag Resources. He said
development progress of spring crops and quality levels of US winter wheat
won't be obvious until July.
The US Department of Agriculture reported on Monday that US soyabean
plantings were 59 per cent complete last week, compared with a 5-year
average of 75 per cent. Maize plantings were only 93 per cent of the
forecast 76.5m acres, about 6 percentage points behind the average.
'It does raise concerns that not all of those acres will be planted and that
the late plantings will result in lower yields,' says Mr Dale Gustafson,
senior grains analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham in Chicago. He adds,
however, that history gives little indication of the crop outcome. Of the
five late-planted crops since 1981, about half yielded above-normal and half
below.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Westerners to sign Kazakh oil
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LE VINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUSHANBE, TAJIKISTAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN oil exploration deal that could be worth several billion dollars,
seven western companies including British Gas, British Petroleum and Royal
Dutch Shell are to sign a preliminary agreement today to explore the Caspian
Sea offshore from Kazakhstan, according to foreign officials in the former
Soviet republic.
The preliminary agreement calls for seismic surveys of the Caspian Shelf
over the coming three years. Geologists say the portion of the shelf off the
Kazakh coast probably contains substantially more oil than the central Asian
republic's 25bn barrel Tengiz field. The US company Chevron in April signed
a 40 year Dollars 20bn agreement with the Kazakh government to develop
Tengiz.
The Caspian Shelf agreement is to be signed in Alma-Ata, the Kazakh capital,
according to the western officials.
Oil geologists are cautious as no no reliable survey of the shelf has yet
been completed, but preliminary reserve estimates varying from a possible
40bn barrels to 60bn barrels have provoked intense interest in the region.
At the low end of the estimate, 40bn barrels, the Kazakh portion of the
shelf still would contain two thirds of Kuwait's proven reserves, though far
more difficult to exploit, geologists say.
Proceeds, however, could significantly exceed an expected windfall at
Tengiz. One key problem in making a final agreement on the Kazakh
exploration is establishing sea boundaries between the five Caspian states.
A final agreement could nevertheless come as early as the autumn.
The companies combining with Kazakhstan's ministry of oil are, in addition
to BP, BG and Royal Dutch/Shell, Mobil Oil, and French companies Agip and
Total. The Norwegian company Statoil is also participating, forming a
partnership with BP.
The seven companies will finance the surveys and pay the Kazakh government
an unspecified fee. In return they will gain the right of first refusal to
exploit whatever oil is discovered.
An environmental survey is included in the agreement, as much of the Caspian
Shelf is a nature reserve. No matter what is found, no oil is expected from
the shelf before the turn of the century.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: French yield spread narrows to new low at
long end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government bond market continued to rally yesterday, closing the
yield spread over Germany still further. The 10-year yield spread moved down
to an all-time low of 23 basis points over the comparable German bond, down
from 27 basis points previously.
Comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, to the
effect that France could happily accommodate lower interest rates were
compounded by positive comments from Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French
economy minister.
He said the franc was 'running like a dream'. He foresaw further German rate
cuts and said French interest rates could settle well below German levels
and close to Dutch and Belgian rates.
Financial analysts said bond prices were driven by the stronger franc, which
in turn responded to confidence in the French economy compared with the
German economy. Mr Kit Juckes, an economist at S. G. Warburg Securities,
said: 'The maturity at which French rates are moving below German rates is
drifting along the yield curve.'
June futures on the Matif rose 42 points to 117.72 on heavy turnover and
continued to move higher in after-hours trading.
RELIEF over the success of the latest DM3bn Treuhand bond issue and
speculation that the Bundesbank might announce a slightly lower repo rate
today prompted a recovery in the German government bond market.
The September bund futures contract opened at 94.12 and rose 0.22 to 94.34
on hope that the repo rate, which has remained at 7.6 per cent for the past
month, will edge downwards. Economists believe that the relatively high
liquidity of the commercial banks will give the Bundesbank leeway to ease.
SPANISH government bonds continued their post-election rally with strong
buying interest - notably from foreign investors - concentrated on the
longer maturity bonds. Dealers said yields fell across the curve following
Sunday's election victory by the Socialists. They said the strength of the
peseta would provide room for further interest rate cuts.
The 13.45 per cent bond due 1996 rose from 107.35 to 107.65, while the 10.90
per cent bond due 2003 rose from 98.05 to 98.75.
THE ITALIAN government bond market gained on hopes that an interest rate cut
in Germany would pave the way for further easing in Italy. The September
Liffe futures contract was propelled to a high of 100.10, up from its recent
99.65-99.75 trading range.
IN the UK, gilts traded in a tight range but closed steady as the Bank of
England announced that its three most recent issues had been taken up.
The Bank said a tranche of 7 1/4 per cent Treasury stock due 1998, an issue
of 9 3/4 per cent stock due 2002, and a tranche of 9 per cent Treasury stock
due 2012, each worth Pounds 200m, were also sold out yesterday.
The September long gilt futures opened at 103.24, slipped 7 basis points,
and then recovered to close at 103.23.
JAPANESE government bond prices were driven higher by the strength of the
Yen, which reached an all-time high against the dollar in overseas trading.
The rises pushed the yield of the benchmark No 145 JGB down from Tokyo's
close of 4.525 per cent to 4.505 per cent in London trading.
US Treasury prices fell at the long end of the maturity range as dealers and
investors traded cautiously ahead of inflation news.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/2 at 102
5/8 , yielding 6.912 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was only
slightly weaker, down  1/32 at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.308 per cent.
The market's attention remained fixed on the inflation picture, which should
become clearer on Friday when the May producer prices index is released.
Analysts said they were expecting an increase of no more than 0.2 per cent
in the PPI.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy eases rules on savings
instrument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy yesterday moved a step further in its liberalisation of
money market instruments by relaxing rules on issuing certificates of
deposit.
Separately, the treasury announced it would issue L2,857bn in new five-year
floating-rate notes to repay some of the 'frozen' tax credits due to Italy's
biggest banks and companies.
The changes to the rules on one of Italy's most popular savings instruments
will benefit both bank issuers and investors. Opportunities for savers will
be increased as banks will be able to issue CDs in foreign currencies,
rather than just lire, or the domestic currency indexed to foreign
currencies.
The minimum size of individual certificates will be reduced to L1m from L5m,
broadening the appeal. Moreover, banks will be given much greater
flexibility on interest rates paid, with the possibility of paying different
coupons for certificates of similar maturity, depending on their size.
The liberalisation also directly benefits banks. The Bank of Italy has eased
the conditions on reserve requirements for CDs, which earlier this year were
lowered to 10 per cent of banks' holdings from 17.5 per cent. The rate of
interest on the obligatory reserves of CDs will also be increased from 5.5
per cent to 8.5 per cent.
The rules regarding obligatory reserve requirements on CDs with shorter
maturities, treated as cash, have already been eased.
The tax credits repayment will benefit the big ENI state energy and
chemicals group in particular. It will receive about L800bn in new
floating-rate notes, while more than L600bn is due to the IRI state holding
company.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Equity Issues: Woolworths to lead activity
with ADollars 2.4bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB

<TEXT>
THE international capital markets continue to show a steady stream of
international equity offerings and equity-linked deals from corporate names
around the globe.
Woolworths, the Australian retailer, will open its ADollars 2.4bn share
issue to the public tomorrow, with the shares expected to be priced at
between ADollars 2.15 and ADollars 2.45.
Meanwhile, investment bankers expect the heavy flow of issues from Latin
American to continue. While investors are focusing on the sale of 35 per
cent of YPF, the Argentine state-owned oil group, other names are expected
to tap the markets, possibly before the summer holiday season.
Market sources said that Grupo de Desarrollo Mexicano, a large Mexican
construction company, is expected to announce an initial public offering
(IPO) to raise about Dollars 250m.
Another Mexican construction group - Tribasa - is also understood to be
considering raising funds in the international capital markets.
Investment bankers claim there are several possible deals emerging from
Asia, with Samsung Electronics of Korea expected to launch a Dollars 150m
Global Depositary Receipts issue soon.
In the Euro-convertible bond sector, Goldman Sachs launched a Dollars 150m
deal for Home Stake Mining, the North American mining company. The proceeds
will be used to refinance existing bank debt. The seven-year convertible
bonds have a coupon of 5.5 per cent.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Warm welcome for two UK corporate deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO prime UK corporate borrowers tapped the Euro-sterling bond market
yesterday, while a range of issues in other currencies kept dealers busy.
New issues from British Gas and Marks &amp; Spencer totalling Pounds 400m met
strong demand from investors.
British Gas' Pounds 250m 15-year deal met surprisingly strong demand from
European and Far-Eastern investors, who normally do not buy paper maturing
in more than 10-years. Longer-dated sterling bonds are normally the preserve
of UK pension fund managers and insurance companies. However, the positive
yield curve in the sterling bond market, coupled with low yields in most
other markets, has encouraged overseas investors to extend maturity.
The deal, arranged by Samuel Montagu and Salomon Brothers, was priced to
yield 30 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2008. British Gas said
the pricing represented 'the tightest spread and the longest maturity' that
the company had achieved on a Euro-sterling issue.
Strong demand from a broad range of investors helped the spread to tighten
to 28 basis points at the end of trading yesterday.
Although British Gas is now rated AA2 by Moody's and AA+ by Standard &amp;
Poors, after losing AAA status, the name is still regarded favourably,
partly because it is a utility. The launch spread of 30 basis points offered
a pick-up over existing 15-year deals for the Gefco, the UK export agency
trading at 20 basis points over the comparable gilt and KFW, the German
development agency, at a spread of 16 basis points.
Marks and Spencer's Pounds 150m five-and-a-half year issue also met strong
demand, attracting both institutional and retail investors. At a yield
spread of 25 basis points over the comparable gilt - though the extra
six-months maturity provides an additional saving for the borrower - the
issue was not priced particularly generously. However investors are prepared
to pay a premium for the name, because of its rarity value. The proceeds are
swapped into floating-rate sterling and will be used to refinance a
five-year issue launched in 1988 - the company's last foray into the
sterling sector.
The spread tightened slightly to 23 basis points, according to lead manager
S. G. Warburg.
Elsewhere, a handful of dollar issues emerged, including a Dollars 500m
issue for KFW International, arranged by Deutsche Bank. The City of Kobe's
long-rumoured 10-year deal also emerged.
In the floating-rate note market, Italy added a further Dollars 500m to
Monday's Dollars 1.5bn issue, while the Bank of China launched its expected
Dollars 200m five-year deal via CSFB.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Badenhorst looks to long term
for ABSA - Philip Gawith on the challenges still facing South Africa's
largest banking group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PIET Badenhorst, straight-talking chief executive of Amalgamated Banks of
South Africa - South Africa's largest banking group - is not a man to seek
publicity. In the past few months, however, he has had it by the
shovel-load. It has been the sort he could have done without.
Hardly a week has passed without some piece of ABSA's dirty linen being hung
out to air. If it was not the dismissal of a senior executive for alleged
fraud, or disputes about contracts entered into before the Bankorp merger,
or fraud in the vehicle finance section, it was controversy about ABSA
forcing companies into liquidation.
Following the merger in January 1992 with Bankorp, nobody doubted that ABSA
had inherited a number of problems. The seemingly endless string of
litigation, however, sooned raised concern that Mr Badenhorst was pursuing
personal vendettas rather than the interests of shareholders. Mr
Badenhorst's standard reply to this charge was to growl that critics should
await the group's 1992-93 results before passing judgment.
That occasion arrived on Monday. The group made attributable profits of
R639m (Dollars 200.2m) for the year ended March, with earnings per share
rising by 12 per cent and the dividend by 10 per cent.
These are modest numbers. Stanbic, First National Bank and Nedcor, ABSA's
three main banking rivals, all increased earnings per share by about 20 per
cent for last year.
Considering ABSA's heavy rationalisation, however, most observers are
inclined to agree with Mr Badenhorst that the results are 'satisfactory'.
So far the stock market has been lukewarm about ABSA, either doubting
whether the benefits of scale will ever be realised, or believing them too
distant to warrant any immediate attention to the shares, which have
continued to under-perform the banking sector.
For his part, Mr Badenhorst is not in any doubt that the merger is on track
and that the group has now reached calmer waters. 'I think we can close the
book on the contentious items. There is not a bad apple that I'm aware of
that hasn't been dealt with, either through write-offs, provisions or
management actions,' he says.
Plainly, the past year has been one of extraordinary activity. It has
involved three main components:
Achieving rationalisation benefits of the merger which, most traumatically,
has involved the retrenchment of 5,000 staff.
Prioritising risk management, which had been very poor in the Bankorp
division in particular. This has involved making extensive provisions for
existing bad debts, and implementing stricter credit screening controls for
future lending.
Removing managers tainted with bad practices and replacing them with a team
which reflects the banking culture Mr Badenhorst is seeking: strong customer
service, high productivity, cost consciousness, and quality lending.
The challenge now is to make the new structure work efficiently. Mr
Badenhorst stresses that given the low level of the operating efficiencies
of some of the divisions he inherited, this is no mean task.
He agrees that his main competitors have many years' start over ABSA. 'It's
a little like putting the Springboks back into international rugby after
years of isolation. It takes time to get up to speed in terms of the rules
and the techniques.'
Short-term targets involved a return to controlled asset growth - the past
year of consolidation saw assets virtually static - and gaining market share
in areas where ABSA is under-represented, notably corporate lending and
merchant banking.
ABSA always set itself a three-year target in which to digest the merger
fully. Analysts, in general, are supportive of the actions taken by Mr
Badenhorst over the past year and agree that the long-term project - to
secure significant cost benefits through economies of scale - is on target.
Where there is stock market concern, it focuses on whether Mr Badenhorst has
the depth of management to take the task to its conclusion.
Mr Badenhorst accepts that the complexion of the group's senior management -
overwhelmingly white, Afrikaans male - needs to be changed. 'We're a South
African operation and must be South African in every respect.'
He says it is policy - endorsed by all senior managers - to increase the
number of non-whites on the staff; to achieve language parity among the
staff; and to bring more English speakers into the management team.
He adds: 'There is not a stone I've personally left unturned to achieve
that.'

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: BSN buys stake in New Zealand
meat company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BSN, the French foods group, is extending its interests in New Zealand by
paying NZDollars 19.2m (USDollars 10.3m) for a 20 per cent shareholding in
Best Corporation, the processed meat company.
Best, which is controlled by the founding Huljich family, said that BSN
would become involved through a special placement of shares at NZDollars
3.25.
Best is also planning a one-for-10 rights issue. The Huljich family plan to
pass their rights to the issue to BSN. After the issue and placement,
Huljich family interests would hold 50.1 per cent of the shares and BSN 20
per cent.
However, BSN has also been given an option to increase its shareholding over

<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's bond market may be opened to foreign investors within a year
and the ceiling on foreign ownership on Korean stocks may be raised, AP-DJ
reports from Seoul.
Mr Hong Jae-hyong, finance minister, hinted that the bond market would most
likely be opened to foreign investors as early as next year or, at the
latest, before 1996.
He said the foreign ownership ceiling on Korean stocks, now 10 per cent of a
listed company, would be raised several times over the next five years but
he refused to give an exact timetable and the maximum ceiling.
The Seoul Stock Exchange was opened to foreign investors in January 1992.
Mr Hong said Japan had taken 20 years to complete its stock market opening
programme, but South Korea would open its market to a significant level over
the next five to six years.
'It took 10 years for the US and Japan to deregulate interest rates but
South Korea will liberalise all controls on interest rates, except for those
on demand deposits, over the next three to four years,' Mr Hong said.
Foreign financial institutions would be guaranteed the opportunity to do
business in Korea on an equal footing with their local counterparts, he
said.

The bank, which is a 50-50 joint venture between the government and Qatari

These would mainly be in developing the country's vast North Field gas

<TEXT>
CSR and Pioneer International, the Australian building products groups, have
moved to rationalise further the local cement industry with a ADollars 12.9m
(USDollars 8.7m) take-over bid for full control of Melcann, the bagged
cement distributor.
The bid was announced through Australian Cement Holdings (ACH), the joint
venture controlled by CSR and Pioneer. It is worth ADollars 1.85 a share for
the 49.5 per cent of Melcann not already owned.
ACH said the bid was pitched at 19 times Melcann's latest earnings per
share, was 32 per cent above latest net tangible assets and was at a 12 per
cent premium to Melcann's average share price for the latest year.
If the bid went through, Melcann shareholders would retain the company's 5
cents a share dividend declared for payment in July, ACH said.
The bid is subject to the condition that ACH would become entitled to 90 per
cent of Melcann's shares and would be able to achieve compulsory
acquisition.
ACH is making the offer because it believes that Melcann is poorly
positioned as an independent distributor in the increasingly competitive
Australian cement market, ACH said.
It said Melcann's attempts at geographic and product diversification over
the last few years had been unsuccessful and extremely costly. Melcann is
also a grain trader and sells swimming pool products.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Paramount Publishing in Dollars
10m first-quarter loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARAMOUNT Publishing, the US media group, reported a loss of Dollars 10.1m
in the first quarter of the current year, after taking a one-off charge of
Dollars 26m for moving the offices of its publishing opera-tions.
Without the charge, Paramount earnings were Dollars 15.9m, or 14 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 28.3m, or 23 cents, in the same period last
year.
Paramount's earnings were hurt by seasonal losses in educational publishing
that more than offset profits from such best-sellers as Beating the Street
by Peter Lynch, and American Star by Jackie Collins.
The entertainment division also performed poorly, especially in comparison
with the first quarter of 1992. Paramount expects revenues from this
division to increase in the second half of the year, as it reaps benefits
from films such as Indecent Proposal, which to June had already grossed
Dollars 153m.
The company also said it expected earnings to gain later in the year from
the newly acquired theme parks, and increased television programming. The
theme parks only started operating full-time last week.
Paramount recorded the Dollars 26m one-off charge after consolidating
publishing operations into two sites in New Jersey, from locations across
the country. It said the move would improve efficiency of the division.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: RPR to take Dollars 77m charge
in second term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals company formed when the French
state-owned chemicals company took a majority stake in the US drug
manufacturer, announced yesterday that it would take a one-off, pre-tax
charge of Dollars 77m in the second quarter of 1993.
The charge will cover some previously-announced moves, primarily in the
group's European operations.
The overhaul involves RPR in divesting part of its manufacturing facility at
Monts, in France, with the expected loss of 230 jobs.
It is also restructuring the marketing and manufacturing operation of the
German and Italian pharmaceuticals businesses, blaming 'governmental actions
to limit prescription pharmaceutical volumes and prices in these markets'.
Around 130 jobs are due to be lost in Germany as a result.
RPR said yesterday that of the Dollars 77m provision, the cash outlay this
year is likely to be around Dollars 30m. The estimated pre-tax savings from
the streamlining are put at about Dollars 30m a year, beginning in 1994.
The company said that it would use a previously-announced legal settlement
with Baxter International to offset the effect of the restructuring charge
on earnings. As part of the settlement of the patent dispute, Baxter has
agreed to pay RPR Dollars 105m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, has formed a
partnership with Xerox, the office products and imaging company, to develop
technology aimed at integrating copying machines and other office document
products into PC networks.
PCs and document products are most often unconnected or incompatible,
hindering workflow and productivity.
The companies said that they would work to define and develop software
products that streamline processes for the creation, production and
distribution of documents.
Microsoft and Xerox have agreed to deliver a new generation of document
products and PC software.
The companies said that they were also collaborating on related unspecified
business initiatives.
'This partnership, allowing the integration of document products and PCs,
will result in products that change the way people work,' said Mr Bill
Gates, chief executive of Microsoft.
As well as jointly developing technology, the companies will co-operate in
marketing, sales and promotional activities. Specific terms are subject to
negotiation of a final agreement between the companies.
The agreement between Microsoft and Xerox comes on the eve of a Microsoft
announcement that is expected to include partnership agreements with several
other office products companies including Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer,
Minolta, Ricoh and Ericsson.
In an audacious marketing campaign, Computer Associates International will
herald its entry into the consumer PC software market by dis-tributing 1m
free copies of its new personal finance software, Kiplinger's CA-Simply
Money.
CA will send free copies to the first 1m people in the US who request the
program.
The product and the marketing campaign are directed at home PC users. The
software provides advice on how to manage personal finances.
In a survey commissioned by CA, the Gallup organisation found that nearly 31
per cent of those contacted have a PC at home, but only 29 per cent of them
use personal finance software.

Dollars 65m stock issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO Radio Centro, a leading Mexican radio broadcaster, is poised to issue
Dollars 65m of stock in Mexican and US markets in an initial public
offering.
The company is the largest radio broadcaster in Mexico City, with nine
stations. The owners, the Aguirre family, are believed to be interested in
buying up two state-owned television companies due for privatisation.
The equity issue would make Radio Centro the sixth Mexican company to be
quoted on the New York Stock Exchange.
The prospectus says proceeds will be used to pay off debt and finance
potential acquisitions, although it says that no such negotiations are
pending.
Radio Centro earned revenues last year of Dollars 47.6m, with profits of
Dollars 12.8m. Operations have been squeezed recently by a slowdown in
advertising, reflecting the weak state of the Mexican economy.
Next month the Mexican government is expected to announce the winning bidder
for two television networks, a film studio and theatre chain.
The Radio Centro equity offering is being lead managed by Bear Stearns in
the US, and Bursamex in Mexico.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Federated makes swift recovery -
Nikki Tait reports on the turnround at the US retailing group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE plenty of US companies have emerged from bankruptcy protection, few
have gone on to achieve much in the way of fame and fortune. Could Federated
Department Stores - which takes in some of the nation's best-known
department store chains, including Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Straus and
Jordan Marsh - prove an exception?
The retailer's recuperation period has been surprisingly swift. Just three
years ago, Federated was floundering under Dollars 7.5bn of debt, due to the
antics of Canadian property developer, Mr Robert Campeau. It filed for
bankruptcy court protection in January 1990 and pundits predicted that it
would take years for the complex case to be worked out. In the meantime,
they declared, a fire-sale of assets might prove inevitable.
They were wrong. Federated emerged, largely intact, from corporate purgatory
in early-1992. In the 12 months ended January this year, it made a small
Dollars 133m profit before extraordinary items and accounting-related
charges, despite the tough retail climate. Sales totalled around Dollars
7bn. Now, Standard &amp; Poor's is talking about returning the group's debt to
'investment grade' status within a year.
'The first annual meeting of the new Federated . . .' crowed Mr Allen
Questrom, chairman, at the recent shareholders' gathering. The executive,
who rejoined Federated from Neiman Marcus shortly after the bankruptcy
filing, paused to let the words sink in. 'That sounds awful nice,' he added.
But if Federated's crisis has passed, enabling the ongoing company to
flourish in America's highly competitive retail environment is still a
challenge. For a start, borrowings remain huge. At the end of January, net
borrowings were in excess of Dollars 2.25bn, putting the debt-to-equity
ratio at 110 per cent. That, moreover, is after a large share offering last
May and a couple of debt refinancings. Last year net interest charges
consumed almost Dollars 200m.
Still, in the eyes of Mr James Zimmerman, Federated's chief operating
officer, the balance sheet situation is less problematic than certain other
aspects of the business. 'The debt situation is satisfactory,' he says,
pointing out that the current average borrowing cost now stands at a lowly
7.5 per cent.
Instead, Zimmerman calls costs the 'number one priority'. Here, Federated
lags behind many of its retail competitors - even other traditional
department stores, whose cost base (and associated service levels)
substantially exceed those of the powerful discounters. Selling, general and
administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, for example, took 34.2 cents out of every
dollar of sales at Federated in 1992. Many department store groups have
ratios of under 30 per cent, while discounters squeeze below 20 per cent.
The Cincinnati-based retailer, acutely aware of the problem, has been
juggling the back-office facilities which support its multi-chain group. All
credit operations are now run from Cincinnati, for example, while the
back-office functions for two of the store chains - Abraham &amp; Straus and
Jordan Marsh - have been consolidated. The latter move, say analysts, should
shave around 0.35 per cent off the SG&amp;A to sales ratio this year.
But, in reality, many of the longer-term cost-savings may come from
fast-advancing retail technologies - such as improved electronic stock
control, which can cut out paperwork and increase the speed and efficiency
with which inventories are replenished.
Like other retailers, Federated knows the potential which more advanced
systems can offer: 'We're just leaping forward on the technology front,'
says Mr Zimmerman.
The downside is that expenditure on improved technologies adds to capital
investment needs, and Federated, like many companies which have been through
the bankruptcy mill, is still constrained by obligations to its bankers.
Nevertheless, it successfully won a Dollars 460m increase in the anticipated
capital spending programme for the 1993-95 period. Total spending over that
period should now total about Dollars 1.2bn.
About half the money will go on refurbishing existing stores. Only three new
outlets will be added in the current year - it currently operates 217 - but
the pace should then increase to between four and eight new stores a year
annually from 1994 onwards. Mr Questrom even talks, in vague terms, about
exploring acquisition possibilities somewhere down the road.
Even so, this level of expansion needs to be seen in context. May Department
Stores, running chains such as Lord &amp; Taylor and Kaufmann's, recently
announced a Dollars 4.6bn spending programme for the next five years,
involving the opening of 100 new outlets.
But having come this far, Mr Questrom remains bullish. He notes that the
SG&amp;A ratio has come down by 2.5 percentage points over the past three years,
and thinks a similar advance should be possible in the next few years. Stock
turn has increased from 2.33 times in 1990, to almost 2.9 times in 1992. And
Federated says that profit margins - as measured by earnings before tax,
interest, depreciation and amortisation - should reach 11 to 13 per cent
between 1995 and 1997. Considering that they stood at 5.8 per cent in 1990,
that would be no mean progress.
Perhaps the biggest plus for Federated is the shifting dynamic in the retail
sector. A few years ago, discount retailers were all the rage, and some
pundits wondered whether the traditional department stores had much of a
future. Now, as the economy starts to improve and the department store
operators have become more competitive at marketing their wares, the trend
seems to be going in the other direction.
In fact, Mr Questrom can even afford to be gracious towards some of the
specialty fashion chains which, until recently, appeared to have had a steal
on his customers. 'These concepts are always changing', he remarks,
benignly. 'We can move from left to right.'
That flexibility, he argues, should serve the department store segment well
as demographics change, the population ages, and customer demands shift from
high, affordable fashion to more sophisticated items, such as quality
cosmetics and 'larger-size' clothing.

NAF-NAF, the French clothing company, is going public by floating 13 per
cent of its capital, worth FFr198m (Dollars 36.3m), on the Paris second
market as a precursor to a larger issue next year.
The Naf-Naf issue, which follows little more than a week after that of
Hermes, the luxury goods group, is seen as a test of the Paris market in the
run-up to the new centre-right government's privatisation programme.
The market has been sluggish so far this year, but the successful Hermes
issue was 33 times over-subscribed.
The bulk of the privatisations should start in September but the government
plans to sell a FFr5bn stake in the Credit Local de France banking group by
the end of this month.
Naf-Naf is taking a cautious approach to life on the stock market by staging
an introduction of 791,668 new shares at FFr250 each on to the second
market. The issue is intended to raise capital to finance the group's
international expansion plans.
After the introduction the founding Pariente family will still control
Naf-Naf with 66.6 per cent of the shares and 79.9 per cent of the votes.
Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, will hold 9.5 per cent and Banque
Nationale de Paris 5.95 per cent.
Naf-Naf, which specialises in casual clothes for children and young adults,
is one of the best known clothing brands in France. It was founded 20 years
ago in Sentier, the 'rag trade' district of Paris, and now owns 120 shops in
France, 13 elsewhere in Europe and sells to 3,500 retail customers.
The group made net profits of FFr90m on sales of FFr1.03bn in 1992. It
expects profits to rise by at least 20 per cent to FFr110m this year on
sales up by 15 per cent to over FFr1.19bn.

EAST Asiatic Company (EAC), the troubled Danish international trading group,
has made a provisional agreement to sell its Plumrose meat processing
operations in the UK and the US to Vestjyske Slagterier, the big Danish
abattoir group, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
EAC said that more details about the sale and implications for the group's
finances would be published when the agreement was made final. The company's
meat processing operations in Germany are not covered by the deal, but the
parties have agreed to a co-operation with a view for a later acquisition by
Vestjyske.
EAC said that its food operations in Australia and New Zealand would shortly
be sold.
The group made a DKr1.18bn (Dollars 190m) loss on sales of DKr17.3bn last
year. The consumer goods division, which includes the food processing
operations, had a turnover of DKr7.29bn and made an operating profit of
DKr254m.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hilger to leave Hoechst next
year - Controversial chairman obeys unwritten law on retirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of Hoechst, Germany's biggest chemicals group, and recently the
focus of a fierce controversy over industrial safety, will be replaced next
year by the group's finance director, Mr Jurgen Dormann.
Mr Wolfgang Hilger, 63, will obey the company's 'unwritten law' on
retirement age and hand over at the annual meeting next May, a spokesman
said yesterday. He will be 65 in November next year.
A decision on whether he will follow the customary route for retiring top
managers and join the group's supervisory board will not be taken until next
spring.
Mr Dormann, 53, has worked at Hoechst for his entire career of almost 30
years. He joined the group immediately from university, where he studied
economics.
His promotion marks an interruption of a long tradition of
scientifically-trained chairmen in the group.
He staked his claim for the top post in the mid-1980s, when he was the
driving force behind Hoechst's purchase of Celanese of the US, which not
only widened the company's presence in fibres, but greatly improved its
standing in North America.
Mr Dormann is also credited with strengthening the group's anti-takeover
defences. His appointment was believed to be stoutly supported by the
banking representatives on the supervisory board, including Mr Wolfgang
Roller, chairman of Dresdner Bank.
The bank, together with an insurance group, has held 10 per cent of the
stock since 1991.
Hoechst was forced to slash its dividend for 1992 to DM9 from DM12 after an
18 per cent drop in pre-tax profits. Earnings fell a further 28 per cent in
the first quarter of the current year as the German recession deepened and
foreign markets remained depressed.
A series of 15 accidents, mostly in Frankfurt, in which one man was killed,
redoubled Mr Hilger's difficulties earlier this year. Despite charges that
he responded too little and too late to the events, he put their
'statistical frequency' down to 'fate', and claimed a job in a Hoechst
factory was safer than one in a shop.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: SAS confirms move to cut stake
in LanChile
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) reaffirmed yesterday that it is looking
to sell part of its 42 per cent stake in Chile's leading airline, LanChile.
It said the move would probably be made in conjunction with the Chilean
state's plan to sell its 22 per cent stake in the airline.
The sale would be specifically intended to give another Chilean investor the
chance to own as many shares as SAS.
'We are prepared to lower our holding by 5 or 10 per cent because we believe
it would be healthy to have a strong Chilean investor in the airline,' an
SAS official said.
He denied the plan had any connection with SAS's ongoing merger talks with
three other European airlines - KLM, Swissair and Austrian Air-lines.
The stake has a book value of SKr247m (Dollars 34m).
SAS originally bought a 35 per cent stake in LanChile in 1990 to gain a
strategic partner in South America.
The holding became less important to the Scandinavian airline, however, when
it stopped flying to South America in January 1992. Co-operation with
LanChile today centres on training, agency agreements, and a joint-venture
duty free operation.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Winterthur chief sees recovery
in profits
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WINTERTHUR Insurance, Switzerland's third largest insurance group, is
looking for a profit recovery this year after last year's result was hit by
several exceptional costs.
'It looks like 1993 will have improved results,' Mr Peter Spalti, the chief
executive, said at a press conference in Winterthur.
Net income in 1992 fell 6 per cent to SFr247m (Dollars 176.4m) because of
write-downs of its investments in Norwich-Winterthur Re and Hypobank, the
latter sold to Swiss Bank Corporation in January.
Mr Spalti said the group had been hit by natural catastrophes last year,
with its reinsurance business losing SFr150m. Norwich Winterthur Re had
stopped writing new business and Mr Spalti said it would not put further
burdens on the group this year.
Gross premiums last year grew 6.2 per cent to SFr15.52bn and he said he was
looking for further growth of 7 per cent this year.
Mr Spalti said it was possible that Winterthur would increase its stake in
France's UAP. Winterthur holds a 3 per cent stake in the large French
insurance group which the new French government intends to privatise.
A decision to raise it would await further progress on a credit business
co-operation between the two.
Winterthur plans to split its bearer and registered shares on the basis of
5-for-1 and to convert its participation certificates into registered
shares.
Swissair said the planned merger of its Balair and Cie des Transports
Aeriens charter units may be delayed by an objection raised by one of the
units' shareholders, Reuter reports from Basle.
The link-up was approved by Swissair shareholders at a meeting, the company
said. But should the shareholder's objection not be withdrawn, the plan
could be delayed. The shareholder has until June 14 to explain a case
against the alliance.

interim result

<TEXT>
ORKLA, the Norwegian group with interests ranging from branded consumer
goods to chemical processing, yesterday reported a decrease in four-month
pre-tax profit to NKr303m (Dollars 43.9m) from NKr415m last year.
The weaker result was attributed to a sharply worse performance by the
group's investment business which contributed just NKr16m to group interim
pre-tax profit against NKr270m last year.
Realised gains on shares fell to NKr53m in this year's four-month interim
period from NKr385m last year, while unrealised gains shot up to NKr774m
from NKr84m. Orkla said the aggregate market value of the share portfolio
was NKr4.88bn at the end of April.
On the Oslo bourse yesterday, Orkla's A shares shed NKr3 to NKr181; B shares
dropped NKr3.50 to NKr187.50 as free shares fell NKr4 to NKr188 on the
weaker result.
Group operating profit rose by 32 per cent to NKr321m in the interim period
from NKr243m last year due to growth in volume, higher productivity and
increased market share.
Group sales in the four-month period increased to NKr5.52bn from NKr5.42bn
last year.
Orkla said its branded consumer goods business lifted operating profit by 20
per cent to NKr242m from NKr201m, in spite of a continued low growth rate in
the domestic consumer goods market.
'In particular, household products, food and media contributed to the
advance,' Orkla said.
Household products saw operating profit rise to NKr112m from NKr70m while
food products increased to NKr87m from NKr71m. The media business more than
doubled operating profit to NKr30m from NKr14m.
Orkla said lower operating profit by the beverage business - which was more
than halved to NKr10m from NKr22m - was mainly due to investments in new
capacity related to new activity in Poland.
The group's chemical processing business lifted four-month operating profit
to NKr77m from NKr43m, helped by increased sales and cost reductions.

FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ford-Werke plunges into DM469m
loss after charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FADING markets and hefty restructuring costs plunged Ford's German
subsidiary into a DM469m (Dollars 293m) net loss last year, the first since
1985, the company reported yesterday.
Mr John Hardiman, chairman of Ford-Werke, said the charges for a
rationalisation programme introduced last autumn, including provisions for
action this year, added DM814m to 1992 costs.
Without this burden the company would have shown a pre-tax profit of DM400m,
compared with DM142m in 1991, he added.
Production in the first half of this year was down 15 per cent at 459,000
vehicles, and unit sales had fallen 17 per cent to 469,000. Prospects for
the full 12 months were 'rather gloomy', Mr Hardiman said.
According to Mr Norbert Kuhne, finance director, 1993 results would be
especially hard hit by the effects of turbulence in foreign exchange
markets. In the year so far, sterling was still registering a 16 per cent
devaluation against the D-Mark compared with the same period in 1991.
The lire had devalued 21 per cent and the Swedish crown 21 per cent.
The company expected that total German new car registrations would fall 23
per cent, he added. This compares with more common forecasts of a 20 per
cent fall from other leading German motor manufacturers.
At the same time, Mr Kuhne said, there was a trend among German customers to
buy smaller cars which offered manufacturers smaller margins. Since 1990,
the proportion of the German industry's domestic sales accounted for by
these vehicles had risen to 59 per cent from 52 per cent.
Mr Hardiman said a positive aspect was the introduction of the Mondeo, the
company's replacement for the Sierra. About 188,000 had been built in the
first half, a 35 per cent improvement on its successor. Another was that
Ford-Werke had increased its European market share to 12.1 per cent from
11.8 per cent, he said.
During 1992, although overall sales remained stable at DM22bn, domestic
turnover tumbled 17 per cent to DM8bn while exports rose 10 per cent to
DM14bn, raising the proportion of export turnover to 64 per cent, compared
with 57 per cent in 1991. Manufacturing costs fell by 1 per cent to DM20bn,
according to Mr Kuhne.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: M Clark rights to fund Freetraders purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATTHEW CLARK, the British wines and mineral water group, yesterday
announced a Pounds 12.9m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Freetraders
Group, a leading drinks wholesaler.
Freetraders, which recorded a 45 per cent increase in sales last year,
mainly to independent pubs, restaurants and hotels in southern England, will
complement Clark's wholesaling operations in the take-home trade.
Clark, which also announced a 16 per cent increase to Pounds 5.3m in profits
for the year to April 30, will pay Pounds 12.8m for 74.9 per cent of
Freetraders, including Devenish's 30 per cent stake and Swiss Bank
Corporation's 20 per cent holding.
It will provide an additional Pounds 5.8m towards repayment of the company's
existing debts from a new Pounds 7m bank facility.
The 4-for-9 rights issue, fully underwritten by BZW, will be at 320p a
share, a 185p discount to yesterday's close of 405p.
The remaining 25.1 per cent of Freetraders, owned by its management, and a
49.9 per cent minority interest in its Francis of Guildford subsidiary, will
be acquired over the next two years. The price will depend on the company's
performance but will be subject to a maximum aggregate of Pounds 16m.
Freetraders, reported an operating profit of Pounds 2.3m on turnover of
Pounds 39.4m in the year to September 30 1992.
Mr Peter Aikens, Clark's chief executive, said the rights issue would enable
the group to continue to expand its business without weakening a strong
balance sheet. 'The group is well positioned for further development,' he
said.
In 'another year of difficult trading conditions,' earnings rose 8 per cent
to 36.2p. A final dividend of 10p lifts the total 6 per cent to 16.75p.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.41m to Pounds 5.36m on turnover, net of
duty, 5 per cent higher at Pounds 42m.
The group's share of the expanding British sherry market, in which it owns
the brand leader, Old England, continued to grow, and Stone's ginger wine
performed strongly.
Strathmore bottled water, acquired in May last year, expanded distribution
outside Scotland and contributed Pounds 460,000 to operating profits.

Murray Enterprise reported a 64 per cent increase in net asset value to
204.96p per share over the six months to March 31.
A year earlier the value was 129.6p.
The growth reflected a large part of the portfolio being held in dollar
assets coupled with strong performances from several investments in the
fund, particularly the FleetCall mobile communications company.
Net revenue for the half year amounted to Pounds 2,000 (Pounds 29,000) for

The actual dividend to be paid from the Pounds 125,000 final declared last

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hazlewood deals part of refocusing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hazlewood Foods yesterday announced it had acquired Welten Snacks, the
Holland-based frozen snack manufacturer.
The purchase price was not disclosed.
The group said Welten's product range of frozen, crumbed convenience/snack
products would further strengthen the convenience food range of Advang, into
which the company is to be integrated. Welten had net sales of Pounds 3.2m
in 1992.
The announcement follows Hazlewood's sale last Friday of Luijckx Beheer for
Pounds 14.2m cash.
Luijckx makes chocolate decorations and bakery items and is not considered a
part of Hazlewood's current core business. In the year ended March 31 1993
it produced net profits of Pounds 1.4m on turnover of Pounds 9.4m.
The deals are part of Hazlewood's strategy to focus on its core businesses.

owned by the Guthrie Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of BBA, returned
to profits in 1992 with Pounds 16.2m pre-tax.
Previously the deficit was Pounds 1.1m after a Pounds 6.8m loss on sale and
termination of businesses.
Directors said there were isolated instances of buoyancy but the long-term
recovery had not materialised. Turnover moved up to Pounds 283.5m (Pounds

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: CML gains ground in second half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CML Microsystems made up lost ground in the second half of 1992-93,
producing pre-tax profits virtually maintained at Pounds 4.3m for the year
to March 31.
The result for this USM-quoted specialised electronic products group
followed a decline of 9 per cent at the halfway stage and was aided by a
strong performance by the US semiconductor and UK traffic operations.
The proposed dividend is lifted 27 per cent to 4.7p, payable from earnings
per share of 15.15p (16.24p). The shares rose 7p to 258p.
Operating profits showed a 2.5 per cent gain on turnover ahead 9.7 per cent
at Pounds 15.7m.

<TEXT>
DOUBLED marketing expend-iture helped Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the
regional brewer, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 20.1m over
the year to March 27.
However, trading conditions continued to be difficult and the outcome, under
FRS 3, included bad debt provisions of Pounds 2.5m, of which Pounds 1m was
taken as an exceptional charge.
Advertising and promotional spending of Pounds 3.7m paid off with a 32 per
cent increase in sales volumes of draught Pedigree, a substantial increase
in canned Draughtflow Pedigree, and a 31 per cent rise in Low C sales.
With some evidence of an upturn in consumer activity in the last few months
of the year, operating profits rose from Pounds 15m to Pounds 21m on
turnover ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 127.7m.
Managed pubs increased profits more than 30 per cent for the fifth
consecutive year. Some Pounds 9.9m was invested in pub improvements and
Pounds 2.2m was spent on acquisitions.
Volumes in tenanted pubs declined 5 per cent overall, but tenants on new
six-year agreements achieved a 1.5 per cent increase in sales while those on
the old agreement saw volumes fall an average 8 per cent.
Earnings per share before exceptionals rose to 17.66p (16.53p). A proposed
final dividend of 3.95p makes a total of 5.4p (4.91p).

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Southend Property in Pounds 24.4m placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHEND Property Holdings yesterday joined in the spate of fund raising by
property companies with the announcement of a Pounds 24.4m placing and open
offer of 8 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock at 100p per unit.
The company said that the issue would put it in a position to take advantage
of acquisition opportunities.
The issue was accompanied by the announcement of a forthcoming cut in its
dividend from 4.25p this year to 2.4p for the year to the end of March 1994.
The company said the decision to reduce the payment stemmed from the decline
in its profits following the partial divestment of its non-core activities.
The cut in dividend would also reduce the amount of irrecoverable advance
corporation tax payable on future dividends.
Mr Malcolm Dagul, chairman, and associated interests which together
represent 22.6 per cent of the share capital, will not subscribe for their
entitlement to Pounds 5.2m nominal of stock under the open offer.
The stock may be converted on the basis of 117.647 shares per Pounds 100
nominal of stock in any of the years 1998 to 2020 at 85p per share.
The terms represent a conversion premium of 3.5p per share, compared to
Monday's share price.
The offer has been made by Paribas on behalf of Southend.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Matt Clark buys Freetraders - Pounds 12.9m
rights enables expansion without hurting balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATTHEW CLARK, the British wines and mineral water group, yesterday
announced a Pounds 12.9m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Freetraders
Group, a leading drinks wholesaler.
Freetraders, which recorded a 45 per cent increase in sales last year,
mainly to independent pubs, restaurants and hotels in southern England, will
complement Matthew Clark's wholesaling operations in the take-home trade.
Clark, which yesterday also announced a 16 per cent increase to Pounds 5.3m
in profits for the year to April 30, will pay Pounds 12.8m for 74.9 per cent
of Freetraders, including Devenish's 30 per cent stake and Swiss Bank
Corporation's 20 per cent holding.
It will provide an additional Pounds 5.8m towards repayment of the company's
existing debts from a new Pounds 7m bank facility.
The 4-for-9 rights issue, fully underwritten by BZW, will be at 320p a
share, a 185p discount to yesterday's close of 405p, unchanged.
The remaining 25.1 per cent of Freetraders, owned by its management, and a
49.9 per cent minority interest in its Francis of Guildford subsidiary, will
be acquired over the next two years. The price will depend on the company's
performance but will be subject to a maximum aggregate of Pounds 16m.
Freetraders, reported an operating profit of Pounds 2.3m on turnover of
Pounds 39.4m in the year to September 30 1992.
Mr Peter Aikens, Matthew Clark's chief executive, said the rights issue
would enable the group to continue to expand its business without weakening
a strong balance sheet.
'The group is well positioned for further development,' he said.
In 'another year of difficult trading conditions,' earnings per share
expanded 8 per cent to 36.2p. A final dividend of 10p lifts the total to
16.75p, an increase of 6 per cent.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.41m to Pounds 5.36m on turnover, net of
duty, 5 per cent higher at Pounds 42m.
The group's share of the expanding British sherry market, in which it owns
the brand leader, Old England, continued to grow, and Stone's ginger wine
performed strongly.
Strathmore bottled water, acquired in May last year, expanded distribution
outside Scotland and contributed Pounds 460,000 to operating profits.
COMMENT
The Freetraders acquisition looks a sound move for the group. It will bring
some balance to the present overdependence of the wholesaling operations on
multiple grocers and other take-home outlets. The free on-licensed trade is
a fragmented and fast-growing sector which offers considerable
opportunities; though as number two in the business, Matthew Clark will have
to work harder to seize them. Having successfully restructured over the past
three years as a producer of drinks brands, the strengthening of its
wholesaling operations continues a coherent strategy of making the most of
its limited resources.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Marston jumps to Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DOUBLED marketing expenditure helped Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the
regional brewer, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 20.1m over
the 12 months to March 27.
However, trading conditions for the industry continued to be difficult and
the outcome, produced on an FRS 3 basis, included bad debt provisions of
Pounds 2.5m, of which Pounds 1m was taken as an exceptional charge.
Advertising and promotional spending of Pounds 3.7m paid off with a 32 per
cent increase in sales volumes of draught Pedigree, a substantial increase
in canned Draughtflow Pedigree, and a 31 per cent rise in Low C sales.
Mr Michael Hurdle, chairman, said: 'Our recent trading performance gives us
confidence that our strategy of widening our distribution base, together
with increased emphasis on building brands, will enable us to make further
satisfactory progress,' he said. 'We have now ceased production of all
products which have no genuine brand potential.'
With some evidence of an upturn in consumer activity in the last few months
of the year, operating profits rose from Pounds 15m to Pounds 21m on
turnover ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 127.7m.
Overall beer volumes rose 3 per cent against a market decline of about 2 per
cent. 'Free trade has probably never been as competitive as it is now,' Mr
Hurdle said - though the company's business had not been directly affected
by the national brewers' price war.
Managed pubs increased profits more than 30 per cent for the fifth
consecutive year. Some Pounds 9.9m was invested in pub improvements and
Pounds 2.2m was spent on acquisitions.
Volumes in tenanted pubs declined 5 per cent overall, but tenants on new
six-year agreements achieved a 1.5 per cent increase in sales while those on
the old agreement saw volumes fall an average 8 per cent.
Earnings per share before exceptionals rose to 17.66p (16.53p). A proposed
final dividend of 3.95p makes a total of 5.4p (4.91p).

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: JA Devenish challenges Boddington to show
hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JA DEVENISH, the West Country-based pub operator, yesterday challenged
Boddington, its largest shareholder, to declare its intentions towards the
company as it unveiled a 17.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the
half year to March 31.
Profits rose from Pounds 3.95m to Pounds 4.64m on increased sales of Pounds
41.4m (Pounds 30.4m).
The company also announced the sale of its 30 per cent holding in
Freetraders Group, the drinks wholesaler, for Pounds 5.9m cash, with a
further Pounds 1m of working capital to be repaid on September 30 1995.
The disposal will give rise to a Pounds 4m exceptional profit in the
year-end results.
Mr Michael Cannon, chairman, said he continued to regard Boddington's
decision to hold on to its 19.5 per cent stake as 'hostile'. The pubs, hotel
and healthcare group made a failed bid for Devenish two years ago.
'We assume Boddington's strategy remains hostile towards us; it has had
plenty of opportunities to sell its stake. If it is not hostile it should
tell us what its intentions are,' said Mr Cannon.
Following its decision to withdraw from wholesaling, Devenish has continued
to expand its pub estate through acquisitions, mainly responsible for
increased profits.
Capital expenditure of Pounds 7.4m is expected to increase during the second
half of the year. Devenish has already agreed to buy another 10 pubs.
Trade in the managed and tenanted pubs in Cornwall has continued to be
difficult. Weather permitting, the company expects an improvement on last
year's second half.
Borrowings rose from Pounds 34.5m to Pounds 42m, representing gearing of
29.4 per cent.
The interest charge rose from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 2m.
Earnings per share increased to 6.08p (5.26p). The interim dividend is
raised to 1.625p (1.5p).
COMMENT
It is difficult for Boddington to fault Devenish's strategy of focusing on
pubs, not least because it first argued for it. But it will not have escaped
Boddington's notice that operating profits from Devenish's existing pubs
edged up by just Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 5m. With 60 per cent of its pubs
based in Cornwall Devenish concedes that there was some truth in
Boddington's jibe during its unsuccessful 1991 bid that Devenish issued a
'weather forecast' instead of a profit forecast. To be fair to Devenish the
seasonal factor is diminishing as it continues to expand its estate outside
of the West Country. The sale of its 30 per cent stake in Freetraders will
give it further opportunity to buy more pubs. With forecast full year
pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m, the shares up 3p to 283p, are on a
prospective multiple of 14.3. Given Boddington's continued interest in the
shares, the slight premium to the market average must be justified.

INGHAM, the worsted spinner and retailer of parts for British classic sports
cars, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 838,000 for the 15 months to March
31 on turnover of Pounds 11.2m.
That compared with losses of Pounds 152,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.83m for
the previous 12 months when the company was concerned only with spinning.
During the period the company made two purchases and raised Pounds 6.4m in
rights issues.
Earnings per share were 9.6p (losses 4.7p). There is no final dividend as
1.25p had been included in the second interim of 4.5p announced when the
figures for the 12 months were reported. The total for the 15 months was 6p
(3p).

profits falling by 39 per cent from IPounds 1.09m to IPounds 663,000 (Pounds

The company estimated that the resulting loss of business, extra interest

Turnover was IPounds 4.96m (IPounds 4.85m). The pre-tax figure was struck

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eurocopy up to Pounds 1.22m aided by
cost-cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COST-CUTTING helped Eurocopy, the office equipment distributor which last
year underwent an enquiry by the Office of Fair Trading, improve interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 721,000 to Pounds 1.22m.
Turnover for the six months to end-March fell to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 18.4m)
as recession continued and the company stopped discounting to achieve sales.
Mr Michael Armitage, finance director, said: 'We feel we are at sufficient
distance from the horrible events of last year that we can resume our policy
of seeking out quality business at fair prices.' The OFT decided not to
revoke the company's licences following assurances about some of its
business practices.
Eurocopy said demand for photocopying equipment remained 'extremely weak';
there had also been a further 6 per cent fall in usage.
Service revenue accounted for Pounds 9m (Pounds 10.3m) of turnover, machine
sales halved to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 6.6m).
The group spent Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.4m) releasing customers from contracts
where it had found evidence of bad practice, out of a Pounds 10.5m provision
made last year.
Eurocopy was continuing its Pounds 7m legal action against Sketchley,
relating to the 1989 purchase of photocopier dealer Equipu.
The interim dividend is 0.5p (1.1p) as the policy resumed of paying a third
at the half year and two thirds at the year end.
Earnings were 1.68p (1p).

NATIONAL GRID said yester-day it expected its workforce to fall this year by

On a current cost basis the pre-tax figure for the 12 months to March 31

Mr John Uttley, finance director, said the job losses were likely as part of
a drive to cut 30 per cent from controllable costs from 1991-92 to 1996-97.
The target was set after a regulatory review resulted in National Grid
having to cut transmission charges by 12 per cent over the next four years.
Mr David Jefferies, chairman, said he expected further efficiencies to
result from the company's decision to put its wires, control centres and
towers business into one unit, leaving the rest of the company to contract
services to it.
Turnover improved 5.4 per cent to Pounds 1.39bn in spite of a slight decline
in electricity demand to 264.8 (265.5) terrawatt hours.
Mr Jefferies said company strategy was to take expertise overseas,
particularly in countries where there was a likelihood of the grid system
being sold off.
In the UK, the company is laying 80km of fibre each week for its new
telecommunications company and would be able to contact 70 per cent of
potential customers in the UK by next March.
Profit growth was most marked in pump storage and interconnections, up 35
per cent to about Pounds 64m, but Mr Uttley indicated future growth would be
less.
National Grid is jointly owned by the 12 regional electricity companies.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: BSS down 35% as Cadel integration takes its
toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSS GROUP'S acquisition last year of Cadel, a rival loss-making domestic
heating supplier, was partly responsible for a 35 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits for the year ended March 31.
The UK's second largest distributor to the domestic heating market reported
pre-tax down from Pounds 10m to Pounds 6.5m. Sales rose to Pounds 243.7m
(Pounds 209.2m).
Mr Ian Phillipps, chairman, said: 'The extreme weakness in the markets which
we serve continued to affect the final figures. We expect the first signs of
an upturn to reach us a little late in the business cycle.'
Group profits were adversely affected by the integration of Cadel.
Difficulties with its integration contributed to the domestic market
division's operating loss of Pounds 712,000 compared to Pounds 1.24m profits
on sales of Pounds 94m (Pounds 55.1m). Turnover included nine months of
sales from Cadel.
The main industrial and commercial side reported operating profit of Pounds
9.95m (Pounds 12.1m) on sales of Pounds 149.8m (Pounds 154.1m).
After the Cadel acquisition and the Pounds 16.2m rights issue earnings per
share fell from 31.1p to 16.7p.
The final is 11.5p, giving 17.25p (same).

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Disposal helps Marshalls to Pounds 12.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of a large landfill site coupled with sharply reduced interest
costs helped Marshalls, the Halifax-based building materials group, report
flat full-year pre-tax profits yesterday despite a 24.9 per cent decline in
operating profits.
The proposed final dividend is cut by 1p to 2.75p, making a reduced total of
4p (5p).
The company said that was to reflect the lower operating profits and to
conserve cash for the planned capital expenditure programme and new
acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 edged up to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds
12.3m) on turnover which fell to Pounds 169.5m (Pounds 174.4m) reflecting
difficult market conditions.
Earnings per share slipped to 3.93p (3.99p).
Operating profits from continuing operations fell to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds
16.6m) reflecting what Mr Andrew Marshall, chairman, described as 'the great
pressure on margins'.
The core concrete, stone and flooring business reported profits before
interest of Pounds 12m (Pounds 13.3m) on turnover which declined to Pounds
128m (Pounds 131m) including Pounds 6m from flooring operations.
Sales of concrete and stone products were down 2 per cent and profits fell
by 9 per cent.
Clay products were also affected by severe trading conditions in the brick
industry with high national stocks forcing down margins which led to
capacity reduction - including a 14 per cent cut in the workforce - in
November. Sales fell by 10 per cent resulting in a marginal profit of Pounds
300,000 compared with profits of Pounds 2.9m.
The steep decline in overall operating profits was, however, offset by the
Pounds 2.74m (Pounds 862,000) proceeds from the sale of an infill site, and
lower interest charges of Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 5.1m), mainly reflecting a
sharp reduction in borrowings following the group's Pounds 20m rights issue
a year ago.
Year-end net borrowings stood at Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 41.3m) representing
gearing of 18.3 per cent, down from 42.6 per cent a year earlier.
Capital expenditure was held at Pounds 5.7m during the year with several
projects deferred until this year when Pounds 12m of capital expenditure is
planned reflecting 'the clear opportunities for profitable organic growth.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Frost Group, the independent petrol retailer, fell 22p to 192p
yesterday as the company warned that forecasts for 1993 in the petrol
retailing industry were not good.
Mr James Frost, chairman, said fuel sales for the first four months of this
year were down nationally by some 1.83 per cent.
In addition the Petrol Retailers Association was forecasting the closure of
up to 6,000 of the UK's 18,500 sites over the next two to three years.
He considered the prospective fall in sites 'alarmist and wildly
exaggerated' but added that the adverse conditions presented Frost with
expansion opportunities as there were a record number of sites for
acquisition in solicitors' hands.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Nationwide falls 8.6% to Pounds 184.6m -
Staff cuts and closure of 60 estate agency branches cost Pounds 52.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Nationwide Building Society, the second biggest society
by asset size, fell by 8.6 per cent to Pounds 184.6m in the year to April 4
after it raised provisions for bad debts by 40 per cent to cope with falling
house prices.
Nationwide raised operating profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 566.5m (Pounds
437.8m) before an exceptional restructuring charge of Pounds 52.6m to
finance the closure of 60 estate agency branches and 650 redundancies.
It reduced management expenses to Pounds 524.5m (Pounds 539.1m), and cut its
ratio of costs to income from 55.2 per cent to 48.1 per cent, not including
restructuring costs.
Provisions for bad debts rose to Pounds 329.3m (Pounds 235.9m), while assets
grew by only 2.6 per cent from Pounds 34.1bn to Pounds 34.9bn.
The society's ratio of capital to assets strengthened to 6.6 per cent,
against 6.2 per cent last year.
The past year has been one of difficulty and upheaval but it has ended with
Nationwide in better shape to answer critics who regard the Pounds
35bn-asset society as a lumbering giant that had to focus its efforts to
survive in a harsher world.
The difficulties of the year encompassed personalities and commercial
strength. Two of its most senior directors left during the year, while its
ability to raise funds cheaply in wholesale money markets were affected by
the downgrading of its short-term debt rating by Standard &amp; Poor's.
The society also had to trade through one of the most difficult years in the
UK housing market, as house prices in the south continued to fall, and
interest rates rose. The result was to push 15 per cent of its borrowers
into arrears, and at least 100,000 into holding 'negative equity'.
However, Nationwide's results depict a society that has finally managed to
reduce its cost:income ratio to a respectable level. It also managed to
strengthen its capital ratios without recourse to more than a single issue
of Pounds 100bn subordinated debt during the year.
'Lots of people used to see Nationwide as a swimmer who was out of sight of
the shore, and some doubted whether it could even swim, but it is a lot
closer to dry land now,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS,
yesterday.
It has made progress by concentrating on internal reforms while adopting
more cautious lending policies. Assets hardly rose last year - from Pounds
34.1bn to Pounds 34.9bn. It adopted stricter lending criteria, and increased
its net interest margin to 2.43 per cent from 2.21 per cent.
At the same time, it cut management expenses by reducing staff and closing
60 estate agency branches.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, argued that the biggest upheaval in
its 730-branch network was now over, but further cuts are likely in central
administration.
Yet while the society shows signs of recovery, there is still some way to
go. Although its ratio of tier 1 capital to assets - calculated by UBS -
strengthened to 8.97 per cent compared with 8.38 per cent last year, its
pre-tax return on capital fell to 11.9 per cent (12.5 per cent).

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FINE ART Developments, the mail-order and greetings cards group, is to
expand in the educational supplies market with the acquisition of James
Galt, the toymaker, for Pounds 13.5m cash.
Mr Keith Chapman, Fine Art chairman, predicted there would be many synergies
between Galt and his company's Hope Education.
Established in 1836, Galt manufactures and supplies teaching aids and play
materials. It also supplies local authorities with playground equipment.
Customers choose and order from catalogues.
However, the company is probably best known for its quality wooden items to
be found in most UK retailers which stock toys.
Mr Chapman said Galt had sales worth about Dollars 5m-Dollars 6m (Pounds
3.2m-Pounds 3.8m) in the US and Canada.
In the year to February 28 Galt achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m and
net assets on completion will be no less than Pounds 4.25m.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Nationwide cuts cost income ratio to 48.1%
 -Internal reforms and adoption of more cautious lending policies showing
through
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAST year has been one of difficulty and upheaval at Britain's second
largest building society. But it has ended with Nationwide in rather better
shape to rebut the critics who regard the Pounds 35bn-asset society as a
lumbering giant that had to focus its efforts to survive in a harsher world.
The difficulties of the year encompassed personalities and commercial
strength. Two of its most senior directors left during the year, while its
ability to raise funds cheaply in wholesale money markets were affected by
the downgrading of its short-term debt rating by Standard &amp; Poor's.
The society also had to trade through one of the most difficult years in the
UK housing market, as house prices in the south continued to fall, and
interest rates rose. The result was to push 15 per cent of its borrowers
into arrears, and at least 100,000 into holding 'negative equity'.
If Nationwide was a publicly-quoted company, shareholders might have been
impatient over its performance since the merger with the Anglia Building
Society in 1987. Even as a society that would have to agree to a merger, it
is often mooted as a potential acquisition target for Lloyds Bank.
Yet Nationwide's results yesterday depict a society that has finally managed
to reduce its ratio of costs to income to a respectable level. It also
managed to strengthen its capital ratios without recourse to more than a
single issue of Pounds 100bn subordinated debt during the year.
'Lots of people used to see Nationwide as a swimmer who was out of sight of
the shore, and some doubted whether it could even swim, but it is a lot
closer to dry land now,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS,
yesterday.
It has made progress by concentrating on internal reforms while adopting
more cautious lending policies. Assets hardly rose last year - from Pounds
34.1bn to Pounds 34.9bn. It adopted stricter lending criteria, and increased
its net interest margin to 2.43 per cent from 2.21 per cent.
At the same time, it cut management expenses by reducing staff and closing
60 estate agency branches. Expenses fell by 2.7 per cent as it reduced staff
by 1,500 - including 650 redundancies. This helped the cost income ratio to
fall to 48.1 per cent, excluding restructuring costs of Pounds 52.6m.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, argued that the biggest upheaval in
its 730-branch network is now over, but further cuts are likely in central
administration. 'Our administration is still cumbersome to a degree, and we
can make changes in the long term to save money,' he said.
A second immediate problem has been the society's exposure to the southern
housing market. Its short-term debt downgrading by Standard &amp; Poor's in
December cited both its high cost base and its mortgage insurance which
provided 'stop loss' down to 80 per cent of original value.
Mr Alistair Dales, who became finance director during the year after the
departure of Mr Daniel Hodson, the deputy chief executive, to head the
London International Financial Futures Exchange, said the society had been
making efforts to improve arrears to convince ratings agencies of its worth.
He said there had been a 5 per cent fall in the number of borrowers more
than two months in arrears during the year. Mr Dales argued that its
relatively high level of provisions relative to assets reflected both the
southern bias of its lending and its policy of avoiding repossession.
Yet while the society shows signs of recovery, there is still some way to
go. Although its ratio of tier 1 capital to assets - calculated by UBS -
strengthened to 8.97 per cent compared with 8.38 per cent last year, its
pre-tax return on capital fell to 11.9 per cent (12.5 per cent).
Mr Melville-Ross acknowledged that shareholders might have become impatient
with a public company that only performed to this level, but emphasised the
improvements. 'Because we are a mutual we have a bit more time, but that
does not mean we are less determined to make progress.'

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright to float with Pounds 113.6m
value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARPETRIGHT, Sir Phil Harris's carpet retail chain, has set its flotation
price at 148p, valuing the group at Pounds 113.6m. MFI Furniture Group,
which has a 20 per cent stake, will sell all its shares in the float,
raising Pounds 21.5m.
The sale price was at the top end of expectations with the shares being sold
on a pro forma historic p/e of 21.8, a premium to the retail sector which
itself is rated above the market average. The yield is 3.37 per cent, on an
indicated dividend of 3.89p covered 1.75 times by the pro forma earnings per
share for the year to May 1 of 6.8p.
The float involves a placing of 39.16m shares with institutions and a public
offer of 13.7m shares. Of the shares being sold, 32.4m come from existing
shareholders. As well as MFI, directors and connected parties are selling
4.7m shares and venture capital backers are also selling.
The company is issuing 6.76m new shares, raising Pounds 8.9m which will
repay its preference shares.
Mr John Randall, MFI finance director, said it was not considered
appropriate for MFI to hold shares in another public company.
He said the cash would be used to cut debt of Pounds 75m on which MFI was
paying interest at about 7.5 per cent. However, it had treated Carpetright
as an associate, and the share sale would be dilutive until the money was
reinvested.
The public offer closes on June 16 and first dealings start on June 23.
COMMENT
Although the price looks high, Carpetright's fast growth rate will bring the
p/e down, and the flotation should go well. Analysts are looking for about
Pounds 10.5m pre-tax in the current year, up from Pounds 7.8m, cutting the
p/e to 16. But there are doubts, not least the high level of selling by
existing holders. Carpetright is essentially a clean, debt free, one-product
business - all points in its favour. But growth in the UK runs out in three
years. It must then find a new avenue for expansion or become an income
stock. Then Sir Phil's determination to resist the temptations that led him
astray last time will be tested.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ownership doubt over Alpine assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECEIVER for Alpine (Double Glazing) is trying to sell the company amid
confusion over who owns some of the company's assets.
Mr Grant Jones, of accountants Morison Stoneham, said yesterday he was
investigating claims to some of the assets by Finchfleet.
The Guernsey-based company claims to have bought Alpine's plant, machinery
and office equipment in March 1992, one month after the company was
purchased out of administration with backing from Mr Clive Smith, the
Midlands entrepreneur with offshore interests.
Mr Jones said: 'I have become aware of a potential claim by Finchfleet to
some of the assets.
In a letter dated March 30 1993 to Mr Robin Speirs, Alpine's chief
executive, Mr Michael Macey, Finchfleet's director, wrote: 'I must make it
absolutely clear that all plant and machinery and all office equipment is
owned by this company pursuant to our Agreement with yourselves of the 20th
March 1992.'
The letter threatens legal action against 'any party' attempting to gain
assets.
Mr Jones said Alpine had a 'substantial' order book. One of his main
concerns would be to ensure that these orders were fulfilled by achieving a
going-concern sale of the business.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clive Smith attacks Butte Mining directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLIVE SMITH, the Midland entrepreneur linked to several natural resource
companies floated in the 1980s, yesterday accused directors of Butte Mining
of not fulfilling their duties to shareholders.
Acting as proxy for one of his daughters at yesterday's annual meeting, Mr
Smith fired a series of questions regarding the company's decision to launch
a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) lawsuit - in which he is one of 77 defendants -
to chairman Mr David Lloyd Jacob.
Butte is pursuing litigation in the US, claiming damages of more than
Dollars 325m from more than 70 people, and is asking for these claims to be
trebled under US anti-racketeering laws. Butte - which Mr Smith helped to
float in 1987 - alleges fraud and misrepresentation on the part of various
defendants, including the purchase of US assets. Past events at Butte, along
with Richmond Oil &amp; Gas to which Mr Smith has also been connected, are under
investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.
Mr Smith questioned the independence of advice being given to shareholders
since both the chairman, finance director and Butte's US attorneys had a
personal financial interest in the lawsuit.
Mr Lloyd-Jacob said the board, which had approved the litigation, included
three independent non-executives with no interest in the action.
In a weighty collection of documents passed out to shareholders before the
meeting, Mr Smith also questioned the sale of certain Australian assets.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sims shares fall 53p on warning prompted by
rising beef prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Sims Food Group tumbled 53p to 129p yesterday as the meat
processor and supplier announced that profits before exceptional items and
tax in the year to March 31 would be about Pounds 6m. Last time operating
profits rose 19 per cent to Pounds 11.3m.
Sims also revealed that there would be non-recurring exceptional charges of
Pounds 6.5m, which would result in pre-tax losses of about Pounds 500,000
were the company to decide to adopt FRS 3 accounting practices.
The annual dividend will be reduced from 11.25p to 7.5p with a final of
4.5p, 'a level of coverage we can live with and grow upon', according to Mr
Brian Ford, chief executive.
Yesterday Mr Ford said that although beef prices to the consumer had risen
by only 7.5 per cent since January, cattle prices were up to 25 per cent
higher, and were not expected to fall in the next two to three months.
It was this more than anything else which prompted the warning, he said. In
the same period, lamb prices grew by up to 60 per cent, but they had fallen
off a little in the past two or three weeks.
Mr Ford also said that the impact of sterling's devaluation was first felt
in January since when 'UK beef and lamb has been very cost attractive to
mainland Europe'. Some 33 per cent of all beef in 1993 will be exported,
thereby contributing to a shortage of supply.
In the catering division, three out of 11 plants had been closed and all the
fresh meat operations were being reviewed. Some Pounds 4.8m of the provision
relates to this with the balance of Pounds 1.7m to cover the costs of
closing non-core activities.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: De La Rue in Pounds 30m Brazilian disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DE LA RUE, the security printer and cash-handling machine group, has
disposed of its Brazilian subsidiary to the United States Banknote
Corporation for Dollars 45m (Pounds 30m).
The group has also ended a cross - shareholding arrangement with American
Bank Note Holographics, a USBC subsidiary, in a deal which will bring the UK
group a further Dollars 15m.
USBC is, through its subsidiaries American Bank Note and American Bank Note
Holographics, the largest private sector security printer in North America
and the largest producer of holograms for security applications worldwide.
The Brazilian company, TDLR, has operations in both Rio de Janeiro and Sao
Paulo and supplies cheques, financial cards and other security documents to
the local Brazilian markets.
The deal gets De La Rue out of the volatile Brazilian market, which has been
plagued by high inflation and consequent difficulties in establishing the
quality of earnings.
De La Rue said the Brazilian company did not form an integral part of its
global security business and was not involved in the production of currency.
The UK group intends to continue supplying currency, passports and other
high-security documents to South and Central America, but these will be
produced elsewhere and paid for in hard currency.
De La Rue has also agreed to unscramble a deal agreed in 1989 whereby a
group subsidiary, De La Rue Holographics, entered into a licence agreement
with American Bank Note Holographics. De La Rue and USBC also exchanged 20
per cent interests in their respective hologram operations, at a net cost to
De La Rue of Dollars 10m.
Both companies said they now felt the arrangement had served its purpose and
that it was appropriate to terminate the cross-holdings and enter a
simplified licence agreement.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Confident Unigate achieves Pounds 101.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIGATE, the food and distribution group, is increasing its dividend for the
first time in three years, a 'clear signal of our confidence,' Sir Brian
Kellett, chairman, said. Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive, said 'we do see
the first indication of a gradual but real UK economic recovery.'
The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 101.4m for the year to
end-March, up from Pounds 65.7m, restated for FRS 3. But excluding
exceptionals the rise was more modest, from Pounds 92m to Pounds 97.9m. The
shares rose 20p to 355p.
A final dividend of 10.4p is proposed for a total of 16.1p (15.3p) up 5.2
per cent. Earnings per share rose from 23.4p to 31.3p, though the underlying
rise is from 27.3p to 29.8p.
The figures are complicated by the move to FRS 3, which substantially
reduces the 1992 profits as they include losses from discontinued
businesses, notably the JP Wood poultry operation sold in February 1992,
which were previously set off against provisions.
Unigate's figures benefited from a Pounds 4m pension credit, although this
will reduce to Pounds 3m in future years as employees' contributions are
being reduced.
Mr Buckland said that after acquisitions totalling Pounds 152m and disposals
of Pounds 73m in the last 18 months there had been significant progress in
reshaping the group.
He said that the decision to postpone the US flotation of the Black-eyed Pea
restaurant chain did not raise concerns about gearing, now more than 60 per
cent, as interest cover would still be over 5 times.
The sale is expected to go ahead in about a year's time, unless a trade
buyer makes an offer meanwhile.
Operating profits from continuing businesses rose from Pounds 88.9m to
Pounds 92.7m, including the pension credit. Associates, mainly the Nutricia
baby food business, rose from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 14.4m, but this was
because of the fall in sterling and an increase in Unigate's shareholding.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 13m to Pounds 9.4m.
Operating profits from dairies rose 5.9 per cent to Pounds 30.4m despite a
5.7 per cent fall in sales to Pounds 363m. Unigate cut out lower margin
business and benefited from cost cutting and capital spending.
Fresh food profits fell from Pounds 19.9m to Pounds 16.8m. Mr Buckland said
levels of competition had been unprecedented and marketing spend had
increased. Farm foods, such as bacon and turkeys, increased profits from
Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 7.5m, and the US restaurants made Pounds 14.3m (Pounds
13.3m) despite a Pounds 1.2m provision for the closure of 4 restaurants.
Wincanton, the distribution business, raised profits from Pounds 12.8m to
Pounds 15.4m. Vehicle sales and service profits were Pounds 4.4m (Pounds
3.7m) and Giltspur, the exhibitions business, made Pounds 4.6m (Pounds
4.9m).

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Margins eroded at Allied Colloids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED COLLOIDS, the speciality chemicals company, lifted profits to Pounds
44.4m last year but robust growth in sales was marred by lower operating
margins.
The company expected recovery would 'begin very gradually in the major
economies' but that it could maintain its sales growth at the much improved
levels.
Pre-tax profits in the year to end-April rose from Pounds 42.1m on sales up
nearly 16 per cent at Pounds 295m. After stripping out a small acquisition
and the effect of currency movements, organic sales growth was 11 per cent.
Administrative costs rose at an underlying rate of 12 per cent. This
included a 71 per cent increase in insurance premiums after the fire at
Bradford in July last year. In 1994 the rate will more than double from this
higher rate of Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 5.4m.
Earnings per share during the year fell from 12.3p to 11.36p after a jump in
the tax charge but the company is to pay a final dividend of 3.35p, giving a
10 per cent increase for the year to 4.29p.
Mr Gordon Senior, finance director, said the group was well aware of the
pressure on margins. One of the problems had been that the group had born
during the year much of the cost of registering chemical processes in
accordance with new environmental controls.
The partial recovery of sterling and the effect of more favourable currency
hedges should begin to help build margins again soon, some analysts believe.
Capital spending increased from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 21.1m. Nevertheless,
cash balances rose Pounds 8m to Pounds 23.7m. Net assets rose from Pounds
145m to Pounds 169m.
COMMENT
Allied Colloids has again shown its ability to grow sales organically.
Recession may have slowed the growth from the 20 per cent levels it achieved
in the 1980s but judging by the progress in the last half, the company has
not lost the knack of selling. A worrying development, however, is the
erosion of operating margin as overheads have grown. A part of this relates
to higher insurance premiums; part from increased raw material costs,
following sterling's devaluation, that could not be passed on. But there is
also a more permanent increase in the cost of running a chemicals business
with tighter environmental controls. The trick for Colloids is to prove
overheads have not moved on to a permanently higher level. This year the
company should make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 50m, or earnings of
12.6p, giving a prospective multiple of over 17. The premium may be
justified by the quality of organic growth, but Colloids is not the kind of
stock likely to excite for the moment now that the market's attention is
firmly on recovery.

FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Due diligence led to Clydesdale
postponement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL profits figures which led to the last-minute postponement of the
flotation of the Clydesdale electrical goods retailer were arrived at last
month after Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Clydesdale's auditors, carried out their
annual audit and the due diligence for the flotation prospectus.
Mr Jim Boyd, Clydesdale's finance director, said that Clydesdale had
suffered from reduced margins in a price war between electrical retailing
groups in the first quarter of 1993.
'On cold analysis the figures were not rich enough to float the company on a
rating that our shareholders deserved.'
Mr Boyd acknowledged that the pre-flotation audit 'does lead to scrutiny of
(a company's) accounting practices.' But Clydesdale's accounting practices
on valuing its stock and on write-offs on the cost of opening new stores
were 'clear'.
He said NatWest Securities' operating profits forecast ought to have been
about Pounds 6.5m to make it comparable with the previous year.
The forecast had included about Pounds 450,000 of interest received from
Clydesdale's insurance subsidiary, and that interest payable should have
been reduced by the same amount.
He said Clydesdale would almost certainly have to wait until next year for
another attempt at flotation. It would want to include the busy Christmas
trading period.
The flotation would have raised Pounds 30m.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Alleged illegality at German exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATIONS into trading irregularities uncovered last month on the
Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures and options exchange, have
unearthed evidence of potential widespread improprieties involving up to 15
people.
'It is possible that a circle of traders is involved,' said an official at
the DTB. He added that employees of more than one DTB member firm may be
implicated, as well as of some non-member firms, including foreign
institutions.
Some of the individuals involved in trades may have acted unknowingly.
It has also emerged that two of the three traders suspended by the exchange
last month were employees of Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank
(Hypo-bank), based in Munich.
The two dealers traded a wide range of contracts on the DTB's screen-based
trading system, from Hypo-bank's Frankfurt office.
The case is being pursued by the prosecutor's office, but no arrests have
yet been made.
According to Mr Josef Wertschulter, a member of the Hypo-bank board, losses
to Hypobank are estimated at DM500,000 (Pounds 203,252) to DM1m, a
relatively small sum the bank expects to cover after the seizure of assets
of the individuals involved.
'We have got a hot trail to follow,' said Mr Wertschulter.
The irregularities were uncovered several months ago by the DTB's own
surveillance. They trading irregularities may have been detected because
traders were making highly favourable prices, out of line with the rest of
the market, to certain accounts.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Price rises help lift Anglian Water by 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIAN Water, one of the biggest privatised water companies, yesterday
announced profits in line with expectations but said its unregulated
businesses lost money due to recession and start- up costs.
Pre-tax profits increased 8.2 per cent from Pounds 171.3m to Pounds 185.4m
in the year to March 31, helped by price increases and a Pounds 3.3m gain on
land sales. Mr Bernard Henderson, chairman, said the results represented a
considerable achievement, especially in Anglian's regulated water and sewage
business.
Turnover increased 11.5 per cent to Pounds 583.2m, with average price
increases at 9.4 per cent. Operating costs grew more quickly, reflecting
expansion of the unregulated businesses. Operating profits increased 9.1 per
cent to Pounds 211.6m.
Unregulated businesses, strengthened in February by the acquisition of the
Swedish-based process engineering company Nordic Water, made an operating
loss of Pounds 4.4m on sales of Pounds 29m. Mr Alan Smith, managing
director, said he hoped the division would make a profit after interest
costs this year.
Anglian has reacted to criticism of its disconnection policy - the number of
customers cut off fell from 1,200 to 236. But bad debt provisions shot up
from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 8.4m.
Interest costs increased by nearly a third to Pounds 29.5m. Net borrowings
rose by a similar amount to Pounds 392.5m as the capital spending programme
gathered momentum. Gearing increased from 23 per cent to nearly 29 per cent.
Anglian said it had won backing from customers to raise capital spending and
prices beyond the legal minimum in the second half of the decade. Ofwat, the
water regulator, will next year rule on companies' pricing levels. Most are
finding resistance from customers to higher prices.
Earnings per share increased 9.1 per cent to 56.4p. The company recommended
a final dividend of 14.3p to make a total of 21.2p, a 9.3 per cent increase.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Sale of stake ends battle for Skandia ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG ownership struggle in the Scandinavian insurance sector drew to a
close yesterday as two controlling shareholders in Skandia, the Swedish
insurance group, sold their stakes in a deal valued at SKr3.2bn (Pounds
289m).
Uni Storebrand, Norway's largest insurance group, and Hafnia, the Danish
insurance company, sold their combined 43 per cent stake in Skandia to a
group of securities houses comprising BZW of the UK, Carnegie International
of Sweden, and Sundall Collier and Fondsfinans, both of Norway.
The shares were, in turn, placed with a broad range of European and US
investors at SKr 105 per share, giving the deal a price tag of about SKr
3.2bn.
'With the completion of this transaction, Skandia is once more in an
unaligned position,' said one investment banker involved in the share sale.
The abortive attempt by Uni Storebrand and Hafnia to take over Skandia was
the most important reason for the collapse of both Uni and Hafnia last year.
The value of their holdings fell dramatically after Skandia refused to go
along with their scheme of pan-Nordic insurance co-operation.
Hafnia Holding last month filed for bankruptcy under the weight of DKr 6.5bn
(Pounds 687m) debts and heavy losses. It had already sold its healthy
insurance operations to fellow Danish insurer Codan in March, but the 15 per
cent Skandia stake was not part of that.
Skandia's share price has been overshadowed since it became clear that both
Hafnia and Uni Storebrand desperately needed to sell their stakes.
Yesterday's deal helps to tie up the loose ends caused by the abortive
take-over attempt. It is well below the average price originally paid for
the shares. Uni Storebrand paid an average of SKr 220 per share for its
holding of 21.5m Skandia shares.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Vodafone plans big spending increase

<TEXT>
VODAFONE Group, the mobile telephone company, yesterday reported a 19 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits and said it planned to increase its
investment and capital spending by more than half.
The company vies with Cellnet for dominance of the UK mobile market. Pre-tax
profits rose from Pounds 271.8m to Pounds 322.5m on turnover of Pounds
585.3m, against Pounds 664.1m in the year to March 31.
Capital spending is projected to rise to Pounds 300m this year, compared
with Pounds 190m. About Pounds 170m will be invested in the UK, mainly on
the company's advanced digital network - built to the pan-European GSM
standard - and on its micro-cellular network, both of which are due to be
launched this autumn.
The priority for the Pounds 130m overseas investment programme is
construction of national GSM-standard networks in Australia and Greece.
Vodafone also has a network contract in Germany and says its paging business
in Spain should soon secure a mobile licence.
The company also announced a joint venture with South Africa's Rembrandt
Group and Telkom Ltd to operate South Africa's first cellular telephone
network. The joint venture, in which Vodafone will have a 35 per cent stake,
is about to submit an application for a 15-year R100m (Pounds 21m) cellular
licence. If, as expected, it gains a licence later this year, it aims to
offer a commercial service by mid-1994.
In an upbeat assessment of the current year, Mr Gerry Whent, chief
executive, spoke of strong subscriber growth in recent months and
surprisingly low levels of migration by business customers to the low-user
tariff introduced last autumn.
Both Vodafone and Cellnet have low-user tariffs offering reduced line rental
charges in return for higher call charges.
Cellnet gained more new customers than Vodafone in the first three months of
the year, after an aggressive marketing campaign.
However, Vodafone pulled ahead again last month, and claims 56 per cent of
the total mobile market.
Mr Whent said he expected to increase his subscriber base from 838,000 to
more than 1m in the coming year.
He projected annual compound growth in the mobile market of 22 per cent to
the year 2000, by which time 10 per cent of the population would have a
mobile phone.
However, he conceded that Vodafone would soon have to make tariff
'adjustments' to counter the impact of Mercury One-2-One, which is about to
launch its PCN network within the M25 area, charging prices around 40 per
cent below those of Cellnet and Vodafone. More than a quarter of Vodafone's
traffic is within the M25 area.
Earnings per share were 22.07p (18.38p). A final dividend of 3.53p makes a
total of 6.96p, a 20 per cent increase.
At the end of March the group had Pounds 152m in cash and liquid
investments, up from Pounds 65m last year.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Great Portland joins rights issue wave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT Portland Estates yesterday announced a Pounds 95m rights issue, making
it the latest addition to the ranks of property companies raising money from
the equity market.
The move takes the total raised by property groups this year to more than
Pounds 900m. They have taken advantage of a revival in their share prices to
repair their balance sheets and fund acquisitions.
The rights issue was accompanied by the announcement of a 16 per cent fall
in net asset value per share from 212p to 178p, and of a rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 34m from Pounds 20.3m, as restated under the new financial
reporting standard FRS3.
The company also projected a cut in its dividend to 8p in 1994, from 10p
this time. The company's cash flow is expected to be constrained by the
expiry of some of its leases in the next few years.
The rights issue was welcomed by the stock market which pushed the shares up
8p to 197p. It shrugged off the announcement of the dividend cut next year,
which had been foreshadowed last November. Mr Richard Peskin, chairman, was
cautiously optimistic about the property market. 'The recovery in the
economy is proving to be patchy and fragile but, after the darkest period
for property since the second world war, I think that, at long last, we are
beginning to see some light.'
Great Portland justified the rights issue by arguing that its gearing, which
had risen from 75 to 91 per cent, might otherwise constrain it from making
acquisitions. It said it was in discussions concerning potential property
deals which could amount to some Pounds 70m.
It also announced the redevelopment of Portland Court, an 80,000 sq ft
office building in Great Portland Street at a cost of Pounds 20m.
The rights issue, which is on a one-for-four basis at 150p a share, was
underwritten by Baring Brothers. An extraordinary general meeting will be
held on July 2 to approve an increase in the company's authorised share
capital.
Great Portland has become one of the first property companies to implement
FRS3, which requires companies to include profits and losses from the sale
of investment properties in arriving at earnings per share.
Rental income rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 83.8m. The investment portfolio
was written down by 9 per cent to Pounds 823.4m. Earnings per share rose to
11.7p compared with 4.8p for 1992, as restated under FRS3. A maintained
final dividend of 6.6p makes a total for the 12 months of 10p.

FT  09 JUN 93 / ITT launches shake-up of its car parts business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT of the US yesterday announced a shake-up of its Dollars 3.5bn-a-year
(Pounds 2.27bn) international automotive parts business in response to
cost-cutting pressures from vehicle makers.
The main focus of the restructuring will be in Germany, where the motor
industry is making the most urgent demands for cheaper components.
According to Mr Klaus Lederer, who will head the new ITT Automotive Europe,
Mr Ferdinand Piech, the Volkswagen chairman, wants prices reduced by 30 per
cent over the next three years.
In response, Mr Lederer plans to pass the pressure down the line to his
outside suppliers. He said the present list of 2,000 parts makers would be
reduced by 30 per cent within two years.
A crucial part of the restructuring is the merger of ITT's five hitherto
stand-alone German businesses, Alfred Teves, SWF, De Koning, WIVO and ITT
Bergneustadt, which will be rolled into ITT Automotive Europe.
This concern will be responsible for all the group's brake and electrical
systems businesses, including 11 German plants and a further 14 outside
Germany.
Cornerstone of the operation will be Teves, a leading supplier of braking
systems. Mr Lederer will run ITT Automotive Europe from the existing Teves
headquarters in Rodelheim, near Frankfurt.
The new European unit will employ more than 17,000, including 13,500 in
Germany. It will have annual sales of DM4bn. Buying in DM1.8bn of parts a
year, it will have virtually double the purchasing power of Teves alone,
said Mr Lederer. The European unit will be largest of three profit centres
within ITT Automotive, based outside Detroit. These bring together what have
previously been nine separate operating subsidiaries with 71 factories in 11
countries.
The restructuring, planned since September last year, is the first
full-scale response from a component maker to the mounting pressure on its
prices and margins from western vehicle makers. Volkswagen, for example,
says it suffers a 20 per cent cost disadvantage in comparison with French
car makers and 30 per cent and more against the Japanese.

FT  09 JUN 93 / France agrees to ratify EC-US oilseeds deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday agreed to ratify the EC-US agreement on oilseeds, but
stressed that it still could not accept the parallel deal on the farm
chapter in the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations.
Both agreements were reached last November in Washington but had been held
up by French objections.
The oilseeds accord, passed last night by EC foreign ministers meeting in
Luxembourg, is a vital building block for an overall deal in the Uruguay
Round talks on trade liberalisation. The deal will, for the first time,
allow the EC to present a unified position on other unresolved issues in the
talks.
However, French ministers emphasised that they were not withdrawing their
objections to the Washington farm accord. 'We have obtained from our
partners and the Commission a certain number of clarifications which enable
us to participate in the accord,' Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's minister for
European affairs, said.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French trade minister, said France's acceptance meant
it had 'broken out of its isolation' within the EC on world trade.
The breakthrough on oilseeds came when EC farm ministers decided on May 27
to increase substantially compensation to farmers for 'set-aside', the land
they have to take out of production to comply with reduced output targets
under farm reform. France will get a large share of the extra spending.
But Mr Lamassoure said yesterday that France had also secured a declaration
from its partners that the oilseeds agreement was separate from the farm
chapter restraints on subsidised exports agreed with the US. Mr Alan Juppe,
the French foreign minister, described that agreement as 'totally
unacceptable'.
Under the previous French government, France had strongly opposed the
Washington deal, even though it was a better outcome than the then French
bottom line.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, is due in Brussels tomorrow
to press the case outlined in France's recent memorandum on the Uruguay
Round talks, which Mr Juppe said had been well received by the EC.
But Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany, France's closest ally,
said the memorandum was 'not God's gift to world trade'.
There is growing irritation within the EC - echoed publicly yesterday by the
Dutch and privately by the British - at indications by French officials that
Paris will require more expensive concessions to consider a Uruguay Round
farm settlement.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Wellcome shares fall 25p as scientist urges curb on AZT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOP scientist involved in the largest-ever trial of AZT, the Aids
treatment produced by Wellcome of the UK, yesterday urged that the drug
should not be used in HIV-positive patients who have yet to develop symptoms
of the disease.
The recommendation by Dr Maxime Seligmann, chairman of the co-ordinating
committee for the Anglo-French Concorde trial, comes as a further blow to
Wellcome. Shares in the company, which suffered badly in April when
preliminary results of the study were announced, fell 25p yesterday to close
at 728p.
AZT is Wellcome's second-biggest selling drug, and a significant number of
those for whom it is prescribed have tested positive for HIV antibodies but
remain outwardly healthy.
Setting out the findings of the study to the annual international Aids
conference in Berlin, Dr Seligmann said AZT did not slow the development of
the disease in such patients, did not extend life expectancy and failed to
improve quality of life.
'Given the side effects, the number of blood tests required and the drug's
cost, and given its limited and transient effect, it is better to save AZT
for later when the patient is developing Aids,' Dr Seligmann said.
Countering criticism of the methods used in the trial, he said that between
the drug and a placebo there was 'no difference in the speed of progression
to either disease or death'. The three-year trial, the longest ever
conducted, showed that 266 of the 887 patients on AZT either died or
developed Aids or Aids-related complex.
Among the 872 on the placebo, 283 died or developed the diseases. Previous
studies had suggested AZT slowed the development of the disease, but these
had not followed patients for as long as the Concorde trial.
Dr Seligmann said the Concorde trial had not tested the efficacy of AZT in
patients who had already developed Aids. It had also not tested the drug in
combination with other medicines.
Dr Paul Fidian, Wellcome's head of virology, questioned the conclusion that
it was not worth using drugs early. He said a joint European and Australian
study, to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine next month,
would show there was benefit the earlier the medicines were used. It was
also necessary to look at the dosing used in the Concorde study before
drawing strong conclusions, he added. The trial had used a dose of 1g,
whereas the most common dose was now 500mg in Europe and 600mg in the US.
Patients were better able to tolerate the lower dose, and the virus built up
resistance less quickly.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Universities allowed to charge top-up fees for tuition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITIES are free to levy top-up tuition charges on students, Mr Tim
Boswell, the higher-education minister, said yesterday.
Mr Boswell told a conference of lecturers' unions that academic autonomy
meant it was 'up to individual institutions whether they decided to charge
top-up fees'.
His comments follow a proposal by the London School of Economics to charge
its students an extra tuition fee of between Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,000 for
the academic year of 1994-95. They were interpreted as an attempt to soften
up public opinion on the issue.
Cuts in funding for tuition have been mooted as part of the review of public
expenditure being conducted by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to
the Treasury.
The LSE emphasised that its proposal, which it expects to ratify by the end
of this term, was a result of the government's decision to cut the tuition
fees it pays for classroom-based courses next year from Pounds 1,850 to
Pounds 1,300 a student.
It said bursaries would be available for all those who at present receive no
contribution from their parents towards living costs. An official said: 'We
have no intention of excluding anyone because they cannot pay.'
However, wealthier parents, many of them Conservative voters, would have to
pay the extra fees in full.
Mr Boswell sought to distance himself from the LSE's decision by saying the
move had not been initiated by him or the education department. 'We have no
plans either to move towards overall fees or to encourage institutions to do
so,' he said. 'If they were imposed without some matching system of
bursaries, they could be regressive in their effect.'
Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour's higher-education spokesman, said: 'The government
is encouraging universities to charge extra fees by manipulating the
notional fee mechanism.'
He predicted that a handful of universities at most would be able to follow
the LSE, creating a 'two-tier education system'.
The Higher Education Funding Council for England, which distributes public
funds to universities, endorsed Mr Boswell's stance. Mr Graeme Davies, its
chief executive, said the council would not take a university's extra
sources of funding into account when allocating funds, and that a decision
on extra fees was 'within the arena of institutional autonomy'.
Few other universities seem likely to follow suit in the near future,
according to the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.

FT  09 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Great Portland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That expectation is far more powerful than reality in the property market
these days is graphically demonstrated by Great Portland Estates. Despite a
dilutive Pounds 95m rights issue, a 16 per cent fall in asset values, and a
probable 20 per cent dividend cut for 1994, the company's shares sailed 4
per cent higher yesterday. One only wonders what would have happened if it
had some really bad news to report.
To be fair, Great Portland has earmarked the rights proceeds for worthy
purposes. Unlike some of its peers, it is not seeking fresh funds simply to
reduce gearing and take the pressure off management to make disposals. The
company wants to continue diversifying away from central London real estate.
Some Pounds 70m will be used for specified acquisitions; another Pounds 20m
will be spent on redevelopment. Those investors with sufficient patience
should be rewarded.
Over the past 30 years, the property sector has swung between periods of
massive underperformance or outperformance against the market. Its general
direction has invariably proved more important than its precise valuation.
Having sunk so low, it is hardly surprising that its current rebound is so
sharp. The entire property sector was worth less than Grand Metropolitan at
its nadir last September, accounting for just 1.2 per cent of the FT-A
All-Share's capitalisation. Since then, the sector has doubled in value. But
there is still a long way to go: at their last peak in 1988, property shares
accounted for 4.2 per cent of the market's value.

FT  09 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Unigate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigate's dividend increase suggests it must be anxious to convey the
impression that it has turned the corner. Mr Ross Buckland, who has now
notched up nearly three years as chief executive, has indeed sharpened the
company's focus: a string of disposals and acquisitions confirms its primary
interest in food and related distribution. That process will surely
continue, but the change has yet fundamentally to transform the bottom line.
Without the Pounds 4m reduction in the pension charge, underlying profits
would have risen by a mere 2 per cent. That increase in turn was due
entirely to a lower interest charge, itself a function of the timing of
disposals and acquisitions as much as lower rates. The delay in disposing of
the US restaurant business means the interest charge will rise again this
year. Much now depends on the degree to which Unigate can manage genuine
economies of scale in milk, and here the jury is still out.
Though the dairy division's operating margin rose last year to 8.4 per cent
from 7.5 per cent, the company is curiously evasive about how precisely this
was achieved. The lower pension charge will have helped, as will the policy
of franchising out milk rounds and shedding less lucrative supermarket
business. But it will take more than that to combat the inexorable pressure
on margins as consumers switch from home delivery to supermarket purchases.
The shares are helped by a yield of nearly 6 per cent, but, without more
evidence of growth, they are in need of such a prop.

FT  09 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Anglian Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian has come off badly during the recent de-rating of the water sector.
With capital spending weighted towards the second half of the decade, it was
always geared to the outcome of next year's regulatory review. All the more
so since its customers are apparently willing to accept higher bills in the
interests of higher standards. Of course Anglian stands to gain more than
most from a generous settlement with the regulator. By favouring companies
with small capital programmes such as Welsh, the market prefers to believe
the worst.
Ofwat's obligation to ensure that Anglian can fund itself is some comfort.
Allowing interest cover to drift much below three times would leave little
to chance. Debt finance could be supplemented by a rights issue, but without
attractive prospects for dividend growth Anglian would have to pay a
punitive price for fresh equity and Ofwat is committed to ensuring the
companies' cost of capital remains reasonably low.
The worry is that Ofwat might argue that profits rather than balance sheets
should take more of the strain from 1995. More manpower and less expensive
equipment, for example, might result in just as clean water. Cheaper capital
equipment with a shorter life could also cut capital spending in the short
run - but only at the expense of higher depreciation. Such a spending
strategy dampened Anglian's profits growth last year. Going into
negotiations with Ofwat some moderation of profits is doubtless desirable,
but one wonders whether the regulator is taking note.

FT  09 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Vodafone calls collect
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vodafone has a charmingly ruthless approach to maximising value for its
shareholders. By any measure the return on capital of its UK cellular phone
operation is extraordinary. Operating profit is 46 per cent of sales and
cash flow is 58 per cent. Vodafone clearly intends to milk the highest
returns it can from this franchise for as long as possible. To that end it
is developing a variety of offers to separate its lucrative business users
from the lower cost alternatives like Mercury's 'one-2-one' service which is
about to be launched.
So far the company has been successful in defending its revenue base. It has
been helped by apparently price-insensitive customers, few of whom have
bothered to switch down to the low-usage tariffs despite the fact that many
would be better off. Cellnet has been a weak competitor and, given the
similarity in pricing combined with the high returns, there is an argument
that competition is not working. Indeed, were it not for the variety of
standards about to be introduced, the case for an investigation of pricing
by the Office of Fair Trading might already have proved overwhelming.
Still, Vodafone cannot defy gravity forever. The company hopes for growth in
the UK market, and judging by recent connection figures there is a new nest
of chirruping yuppie chicks somewhere. It has also bought overseas
franchises to generate future sales. But foreign authorities may take a dim
view of excess profits from cellular operations as the price of technology
falls. Even the UK government may eventually get the same message.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSING STEEL plants is never popular. Not only does each employ thousands
of people, often in communities with high unemployment. They are also a
symbol of industrial machismo, echoing a time when steel production was the
foundation of much economic activity. But unless the European Community's
steel companies, which are expected to lose about Ecu4bn this year, take
decisive action to cut capacity, the industry will become increasingly
enfeebled, burdening the rest of the economy in the process.
A European Commission plan to resolve the crisis comes to a head next month
when the Council of Ministers meets to thrash out whether governments should
be allowed to aid their ailing companies. The industry's problems stem
mainly from decades of politicisation. Governments have poured subsidies
into new steel plants in mistaken job-creation initiatives. They have then
pumped in yet more aid to prevent closures. Between 1975 and 1990, the
industry is estimated to have received DM121bn in direct aid.
The Community needs a steel industry. But it should be slim and efficient,
not bloated and loss-making. It is not just capacity that needs cutting -
from about 130m tonnes a year to perhaps 100m tonnes - to bring supply into
line with demand. Many big integrated plants will need to be replaced by
lower-cost mini-mills.
The best way of achieving such a restructuring would be to allow the market
to work. But the public-sector owners of the Community's most inefficient
plants are determined to prevent closures. Italy, Spain and the Treuhand,
east Germany's privatisation agency, want to give more hand-outs to Ilva,
CSE and Ekostahl.
Italy argues its proposals do not involve Ecu4bn in aid, as the Commission
claims, but are merely a rational restructuring. This debate has certainly
been muddied by the Commission's decision to write-off debts owed it by
Klockner-Werke, the near-bankrupt private German group, in superficially
similar circumstances. Nevertheless, it is scarcely credible that private
investors would be prepared to prop up loss-making companies on such a scale
and for as long as their public-sector owners propose. The danger is that
taxpayers' money will be wasted and more efficient, privately owned
companies bankrupted.
The European Commission would like to take a tough line but has had to
soften its approach in response to political pressure. Anti-dumping duties
have been imposed on cheap imports from eastern Europe and limited aid will
be allowed if accompanied by capacity cuts. The Commission's approach may
still be rejected by governments. But, even if it passes, the consequent
restructuring will probably be inadequate. The crisis could recur.
A better approach would be for governments to bite the bullet now. Their
goal should not be to freeze economic development, but to ease adjustment by
giving more generous grants than those already planned directly to redundant
steel-workers and their communities. This would offer the best chance of
creating new jobs in industries with a viable future. Such an approach would
not only benefit Europe's taxpayers. It would also be in the best long-term
interests of the steel industry and of most of those who currently work in
it.

THE FLIGHT of Mr Asil Nadir to northern Cyprus has left three government
ministers facing accusations of improper behaviour after revelations that
they had raised his case with the attorney general. Mr Michael Heseltine and
Mr Peter Brooke have provided convincing accounts of their motives in doing
this. Mr Michael Mates languishes under the impression that he behaved
foolishly in giving Mr Nadir a watch inscribed with a message which appeared
to disparage those responsible for clearing up the mess after the collapse
of his business empire.
The fact that Mr Nadir was a significant contributor to the Conservative
party has again raised wider questions over the funding of UK political
parties. Reports that he sought help in adversity as a quid pro quo for
gifts totalling Pounds 440,000 during the 1980s may be unfounded. But the
secrecy surrounding donations to political parties makes it hard to counter
the charge that wealthy individuals such as Mr Nadir are buying influence or
political favours. The concern is heightened when the donations come from
overseas, such as the Pounds 2m given to the Conservatives by the Greek
shipping billionaire Mr John Latsis, or the sizeable gifts from two Hong
Kong businessmen.
The Conservatives seem to be the principal beneficiaries of private
generosity. But Labour, too, had its own embarrassment in the Pounds 30,000
given by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Labour is also vulnerable to attack
over the role of union funding in determining party policy. Mr John Edmonds'
stark claim this week that the GMB general union expected a say in the party
in return for its financial support has undermined Labour's attempts to
portray itself as loosening the union ties and representing a wider
constituency.
Greater disclosure of the funding of political parties would do much to
avoid the accusation that wealthy donors are buying influence. Companies and
unions are already required by law to publish details of political
donations. Parties should be required to disclose donations over a modest
limit made from individuals and other sources. Unless such a requirement is
introduced, the suspicion will remain that political parties are swayed by
the wishes of those who pay their bills.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RADOVAN KARADZIC

<TEXT>
An ignorant world supposes that we Serbs are triumphant. It is true that we
have won a difficult victory. We have survived and have not been beaten. But
there have been no prizes. Today we need a settlement as much as the Moslems
and the Croats. Zagreb gloats as the Serbian nation rots under economic
sanctions which Germany would never allow to apply to Croatia whatever
murders were done in its name. When will Washington, London and Paris
concede that this disastrous war stems from a false and fatal consent by the
US and the EC to German ideas about Yugoslavia?
Who imposed Bosnia's catastrophic 'sovereignty'? A committee decided to
partition Yugoslavia, a committee of politicians which miscalls itself the
European Council and which is responsible to no parliament. It consisted of
peop]e wholly ignorant about Yugoslavia. Yet this is a political detail. The
effective demand for the partition of Yugoslavia came from Germany alone
when it was the first EC country to recognise a separate Croatia in December
1991, unchecked by its reluctant European partners.
Who suffers most today? The Bosnian Moslems lured into their grab for
supremacy; the Bosnian Serbs pushed into a war they wanted to avoid; the
entire Serbian nation condemned to poverty for the crime of a minimal
solidarity with their brothers in Bosnia; the Macedonians whose economy is
smashed; the Greeks, Bulgars, and Romanians whose economies are hammered by
the loss of trade through sanctions on Serbia.
Bosnia is not 'Europe's backyard' - to employ the favourite expression of
the interventionists. A backyard is something intimately familiar. But no
European politician - I mean those on the Brussels circuit - and few EC
journalists can speak about Bosnia for two minutes without making ludicrous
errors of fact. The proposition 'Bosnia is Europe's backyard' is more than
stupid; it stinks of neo-imperialist arrogance, resembling the most
preposterous claims of the imperialists of 100 years ago.
What then is Bosnia? We can only start from its pre-war status. It was part
of Yugoslavia. The world does not want to understand Serbian motives in
Bosnia. But we must explain them until the world starts to listen. The Serbs
are a nation whose desire for unity was and is as strong as that of any
people in Europe. Yet we once consented to be divided, within Yugoslavia,
provided that a degree of Serbian solidarity remained available to us.
We never lived in a state called Bosnia, we lived in Yugoslav Bosnia. To
take away Yugoslavia was to take away all the compromises which held Bosnia
together. Even today we do not insist on being in Serbia, but we will always
insist on being with Serbia.
Well-meaning foreigners must not suppose this is fanaticism just because it
is inconvenient. We in Bosnia have never considered ourselves other than
Serbs, Croats and Moslems. There is no Bosnian patriotism. There is no
Bosnian nation. There is just a common home for three peoples. We know the
Moslems and the Croats of Bosnia far better than the foreign journalists.
We ask the Moslems and the Croats these questions: do you think we Serbs
have no right to distrust you with your record during the second world war?
Do you think we will accept the dismemberment of Yugoslavia and the division
of the Serbian nation without setting up our own state to live in safety?
Why not start talking to us now?
The Moslems ask today whether they are expected to live as virtual prisoners
on tiny reservations? The Serbian answer is no, not at all. But when did the
Moslems negotiate directly with the Serbs about a division of territory? Did
we refuse to examine the question of eastern Bosnia with them?
No Serb can deny that the Moslems need a secure home in Bosnia; no
thoughtful Serb imagines that there can be peace without them. Not
everything has been destroyed by this latest hurricane of history that has
swept through Bosnia. There is goodwill on our side, as I am sure there is
goodwill among the Moslems. Moslems are our Slav brothers. They did well in
Yugoslavia and suffered terribly once their leaders told them they had a
better future outside. They now require not only peace, but also
institutional safeguards and guarantees. The old Yugoslavia has gone.
Bosnia, or most of it, could still be recreated, perhaps as a confederation,
and joined at some stage to the remainder of Yugoslavia. Whatever the
future, it cannot be settled from the outside, and it should not be shaped
by the force of arms. The future must be negotiated among ourselves, and the
time to do it is now.

Expect an announcement any day of who has got the best-paid job in urban
regeneration in Britain - chief executive of the new Urban Regeneration
Agency. More than 200 have applied for the Pounds 90,000 a year post.
Current favourite for running what has been described as 'an urban
development corporation on wheels' is Eric Sorensen, the former civil
servant who now runs London Docklands Development Corporation. He'll get a
close run from Alastair Balls, another ex-civil servant who is chief
executive of the Tyne and Wear development corporation. Tony Pender, chief
executive of English Estates since 1979, could also make a good showing -
since his organisation will be absorbed by the URA.
If it's experience of the private sector that is needed, they could do worse
than go for Anne Ferguson, marketing woman of the year 1990, whose job as
head of group advertising and sponsorship at ICI has lost some of its
glamour following the break-up of ICI. Jan Hall, the ex-ICI manager who
heads up Coley Porter Bell, would be another good candidate.
Whoever gets the job has an important first task to sort out - defining the
new agency's role. Lord Walker, with his beloved Welsh Development Agency in
mind, sees the URA leading efforts to attract inward investment from points
east. The Environment Department would rather the URA got on with clearing
the 150,000 remaining acres of derelict land in Britain's inner cities. The
new chief executive will need the wisdom of Solomon to reconcile the two
viewpoints.

David Williamson, secretary general of the European Commission, is not
accustomed to being shown the door. But that was exactly what happened when
he tried to claim his bed at the Luxembourg Pullman last Monday.
Amid scenes of chaos rare in the somnolent Grand Duchy, managers hastily
dispatched EC dignitaries, assembling for this week's meetings of foreign
and finance ministers, far and wide. Protestations that a computer breakdown
had erased reservations did nothing to soothe the ire of the likes of Dutch
foreign minister Piet Dankert, who only belatedly secured a room. A trio of
senior Foreign Office diplomats travelling with Douglas Hurd were deported
by taxi shortly after midnight to the Hotel Senator, plum in the middle of
Luxembourg's red-light district.
Outside the hotel, Williamson was to be heard muttering darkly that the
Commission intended to withdraw all future bookings from the Pullman group.
No mean threat, given the size of the Commission's travel budget.

But the provincial government, while anxious to enliven Patagonia's less

the venture. Hence it is unabashedly calling all entrepreneurs, tour

Is Lord Hanson, founding chairman of Britain's 10th biggest company, going
to lose one of his most cherished possessions - his licence to serenade the
citizens of the nation's capital?
Melody Radio, one of Hanson's stranger diversification moves, is among the
six existing London broadcasters to pop in their licence reapplications
yesterday. But, given that there are another 42 applicants bidding for a
total of eight licences, it would seem rather unfair if all the existing
stations were allowed to hold on to their slots.
Why Britain's 10th biggest company needs to own a local radio station has
baffled some Hanson-watchers. But Sheila Porritt, Melody's managing
director, is unmoved by such ethereal questions. Melody has achieved
virtually everything that it promised when it started broadcasting three
years ago. Its weekly audience of 1m listeners gives it a market share which
is bigger than newcomers Kiss FM and Jazz FM combined, and second only to
LBC Talkback.
What Melody has not yet done is to struggle out of the red, even though its
profit and loss account is being helped through the recession by a spot of
Hanson corporate advertising in between m'Lord's favourite tunes. (Suitably
balancing dollops of advertising by the company, needless to say, are to be
heard on LBC).
Sounds as if Lord Hanson, at least, has no intention of letting himself be
outbid on this pet venture.

FT  09 JUN 93 / A tide that's not for turning: Remedies for persistent and
rising unemployment in Europe are proving elusive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment in developed countries has risen by nearly 3m since the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development began its
investigation into the causes of persistent joblessness in its member
countries a year ago.
The tally is expected to rise by a further 1m before the study is completed
in June next year. By then, the OECD expects 36m people to be out of work,
8.5 per cent of member states' labour force.
Little wonder that high and rising unemployment has become one of the most
pressing political issues, particularly in Europe where the bulk of the
unemployed reside. The OECD's latest economic forecast says that, by the end
of 1994, the jobless total will have risen to 8.25m in the US and 1.7m in
Japan - but 23m in the European community.
The EC Commission, mindful of its commitment to European union, has
recognised the potential threat to future economic and monetary integration
that rising unemployment implies. A month ago, the Commission, under the
direction of its president, Jacques Delors, announced a medium-term study of
unemployment and competitiveness in the EC. Social affairs commissioner
Padraig Flynn has since published a study-plan - the Community-wide
Framework for Employment - to examine over the next 18 months the reasons
for the low levels of employment as well as high unemployment in the EC.
Why is unemployment in the OECD, particularly in Europe, so persistently
high? The OECD's interim unemployment report, published last week, is strong
on description and vague in diagnosis. But it is emphatic on one point: that
active macroeconomic management is not the remedy. Pulling either the fiscal
or monetary policy levers will not solve a problem which the OECD says is
'in large part structural'. Governments should aim, instead, to cut budget
deficits and so reduce long-term real interest rates and encourage private
investment. The EC's framework paper agrees economic growth alone will not
reduce unemployment to more tolerable levels.
While Europe's current monetary squeeze may be pushing unemployment higher
than it might otherwise be, both the OECD and the EC have reasons to ignore
current macroeconomic difficulties and focus on the medium term. For, as the
record of the past two decades shows, the underlying jobless total has been
rising regardless of the ups and downs of the economic cycle. Every OECD
region has seen a trend rise in unemployment rates since 1960.
The report points to a shift in developed economies away from manufacturing
as a key reason for structural, or non-cyclical, unemployment. By the end of
the 1980s, it says, one in five workers was employed in manufacturing,
compared with one in four in 1960.
The report suggests that some combination of competition from developing
countries and technological change has reduced the demand for blue-collar,
relatively unskilled, male labour at prevailing wage levels. Hence the rise
in unemployment is concentrated among poorly educated men whose main
contribution was brawn, not brain.
The evidence suggests new technologies and production processes in developed
countries, rather than low-wage competition from the developing world, have
been the main reason for the decline in demand for unskilled labour.
Developing country exports to the developed world have grown rapidly in the
past three decades, but developing country trade remains too small to have a
significant effect on employment, other than in a few sectors such as
textiles.
More important has been a shift, within manufacturing, towards more
sophisticated technology and the employment of fewer workers overall. An
increasing proportion of the remaining jobs are filled by better educated,
white-collar workers. In the UK, the proportion of manual workers - both
skilled and plant operatives - in total manufacturing employment fell from
56 per cent in 1971 to 50 per cent in 1990. Thus, technological change in
the UK has reduced both skilled and unskilled manual employment.
In US manufacturing, the employment of production workers fell by 2.2m to
12.3m between 1979 and 1989, while non-production employment increased by
0.2m to 6.7m. The shift occurred largely within existing industries as they
upgraded technology and expanded the use of computers, rather than because
old, labour-intensive industries were replaced by high-tech industries.
The need, then, is for policies which create more skilled, and more
attractive, jobs while enabling the unskilled unemployed to update their
skills.
Job creation is of particular concern in Europe. EC countries, the
Commission's Framework for Employment explains, have a low rate of
employment against other industrialised countries - less than 60 per cent of
the working age population of working age is in employment, compared with
more than 70 per cent in the US, Japan and in the countries of the European
Free Trade Association, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Austria.
Moreover, as the OECD points out, the EC's job-creation record in recent
decades has, with the exception of the UK in the late 1980s, been dismal.
Employment in North America has nearly doubled since 1960, but has grown by
a mere 10 per cent in the EC. Member countries, the Commission says, need
policies which deliver 'a more employment-intensive pattern of economic
growth'. The paper suggests high non-wage labour costs in some continental
European countries, employment taxes, inadequate training and rigid working
patterns might explain this poor record.
'In the past we have tended to search for policies targeted only on the
unemployed rather than on creating employment,' says John Morley, head of
the Commission's Employment Policy Unit. 'We want to make the level of
employment a target for policy.'
Commission officials deny they are suggesting continental Europe embrace
Anglo-Saxon-style labour market deregulation by removing obstacles to hiring
and firing. 'Low levels of regulation tend to lead to low levels of
investment in training and skills,' says Mr Morley. 'It is not clear where
the right balance is, but it has to be struck.'
But the EC's list of policy options is similar to the OECD's standard 1980s
agenda, recounted in the interim report: more investment, encouragement of
entrepreneurship, labour market flexibility, better training, more support
for those job-searching and less generous unemployment benefits.
Is this the same approach tried for more than a decade without great
success? No, reply OECD officials. 'Ministers talk a lot about making labour
markets more flexible and reforming unemployment benefit systems,' says one
OECD official. 'But they don't actually do it - individual governments still
manage things in a sloppy way.'
Still, the OECD has not yet found compelling evidence that countries
following its policy menu have noticeably lower levels of unemployment.
Active labour market measures give the impression that governments are
tackling the problem, acknowledges one senior OECD official, 'but the
evidence does not suggest these measures are very effective in improving an
individual's ability either to get a job or to secure a higher income.'
A deeper problem for the OECD and European Commission is the mismatch
between the attributes and attitudes of the unemployed, normally men, and
those, often women, willing to take the kind of jobs created over the past
decade.
Those countries which have substantially increased employment in the 1980s,
the US and UK in particular, have encouraged the creation of relatively
low-wage service sector jobs shunned by the male unemployed and taken up
mainly by female entrants to the market.
The proportion of British women of working age who have jobs rose by 6.7
percentage points across the 1980s, but male employment fell by 2.6
percentage points. The US and the UK have substantially more women of
working age in employment than, for example, France and Germany - nearly 60
per cent on average in the 1980s, compared with less than 50 per cent.
The test for both the OECD and the EC is whether they can find solutions for
the root unemployment problem facing all developed countries - how to find
ways to re-employ unskilled men at wages they are willing to accept. For,
while raising female employment may be a laudable policy goal, and labour
market deregulation the fastest route to success, the evidence does not
suggest that it is also a route to lower unemployment.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Tokyo's old, new wedding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PREPARATIONS FOR today's royal wedding in Tokyo have provided an effective
diversion from Japan's worst economic downturn for almost two decades. For
the country's political leaders it has had the added allure of distracting
attention from the scandals undermining them. The ruling Liberal Democratic
Party is impatient to declare the worst over - understandably, since the
problems of the past two years have provoked calls for restructuring
throughout society.
In politics reformist groups are attempting to force changes in Japan's
corrupt electoral system. Three years of declining profits have obliged
Japanese manufacturing companies to slash investment, rewrite the terms of
the social contract based on lifetime employment, and revise many of the
management strategies fashionable in the the late 1980s. It will take
several years for Japan's banks to restructure in response to their mounting
bad debts, while the securities industry is still in parlous health. Nor
have Japan's international relations been left untouched. The slump in
demand for imports has helped to expand the Japanese trade surplus, and the
US wants to renegotiate its trade relationship with Japan.
Many western critics believe all this presages sweeping change: a challenge
to the LDP's dominance; liberalisation of the financial system and
rationalisation of the weakest banks and securities companies; a rise in the
cost of capital for manufacturing companies which will have to focus more on
profitability rather than expansion of market share; a loss of social
cohesion brought on by a rise in unemployment; the opening to international
competition of closed Japanese markets.
Not much of this wish list is likely to be fulfilled. Where there is change
it will make Japan's western competitors uncomfortable. Japanese
manufacturing companies could emerge in two years with much lower costs and
higher productivity. Some Japanese car companies have set out to cut costs
by 40 per cent in the next three years. The financial system is finely
balanced. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's redoubtable governor,
favours market disciplines to enforce restructuring, but many in the banking
industry want the Finance Ministry, often a willing accomplice, to manage
the crisis to avoid painful changes.
The prospects for far-reaching political change are even more limited,
partly because the main opposition parties would suffer at least as much as
the LDP under proposed electoral reforms. As far as social values are
concerned, the slowdown is not provoking a challenge to the established
order, quite the opposite. It was the brash, individualistic ethos of the
'bubble era' which threatened traditional values. Now there is a new
conservatism in the air, particularly for women, who are first to lose their
jobs in a downturn.
Ms Masako Owada's decision to forsake her career as a diplomat to marry
Crown Prince Naruhito may bring a modernising influence into the Imperial
Family but it also symbolises the strength of tradition in Japan. That
mixture of modernisation and conservatism is likely to remain the hallmark
of Japan for years to come.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Letter: Water companies require price rises for investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JANET LANGDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The privatised water companies do not finance their diversification
ventures from the profits of their main water businesses, as Mr Shutt
(Letters, June 8) mistakenly believes. Nor are they permitted to do so.
In raising funds for such ventures, the financial strength of the main
businesses is undoubtedly important. But so will the technical and other
experience gained from other ventures be helpful to the main water
businesses.
As regards what Mr Shutt calls the 'tax' on their customers, the water
companies are well advanced with a Pounds 30bn investment programme. This
will improve the security of water supplies. It will also enable them to
meet very demanding EC environmental requirements, both in the quality of
drinking water and the handling of waste.
Investment on this scale could not be accomplished by less profitable
enterprises. Nor, unfortunately, can it be achieved without price rises
above the level of inflation.

FT  09 JUN 93 / This little penny is for childcare: Day care for children
need not drain public funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should take the lead in expanding the provision of childcare
for people at work, according to the 11 UK companies which last week
launched Employers for Childcare with the support of the Confederation of
British Industry. The companies are large employers, such as Shell UK and
British Airways, which have tried to provide childcare for their employees.
Their claim that the government needs to do more to help them provide a
comprehensive childcare package therefore merits consideration.
They say, for example, that even the largest companies cannot provide
workplace nurseries in every location. The alternative - forming consortia
with other local employers to create shared childcare facilities - can be
time-consuming and complex to administer. They point out that workplace
childcare is often not the first choice of parents, who are reluctant to
drag their children into work every day. Yet, finding suitable childcare
close to employees' homes can be difficult, with a limited range of
facilities in many parts of the country.
What is needed is a marketplace within which employers and parents can more
easily purchase high-quality childcare. The first requirement is a national
register of childcare providers which would help companies find out what
services are available. This should be accompanied by some sort of quality
assurance scheme so that employers and parents can be confident of the
standard of childcare on offer. And the range of childcare provision needs
to be expanded to ensure there is a range of options in every locality,
including registered child minders, pre-school nurseries, after-school clubs
and holiday play schemes.
Some of these developments might be achieved by business initiatives - but
only piecemeal and in ways that would duplicate efforts in different parts
of the country. It would be more efficient for the government to take the
lead in creating such a marketplace.
This would not require the exchequer to finance unlimited expansion in
childcare. Employers who want to offer childcare to attract and retain the
best employees should be prepared to pay for it. So, too, should those
employees better able to combine work and a family - currently they may not
be asked to pay towards the cost of some forms of pre-school education.
But the government may need to fund new agencies and help create new
capacity for childcare. A precedent has been set with the Pounds 45m which
the Department of Employment is giving Training and Enterprise Councils over
the next three years to develop out-of-school facilities. This is a good
example of how relatively modest amounts of government money can be used to
prime the pump. If the first-year pilot is successful, the programme should
be expanded to cover other forms of childcare provision. Funds for such
purposes could be found by redirecting the money now spent on tax incentives
for workplace nurseries. Employers can claim capital allowances for
investment in workplace facilities, which are then tax-free for the
employee.
Employers for Childcare suggests extending the tax concessions to other
forms of support, such as childcare vouchers. This would be costly and would
give the greatest benefit to those who paid the highest rates of tax. It
would also discriminate against those whose employers give no such help with
childcare and must pay for it out of their after-tax income. A fairer and
more rational approach would be to make all childcare support a taxable
benefit for employees, using the revenue saved to provide better childcare
facilities.
Creating a comprehensive childcare framework need not add a penny to public
expenditure. But it could make a significant supply-side contribution to
business success by encouraging the best use of the country's skills and
labour force. The market where possible, the state where necessary, as the
German theorists of the social market would say.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Letter: Laws of marketplace also apply to brewing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While your reporting of the effect of tax changes on the strength of
beer has been admirably fair, your editorial, 'Weak beer' (June 8) made
curious reading.
It was surprising to see complaints about a failure to keep consumers
informed, and a reference to furtive product changes, in response to very
public announcements by brewers of these changes.
Most remarkable was your editorial line that it is wrong for a producer
industry to pass on tax increases to consumers in, to use your own words, a
modern competitive business. Your general business readership, not to
mention your own financial journalists, may be interested in this doctrine.
The laws of the marketplace, and the relationship between costs and price,
are no different for brewers than for any other business, including
newspapers. Your comments would be better directed at the root cause of the
problem, the over-taxation of beer even before the recent change of taxation
system.

FT  09 JUN 93 / A question of trust and security: John Plender on
proceedings that threaten to expose gaps in the regulatory framework
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the Goode Committee presses on with its review of pensions law after
the Robert Maxwell scandal, important questions about the security of
pension rights are about to be raised in a smaller but no less contentious
case in the High Court. This follows the Securities and Investments Board's
recent decision to issue a writ against trustees of the pension funds of the
unquoted Midlands conglomerate, Melton Medes. The proceedings threaten to
expose further inadequacies in the regulatory framework, together with
highly controversial advice from a leading firm of lawyers.
The story starts with the acquisition in 1986 by Melton Medes from Imperial
Group of two paper mills, Robert Fletcher (Greenfield) and Robert Fletcher
(Stoneclough). Immediately after the takeover the acquiring company declared
a pension fund holiday and suspended contributions into the funds.
The trustees, who included Mr Nathu Ram Puri, chairman of Melton Medes, and
Mr James Philpotts, chief executive, then sanctioned a Pounds 4m loan from
the two pension funds to the parent company at a rate of interest of only 2
per cent. This was subsequently increased to National Westminster Bank base
rate. Yet the terms still appeared to fall short of a commercial rate for an
unquoted company, which offered a second charge on less than prime property
for security. The pension funds were valued at just over Pounds 18m at the
time.
When employees discovered that pension money had been diverted into a cheap
loan to Mr Puri's company, they were understandably concerned about the
potential conflict of interest and loss of income. They were even more
concerned when the loan was repaid, but not in cash. The settlement of the
debt came in the form of a transfer of shares from Melton Medes in two small
quoted companies, Delaney Group and Marling Industries, where Mr Puri's
companies had large stakes. In the case of Delaney, Mr Puri was chairman and
controlling shareholder.
Since shares in both companies have plunged, the pension funds have suffered
losses as a result. And an investigation carried out by SIB has resulted in
an allegation in SIB's writ in the High Court that the trustees failed to
keep complete, accurate or proper records in relation to the Marling
Industries transaction.
Asked by the employees to look into the case, the Graphical Paper and Media
Union took advice from counsel on the investments in these companies. Melton
Medes' Mr Philpotts, meantime, consulted a leading pensions expert and
partner of solicitors Nabarro Nathanson, Mr John Quarrell. In an
extraordinarily frank letter, Quarrell offered reassurance, saying: 'My
advice would be to wait until matters develop because quite frankly it is
almost impossible to pursue a trustee for negligence when it comes to
investment. Most of the recent trustee cases in this area beggar belief.
Unless you happen to be an alleged extreme left-wing union type person
(namely Arthur Scargill) then you really have to have your fingers in the
till and it must be clearly shown that whilst they are in there they are
purloining large amounts of money, before anyone can bring a likely
successful action. Clearly, your situation and that which I have just
outlined are light years apart. Nonetheless I suggest you wait and be
cautious and not over perturbed by the fact that the particular trade union
concerned has managed to collect enough money to go and see Patrick Howell,
QC.'
The assertion that anything short of large-scale robbery would leave the
trustees safe from an action for negligence, while falling short of a direct
incitement to breach of trust, nonetheless looks remarkable advice -
especially to a trustee who was also an officer of the company that had
already borrowed at uncommercial rates from the pension fund.
Equally striking is the absence of any reference to the rules of the
self-regulatory organisation, Imro, which had authorised the trustee company
to carry on investment business. The rules constrain investment where the
trustees also have a personal interest, as Mr Puri had with Marling and
Delaney.
When approached by the Financial Times to comment on the legal advice
received by the trustees in relation to the controversial transaction, Mr
James Philpotts referred the call to Melton Medes' solicitors, D J Freeman.
Mr Marcus Rutherford, a partner in the firm, said that in the light of the
court proceedings over the pension funds it would be inappropriate to
comment.
As a description of the effectiveness of trust law, Mr Quarrell's letter
looks realistic, particularly in the light of a current high court action
initiated by the Graphical Paper and Media Union on behalf of pension fund
members. Having spent Pounds 250,000 of union funds on court proceedings,
the union was unable to pay for the next stage of a breach of trust action.
So seven employees asked the court to grant an order to release part of the
pension fund surplus to allow them to pursue their case. They proposed to
challenge the validity of the trust deeds, seek an inquiry into losses on
the funds' investments in Marling and Delaney, and demand the appointment of
independent trustees.
In January Mr Justice Vinelott showed reluctance to grant the order. He was
no doubt conscious that the costs for both sides were expected to run to
Pounds 1 1/2 m. The total value of the Fletcher pension scheme assets, now
merged into a single fund, was little more than Pounds 23m at the last
balance sheet date. The judge was also reluctant to remove Messrs Puri and
Philpotts from the board of trustees since this would have amounted to a
finding of guilt before the alleged improprieties had been properly
investigated. For the moment the court proceedings are in stalemate,
following a failure to reach a compromise between the two sides.
Meantime Mr Puri and Melton Medes have found a new way of transferring money
out of the pension funds into the company. The Financial Times has
established that property in Luton owned and occupied by subsidiaries of
Melton Medes has been sold to the fund at a valuation carried out by a small
London firm of chartered surveyors. A controversial aspect of the deal is
that the tenant-subsidiary, Balmforth Engineering, made pre-tax losses of
Pounds 184,000 in the last year for which accounts have been filed at
Companies House. At June 30 1992, the property was included in the pension
fund's balance sheet at Pounds 1.4m and accounted for 6 per cent of the
assets.
Significantly, property is exempt from the 5 per cent ceiling on
self-investment introduced under the Social Security Act 1990. The result of
this loophole is that the fortunes of present and future pensioners of the
Fletcher fund have become even more closely enmeshed in those of Melton
Medes, which has substantial borrowings, despite the attempts of the
employees to establish proper independence from Mr Puri in the courts.
To the layman, the issues in the case look clear cut. The trustees appear to
have been involved in a straightforward conflict of interest over the grant
of the original loan to Melton Medes. The return on the loan was
uncommercial and the pension fund has had no compensation for this. The
losses on shares in Marling and Delaney were also incurred in unusual
circumstances which involved potential conflicts of interest. In the light
of the history, the case for removing Messrs Puri and Philpotts, and giving
exclusive control to an independent trustee, looks overwhelming.
But that is the ethical, not the legal position. And for SIB, pursuing a
separate action, the case is not clear cut. For a start, it only regulates
investment activity, not the trustee function as such. And because the 1986
Financial Services Act had not come into effect when the original loan was
made by the Fletcher funds to Melton Medes, it has jurisdiction only over
events that took place after the Imro rules and SIB principles came into
operation.
SIB thus alleges that the share transactions whereby the loan was supposed
to be repaid were in breach of Imro rules and in breach of its own
regulatory principle of integrity and fair dealing. Its writ asks for an
order requiring the defendants to return the shares in Marling and Delaney
to Melton Medes. It then calls for them to restore the sum of Pounds 4m,
together with interest, to the pension fund. The question is whether the
courts will accept this slightly convoluted approach.
Either way, the protracted and tortuous nature of the employees' case
clearly demonstrates how the odds are stacked in favour of the employer
against the employees where pension scheme assets are in question. And if
the Goode Committee calls for the retention of the trust law framework for
pension funds, it will have to come up with radical proposals on enforcement
if it is to carry any conviction with those whose pensions are threatened.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Letter: Lamont embodied lack of government policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN TRANTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article on the departure of Norman Lamont as chancellor ('Hounded
out by fiction and foes', 6 June) did not address the reason why the
approach of the tabloids found an echo throughout the country. In essence,
he was the embodiment of the lack of a clear government policy.
The government has claimed credit for a recovery which has been won through
the hard work of the electorate and at the cost of high unemployment. The
recovery is not due to any fundamental government policy which has been
aimed at reducing inflation through economic restriction.
The lack of clarity of government policy is exemplified by, on the one hand,
Mr Heseltine's interventionist stance and, on the other, by the promotion of
privatisation to reduce government intervention.
The former approach has not been much in evidence - witness British Coal and
Swan Hunter - and the latter policy does not inspire confidence that the
government is operating anything other than a policy of 'sell and forget'.
Whitehall and the electorate must recognise the necessary but limited role
the government can play in the economy. Discredited policies on both sides
of the former Iron Curtain have shown that no government has the secret
formula for sustaining growth. Control in an economy is widely dispersed,
making economic movements impossible to forecast.
Government can only assist the wealth creators, the electorate, be they
entrepreneurs or the workforce building quality product. Government should
aim to take the long-term view, to manage the infrastructure of the country
and nurture the business environment.
Business will develop of its own accord but cannot be expected to be
responsible for the country's infrastructure while pursuing, generally,
short-term profit motives.
For these reasons, members of the electorate may finally realise that the
success of the economy resides with them.
Whitehall is but a sideshow.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Letter: DTI audit proposal little better than nothing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL FOWLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr L. D. McClements (Letters, June 4) - who believes the Department of
Trade and Industry's proposal that companies below the VAT threshold should
be exempted from compulsory audit requirements does not go far enough - is
pushing at an open door so far as much of the auditing profession is
concerned. But the government is leaning against the door to ensure it does
no more than stay ajar.
Certainly in this firm we feel strongly that the DTI's proposal, while
better than nothing, is not much better than nothing. We believe (as did the
majority of respondents to a consultative paper issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales) the level should be higher. We
suggest that audit should not be mandated by law for companies which are
defined as small, ie currently broadly those with turnover below Pounds
2.8m. While the directors of many companies with a lower turnover than this
will want to have their accounts audited, because the directors believe it
to be desirable or because shareholders or lenders believe it desirable, if
none of these parties believes that an audit is necessary, we do not believe
that the public interest is served by an audit.
There is another point which we believe should be addressed. Why do
wholly-owned subsidiaries require separate statutory audits for their
accounts, even if their holding company (whose audited accounts are
available at the Companies Registry) has guaranteed all their obligations or
when there are no outside creditors? We believe the UK should follow
available European legislation and relieve such companies of the compulsory
audit requirement. Auditors should only be entitled to earn income from
audits if the marketplace believes audits are worthwhile. We do not believe
the public interest is served by forcible audits on small companies whose
shareholders and loan creditors see no benefit in audit.

Sir, The retail profits of BAA, the privatised UK airports operator ('Retail
fillip helps BAA to 49 per cent advance', June 8), are certainly being
achieved at the expense of passenger seating and circulation at certain
terminals. At Heathrow Terminal One, for example, passenger flow is so
constricted by the cramming of retail units into a restricted area that
there is always a bottleneck after passport clearance.
Is this not an aspect of BAA's activities that the Civil Aviation Authority
should be reviewing.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Arts: The Velvet Underground - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the old the Town and Country the bar policy was simple. It sold bad beer
in plastic beakers designed to cause the minimum of injury when, not if,
they were thrown at the band. The T&amp;C is now the freshly-painted Forum and
things are different. The new management knows its customers' vices are
changing. And so on Saturday, the Velvet Underground, reformed and touring
again after 23 years, dusted off their old repertoire and performed 'Heroin'
in a venue which sells tubs of Haagen Dazs ice cream and coffee in hefty
china mugs.
The audience covered the pop age range. For two decades suburban rock fans
have grown up listening to songs of drug abuse and sado-masochism and dreamt
of the seedy glamour of late-1960s Manhattan when the Velvets were Andy
Warhol's house band. To have four of the original five members (Nico died of
a heart attack in 1988) on stage in Kentish Town, alive and well and
unmistakeably middle-aged somehow seems a breach of the band's contract with
its fans.
In the middle of a bit of doggerel 'We're the Velvet Underground', Lou Reed,
the lead singer, demanded 'what's wrong with this picture?' The answer came
when the band tried the old shockers. As Reed, arms bulging white and
unblemished from his tight black rock star T-shirt, declared: 'heroin, it's
my wife and it's my life', the credibility gap yawned.
The Velvets have always been victims of a widespread prejudice against
out-of-tune singing. For the faithful, Saturday's generous concert veered
reassuringly between the competent and the chaotic. Reed's voice has
improved with age and a more careful life. But the audience roared its
approval after drummer Mo Tucker's scratchy rendition of the gentle Close
the Door.
At other times the band struggled to settle on a tempo. But the slickness
would have been the greatest sin. The music was at its most engaging when it
teetered on the edge of collapse; when the band was making a mess of Reed's
simpler pop songs rather than when duplicating the original, eerie
recordings of 'Black Angel Death Song' or the gruesome, cautionary tale,
'The Gift' (children do not open man-sized parcels with power tools).
The only new song was 'Coyote', a slower number which closed the second
encore, signalling to the demanding crowd that it could expect no more. The
Velvets' original songs are entirely preoccupied with Manhattan nightlife,
quite free of nature references. 'Coyote' is a not a Velvets' song, it is
latter day Lou Reed. It was a pleasure to see and hear the enjoyment with
which they performed the old favourites. But they can never again be the
dangerous, amphetamine-powered creatures they were when they created these
songs. It is not just rock fans who grow nostalgic for irresponsible youth .

FT  09 JUN 93 / Arts: Harry Connick Jnr - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a commonly held belief that pianist/singer Harry Connick Jnr's music
is jazz for people who do not like jazz. This is probably correct and it is
certainly true that people who like jazz do not usually like the sentimental
crooning of Harry Connick Jnr. So what? It is popular music. Moreover, it is
pop music - standards, mostly - which involves a number of musicians who can
and do play interesting instruments such as the baritone sax, bass trombone
and tuba. Like Duke Ellington said, it is pointless to discuss what is or is
not jazz: there are only two types of music, good and bad.
Harry Connick Jnr is exceedingly good at what he does, which is to croon
pleasantly and swing a plausible big band. The singing is sub-Sinatra 1950s
brat pack style. The range is limited, but the diction is clear and he
wrings ballads such as 'It had to be you' for all they are worth. His piano
playing, which is rationed so as not to distract a non-jazz audience, could
best be described as 'honky-Monk'. By his own admission he models his
technique on the late bebopper's faltering and surging method but cuts his
playing with more vaudevillian verve.
For lesser performers, these derivations would not be enough to sell seven
million records worldwide. But Connick, who at the age of six was good
enough to perform at his father's swearing in as DA for New Orleans, employs
highly developed showbiz instincts. In the 1960s he would have been said to
have 'sex-appeal'. At the Albert Hall for three nights he high-kicks patent
shoes, rolls his sleeves up to zap and click directions at the choreographed
band, even tap dances, while singing 'toons' full of Big Easy charm.
Long and intimate conversations with the audience which discuss girlfriend
Jill's sore throat, his first sight of the Queen and George Michael not
recognising him had them squealing in the stalls. A half sung tribute to
Freddie Mercury was genuinely touching though the Jungle Book's 'Bare
Necessities' tested the limits of sentimentality.
It is impossible that Connick, who is in his mid-20s, will ever unite
disparate audiences in the way Ella Fitzgerald or Louis Armstrong could, he
is too good looking and not as massively musical. But he writes a catchy
'toon', employs musicians and cheers people up. Personally, I look forward
to seeing Tony Bennett next month.
Forever For Now (Columbia 473873) is the new retrospective collection. Harry
Connick Jnr and his orchestra play the Royal Albert Hall (tonight);
Newcastle City Hall, June 11; Nottingham Royal Centre, June 12; Liverpool

Perhaps television is growing up. Until recently if you had suggested to
those who run BBC2's access slot Open Space that the Duke of Westminster
should have the platform you could have expected a chant of 'Plutocrats -
Out] Out] Out]' to echo around Shepherd's Bush. Yet here he is at 7.40 with
30 minutes to tell the world about 'The Last Straw'. The programme builds on
a report by the duke called 'The Problems In Rural Areas', it seems that one
farm in five loses money, each day 13 farmers give up the job, and every
week four commit suicide. If you really feel that Britain's main problem is
crime and punishment you are in luck: we are offered several programmes
every day on the subject. Just Desserts (8.10 BBC2) asks whether there is a
cure for crime and traces the history of punishment. What fun. Inside Story
(9.30 BBC1) is concerned with 'Children Who Kill'. How jolly. There are two
worthwhile repeats. The Fall Of Squirrel Nutkin (8.30 C4) investigates the
decline of the red squirrel. The Insurance Man (9.00 BBC2) is Alan Bennett's
drama about Franz Kafka and government by bureaucracy.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Arts: Strength depends on the writing - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We were, it seemed, slipping into another long summer of television tedium,
with countless repeats and second eleven documentaries, relieved only by
sport. Once again it looked as though the unpleasant duty of the television
critic was to remind the broadcasters that even if top ratings do decline by
about three million between February and May, top-rated programmes such as
Coronation Street still attract 17m viewers even on warm June evenings.
Thus, although people are beginning to get back into their gardens, there is
still a vast audience for television, and no excuse for serving up
warmed-over bubble and squeak.
But the complaint would be absurd after a weekend which brought the eighth
episode in Edgar Reitz's Second Heimat: A New Generation from BBC2, Lynda La
Plante's Comics from Channel 4, and the beginning of Ken Russell's Lady
Chatterley on BBC1. Of course none of the three was beyond criticism, but
when a single category of programming shows such ambition, variety and
achievement in such a short period it would be churlish to issue yet another
blanket condemnation of the medium. Previous generations would surely think
it astonishingly ungrateful to complain when such diverse entertainment is
available in every British home.
Predictably enough, the least satisfactory of these three dramas was the one
which had attracted most fuss and hype prior to transmission: Lady
Chatterley (not, you notice, 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' because Russell has
used all three of DH Lawrence's versions of the story for his adaptation and
they all had different titles). Fashion now insists that we should dismiss
the notorious novel as a poor bit of work, but that is not why lack of
satisfaction with the television version was predictable. Actually, although
the book is not among Lawrence's best, it is still streets ahead of most of
the stuff which becomes so famous these days via Booker and Whitbread and
all the other publicity schemes.
The reason for doubt was that in the past 30 years Russell never seems to
have recaptured the flair that he brought to his Monitor programmes about
Delius, Elgar and others at the BBC in the early 1960s. Since then he has
been at his best when going wildly over the top, but it seemed unlikely the
BBC would tolerate this in an adaptation which was always going to be
touchy. Sure enough, we find neither the lyricism of Song Of Summer nor the
outrageousness of The Devils in Lady Chatterley.
There are moments of Russelliana: the black horse sequence with the naked
soldiers in garlands of flowers and Connie imagining Clifford drowning; and
when Connie's father - played by Russell who now seems to act, though not
terribly well, in all his own films - tells her 'Yer wanna get yer axle
greased, know what I mean?' But they are too few and far between, and while
Russell doubtless relished the knowing anachronism of the above phrase, he
did rather ruin the effect by having Clifford say 'There's something much
stronger than sex between you and I'. It seems unlikely that an Edwardian
baronet would make that sort of howler with a personal pronoun.
If Russell had simply stuck to extremes and given us a Marvel Comics version
of the story that would have been tolerable, but this Lady Chatterley feels
more like one of those desperately respectful Classic Comics adaptations of
Homer or Shakespeare. Too often there is the same awkwardness that you used
to feel in those 'Ho, varlet]' movies from Hollywood; it is virtually
impossible to suspend disbelief. Worse, Russell is now lazy and relies too
much on cliches. Not only does he have Joely Richardson musingly fingering
the surface of a nude in an oil painting, he also has her hugging an oak
tree. Both actions are as familiar on screen yet as untrue to life as those
people in films who keep saying 'Hallo? Hallo?' to a dialling tone. Thank
goodness Joely Richardson (who is so beautiful undressed that it seems a
pity she has to do any scenes clothed) and James Wilby, who plays Clifford,
are as good as they are at their jobs. Perhaps the same can be said of Sean
Bean who plays Mellors, but on that, judgment will have to be reserved.
Even though Channel 4 had transmitted only the first half of Comics at the
time of writing, it seems clear that this is the best television drama yet
from Lynda La Plante. It has the same narrative drive as Prime Suspect and
the same attention to arcane detail as we have come to expect from all her
work, but, mercifully, none of the finger wagging lectures on feminism.
True, the production is powerfully enhanced by the direction of Diarmuid
Lawrence who manages to make locations in London's West End look so
glamorous and dramatic that you begin to wonder whether they are brilliantly
constructed sets.
In the end, however, the strength depends upon the writing. La Plante has
plaited together three strands with great skill: stand-up comedy, a murder
story, and the private life of her central character, American comedian
Johnny Lazar. Any one of these might make a strong drama but the combination
is far more impressive. At the halfway stage there were some, presumably
deliberately, baffling components - was it Lazar's mother who walked into
the sea with a little girl to commit murder and suicide at the beginning?
Did Lazar's flashback of the street murder really prove that Delroy was the
killer and did Lazar perjure himself and swear the murderer was white
because his adoptive parents were black . . . or what? It served merely to
ensure that one returned the next day.
Comics was an original contemporary drama in two parts written expressly for
television. Lady Chatterley is a four-part adaptation of a 1928 novel. The
Second Heimat: A New Generation is a 13-part serial, set in Munich in the
1960s and written, produced and directed by Edgar Reitz. Saturday brought
Episode 8 and yet more proof, if any were needed, that this is just as much
a television masterpiece as Reitz's original Heimat. It is conceivable that
a viewer coming fresh to the work this week could have found it slow,
sometimes inconsequential, and occasionally hard to understand. But for
those of us who dodge dinner parties and tell lies to be sure to catch every
word, each episode adds to the sum of our knowledge and increases our
involvement.
Regulars will have been full of trepidation this week when Hermann agreed to
marry Schnusschen, however sweet and seductive she may be. We know that
Clarissa, the brilliant cellist (and actress Salome Kammer really is a
superb musician) is Hermann's soulmate, probably for life. When Clarissa
arrived at the wedding reception, regular viewers brought to the drama a
major contribution; we were as poignantly aware of how these two would be
feeling as if they were our own lifelong acquaintances. Sounds like any soap
fan? So be it, but you rarely find a soap opera with characters as authentic
and funny as Hermann's aunts who are always keen to know the location of the
nearest lavatory, or as persuasively real as Juan who this week attempted to
shoot himself through the heart with a rifle.
With drama as strong as this at weekends and sport as good as the First Test
and Nigel Mansell's IndyCar 93 during the week - not to mention Wimbledon
rapidly growing on the horizon - we may be in for a rather pleasant summer
season.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Arts: Gorecki, Smetana and Janacek - London concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT and ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was very nearly the concert of the CD - same work, same soprano soloist
(Dawn Upshaw) and orchestra (London Sinfonietta), and only the conductor
(Paul Daniel) different. Since Electra Nonesuch's record of the Gorecki's
Third Symphony continues to sit month after astonishing month at the top of
the best-seller charts, it is only natural that the Sinfonietta should wish
to draw on the benefits of that popularity.
This band has every right to. They paid attention to the Polish composer and
his music - including him, for instance, as focus of one of their 1989
'Response' weekend series, of which the Third provided the climax - at a
time when it was an act of daring to do so. Now they have been able to bill
two successive Gorecki evenings at the Barbican Hall and sell every seat.
At Monday's, first of the two, the atmosphere was festive, very different
from the general run of contemporary music concerts (the composer
autographed programmes during the interval). It would be a stuffy soul who
failed to rejoice in the orchestra's moment - shared, of course, with the
composer himself - of success.
But I do completely fail to comprehend how exactly it has come about: how,
indeed, such an acreage of sustained banality could have struck a chord with
the public at large. Perhaps the high-mindedness of the banality has
something to do with it: the Third Symphony, the 'Symphony of Sorrowful
Songs', is an essay in what one might call 'antique' style, with
stained-glass harmonies and lush string textures displayed slowly and at
length, over and over again, and it obviously requires - and in the
sympathetic listener encourages - an ear of faith.
Played and conducted with the greatest sensitivity, and sung by Miss Upshaw
with exquisite simplicity, this 55-minutes-worth worth of relentless
diatonic uplift was for me, nevertheless, excruciatingly hard to take. It
was preceded by the Three Pieces in Old Style, an early (1963) harbinger of
the holy-minimalist Gorecki still to come, and by the lighthearted Concerto
for harpsichord of 1980 (played, as ever, by the brilliant Elisabeth
Chojnacka), which has very little actual music in it but at least attempts
to disguise its poverty with a snappy mode of address.
If the crowd-puller in London on Monday evening was the Sinfonietta's
Gorecki bash at the Barbican, Radio 3 in its ever fastidious, discriminating
way chose to relay instead the Festival Hall's concert of Czech music, given
by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Libor Pesek. There is a feeling
that live concert relays are more strictly rationed on the network nowadays
and that the selection of concerts is sometimes eccentric, but certainly the
quality of the RPO performances justified the singling out of this event.
Pesek paired Smetana and Janacek, giving over the first half to four of the
symphonic poems from Ma Vlast, the second to the Glagolitic Mass. Throughout
the RPO was on first-rate form, not just in the extrovert shows of the Mass
where the brass excelled, but in the quieter, sustained beauties of the
Smetana poems to which Pesek gave a sense of symphonic coherence, a
consistent eloquence derived from beauty of tone and limpid phrasing. Even
the rhetorical charges of Blanik the last poem in this selection, had a
warmth and emotional focus that placed them far above run-of-the-mill
programme music.
Pesek's knack of getting something extra from all his orchestras clearly
carries over to the vocalists with whom he works. The Glagolitic soloists
were Helen Field, Ameral Gunson, John Horton Murray and Roger Roloff, the
chorus the Brighton Festival; John Scott was the organist. All were superb;
if one singles out Ms Field for special mention it is for the vivid
directness of her singing and fearless attack. On this evidence Pesek is
less furious in Janacek than some interpreters, but wonderfully,
unfailingly, vital.

FT  09 JUN 93 / People: From Capel to headhunting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Fergusson, who resigned from James Capel in April, has picked up his
first non-executive directorship, as chairman of headhunters Stephens
Consultancies, run by chief executive and founder Fiona Stephens.
'Fiona picked up the phone quick as a flash as soon as she heard I was
leaving' says Fergusson, 50, adding that the two have known each other for
20 years. While, as a fresh-faced headhunter, he would be too discrete to
say so, Capel is presumably a longstanding client of Stephens.
Fergusson resigned from his position as managing director after what he
calls a 'little row' with Capel parent Hongkong Bank group. Capel had
incurred losses of up to Pounds 16m on an eastern European venture capital
fund, New Europe Hotels, shares in which were sold mainly out of New York;
Fergusson had been in charge of Capel's international operations.
Following New Europe, the bank was anxious to keep a low profile in the US,
Fergusson explains. 'They regarded us as a bit aggressive - though I think
the rules of the game in the US are a bit different.' He says that at 50,
and with four youngish children, he would not have wanted to put in long
City hours for much longer.
Stephens, meanwhile, was looking for a chairman for the first time. 'It was
felt the business had got very large and it was necessary to bring some sort
of discipline to bear,' says Fergusson. He adds that, in his one day a week,
he will fulfil 'a mildly executive role'. The specialised headhunter
operates in New York and Hong Kong as well as London and Edinburgh.
For Fergusson, who joined Capel in 1969 as a food analyst, says that his
next ideal job would be on the board of a food manufacturer planning to go
public in the next two to three years.

</HEADLINE>

Professor Sir Roland Smith has just accepted his 10th non-executive
directorship, this time as chairman of specialist publisher Harrington
Kilbride.
'He is just the sort of person Ted Croker would have recommended to succeed
him if he had been planning his retirement' says Kevin Harrington, founder
and managing director. Croker, the former chairman, died suddenly last
Christmas at the age of 68.
Although the two never met, Smith, who is chairman of Manchester United
football team, will have known of Croker, who was secretary and chief
executive of the Football Association betwen 1973 and 1989.
'Given it was not a planned retirement we had to go back and define the
requirements. We wanted someone who was very much an international
businessman as well as someone who would fit in with the fair amount of
(sports-related publishing) that is still within the group,' says
Harrington, who did not employ headhunters to fill the position.
Smith, 63, is a also a director of the Bank of England, and chairman of
Readicut International and Hepworth in addition to other non-executive
posts. He was forced out of British Aerospace in a boardroom coup 18 months
ago.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Fashions in green -
Eco-clothing is a long-term trend, not a fad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ecology-consciousness has arrived in the apparel industry. While
eco-fashions have not yet been paraded down the haute couture catwalks of
Paris, Milan or New York, their niche in the multi-billion dollar apparel
industry is growing.
Since 1991, green-minded consumers have increasingly been able to find
stylish clothing made from raw materials and with processes that match their
concerns about the environment. Though many smaller companies were the first
to make eco-minded clothes, large, mainstream US manufacturers, such as
Esprit, Levi Strauss and VF Corp, are jumping on board.
'This is a trend, not a fad,' says Andy Baker, marketing chief for VF's new
O Wear division. The 'O' is for organic, because the clothes are made from
organically grown cotton.
VF, a Fortune 500 apparel maker whose brands include Lee and Wrangler jeans
and Vanity Fair and Barbizon lingerie, made Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) worth
of O Wear sales last year and expects that to more than triple this year.
Esprit, the women's sportswear maker, is in the second year of its
Ecollection, a special line of 'green' clothes. At retail level, sales ran
to about Dollars 4m last year, three quarters of which came from Europe.
Levi Strauss, the jeans-manufacturer, is preparing a launch of a 'naturals'
line of jeans. 'Naturals', market tested last year, are made with naturally
coloured cotton, eliminating the dying process which is a leading polluter.
Even footwear companies are entering the field. Nike, the athletic shoe and
apparel company, has introduced a shoe whose outersole is 10 per cent
re-cycled (reground) production scrap. Nike says the process cuts down the
need for source material and helps reduce waste headed for landfills. The
company plans to expand the process to all shoes in its outdoor
cross-training and trail lines.
The exact size of the eco-clothing market is unclear. The American Apparel
Manufacturers Association, which represents two-thirds of all apparel
production in the US, would not venture a guess. Carl Priestland, the
association's chief economist, says: 'No one knows. It depends on how you
define 'green'.'
But those in the ecology movement have a definition. Carl Frankel, editor of
the Green Market Alert newsletter in Bethlehem, Connecticut, says that
eco-clothes are garments made with the following:
'Green' or 'natural' cotton, which is conventionally grown but processed in
an environmentally improved manner, for example by reducing the use of
resins and toxic chemicals;
Organic cotton, which is grown without the use of chemical fertilisers or
pesticides and involves crop rotation and other special farming methods;
Naturally coloured cotton, which grows (both organically and conventionally)
in colours and does not require dying;
Recycled, post-consumer clothing, which is shredded and respun or woven.
By this definition, Frankel estimates conservatively that eco-clothes sales
were Dollars 20m last year and will rise to Dollars 80m by 1996. But some
feel the figure is higher and the growth of the market more explosive.
The increase in farming of organic cotton would seem to be an indication of
where the market is going. Melanie Gordon, senior analyst with the National
Cotton Council in Memphis, Tennessee, calculates that some 8,000 acres of
organic cotton were planted last year, with a 6m lb harvest. She expects
that to double this year.
Eco-clothing manufacturers, big and small, are uniformly optimistic about
prospects.
For example, Ecosport, a small, New Jersey-based company which was one of
the pioneers in the market, believes it will sell more than Dollars 5m worth
of its organic cotton clothing this year, up from Dollars 1m in 1991 and
Dollars 3.5m last year.
VF's Baker claims that 'demand is blowing out the doors', from speciality
shops. And Esprit expects its Ecollection to make a significant jump in
sales next year when distribution is moved beyond its own 56 stores.
Yet this is a business with more than profits in mind. 'It's sort of a
mission,' says Lynda Grose, the lead designer for Esprit's Ecollection, from
Manchester, England. The Ecollection began in 1990 as an in-house research
and development project. 'It was never really intended to be a business,'
says Grose. But it is now well regarded in the company and some of its
accessories and processes are being expanded into Esprit main lines.
The sense of mission is strong in this niche industry. Barbara Lesser, a
founder and designer for the Santa Monica, California firm 'Wearable
Integrity', says that while her clothes sell in up-market department stores
and speciality shops, she shaves margins to price them competitively. 'We're
committed to making this happen,' she says.
A barrier to wider consumption of eco-clothing is its price premium. Organic
cotton, for example, is scarce and costs twice as much as conventional
cotton. Naturally coloured cotton, which was pioneered as a commercial
product by Sally Fox, an entomologist in Bakersfield, California, is even
more expensive.
In addition, the 'greener' processes, such as the use of natural dyes or
synthetic dyes with a low environmental impact, are applied on a small scale
and are more costly.
But Fox, who is Levi's prime supplier and widely considered a star of the
eco-clothing world, is confident that demand will grow and that as it does
production will be spurred and prices will come down.
At present, eco-clothing makers say that as long as their products are in
the same price range as designer-name sportswear, consumers will buy them.
But they note that while consumers - whom they are trying to educate about
eco-clothing - are drawn to the ecology concept, they are not buying just
because it is a green product.
The challenge is 'to come up with things that break through the granola
image,' says Grose. 'The items that sell the best are the ones that look the
best.' Fox, with a pioneer's conviction, is sure it will catch on. 'The
public loves it,' she says.

FT  09 JUN 93 / People: Daiwa replaces European chief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's second largest securities house Daiwa is bringing Ryonosuke Miyoshi,
deputy head of the capital markets division in Tokyo, to London as the next
chairman and chief executive of Daiwa Europe.
Miyoshi, who celebrated his 49th birthday yesterday, was in London between
1983 and 1988 as head of the fixed income, money markets and derivatives
division.
He replaces Katsuhiko Fujimoto, who has been in London since May 1991.
Fujimoto, 56, returns to set up the new trust banking operation, a service
that the securities houses are now able to offer as a consequence of the
continuing capital markets deregulation.
Like Miyoshi, he is on the main board of Daiwa Securities.
In common with other Japanese securities houses, Daiwa Europe has found its
business from Japan tailing off.
Pre-tax profits at Daiwa Europe and its subsidiaries were Pounds 4.2m for
the year to March 1993 compared with Pounds 18.9m in the previous year,
Daiwa revealed yesterday.
However, it has sought to build up its European activities to compensate;
the company points out a number of Euromarket successes including recently
becoming the first Japanese house to lead manage a Eurosterling issue (for
Eurofima).

FT  09 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Hanoi finds Friends in
international places - Kevin Bubel on attempts to preserve the city's
culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BUBEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The visitor's first reaction to Hanoi is often surprise that after decades
of war, isolation and neglect it is still intact and in many places
unchanged.
Few cities in the region have managed to preserve their colonial and Asian
heritage under the pressures of rapid economic expansion. But while rapid
change looms for Vietnam, the drive towards prosperity may not sound Hanoi's
cultural death knell.
An organisation recently launched in the Vietnamese capital aims to
encourage new investment and growth with the help of corporate funds, while
preserving the city's culture and its architectural environment.
The Friends of Hanoi Heritage is an international foundation supported by
the Vietnam government, UNESCO and other international government bodies.
Its board of trustees is chaired by Gough Whitlam, the former Australian
prime minister. Accompanying him are Vietnam's Vice-Minister for
Construction, Pham Sy Liem, and the Vice-Chairman of the Hanoi People's
Committee, Dinh Hanh. Registered as a charitable trust in Australia, it is
starting to attract investment from corporate backers interested in doing
business in Vietnam. Cash will fund projects to set up the legal, economic,
social and political frameworks with which to get planning and conservation
programmes in motion.
In return, supporters of the foundation are promised useful business
contacts with Vietnamese officials and fringe benefits - such as use of the
Friends logo (a pagoda), government briefings on investment and local
television exposure. The biggest donors will also receive invitations to
briefings by Vietnam's prime minister and senior ministers. One of the
project organisers, John Goodyear says it provides an 'ethical entry' into
government and commercial markets. Goodyear, an Australian lawyer who has
worked in Asia for some years, is a director of the Sydney-based Indochina
Financial Services (IFS), the company appointed by the trust to direct fund
raising. 'It's about preserving the city while recognising there is going to
be economic growth. If it's not done correctly you don't have a city, you
have another Bangkok,' says Goodyear, referring to the development sprawl of
the Thai city.
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy group, joined the organisation at the
outset. It acts as the foundation's auditor and advises on setting up
investment structures.
The idea was first taken to selected companies in Hong Kong at the end of
February. Interest has also picked up in Japan, one of the largest foreign
investors in Vietnam and in Singapore.
The fund-raising target for the first three years of the trust's 10-year
duration is Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m). The foundation does not undertake its
own conservation projects, but brings in money and advice so that the
Vietnamese government can devise and implement its urban planning strategy.
For companies already involved with Vietnam, Peter Wallman, the IFS managing
director and a former Australian investment banker, says donations to an
organisation such as Friends could act as 'insurance' for keeping up good
relations.
'When you have a very powerful government which can make unilateral
decisions, it's really important for a company to be linked to the cultural
side of the country.'
Hanoi's western architectural influence, provided by the French before they
were forced to give up colonial rule in 1954, is much in evidence as the
city was spared US bombs during the Vietnam war.
Although run down, the streets of Hanoi, also the cultural capital of the
country, have a refined air. Divided into distinct quarters, the city was
devised on a small, human scale. There is little four-wheeled traffic, with
goods carried on the back of bicycles. But more cars would bring many areas
to a standstill. There, says Goodyear, lies the other incentive for outside
companies to consider the Friends initiative. 'If you're building a hotel
you'll want to be sure that in 20 years' time, traffic can still get to it.
You'll have an interest in maintaining development, so that the city grows
in a proper way.'
Putting together a city-wide cultural conservation plan is complex. It
involves road and housing development, resettlement of certain parts of the
community and disruption to local business, as well as shaking up national
and local government departments.
Friends has begun work on an archive of pictures and written material to
establish which buildings are worth saving, using sources in Vietnam and
France. The second stage will look at the drafting of a legal framework to
protect individual sites, define land rights and set planning and
construction standards.
A long-term objective is to pass on professional and technical expertise ,
so that the conservation and planning process can continue in Hanoi and
across Vietnam.
'The Friends can't unilaterally change the (development) law. But they can
say 'this is the recommended law' and if that is developed in conjunction
with the Vietnam government, then it's going to get legal passage,' says
Wallman. Decisions and projects will rest with Hanoi.
But Goodyear says that western experience could be 'layered in' to advise on
which errors to avoid.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Jobs: A nation of employment addicts - Although survey shows
the work ethic is strong in Britain, certain questions remain unasked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the Archangel Gabriel's sake, let's hope that the Almighty has a good
sense of humour. If not, it is odds on that the two-way communicator between
heaven and earth has been demoted or worse as a result of arriving on high
with a survey report just published here below by a consortium of British
employers and like interests.
The study's subject is work which, except for a spot of light gardening, had
no part in the original plans for human kind. It was inflicted on us, as the
Old Testament makes plain, as a penalty for our first forebears' sinful lust
for apples. That's why it is called 'Adam's curse'.
So heaven will hardly rejoice to learn that, far from looking on work as the
punishment it was intended to be, the Brits at least are leaping around
chortling: 'I like it] I like it]'
The study of 3,458 job-holders of all levels included a question asked in
surveys before. It was: If you were to get enough money to live as
comfortably as you would like for the rest of your life, would you continue
to work, not necessarily in your present job, or would you stop working?
When it was put to the public in 1977, no fewer than 60 per cent answered
yes. Since then, despite the bitter recession, the number who are hooked on
employment has risen to 67 per cent.
To make matters worse, their liking for it apparently grows as it becomes
harder. Not only did over three in every five of the latest lot happily
report that the effort demanded from them had increased in the past five
years, but 68 per cent claimed to be putting in still more effort than their
bosses required.
Besides hard graft, they are also having to invest more skill. True, nearly
one in 10 admitted that the technical demands of their work had diminished
over the last half decade, but another 63 per cent said they were being
called on to exercise greater skill.
The most marked increase in need for same was reported by those in jobs
involving frequent dealings with other people, such as professional staff,
managers, supervisors and the like. All reported more pressure on them to
communicate persuasively, and be sensitive to the wants of customers and
colleagues alike.
In return for their added in-puts, most workers at all levels were being
given a stronger say over what they should do and how they did it, and
allowed to be innovative in their approach. The only cloud in the offing was
that two thirds felt that their bosses didn't give them enough say over how
their work was organised - a grumble seemingly linked with a majority view
that, whatever their addiction to employment, they certainly weren't
dependent on their present employer and could well trip off elsewhere when
conditions improved.
But, while that cloud might make the report unwelcome in boardrooms as well
as heaven, the findings must come as manna to a beleaguered government. For
they suggest that, on a national plane, the work ethic is not just alive and
well in Britain, but stronger than ever before.
Even so, to the Jobs column's mind, the 3,458 people's answers may be less
crucial than certain questions they appear not to have been asked. For
example, how much of the employment they found so addictive consisted of
productive work?
It is clear that the two aren't just the same thing. As countless housewives
still demonstrate, it is possible to do productive work without being
employed. Equally, no one need look far for evidence that it's possible to
be employed without achieving any productive work. Nor is there any doubt on
which of the two Britain's future prosperity depends.
But even if there were, the present addiction to employment seems scarcely
healthy. For the survey shows that the mounting demands for skill and effort
have been accompanied by worsening experience of stress.
And in terms of material rewards at least, Adam's curse has not merely been
maintained, but is falling more and more on Eve as well. Whereas in 1984, 30
per cent of women job-holders explained that their earnings were essential
to keep their family from bankruptcy, the same is now said by 40 per cent.
FINALLY, to the underlying table which as on previous occasions is compiled
from the latest of the Wyatt management consultancy's surveys of senior
managers' pay and perks in 17 European countries. Anyone who wants full
information on the findings, which were outlined in this corner of the FT
four weeks ago, should contact Don McClune of the consultancy at 21 Tothill
St, London SW1H 9LL: telephone (0)71-222 8033, fax (0)71-222-9182.
Today's table is limited to 10 of the countries, and gives a broad idea of
how each of them views the relative status of the various departments of
business as measured by the money value employers put on their directors.
The basis of the ranking is the typical gross pay received in cash - basic
salary plus bonuses and so on - of a chief executive in the country in
question, a figure which is indicated at the top in italic type. The
departmental directors are then listed below, their order of appearance
being decided by their typical gross pay expressed as a percentage of the
chief executive's rewards.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Management: A shot of advice for business travellers -
Vaccinations are still extremely important / Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE astuteness in other fields, business travellers tend to be
dangerously cavalier about health. Trips are often arranged at short notice,
when other matters take higher priority. Unless their employer takes
responsibility for preventive medicine, business travellers give it little
thought, or simply assume that staying in good hotels guarantees good
health.
While this may hold more or less true for North America, Northern Europe,
Australia and New Zealand, the rest of the world is more perilous and there
are some precautions travellers should find time for, no matter how rushed
the schedule.
An incomplete course of immunisations is better than none.
Travellers should be up to date with tetanus as the spores which cause the
disease are widespread in the developing world. Admittedly tetanus is more
of a hazard for those roughing it, but infection can result from very
trivial injury and the right treatment may be unavailable in an emergency.
Provided a traveller has had a full course of tetanus toxoid in the past, a
booster every 10 years is enough.
Polio presents a serious risk in countries with poor hygiene and may be
spreading in Europe too. The British have little natural immunity to it, so
again immunisation is essential.
Those who have never had polio vaccine need three oral doses (drops or sugar
cube) at monthly intervals. Anyone immunised in the past needs only one
booster every 10 years - worth doing even if travel is not on the agenda.
Typhoid is also widespread. The traditional vaccine requires two doses and
protection lasts three years. The new oral vaccine Vivotif is only three
capsules (one capsule, alternate days) and avoids the feverish reactions
associated with the traditional vaccine. There is also a new single-dose
injectable vaccine, Typhim Vi, which seems free of significant side-effects.
Another new vaccine is that for hepatitis A, which supersedes the painful
and relatively ineffective gamma-globulin injection. Hepatitis A is common
in the developing world, but it occurs in Britain too, so some people are
already immune. If time allows, check immunity with a blood test before
having the vaccine.
An international vaccination certificate for yellow fever is still needed
for Nigeria, Ghana and many other countries, and the certificate is not
valid until 10 days after the jab. The vaccine gives virtually 100 per cent
protection for 10 years and is given in about 600 specialised centres in the
UK.
Cholera vaccine provides negligible protection and there is no longer any
international requirement for it. Nonetheless, immigration officers in some
countries still ask for a certificate - hence the risk of hepatitis B or HIV
from a dirty needle at the port of entry. If going to Zambia, Mexico, or
parts of South America, it may be a good idea to be armed with an exemption
certificate, have the vaccine before departure, or take a small supply of
sterile disposable needles, available from Masta (Medical Advisory Services
for Travellers Abroad).
Only 5 per cent of travellers' illnesses are preventable by vaccines.
Even in the most prestigious accommodation, care with food and water is
important in preventing cholera as well as common types of diarrhoea which
could otherwise ruin a vital meeting.
Anti-malarial tablets are vital if visiting a malarious area and should be
started a week before the trip and continued for at least four weeks after
returning home.
According to one estimate, only two-thirds of those at risk are taking
anti-malarials, so it is no surprise that 2,000 people import malaria into
Britain every year, of whom about a dozen die. Even normally low-risk areas
such as Ethiopia and Zambia have seen epidemics recently and malaria
parasites are also becoming more resistant to drugs. The right tablets
depend on the itinerary, including stopovers. Check the current situation by
phoning the Malaria Reference Laboratory Healthline on 0891 600 350.
Protection given by anti-malarials is important but far from perfect.
Measures should also be taken to prevent mosquito bites. The anopheles
mosquito (the female of which transmits malaria) tends to be more active in
the evenings, so sleeping under a mosquito net can help, especially if it is
impregnated with insecticide.
Air-conditioning, when working, reduces the chance of being bitten, but one
has to leave the hotel sometime.
Outside, cover legs and arms with clothing after sunset, and apply insect
repellents to exposed skin (Jungle Formula products can be bought from
chemists before departure.)
Masta can supply up-to-date immunisation advice and health briefs for
individual countries, and will fax if necessary. Call 071 631 4408 with
itinerary.
British Airways travel clinics provide a wide range of vaccinations,
including yellow fever and other travel advice. A recorded message, on 071
831 5333 gives details.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Management: Finding the right Touche - Tim Dickson looks at
Henderson's strategy for integrating a fund management rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budding empire builders in the City of London must be heartened by stock
market reaction to the Pounds 42.5m acquisition of Touche Remnant by fund
management group Henderson Administration. Henderson shares, after all, have
outperformed the FT-A All-Share index by 20 per cent since the merger was
first proposed in October.
There is more to takeovers in the financial services sector, however, than
sound timing and a good strategic fit (the aspects of the deal which have
gone down well with investors). Combining businesses with more than their
share of highly paid egos, reconciling different computer systems and
physically transferring furniture and other equipment to tight timetables
represents a large organisational challenge and demands a particular blend
of management skills.
'The process of integration is complex,' said Ben Wrey, Henderson's
chairman, with, no doubt, deliberate understatement, as he announced the
group's 1992/93 financial results on Monday.
Wrey and colleagues acknowledge that this process is not complete. But they
believe that the smoothness of the transition so far augurs well for the
future of the enlarged group (combined funds under management Pounds 11.5bn,
including a wide range of investment trusts, unit trusts and pension funds),
and contains valuable lessons for others.
Certainly the vacating of Mermaid House - Touche's riverside offices - and
the relocating of Touche personnel inside Henderson's headquarters in the
Broadgate complex, look to have been achieved with enviable speed and
efficiency. More questionable is whether Henderson can be equally proud of
the way it handled the human resources issue.
To be fair to Henderson, the long gap between the first public announcement
of talks on October 13 and completion of the deal on December 22, followed
immediately by the Christmas break, inescapably heightened tension.
Moreover, when all is said and done, defections of key staff were minimal
(and non-existent in the case of fund managers).
Any scope for criticism lies in the time taken to inform employees about
their personal futures. More than half of Touche's 160 staff, and 10 of
Henderson's pre-merger total of 400 employees, were made redundant, albeit
after free counselling and additional compensation for those with long
service.
Henderson obviously thought it reasonable in the circumstances to set a
deadline of January 19 for talking to each employee. Inevitably perhaps,
others disagree. One executive who has since left the group voluntarily -
and therefore with no axe to grind - believes better planning was possible
in the weeks leading up to completion. 'There was nervousness for longer
than was necessary, particularly among senior Henderson staff, and I think
some people who might have stayed didn't do so because of the uncertainty. I
know hindsight is a wonderful thing but the lesson for me is to communicate,
communicate and communicate. Then to do it again.'
Henderson's personnel director Michael Robinson insists two-way
communication was a priority from the start. 'Studies show that 50 per cent
of takeovers ultimately do not meet their commercial objectives because of a
failure to win the hearts and minds of the acquired staff,' he observes.
'People invent information if kept in the dark.'
Henderson's decision to enlist the services of a third party - the
consultancy People in Business - can be seen as a sign of this commitment.
The brief was to talk to key staff in both companies to establish their
perceptions and their expectations of the merger. The resulting comments -
unexpurgated if unattributable - were apparently pretty robust but by all
accounts Henderson responded to the criticisms. 'It made us aware of a
number of misconceptions about ourselves, our business, and how we operate
it,' is how Robinson puts it.
Henderson mentors - known internally as 'pilots' or 'shadows' - were
assigned to each Touche employee to help speed up the process of
assimilation. But Robinson says this could take a year.
If cultural adaptation inevitably takes time, the physical transfer of
Touche staff and their systems was achieved a week ahead of schedule.
Henderson, though, had the perfect incentive to get cracking, expiry at the
end of March of a three-month, rent-free period negotiated with Touche's
previous owners, the French bank Societe Generale.
Nevertheless, recalls the managing director of administration John Hughes,
'Two firms of outside consultants told us that transferring all the systems
and converting them in the timescale couldn't be done in businesses of this
size.'
Advance planning was clearly crucial. Even before talks between the two
sides were publicly announced, the bidder had decided to make integration a
joint exercise - with Henderson and Touche staff working together. Joint
Integration Groups (JIGs) were established for nine main business areas,
each of which was given simple control and management guidelines.
Flexibility was maintained, though, so that the approach of each JIG could
be varied. 'It is easy to overplan these things,' observes corporate finance
manager Mark Lund. 'In many instances a one-page plan is sufficient, but in
others a more detailed plan is required.'
Good communications - vertically between JIGs and the overall steering group
and horizontally between JIGs - ensured that operational problems were
mostly resolved as they cropped up. There was also a strong emphasis on
motivation, ensuring that good work was recognised and rewarded.
Fred Kinahan, Henderson's facilities manager and the man ultimately
responsible for co-ordinating the 15,000 man-hours (nine man-years) of
relocation effort, believes the achievements of properly motivated people
cannot be over-estimated. 'One of the major motivational factors for our
team was when senior management took the time to thank them for doing a good
job (and not just at the end of the project).'
The unplanned-for invariably happens, as when the crane company due to
remove Touche's four, one-tonne Kardex Lectriver mechanical filing machines
let Henderson down. 'Our team showed great ingenuity,' says Kinahan. 'They
dismantled each machine into several hundred parts, manhandled them out of
the building and reassembled them at our office. What's more they still work
and the cost worked out at 70 per cent less than the outside contractor.'

FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Powers 'limit VAT appeals'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to grant Customs draconian powers which will make it more
difficult for businesses to appeal against VAT assessments.
Labour said yesterday that clause 46 of the Finance Bill, which implements
the Budget, would restrict the right of businesses to appeal against VAT
charged on goods and services bought for business rather than private use.
But the government argued that under the current system inconsistent
decision-making by tribunals had resulted in businesses being allowed to
reclaim VAT paid on goods such as hi-fi systems, personalised number plates
and yachts.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM attacked over Iraq arms probe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday accused Mr John Major of trying to 'bring down the
shutters' on the arms-for-Iraq affair, as it launched its strongest attack
yet on the government's refusal to answer questions on the subject.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary, charged the prime minister with
betraying promises made when the Scott inquiry was set up.
Mr Cook's comments followed a written answer by Mr Major in which he turned
down a request to make it government policy to give substantive replies to
parliamentary questions on arms-for-Iraq.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Crossrail bill wins second reading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT wants the private sector to be 'fundamentally' involved in
the Crossrail project, Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, said last night
as the bill clearing the way for the Pounds 2bn scheme received its second
Commons reading, David Owen writes.
Mr Norris sidestepped repeated requests to outline what proportion of
funding for the scheme to build a pair of rail tunnels under central London
ministers were hoping to raise from private sources.
But he emphasised the government was not contemplating a project to which
the private sector 'might merely make a small contribution.'
Mr Brian Wilson, a shadow transport spokesman, said Labour supported the
bill 'above all' because the economy needed the sort of kick start that
projects such as Crossrail could generate.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peers reflect division on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RIGHTWING minister yesterday gave an implicit acknowledgement of the rift
within government over Europe, as Maastricht supporters in the House of
Lords warned of grave consequences if the treaty was not ratified.
As the marathon Lords second reading debate completed its second and final
day, Mr Michael Forsyth, a junior employment minister, admitted it was
'bound to be the case that not every minister can agree with every aspect of
government policy.'
But - interviewed on BBC Radio 4's The World At One - he said that once a
decision had been taken, ministers were 'bound by collective
responsibility.' There was 'a united front' in the government, he said.
He sidestepped a question over whether he was one of the 14 junior ministers
whom Mr Edward Leigh, a former minister sacked in last month's reshuffle,
has indicated used to meet to discuss their unhappiness over Maastricht.
The interview followed Mr Forsyth's presence in the Lords on Monday during
the speech by Lady Thatcher, in which the former prime minister called again
for a Maastricht referendum.
In yesterday's debate, Lord Healey, the former Labour chancellor,
highlighted what he called the 'civil war' within the Conservative party,
warning it could 'poison Britain's political life' and 'corrupt the British
government's policy in every field.'
He found it 'particularly tragic' that Conservative infighting had 'played a
major role in deepening the crisis in Yugoslavia.' Prime minister John
Major's failure to confront 'head on' the type of nationalism espoused by
Lady Thatcher had made the 'civil war in the government party a danger to
Britain and to Europe as whole.'
Viscount Whitelaw, Lady Thatcher's former deputy prime minister, accused
Maastricht opponents of taking 'a narrow-minded view' when a broader
approach was needed 'in the interests of world peace.'
He told those demanding a referendum that parliamentary procedures had stood
the test of time and should not be changed on a 'short term, opportune
basis.'
In another strong speech supporting Maastricht, Lord Callaghan of Cardiff,
the former Labour prime minister, said the imperative that impelled the
treaty was 'the overriding necessity of preserving the peace and security of
the European mainland and hence the British Isles themselves.'
But Lord Tebbit, the arch Euro-sceptic and former chairman of the
Conservative party, attacked the treaty's proposed move towards monetary
union, saying the question that supporters of Maastricht needed to address
was whether a single currency was practical, whether it was achievable and
whether if achieved it would be in the EC's interests.
'A single currency as chancellor Kohl has explained requires a single
government,' Lord Tebbit said.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dark delusions on the Conservative
right - Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE arrogance is breathtaking. Follow the scenario now being mapped out by
some of Mr John Major's so-called supporters on the Tory back benches at
Westminster.
The prime minister, already badly wounded, is delivered a fatal blow by a
Conservative defeat in the Christchurch by-election. He struggles on until
the autumn.
A stormy party conference (spiced with the revelations promised in Lady
Thatcher's memoirs) and an anaemic economic recovery sap what remains of his
political authority. The men in grey suits appear on the steps of 10 Downing
Street.
Mr Major decides not to wait for a formal leadership challenge and retires
on health grounds to Huntingdon. Mr Norman Lamont considers justice has been
done. The Tory party elects by acclamation Mr Kenneth Clarke as prime
minister.
There are one or two conditions, of course. The right wing of the party, so
disenchanted now with the leader they chose to replace Lady Thatcher, demand
that the centrist Mr Clarke don a suitably ideo-logical straitjacket.
Mr Michael Portillo must be given the chancellorship - with a free hand to
dismantle the welfare state. Mr John Redwood is promoted from Wales to
health. Mr Peter Lilley keeps command of social security.
Mr Michael Spicer, the self-proclaimed leader of the Fresh Start group of
anti-Maastricht MPs, returns to the government as minister for Europe.
All that agreed, the Euro-sceptic right is perfectly happy to sustain the
government in office for another two or three years.
The fantasy does not end there. For all the valiant efforts of Mr John
Edmonds to ensure that Labour never again becomes a party of government, Mr
John Smith wins the general election.
Mr Clarke goes the way of his two predecessors. He is replaced, yes, by Mr
Portillo. The true heir to Thatcherism has four years in opposition to
stiffen the ideological backbone that sustained the Conservatives in the
1980s.
If, by some mishap, Mr Clarke wins the election, then Mr Portillo, still a
stripling of 43, remains well placed to assume the mantle four or five years
later.
No wonder Mr Major is weary.
For the above represents not the dark delusion of one of Westminster's
occasional, overlooked eccentrics. Instead, give or take a detail of two, it
encapsulates the embittered dream of two dozen MPs on the Tory back benches.
Add one or two further modifications and up to 50 - including a handful of
ministers - might sign up.
So deep during the past year has their hatred of Maastricht run, so great is
their detachment from the world of government, that Mr Major's very own
Militant Tendency now operates outside the para-meters of political logic.
That brings us to the arrogance. There is no mention of the electorate -
save as a convenient instrument for Mr Clarke's early replacement by Mr
Portillo. In this self-obsessed world, politics is no longer about such
esoteric notions as good government but about revenge and ideological
purity.
There is no reference to the commitments offered to the voters barely 15
months ago. Instead, a new dictum is applied: Conservative manifesto pledges
operate not for the lifetime of a parliament, but only during that of the
leader who penned them.
Of course, it will not happen like that. Politics is not susceptible to neat
blueprints. The notion that a few dozen backbench MPs can choose now who
might lead the Tories in five or 10 years' time - assuming there is still a
party to lead - lies outside the realm of sensible politics.
So, too, does idea that the party can swap its prime minister every two or
three years and remain a coherent force in politics. Mr Portillo is an
astute politician. He might one day lead his party. But he must tremble at
the thought of the future mapped out by Mr Major's enemies.
For all their noise, the Tory right remains a minority. Taken as a whole it
can claim, at most, the support of a third of the 332-strong parliamentary
party. That is a distinctly generous estimate. The hard-line Eurosceptics
represent half again of that number.
So Mr Major can relax?
Well, no. If his fortunes continue to slide, the ideologues may enlist the
support of that other lethal grouping in the Tory party - the pathological
panickers. They are scornful of their colleagues' bizarre plan for the
rebirth of Thatcherism. Yet some are already whispering that salvation in
the end may lie with Mr Clarke.
The odds still are all this will turn out of be a particularly acute attack
of midsummer madness. But it is no longer possible to be sure. In its
present state, the Conservative party is capable of anything - including
setting off on the route to self-destruction.
