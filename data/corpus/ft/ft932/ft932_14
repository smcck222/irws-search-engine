FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Aid body set to lose funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to end its aid funding for the Commonwealth Development
Corporation, Britain's main agency for channelling aid to the private sector
in the developing world.
In figures about to be released under the Foreign Office's cash plans for
next year, the current CDC funding of Pounds 49m will disappear next year.
In part compensation, the CDC will not pay interest on outstanding loans.
The total Overseas Development Administration budget is set to rise by 4 per
cent from Pounds 2.27bn to Pounds 2.31bn, with the only significant
increases being rises from Pounds 202m to Pounds 272m in funding for the
European Development Fund, and from Pounds 131m to Pounds 187m in EC funding
for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The CDC is the main casualty of a 35 per cent increase in funding for
European Community aid efforts - a shift that has occurred in spite of
criticisms by ministers and members of parliament about inefficiencies in
the way aid from the EDF is disbursed.
That shift will raise the EC share of Britain's gross aid budget from less
than 15 per cent this year to 20 per cent in 1994. The decision will cut the
projects it supports from more than 300 last year, to about 200 in 1994, the
CDC says.
The cut comes in spite of a recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report,
which commended the CDC as providing 'a highly effective form of aid' that
'fits well with the trend of international thinking on development
assistance.'
The decision will 'take the growth out of the CDC, and make us sweat a bit
more', Mr John Eccles, CDC chief executive, said yesterday.
He emphasised that net funding averaging Pounds 20m a year over the past
five years had enabled the CDC to disburse more than Pounds 150m.
He said that the shift towards aid funding from Brussels would force the CDC
to look more in the future to the EC for support.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heath urges shake-up in
anti-terrorism strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAMATIC changes in the government's anti-terrorism policy, including a new
central counter-terrorist agency, to stop IRA bomb attacks on the City and
elsewhere, were urged yesterday by Sir Edward Heath.
The former prime minister called for the appointment of a senior cabinet
minister as an anti-terrorist 'supremo' and said the government should
consider providing public money to help collect information on
paramilitaries.
Sir Edward was incredulous that, in spite of experience in Northern Ireland,
security forces had failed to prevent the IRA planting enough explosive in
the City to cause Pounds 300m of damage.
The state had to outwit terrorists, he said. 'You have to be cleverer in
intelligence, cleverer in action, and cleverer politically and to be
perfectly blunt, we have failed in all three.'
MI5, the domestic security agency, had failed to adjust to the post-Cold War
era, he said. He backed the setting up of a centralised counter-terrorism
agency to integrate intelligence networks.
Sir Edward's comments came as MPs debated the renewal of the government's
emergency powers in Northern Ireland. Adding to the embarrassment of
ministers, he also called for the Rev Ian Paisley, hardline leader of the
Democratic Unionist party, to be excluded from political talks on the
province's future.
The former prime minister said the Sunningdale power-sharing deal of the
1970s had worked only because he had excluded Mr Paisley. 'He doesn't want
agreement, he always does everything possible to prevent agreement,' Sir
Edward said.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is trying to re-start talks
but Mr Paisley has refused so far to meet him.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MoD cash details revamped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBERS of soldiers, air force officers, tanks and frigates deployed on
particular commitments will be among the details given for the first time in
the annual statement on defence spending.
The revamped format for the white paper, which Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
defence secretary, is to publish early next month, will identify individual
tasks, set out the manpower and equipment resources allocated to them, and
give a clearer idea of the costs of the operations.
The stated aim is to widen the public debate on defence spending beyond a
handful of specialists, but the new way of presenting information will also
help the ministry of defence in its negotiations with the Treasury during
the public spending round.
Because of 'double-hatting' - resources used to fulfil more than one
commitment - the total cost of all the individual tasks will be far higher
than the total defence budget, reinforcing the MOD's arguments about value
for money.
Ministers believe also that the armed forces command such 'affection and
respect' from the British public, that the MOD can only gain from bringing
greater openness and transparency to the defence accounts.
There was initially some resistance from officials and the military, but
they have now been convinced of the benefits. The revised approach will
combine information which had formerly been published piecemeal or only in
response to questions, with some material that has not previously been
available.
'The Russians had this information but the British didn't,' one minister
said yesterday.
It also has the advantage of containing in a single statement details of
equipment projects which have been cancelled, scaled back or delayed, thus
enabling the MOD to avoid several successive 'bad news' announcements.

THE traditional pre-Budget 'purdah,' when Treasury ministers refrain from
public comment, is expected to start immediately after Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the Chancellor, addresses the Tory party conference in October.
Treasury officials are drawing up a timetable for the run up to the first
unified Budget, in November, that envisages a shorter than usual 'purdah'
but does not abolish the convention completely.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour rounds on PM over Iraq probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR YESTERDAY accused Mr John Major of trying to 'bring down the
shutters' on the arms-for-Iraq affair, as it launched its strongest attack
yet on the government's refusal to answer questions on the subject, David
Owen writes.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, charged the prime
minister with betraying promises made when the Scott inquiry was set up.
'This is the arrogance of a government that has been in power so long that
it has forgotten it is accountable to parliament,' he said.
Mr Cook's comments followed a written answer by Mr Major in which he turned
down a request to make it government policy to give substantive replies to
parliamentary questions on arms-for-Iraq.
'These issues are being investigated by Lord Justice Scott, and it would be
wrong for the government to comment on them before publication of his final
report,' Mr Major said.
The government was 'making all the relevant facts available to the inquiry,
and it is right that we should wait for Lord Justice Scott to present his
conclusions before commenting publicly.'

FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories under pressure over dockyard
row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR SUCCEEDED yesterday in highlighting the government's wariness over
the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards by securing an assurance that no
announcement on a crucial nuclear submarine refitting contract will be made
before June 17.
As ministers acknowledged privately the acute political sensitivity of the
decision, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, revealed
that Mr John Major had agreed to meet him on June 17 to discuss Rosyth's
bid.
The prime minister yesterday met Conservative MPs from south-west England
who are keen to see Devonport win the contract - estimated to be worth
hundreds of millions of pounds - and to save up to 4,000 jobs.
Devonport is widely regarded at Westminster as the front-runner but several
Scottish Conservatives have already indicated that they are prepared to vote
against the government if Devonport wins.
The prime minister's office emphasised that no decision was imminent,
although it admitted that ministers might meet later this week for a
preliminary discussion.
The sensitivity of the contract has contributed to a delay of several months
in the announcement, expected last June, but the government seems committed
to resolving the matter before MPs disperse for the summer recess in late
July.
Mr Brown said that a 'number of sources' had told him that, under the
Ministry of Defence's own criteria of assessing capital costs and running
costs over five years, the Rosyth bid was Pounds 10m cheaper. Rosyth is in
Mr Brown's Dunfermline East constituency.
Mr Brown also called on the government to publish in full all the figures
used by ministers in reaching a decision and for an independent inquiry into
the bids by the National Audit Office. A Labour survey yesterday showed Fife
in Scotland is the UK region most dependent on defence-related jobs.
Cabinet ministers insist that the contract will be awarded on merit, and say
that the potential political damage will be equally serious whether the
contract goes to Scotland or the south-west of England.
They add that a full debate will be in the government's interests since they
are confident that the basis of the decision will stand up to the intense
scrutiny it will receive.
In an attempt to play down the significance of the contract, some ministers
point out that whichever yard does not win the Trident work will be certain
to be awarded work on the surface fleet in the coming years, and that even
the successful yard will probably have to make some workers redundant.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Company start-ups point to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of new companies has risen sharply in one of the strongest signs
yet that business activity is picking up as part of a broad-based economic
recovery.
The 4.9 per cent increase in company starts since the beginning of the year
compared with the corresponding period last year is the first year-on-year
rise in this indicator since 1989, before the recession started to bite.
Company starts were up particularly strongly last month compared with May
last year, a sign that entrepreneurial activity may be on the increase and
banks less reluctant to lend to new businesses.
In the first five months 49,056 new companies were incorporated, up from
46,721 for the equivalent period last year. In the whole of last year
107,375 companies were started, 2.5 per cent down from the previous year.
The figures come from Jordans, a Bristol-based business information company.
They are based on registrations at Companies House and cover the UK
excluding Northern Ireland.
Figures for company starts have to be interpreted carefully because they
include significant numbers of 'shell' companies, which are responsible for
little economic activity.
Even so, the data appear to indicate that business enterprise is expanding,
possibly linked to signs of an upturn in the hard-pressed property sector.
In May 8,799 companies were started, 9.3 per cent up on the 8,049 recorded
in the equivalent month last year. Jordans says a significant point is that
the rate of year-on-year growth seems to be increasing. The total for the
three months between March and May was up a healthy 7 per cent on the
corresponding period last year.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Two-week extension for Swan Hunter frigate work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, has won a further two weeks'
outfitting work on the three Type 23 frigates which are its main workload,
Price Waterhouse, the yard's receivers, confirmed yesterday.
The agreement between the receivers and the Ministry of Defence is the third
temporary extension to work on the frigates since Swans went into
receivership in mid-May, after failing to win a crucial helicopter carrier
order.
Price Waterhouse said the extension until June 28 meant there would be no
redundancies in the coming fortnight among the remaining 2,000 employees.
Union leaders expressed concern at the effect of the agreement on morale. Mr
John Macciocchi, fitters' shop steward, said: 'We hope the MoD make a final
decision that Swans can finish these ships, then we can get down to business
and boost morale a little bit.'
Negotiations on whether Swans can complete the frigates, providing some work
until late 1994, are continuing. The Ministry of Defence said it was a very
complicated issue, adding: 'They must be completed within the time-frame and
the financial constraints.'
Completing the frigates would give Swans a chance of securing further orders
and being sold as a going concern.
The company's strongest hope for new work, a Pounds 40m patrol boats order
from the Royal Navy of Oman, hinges on satisfying the navy that its Pounds
8m advance payment would not be at risk.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday it was still studying
whether it could underwrite the Pounds 8m as part of a total Pounds 20m
package of performance guarantees.
The department said the proposal, from local authorities and the Tyne and
Wear Development Corporation, raised technical and ideological questions.
The European Commission is still considering a government request to look
again at the exemption of UK warship yards, including Swans, from
Shipbuilding Intervention Fund eligibility.
The GMB general union, holding its annual congress in Portsmouth yesterday,
unanimously backed an emergency motion pledging full support for the Swans
workforce in its fight to complete the frigates.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Pounds 38m premium paid on Gulf war charters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN PAID a premium of about Pounds 38m above normal commercial charter
rates to ship military supplies to the Gulf during the conflict of 1990-91,
according to a National Audit Office report published today.
The report, which coincides with a police investigation into alleged fraud
in the contract arrangements, also finds that some of the commissions paid
were unusually high.
The watchdog body says the special shipping committee set up by the Ministry
of Defence failed to keep records showing how it decided which ships to
charter.
The National Audit Office, which reports to parliament on the way taxpayers'
money is spent, says that because of the fraud inquiry it was unable to find
out why only five of the 162 ships used were British.
A decision on possible prosecutions is in the hands of the Crown Prosecution
Service following investigations by the Ministry of Defence police. The
ministry said yesterday, however, that there was no evidence of fraudulent
activity by its military or civilian employees.
The ministry paid 55 per cent to 70 per cent above market rates for outward
voyages by general cargo ships and 160 per cent to 200 per cent above the
going rate for roll-on-roll-off vessels, the report says. It ascribes this
mainly to limited availability of the types of ship specified by the
ministry, and notes that a 'wartime premium' will always be payable.
A total of Pounds 143m was spent on ship charters and Pounds 69m on aircraft
charters.
Brokerage fees for 56 charters arranged through Hogg Robinson, the
government freight agent, are being questioned by the MoD as a result of an
internal audit. The audit office says fees ranged up to 8.5 per cent
compared with normal levels of up to 5 per cent. It also notes that Hogg
Robinson, whose contract is under review, used only four brokers for 87 per
cent of its charters.
In addition, the report reveals that 228 aircraft pallets - metal platforms
on rollers used to load freight on to transport aircraft - went astray in
the operation. The loss is valued at Pounds 680,000.
It says that 'despite exhaustive searches', not enough pallets were sent
back from the Gulf. The RAF transport base at Lyneham, Wiltshire, was
'within two hours of grinding to a halt' and pallets had to be borrowed from
the US Air Force. Eighty containers, out of 7,000 used, were also
unaccounted for.
'In addition to not always knowing where the containers were,' the report
says, 'the department were not always aware of what was in them.'

FT  09 JUN 93 / Britain behind in R&amp;D: Foreign companies spend more on
research, DTI study says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies increased spending on research and development by 6 per
cent last year, although the recession reduced their profits by 11 per cent,
the annual R&amp;D Scoreboard, published today by the Department of Trade and
Industry, shows.
The DTI report points out that UK industry carries out much less R&amp;D than
its international competitors on any comparative measure - and that the UK
slipped further behind last year. The world's 200 largest companies
increased spending on R&amp;D by 8 per cent while their profits declined by 9
per cent.
This year's R&amp;D Scoreboard includes more extensive international comparisons
than its two predecessors. They show that UK companies devoted 1.55 per cent
of aggregate sales revenue to R&amp;D last year, compared with a world average
of 4.59 per cent, and only 19.7 per cent of profits compared with 94.3 per
cent internationally.
The report also shows for the first time the 'inexorable decline in the
contribution of British companies to the patent register in the USA' (see
chart). The UK share of all US patents fell from 10 per cent in 1980 to 6
per cent in 1991.
The sector in which the UK performs best - both in R&amp;D spending and in
output of patents - is pharmaceuticals. Among individual companies, Glaxo,
the largest British drugs manufacturer, stood out with a 25 per cent jump in
R&amp;D last year from Pounds 475m to Pounds 595m, although it was still second
to Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US in the world healthcare league.
The two Anglo-Dutch giants, Unilever and Shell, both headed the spending
tables for their respective sectors. In food, Unilever's turnover was very
close to Nestle's but its Pounds 461m R&amp;D budget far exceeded the Swiss
group's Pounds 302m. In fuels, Shell came just ahead of Exxon of the US.
Aerospace suffered the steepest relative decline of any UK sector last year.
It cut R&amp;D by 8 per cent while the international industry increased spending
by 11 per cent. The main factor was the financial retrenchment at British
Aerospace, which led to a 23 per cent slide in R&amp;D outlays.
The R&amp;D Scoreboard was prepared for the DTI by Company Reporting of
Edinburgh, on the basis of R&amp;D expenditure published in the annual accounts
of 340 UK companies. Company Reporting said such disclosures should now be
standard practice, yet 25 per cent of companies that mentioned R&amp;D in their
annual reports for last year did not say how much they spent. They included
Associated British Foods, BET, J. Bibby, Eastern Electricity, Guinness, J.
Sainsbury and Tate &amp; Lyle.
Company Reporting said: 'A number of companies describe in glowing terms
their R&amp;D activity but when it comes to disclosing the amount of R&amp;D spend
they are strangely silent.
'Such practices make a mockery of serious attempts to use the R&amp;D data
currently being disclosed.'

FT  09 JUN 93 / ICL top of computing services league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, THE computer company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, is
the largest software and computing services organisation in the UK, ahead of
EDS-Scicon, the General Motors subsidiary.
The Holway Report, an annual review of the financial performance of
computing services companies, says ICL's computing services revenue in
1991-92 was Pounds 365m compared with EDS-Scicon's Pounds 255m.
The survey shows that computer manufacturers are increasingly turning to
software and services to sustain revenues as hardware prices fall. The UK
software and services market was worth Pounds 6.1bn in 1991-92 but the rate
of annual growth slipped from 6 per cent to 5 per cent.
Profits before tax grew strongly, however, in a sector that has suffered
badly in the recession over the past two years. They grew an average 44 per
cent last year, compared with a 10 per cent fall in the previous year and a
22 per cent fall the year before.
The survey says the recovery in profits was due to cost reductions.
The 1,100 companies covered by the Holway survey have reduced staff by
9,000, or 7.5 per cent, since the end of 1990.
The survey also shows that the top 10 suppliers represented a third of the
total UK market and the top 40 represented more than 70 per cent.
Revenues of the top 10 companies grew by 19 per cent, almost four times as
fast as the average, suggesting continued consolidation.
Only three quoted companies in the sector, Admiral, Capita and Macro 4, have
not suffered a reversal since 1985. Capita performed best, with an average
65 per cent increase in earnings per share.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Volkswagen to boost parts purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLKSWAGEN group of Germany, Europe's biggest carmaker, aims to double
the value of its component purchases in the UK to about DM1bn (Pounds 400m)
a year by the end of this year.
The total is expected to continue to rise rapidly to more than DM2.5bn by
the mid-1990s from DM500m last year. The move is part of the group's effort
to cut its purchasing costs in order to reduce its heavy losses. The group
suffered a loss of DM563m in the last quarter of last year and a loss of
DM1.25bn in the first quarter this year.
The group established a UK purchasing office in Milton Keynes earlier this
year as one of seven regional offices around the world responsible for
implementing the group's new global purchasing strategy.
Last year the UK accounted for less than 1 per cent of the group's
purchasing volume of DM53.8bn, but Mr Frans Boot, head of the UK purchasing
office, said yesterday this could increase to more than 5 per cent by the
mid-1990s.
The UK operation is seeking to increase purchases for all the group's four
divisions, Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda, which are being linked into one
global purchasing system by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the recently
appointed group director for purchasing and production.
Mr Lopez, who moved from General Motors in March, was previously responsible
for greatly increasing the volume of GM component purchases in the UK.
VW has previously lagged rivals among the world's volume carmakers in
seeking lower-cost components outside its main German supply base, and the
UK is seen as one of its most promising sources for lower-cost purchases.
The group said that UK component makers had become much more competitive as
a result of the arrival in Britain of the Japanese carmakers, which had
greatly improved levels of quality, service and cost.
The drive to increase purchases in the UK had been intensified by the
devaluation of sterling against the D-Mark, it said.
Mr Boot said that there had been 'a quantum leap' in the competitiveness of
the UK automotive components supply base since the late 1980s. 'It is not
just low labour costs and currency but also in product development
capability, quality and just-in-time delivery with the Japanese transplants
working on the supply base.'
Mr Boot said some quotations from UK suppliers were coming in at only 60 per
cent of VW's present costs.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Edinburgh to top British growth table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDINBURGH will be the fastest growing of Britain's big cities in the 1990s,
while economic activity in London will be held back by a fragile
manufacturing base, traffic jams and a contraction in business services, a
report published today predicts.
The European Economic Research and Advisory Consortium, a group of European
research institutes, says that out of 32 European cities, five of the bottom
eight ranked according to their 1990s growth potential are in Britain.
Edinburgh occupies a respectable 14th position, but London manages only a
poor 28th. Manchester and Birmingham are at the bottom of the league table,
and Glasgow and Cardiff rank 25th and 27th respectively.
Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam - rivals to London as centres for financial
services - rank higher at 11th, 12th and 13th.
London scores highly as a centre for banking and investment and as a
headquarters for multinational companies, but its growth potential may be
constrained by poor transport links and failure by the UK to participate
fully in European economic integration.
The UK economy as a whole is expected to grow relatively quickly in the next
year or so compared with other parts of Europe, but many big British cities
will continue the trend of the past 30 years and lose out economically in
relation to the countryside or suburbs.
Of the 32 cities Barcelona, Dublin, Lisbon, Berlin and Hamburg come out with
the highest ratings for likely economic growth.
Barcelona is considered capable of average growth of 3.4 per cent a year up
to 1997, but London is likely to achieve a comparable figure of just 1.2 per
cent.
Other also-rans in the bottom eight of the league table include Turin,
Dusseldorf and Cologne.
The report says that the declining share of manufacturing activity in the
economies of many big UK cities during the 1980s is a pivotal reason for
their relatively low growth prospects.
The Ereco members include Cambridge Econometrics from the UK, BIPE (Paris),
Ecotec (Birmingham), IFO (Munich), NEI (Rotterdam), Prometeia (Bologne) and
Wifo (Vienna).

FT  09 JUN 93 / BA strikes may have prolonged Virgin dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESENT wave of industrial relations friction at British Airways seems
to have played a role in the company's refusal to pay Virgin Atlantic
Airways Pounds 9m in compensation to settle the dispute between the two.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA group managing director, said yesterday that the
airline would have had to justify such a large settlement to its staff at a
time when they were being asked to make sacri-fices.
'The board of the company also has a duty to its shareholders to justify
such an amount and the staff is increasingly conscious of every penny the
company spends,' he added, after addressing a Financial Times aerospace
conference in Paris.
Mr Ayling conceded that 'people are becoming frustrated' that the dispute
had not been resolved in spite of the Civil Aviation Authority's initiative
to bring the two parties together.
The CAA mediation attempt collapsed when Virgin insisted on a Pounds 9m cash
settlement while BA wanted the dispute to go to arbitration.
'In assessing how we might settle the claims, we took account of all the
potential lawsuits we might face, but we did not think that threat could
begin to justify payment of Pounds 9m,' Mr Ayling said.
BA had originally proposed a Pounds 9m settlement in March but subsequently
withdrew the offer when Virgin decided to take further legal action against
BA.
BA was seeking a quick resolution to the dispute to avoid further hostile
media attacks. It also sought a 'gagging clause', which was rejected by
Virgin.
Mr Ayling again said BA was willing to try to resolve the dispute out of
court but not at any price.
The threat of strike action this week at London's Gatwick airport was lifted
yesterday as British Airways management reached agreement with the GMB
general union over pay and conditions for white-collar workers, including
flight controllers and computer staff.
The agreement guarantees that no employees will be forced to transfer to a
BA subsidiary and accept poorer pay or conditions.
A similar dispute between the TGWU general union and BA was recently
resolved.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Merger talks for TGWU and GMB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREATION of a single general union, bringing together almost 2m
unskilled and semi - skilled workers, moved a step closer yesterday with the
announcement that formal talks will start for the first time on a merger
between the TGWU and GMB unions.
Delegates at the annual conference of the GMB, traditionally a centre-right
union, agreed by 10 to 1 to a policy document which argued the case for
merger. Talks will not start until after the annual conference next month of
the TGWU, a union whose hard-left image has softened in recent years.
No date has been fixed for a merger, but it is not expected before the end
of the century.
Mr John Edmonds, the GMB general secretary, said: 'This is a matter of
enormous significance in the union movement. We have seen a decline in union
membership throughout the 1980s and 1990s and we have to think of how to
move out of that and transform the union movement.'
An amalgamation between two unions with extensive resources could be a way
of attracting more members.
The relationship between the TGWU and the GMB has been marked by a blend of
rivalry - mainly over recruitment - and co-operation in campaigns, such as
better training rights.
Although most GMB delegates at the conference in Portsmouth were in favour
of a merger, a handful spoke against the move because they did not want to
lose their regional identity.
The merger plan is part of a trend towards fewer, larger unions. The most
recent merger was the creation of the AEEU by the merger of the EETPU
electricians' union and the AEU engineering union last year. Three key
public-sector unions, Cohse, Nupe and Nalgo, will merge on July 1 to create
Unison.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Lawyer with a case for equality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS KAMLESH BAHL, who from next week begins a three-year stint chairing the
Equal Opportunities Commission, has had more direct and shocking experience
of discrimination than any of her predecessors is likely to have known.
In her first two years at Birmingham University she was top of her law class
and in finals she finished third. Yet when it came to looking for articles,
it took 250 applications to get one offer - from the Greater London Council.
'It was the first time I had come across discrimination,' she says. It was a
revelation . . . most other people got articles - I stuck out like a sore
thumb because I was about the only one who didn't.
'If you have the merit and the ability, you should be given the opportunity.
That was what I was denied at that point in my life.'
The appointment of Nairobi-born Ms Bahl, aged 36, to the Pounds
30,000-a-year, three-day-a-week job, was unexpected. She is not a well-known
face in the sex equality world and her greatest claim to popular fame until
now has probably been as the model for Usha Gupta, the Asian lawyer in the
Archers on Radio 4.
Ms Bahl's success in getting the job followed the kind of procedure she
would advocate for giving merit and ability an equal chance. For the first
time the government advertised the vacancy and she competed with 80 others.
One of Ms Bahl's strengths was perceived to be her varied career. After
working at the GLC she moved to British Steel and then to Texaco, where she
specialised in commercial and employment law.
At the time of her appointment to the commission, she was company secretary
and manager of legal services at Data Logic, the computing services company.
She is also a member of the Law Society's ruling council, and sits on its
race relations committee.
Her experience of implementing equal opportunity policies began at Texaco,
where, she says, the company was threatened by a potential equal pay case.
'That brought home to the organisation how it could be exposed in an
industrial tribunal - its practices for job evaluation, its practices for
rewarding individuals, the way it analysed jobs, could all be exposed in a
public arena. In a business environment, the last thing you want is to wash
your linen in public.'
As a result, the whole organisation received training on equality issues,
starting with the chairman and members of the board.
As far as the future of the commission is concerned, Ms Bahl speaks the
language of the lawyer and the commercial manager, rather than the social
reformer.
Meetings with Mr David Hunt, the new employment secretary, have been
'positive'. The commission's legal and political independence, she says,
must remain sacrosanct.
She also points out that even if the government is unenthusiastic about
commission proposals on, for example, childcare, pensions and reform of
discrimination laws, goals in these areas must remain long-term. Strategies
will need to be drawn up to make the best use of resources.
Her immediate priority will have to be how to stretch the commission's
Pounds 6m budget to cover the vast increase in public demand for its advice
and services.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Three deny insider deal on USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER stockbroking account manager with the London operation of Svenska,
the Swedish-based bank, passed on unpublished price-sensitive information
about a public company to clients to enable them to deal in its shares, it
was alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr Alton Byrd, who is also a British international basketball player,
breached the insider dealing laws by passing on information about
International Media Communications, a video and entertainment company
registered on the Unlisted Securities Market, the court heard.
Mr Edmund Lawson QC, for the Department of Trade and Industry which is
bringing the prosecution, said that by the end of 1989 the company was in
serious financial trouble. Under-capitalised and trading at a loss, its
share price had fallen to about 5p.
In January 1990 Mr Byrd acquired and passed on information that outside
buyers were interested in buying the company and bringing in fresh
investment. This was information that, if publicly known, would have caused
the share price to rise, Mr Lawson said.
Mr Byrd passed the information to a number of clients including Mr Roger
Wilcocke, the director of a shop-fitting company, and Mr Graham Shear, a
London solicitor.
Mr Lawson said Mr Wilcocke and Mr Shear then bought 100,000 shares at 5p
each and sold when the price rose.
Mr Byrd faces four charges of communicating unpublished price sensitive
information while being a prohibited person and one charge of procuring
another person to deal in shares, all contrary to the Company Securities
(Insider Dealing) Act 1985. Mr Wilcocke and Mr Shear face single charges of
insider dealing. All three deny the charges.
The trial continues today.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Nadir adviser proves a friend in deed: Andrew Jack talks to
the PR man who canvassed politicians on behalf of the ex-Polly Peck chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN at the centre of the row over the political intervention by senior
Conservative MPs in connection with Mr Asil Nadir said yesterday he would
continue to work for the fugitive businessman.
Mr Christopher Morgan, head of the public relations firm Morgan &amp; Rogerson,
said: 'I'm not giving up.'
He refused to make judgments about Mr Nadir's guilt and stressed the issue
of Mr Nadir's treatment by the Serious Fraud Office. He said he started
working for him because 'I didn't think there was a flat playing field'.
Mr Morgan was at Mr Nadir's side when he gave his first conference in
northern Cyprus after jumping bail last month. Yet Mr Morgan insists he has
never been paid by Mr Nadir, who has been bankrupt throughout their business
relationship. 'We were just doing a job. What remuneration was quite
irrelevant,' he said.
Questions have been raised about Mr Morgan's credibility, but he denied
suggestions that he had misled newspapers over his attempts to involve Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, in the Nadir case. His
partner Mr Mark Rogerson was the constituent who nominally made contact with
Mr Michael Mates, the Northern Ireland minister, but it is Mr Morgan who
best knows Mr Mates. Several years ago Mr Mates hosted a 50th birthday party
for Mr Morgan at the Commons.
As well as contacting ministers, Mr Morgan has been in contact with BBC
Television's Panorama programme, which has been preparing a story on Mr
Nadir over several months.
Mr Harry Dean, one of the series' two deputy editors and the one responsible
for the programme, said last night: 'We are still very actively considering
broadcasting it.'
Mr Morgan is the person most involved in contacting MPs on Mr Nadir's
behalf.
He contacted Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, as Mr Nadir's
constituency MP, and claims to have known Mr Heseltine socially for several
years. He said he spoke to him in an 'informal and confidential' meeting.
Mr Morgan said he raised the concerns of Mr Nadir's legal advisers about the
administration of his case by the Serious Fraud Office.
Mr Morgan said he had met Mr Nadir 'fleetingly' over several years but only
started working for him in the past two after referral from a mutual friend.
He said he liked Mr Nadir personally and added: 'I would have been intrigued
to have been his PR adviser before the crash (of Polly Peck).'
Like Mr Nadir, Mr Morgan has led a colourful and somewhat cosmopolitan life.
He speaks French and lives in Vaucluse in the Provence countryside. He
commutes to London where he stays at the Reform Club.
Mr Morgan is also a regular visitor to Spain, and says he has often attended
the bull-racing festival at Pamplona.
Yesterday he did not want to name other current clients or to provide
details of his firm. Morgan &amp; Rogerson has existed for about a year and
focuses on financially oriented marketing and public relations. Mr Morgan
has carried out some exotic contracts in the past. He said his past clients
had included the Spanish government - for which he promoted Rioja wine in
the UK - and Cuba Tobacco, for which he promoted the Havana cigar in this
country.
One of his more high-profile cases was as an adviser to Lloyds Merchant Bank
in connection with the Westland helicopter affair, the time at which he met
Mr Heseltine.
He worked as an adviser to the London International Financial Futures
Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the French Bond Market. More
recently he worked with the consortium bidding for the Olympic Games to be
held in Manchester in the year 2000.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Ex-MGN treasurer arrested and charged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL STONEY, the former treasurer of Mirror Group Newspapers, was
yesterday arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud and false
accounting over his role in the Maxwell affair.
His arrest brings to six the number of defendants being prosecuted by the
Serious Fraud Office as a result of its investigation into the collapse of
the business empire of Robert Maxwell.
The conspiracy to defraud charge alleges that Mr Stoney conspired with Mr
Maxwell and his son Kevin to defraud MGN by obtaining a Pounds 50m revolving
credit facility from the Bankers Trust Company in the name of MGN, but then
used the proceeds for other purposes. The offence is alleged to have taken
place between August 1 and December 2 1991.
Two false accounting charges allege that between October 21 and December 2
1991 he falsified the general ledger of MGN by omitting, or concurring in
the omitting of, the receipt of the Pounds 50m on October 21 1991.
The charges also allege that he falsified MGN's group financial report by
omitting, or concurring in the omitting of, the liability of MGN to Bankers
Trust Company in respect of the Pounds 50m facility.
After his appearance before City of London magistrates Mr Stoney - who had
been charged 'by appointment' at Snow Hill police station in the City -
issued a statement through his solicitor saying he 'strenuously denied' all
the charges.
Mr Stoney was remanded on conditional bail with a single surety of Pounds
50,000 and ordered to surrender his passport. He was allowed to take a
one-month family holiday in Miami.
The cases against all six defendants are scheduled to be transferred to the
Crown Court on July 19.
The other five men charged over the affair are Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian
Maxwell, Mr Larry Trachtenberg, a financial adviser to the late publisher,

FT  09 JUN 93 / Radio groups plan business news station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TWO RIVAL consortia hoping to launch commercial business radio stations for
the London area were among 48 applications submitted to the Radio Authority
yesterday.
The applications were for eight commercial licences for the capital, six of
which are already held by existing broadcasters.
The competition for a business station on an AM frequency pitches London
Business Radio (LBR) - whose shareholders are the GWR radio group, Reuters
and Associated Newspapers - against London City Talk Radio.
City Talk has been put together by Mr Mike Bloomberg, the Wall Street
entrepreneur who is a growing rival of Reuters in the financial information
business. Mr Bloomberg's backers include the International Herald Tribune
newspaper and Professor George Bain, principal of the London Business
School.
LBR would draw on the strength of Reuters correspondents around the world.
City Talk would aim to be the radio equivalent of US-based television
service Cable News Network, with 20-minute programme segments updated 24
hours a day.
Among the other radio licence applications submitted yesterday there were
two rivals for services aimed mainly at women listeners: Radio Viva and
London AM.
Five groups want to provide services on both AM and FM. Those applications
came from the Chrysalis group, Allied Radio, London Broadcasting Company,
London News Radio (backed by merchant bank Guinness Mahon), and LBR.
Other offerings included two country music applications, two sports
services, and an application from London Transport for a travel and
travel-related service.
Sixteen applications were submitted for ethnic services in the capital.
The Radio Authority, the industry regulator, is expected to make its
decisions on this round of licence applications in the next three months.
In the past the authority has re-awarded the commercial licences but, this
time, the heavy number of applicants for the London area could lead to
casualties among the existing companies.
Apart from LBC, which yesterday appointed broadcaster Mr David Dimbleby as a
non-executive director, those defending existing licences are Jazz FM, Kiss
FM, Melody Radio and Spectrum International Radio.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Names urge Lloyd'sto reform EGMs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Names -
individuals whose assets support the market - yesterday called for changes
in the organisation of extraordinary meetings.
Mr Neil Shaw, the association's chairman who is also chief executive of Tate
&amp; Lyle, described the present system - requiring 100 Names' signatures - as
'ludicrous'. Mr Shaw said at least 1,000 signatures should be the minimum.
Lloyd's, which is under pressure to implement its business plan, has already
organised one meeting at the request of supporters of Mr Claud Gurney, a
critic of the market's administrators. It could soon face calls for another
meeting by supporters of Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer campaigning for
loss-making Names.
'We believe it is in the members' interest to reserve the expensive and
time-consuming process of an EGM for genuinely critical issues that affect
the whole membership of Lloyd's,' said Mr Shaw.
Lloyd's said extraordinary meetings were expensive but the market had to be
careful about 'disenfranchising people who have genuine grievances'.

<TEXT>
STUDENT numbers in English higher education have risen by 46 per cent in the
past four years, says the first annual report of the Higher Education
Funding Council.
The council said this expansion, which exceeded the government's own
forecasts, had been achieved 'while maintaining quality and strengthening
research activities'. Professor Graeme Davies, chief executive, said the
increase was equivalent to the creation of 20 large civic universities.
The report shows that the composition of the student body is changing, with
far more mature students. Those over 21 now take up the majority of higher
education places, accounting for 55 per cent of all students, while 38 per
cent of all students are 35 or older.
Ethnic minorities are well represented relative to their share of the
population, accounting for 13 per cent of UK-based students. Only 8 per cent
of the population aged between 18 and 29 came from ethnic minorities in
1991, says the report.

FT  09 JUN 93 / British Coal to cut 3,000 white-collar jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL warned for the first time yesterday that some of the 12 pits
reprieved in March were at risk as it announced plans to cut half the 6,000
white-collar jobs at the corporation.
The warning by Mr Neil Clarke, chairman, came as the National Grid predicted
a stark decline in coal's input into electricity making and National Power,
the generator, announced the closure of Thorpe Marsh, the coal-fired station
in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, with 200 job losses.
In his gloomiest prognosis yet of British Coal's prospects, Mr Clarke said
he feared the electricity generators did not wish to buy any more coal,
'certainly not until the autumn'.
The fate of most of the 12 reprieved pits depends on the generators making
extra purchases. Mr Clarke said that with the growth in gas and with the
preferred position of nuclear power 'the prospects for substantial
additional sales are less optimistic than I would like'.
Speaking to the annual conference of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in
Weymouth, Dorset, Mr Clarke said that 'unless we are competitive, the
consequence will effectively be the closure of more pits'.
A cut of about 3,000 of the white-collar staff would be necessary to reduce
the burden on the 31 remaining collieries, he said.
Talks will be held about the job losses during the next few weeks but they
will be spread across the country and will involve all grades, including
senior managers.
Mr Neil Greatrex, UDM president, said it was clear that the government was
running British Coal. 'The white-collar job losses ought to include senior
people at British Coal because they have let miners and the country down.'
Meanwhile Mr David Jefferies, National Grid chairman, speaking at the
announcement of his company's annual results in London, said that coal's
share of the electricity market could be less than 50 per cent by 1997-98,
compared with the current total of more than 70 per cent.
With 10,000MW of combined cycle gas turbine plant already built or under
construction, gas's share, which was almost nil this time last year, could
reach 25 per cent.
Nuclear Electric's share increased from 18.5 per cent to 21.6 per cent last
year, and could be 25 per cent after the completion next year of Sizewell B.
Emphasising the threat to British Coal's future, National Power said the
1,100MW coal-fired Thorpe Marsh plant would cease production at the end of
March because it could 'no longer find room in the market place'. The
company expects redundancies to be voluntary. It recently announced plans to
close 2,000MW to 3,000MW of capacity during the next two to three years.

MR ASHOK Patel was yesterday fined Pounds 1,200 for selling duty-free goods
bought on a cross-Channel trip to France, in the first case of its kind in
Britain, Philip Rawstorne writes.
Mr Patel, a Bristol shopkeeper, bought 960 cans of lager, 2.75 litres of
wine and 200 cigarettes in Calais. He admitted at the city's magistrates
court one offence of knowingly dealing in duty-free goods.
The court heard that Customs and Excise officers visited his shop in
Southmead Road within weeks of his crossing from Dover to Calais on January
28. They spotted continental-sized 500ml cans of lager for sale. Mr Patel
later admitted he had made the trip in his van to buy goods for his store.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Leasing practices examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK COMMERCIAL property leasing practices are significantly different from
those of the US or continental Europe, says a report published yesterday by
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The survey may give added impetus to the debate about the structure of UK
commercial property leases, which has been the subject of increas-ing
criticism from tenants.
The study, which was carried out by the University of Reading, showed that
England and Wales had longer leases than other countries. They were unusual
as well in imposing full repair obligations on tenants.
The convention of privity of contract, by which an original tenant is liable
to pay the rent if a subsequent tenant defaults, is peculiar to England and
Wales.
In addition, England and Wales are unusual in lacking any form of
condominium or joint ownership, which allows occupiers to participate in the
growth of a building's capital values.
Some of the practices highlighted in the report are being reviewed by the
government.

Mr Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, last night appealed to the
country's top business leaders to help his government in pressing ahead with
its economic development plans, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
'The country has to be built by the private sector,' Mr Sharif was quoted as
saying, in his first meeting with businessmen since a court ruling restored
him to office last month. The appeal came before next Monday's annual budget
which ends a year with a record high budgetary deficit.
Mr Sharif is believed to be seeking the business community's support to
generate more tax revenues. 'We are fully supportive of the prime minister
and his policies,' said Mr Younas Khan, president of Pakistan's Overseas
Chamber of Commerce, after the meeting.

</HEADLINE>

   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rabah Kebir, spokesman for the Algerian Islamic Salvation Front (FIS),
was arrested in Germany yesterday on an international arrest warrant issued
by an Algiers court, Francis Ghiles reports. He had escaped from house
arrest in Algeria last summer, six months after national elections were
suspended when it became clear the FIS was poised to win. The FIS was
outlawed the following month.
In a separate incident yesterday Mr Oussama Kebir, the son of the FIS
leader, Mr Abassi Madani, imprisoned since June 1991 in Blida, near Algiers,
was arrested elsewhere in Germany.
The decision to extradite the two men, one of whom is under sentence of
death in Algiers, rests with the German federal government since there is no
extradition treaty between the two countries.
The French authorities meanwhile have banned the FIS weekly Critere which
for the past 18 months has been regularly distributed after Friday prayers
in mosques throughout France. French security sources say they have arrested
a number of FIS activists over the past few days.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New Zealand Reserve Bank is to maintain its monetary policy despite some
inflationary risks, Mr Don Brash, the central bank's governor, said
yesterday.
Mr Brash, whose task is to control the country's monetary policy in the
interests of maintaining low inflation, was reporting for the first time
under his 'targets agreement' with the minister of finance, set when he
renegotiated his five-year contract last December. The Bank is otherwise
independent of the government.
Releasing the Bank's six-monthly policy statement, he said the 'balance of
risks suggests the possibility of rather higher inflation is a real one'. He
said the Bank would not hesitate to tighten monetary policy if it became
clear the inflation target was being threatened.'
He said the country was on a higher inflation track than previously,
although rises were still comfortably with the Bank's target of nil to 2 per
cent.
The Bank's forecasts show that adjusting for one-off factors, such as
changes in government charges and in interest rates, underlying inflation
was estimated to have been unchanged at 1.8 per cent for the year to March.
Underlying inflation is expected to fall to 1.6 per cent in the year to the
end of this month.
The Bank said its actions to tighten monetary policy last December, which
led to a rise in the New Zealand dollar, had had the intended result of
keeping inflation below 2 per cent.
As a result the currency as measured against the trade weighted index was
now considerably higher than in late December and early January, and both
short and long term interest and bond rates had fallen back to the levels of
last November.
The bank said its forecasts assumed economic growth of 3 per cent.
Underlying inflation was expected to ease to around 1.2 per cent for the
year to December 1994.
The forecast included an assumption that rising timber prices would lead to
an 0.6 point rise in inflation.
Mr Brash said the rising domestic prices of timber represented the 'first
significant shock' for the bank's regulatory powers.

FT  09 JUN 93 / From career woman to a life of imperial isolation: Emiko
Terazono reports on how the Japanese regard Masako Owada on the eve of her
wedding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Miss Masako Owada enters the imperial palace in the heart of Tokyo to
wed the heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne today, she will be purified with
sacred water, and initiated into an isolated life as wife to the eventual
spiritual head of the Japanese people.
She and Prince Naruhito will take their vows before the Amaterasu, the sun
goddess, the most important in the Shinto religion. For modern Japanese,
though, the spiritual side is just theatre - they want to know if the career
girl commoner and the prince will live happily ever after.
And on a even more wordly level, for some Japanese, the wedding will mean
only an excuse to drink 'royal' sake with gold flakes floating in it, eat
'royal' lunch boxes and festive cakes.
Following the relief at the initial announcement that the 33-year-old prince
had finally found a bride, the Japanese media has turned the story into a
great romance - a tale of a prince who battled to win his love.
The imperial household agency, the mandarins who jealously guard the affairs
of imperial family, initially strongly opposed the prince's choice of the
29-year-old Miss Owada.
Her grandfather headed Chisso, a chemical manufacturer once linked with
poisonous mercury disposals in southern Japan. Miss Owada herself refused
the prince's proposals on several occasions as she pursued a career as a
diplomat in the footsteps of her father - Mr Hisashi Owada is deputy foreign
minister. The prince vowed to protect her from the pressures and antagonisms
of the imperial court, and Miss Owada eventually accepted his hand.
Today's royal wedding has not been met with the frenzied excitement as the
marriage of the current Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko 34 years ago.
'For ordinary Japanese in 1959, the royal couple playing tennis in a summer
resort, and parading through the streets of Tokyo on a horse-led carriage
was like Hollywood or Disneyland,' says Mr Naoki Inose, a writer who has
published several books on the imperial family.
Corporate executives, who had hoped that a 'Masako boom' would spur Japan's
depressed consumer demand, have been more disappointed. Aside from a rise in
sales of the somewhat dated Toyota Corolla model driven by Miss Owada, and
an upward blip in the popularity of pearls, often worn by the bride-to-be,
there seems to be little evidence that the economy is being lifted by a
wedding boom.
When the engagement was announced, analysts predicted additional retail
spending as large as Y3,300bn (Pounds 20bn) - a figure based on the rise in
consumer confidence triggered by the 1959 'Michi-boom'. when the current
emperor married. At the time, Japan was beginning its rapid economic growth,
and consumers rushed to buy television sets to watch the wedding, boosting
sales at electronics makers.
Feminists have meanwhile lamented that the wedding represents a setback for
Japanese women. Many argued that Miss Owada, who gave up her fast-track job
to marry the prince, symbolised a career woman sacrificing herself for
confinement within the home.
Many Japanese men appear threatened by Miss Owada, who represents a new
breed of strong Japanese women - she is a graduate of Harvard and Oxford and
speaks five languages. 'She's stuck-up,' remarks a middle-aged office
worker. She was recently chided by a weekly magazine for talking too much -
27 seconds more than Prince Naruhito at a press conference.
At the same time, those who hoped that Miss Owada's strong character would
lead the royal household to a new era of openness have so far been
disappointed. Taken over by imperial banality, Miss Owada now smiles shyly
at the cameras and walks behind the prince. Her stodgy frocks have not
prompted the fashion boom seen when Prince Charles wed Princess Diana.
In contrast to recent coverage of the British royals, the imperial household
agency has set out to control its public image, and media coverage has been
superficial and polite. Still, traditionalists are alarmed that the
publicity over the wedding is threatening the mystique surrounding the
imperial family.
But for nationalists and those who advocate a more prominent imperial
family, the wedding is seen as an ideal opportunity to arouse such
sentiments among the Japanese. Following criticism from conservative
politicians, the imperial household agency was forced to reverse its
original decision to leave out from the ceremonies the anthem which accords
the emperor godlike status,
The official wedding celebrations, including six banquets over three days
and visits to ancestral shrines in eastern Japan, will last till the end of
next week. Then the doors of the palace will again be closed and the
imperial family will return to its refined confinement.
The princess behind those walls could yet emerge as a force for
modernisation, making the imperial family more accessible. She may find it
hard to escape the confines of imperial life, having to make do with
occasional appearances at state dinners, charity functions and sports
tournaments. But among her imperial duties, she will face enormous pressure
to succeed in the most important - to produce a son to become the next heir
to the Chrysanthemum Throne.

   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FUEL shortage caused by strikes and breakdowns in Nigeria's oil refineries
threatens to bring chaos to the main cities and to disrupt presidential
elections due on Saturday.
Long queues have been forming outside the few fuel stations in Lagos which
have stocks. Refineries are shut, as are all state-owned fuel depots.
Private sector depots have a few days' supply at most.
The unions have picked a dangerous week to go on strike. The military
government of President Ibrahim Babangida has widespread powers to cancel
the election, the first for a decade in Nigeria, if law and order breaks
down. Fuel shortages in Lagos a year ago sparked off serious riots.
Even before the strike at the weekend by the two main unions in the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and its marketing subsidiary , output
at the country's three refineries had been far below capacity for months due
to lack of maintenance.
Shortages have affected most of the north and east of the country for
several months but spread to Lagos only at the end of last month, when a
tanker drivers' strike cut off the supply of fuel and pushed up prices of
public transport and foodstuffs by more than 300 per cent.
Inflation is already outstripping earnings and the disintegration of public
services is testing the patience of Nigerians anxious not to disrupt the
transition to democracy which President Babangida has promised to complete
by August 27.
Some 38m Nigerians are registered to vote on Saturday, many of them in their
town of origin far from where they live.
Demand for public transport will be exceptional and many people are trying
to stockpile fuel for the weekend. A fuel shortage could also affect
supplies of ballot papers and staff to run the 106,000 polling booths.
Even at full capacity of about 300,000 barrels a day, Nigeria's refineries
are unable to meet domestic demand, as about a third of output is smuggled
to neighbouring states where subsidies are much much lower.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Ten-hour blackout points up Indian power problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Indian government has ordered an inquiry into a power failure which has
this week left Delhi and much of northern India without electricity for
periods of up to 10 hours.
The worst breakdown in seven years left householders sweltering in
temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius bereft of light, air conditioning and
sometimes water, because pump stations stopped working. Even the power
supplies to districts inhabited by politicians and other preferential
customers suffered prolonged cuts.
More than 30 trains stopped in northern and eastern India; passengers were
left stranded without light, cooling or water. Delhi's international airport
was plunged into darkness for two hours.
The failure raises questions about the Indian electricity network's capacity
to supply the power the country needs for economic growth. Foreign and
domestic companies have frequently cited electricity shortages as a crucial
obstacle to investment. The Times of India, the leading English-language
newspaper, said yesterday: 'The crisis is a measure of the long-standing
maladministration and negligence of the country's power sector.'
The cuts started on Sunday night after a transmission line in Uttar Pradesh
state in northern India overheated. Power which should have been carried by
this line surged into other lines causing further failures and breakdowns of
power stations and transmission lines. At one point on Sunday night, the
authorities were unable to supply electricity even to Mr P V Narasimha Rao,
the prime minister, an unprecedented failure given the attention lavished in
India on VIPs.
Many people left their homes to sleep on the street. Slum-dwellers, who are
given to stealing electricity by suspending wires from overhead power lines
and have become accustomed to the comforts of fans and coolers, if not of
air-conditioners, are also affected.
The government wants to increase generation capacity of the publicly-owned
network in the five years 1992-97 by 30,500MW over the 69,000MW installed by
March 1992. But in the past year, less than 1,000MW have come on stream.
As the building of new stations has slowed so has the growth of electricity
output, which rose by just 5 per cent in the year to March 1993, compared
with an annual average of 9 per cent in the 1980s.
The industry suffers from chronic losses because power is supplied at
uneconomic rates to privileged groups such as farmers.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Islamic militants bomb bus in Egypt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISLAMIC extremists killed one man and injured 14 others in a bomb attack on
a tourist bus in Cairo yesterday as part of a continuing campaign to cripple
the tourist industry, Egypt's biggest source of foreign revenue.
The terrorists dropped the bomb from a bridge as the bus travelled through
an underpass towards the pyramids at Giza. It exploded on a car, badly
damaging the vehicle and the tourist bus which was following.
One Egyptian died and 14 other people were injured, including five Britons
who were among a party of 39 on a one-day visit to Cairo.
The attack was the latest in a year-long campaign waged by extremists
primarily against the tourist industry, but which has also targeted
government ministers, senior security officials and members of Egypt's
Coptic minority.
The economy has already felt the impact with some forecasts suggesting a
halving of tourism revenues this year. Over 3m tourists visited Egypt last
year with earnings estimated at Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn). Some officials
had forecast an increase to more than Dollars 4bn during the current year.
President Hosni Mubarak has blamed Iran for being behind the violence, which
he claims is aimed at destabilising his regime. However, there is also
evidence that widespread poverty, particularly in the south and in inner
city areas, is proving fertile recruiting ground for groups pledged to the
introduction of full Islamic government.
The authorities have responded to the attacks by declaring all-out war on
the extremists and have used thousands of police and para-military units in
assaults on suspected terrorist hideouts. Military courts have sentenced 21
extremists to death in recent months.
Religious broadcasting on the state-run media has also been sharply
increased in an effort to demonstrate that the regime is more devout than
its radical opponents.
This has caused growing alarm among more liberal, secular groups in Cairo
who say that the government is polarising society and denying greater
democratisation which, they argue, is the only effective way of defeating
the Islamic extremists.
The British Foreign Office is waiting before deciding whether to advise
Britons not to visit Egypt in the wake of today's terrorist attack.
'Our consul and vice-consul are visiting the scene of the incident and will
be reporting back,' the Foreign Office said. Advice to visitors to Egypt,
issued in March this year, was that they should be vigilant at all times,
avoid Dairut and Assiut districts unless carrying out essential business,
and dress and behave discreetly.
While the highest priority was given to protecting visitors, people's safety
could not be guaranteed and further incidents in Cairo and elsewhere 'must
be expected'.
The Association of British Travel Agents said it would continue to tell
tourists of the dangers and urge them to be careful.
More than 80,000 Britons visit Egypt each year.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Wanted: revenue, electricity and IMF deal - Jose Galang on a
Philippines economy of deficits, 'brown-outs' and loan delay fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY a year after a surge in optimism that followed an orderly transfer of
political power, the Philippine economy appears headed for hard times again.
Gross National Product growth in the first three months of the year,
according to preliminary government estimates, was only 0.9 per cent, down
from the 2.2 per cent rise in the same period last year.
The slight rise was registered only with the help of the sustained inflows
of foreign exchange from the 2m Filipinos working abroad, according to
government data.
Without a dramatic improvement in the power supply, which was blamed for a
nearly 3 per cent contraction in industrial activity during the first
quarter compared with the first quarter of the previous year, the GNP growth
target of 3.5 per cent this year is unlikely to be met. The Philippines
Chamber of Commerce and Industry is forecasting between 2 and 2.5 per cent.
Mr Cielito Habito, the socio-economic planning secretary, recently insisted
that the growth goal could still be achieved. It will, however, require some
harsh policy measures to raise government revenues.
A number of tax proposals are being held up in Congress, putting under a
cloud funding for government infrastructure projects designed to perk up
domestic demand. Congress begins a two-month recess tomorrow, although
President Fidel Ramos has called for a special session to consider the tax
bills.
One is aimed at introducing quarterly collection of value added tax instead
of annual and a second seeks an excise tax system on cigarettes and beer.
Both bills are aimed at improving revenue collection.
Mr Habito has indicated that if Congress fails to pass the bills, the
government may again have to impose an import levy and possibly also raise
tax rates on fuel products. The last time the government imposed an import
levy - in 1990, also because of stalled tax bills in Congress - the local
manufacturing sector, which remains import-dependent, suffered a slump.
Government revenues at the end of April were nearly 14 per cent below
target, with the shortfall of 13.7bn pesos (Pounds 338m) leaving little room
for manoeuvre for the rest of the year.
The shortfall may have already put in jeopardy the Philippines' negotiations
with the International Monetary Fund for a medium-term programme. The
country is seeking Dollars 800m under an IMF extended fund facility to
support its 'growth-oriented' programme over the next three years. Previous
programmes involved austerity-type bailing out or stabilisation measures.
The one being sought now places the emphasis on export-led growth and
capital spending on infrastructure projects.
The negotiations, deadlocked over IMF concerns about Manila's ability to
raise targeted revenues, now seems certain to be delayed until September,
not least because Mr Ramon del Rosario, Mr Ramos's finance secretary
nominee, has just been rejected by the congressional commission on
appointments.
Some commission members charged that Mr del Rosario had 'always followed the
IMF'. Several leaders in the legislature have over the past few years been
critical of the big budgetary allocations for repayment of debts incurred
mostly during the administration of the late Mr Ferdinand Marcos, deposed in
1986.
The family of Mr del Rosario, a former banker, has also been accused by his
critics of benefiting from certain policies implemented by the Ramos
government.
Another reason why the IMF negotiations are likely to be delayed is that Mr
Jose Cuisia, the central bank governor, confirmed this week that he would be
retiring at the end of June.
However, this week Congress passed a law, as required if the IMF deal is to
be concluded, replacing the central bank with a new Singapore-style central
monetary authority which will be more independent and relieved of its
present responsibility for financing the fiscal deficit.
Should the Philippines fail to secure the IMF programme, which would have
followed the last 18-month standby facility that expired last March, the
country may have to go to its commercial bank creditors for new financing.
It will also have to pay up some Dollars 1bn in official credits, which
would be likely to pull down its international reserves, now at some Dollars
6bn.
Meanwhile, energy officials acknowledge that the end to the debilitating
power cuts may not come before December, despite the commissioning of six
gas-turbine plants in the second and third quarters of the year.
Commercial establishments and residential areas in metropolitan Manila and
the rest of the main Luzon island currently take turns being hit by power
cut-offs, or 'brown-outs', of about six to eight hours a day.
The brown-outs have scared away potential investors to the Philippines,
according to diplomats. While the improved political conditions and the
on-going economic reforms appeared to have gained the interest of some
foreign investors, many would rather wait until the power-shortage problem
has been resolved.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Japan believes worst of banking crisis is over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN will tell its Group of Seven economic summit partners that its banking
system is over the worst of the problems left by the bubble economy of the
late 1980s and that its economy is recovering.
Although it may take two to three years for Japan's banks to work off their
bad loans, the ministry of finance is satisfied operating profits have risen
and that the crisis in the financial system is past its peak.
The ministry's confidence has reached a point where officials are letting it
be known that the government will not allow bank failures.
Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, a finance ministry deputy director-general, said
yesterday it was the ministry's policy never to allow a bank to fail. The
government felt the financial sector was in part a public good and that some
'socialisation of risks' was necessary.
Some banks in Japan have been bailed out recently at a cost to the country's
deposit insurance scheme. While bank managers have been fired in such cases,
depositors have not been affected. So far, the government says no tax
revenues have been used in bailing out stricken banks. Instead, Japan's
banking industry has been expected to carry the costs.
The better outlook for Japan's financial sector will form part of an upbeat
assessment of economic developments to be presented to Japan's G7 partners
at next month's summit in Tokyo.
The government is expected to counter US demands for fiscal action to boost
growth by asserting that the economy bottomed out in the first quarter of
this year and should return to annual growth rates of 3.5 per cent.
Japan's Y2,190bn (Pounds 13.2bn) supplementary budget, designed to pull the
economy out of recession, has become law, Reuter adds.
It is the first time in 32 years that Japan has drawn up an extra budget
during the 150-day ordinary parliamentary session ending in late June, the
finance ministry said.
The supplementary budget will increase government spending in 1993-94 to
Y74,540bn overall. It will fund a Y13,200bn economic stimulus package
unveiled in April.

FT  09 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Hyundai Motor to convert Canadian plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HYUNDAI Motor of South Korea is to close its assembly line at Bromont,
Quebec, for two years while it converts the underused plant to produce a new
generation of its Elantra compact sedan.
When it reopens in July 1995 the Bromont factory, which is Hyundai's only
assembly plant outside South Korea, will export Elantras to Hyundai's
fast-growing European markets, besides serving North America.
Hyundai sold 110,000 cars in 13 European countries last year, making Europe
its biggest export market. Mr John Wright, vice-president of Hyundai's
Canadian subsidiary, said yesterday the Elantra had 'greater potential for
future worldwide sales' than the mid-sized Sonata, which is now produced at
Bromont.
Production of Sonatas will be shifted to a factory in Ulsan, South Korea.
The conversion of the Bromont plant is expected to cost CDollars 66.1m
(Pounds 34m), with full production of 100,000 vehicles a year targeted for
1997. The company is negotiating a financial assistance package from the
Canadian and Quebec governments.
The Bromont factory has been running far below capacity since it was built
in the late 1980s.
The original plan was that the plant would capitalise on explosive demand
for Hyundai cars in North America when they were introduced in Canada in
1984 and in the US two years later.
Combined sales in the two countries reached a peak of 314,300 in 1987, when
the sub-compact Pony was Canada's best-selling imported car.
But buyers' enthusiasm for the low prices of Hyundai models gave way to
disappointment at their poor quality. Sales tumbled further during the
recession, and totalled 49,600 in the first five months of this year.
The Bromont plant now has an annual capacity of 100,000 units, but turned
out only 14,700 Sonatas last year.

FT  09 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Japan condemns numerical trade targets -
Miyazawa responds to US demands for commitment on reducing current account
surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN yesterday stressed its opposition to US demands that specific
numerical targets be set to reduce Japan's massive current account surplus
and further open the country's markets to foreign goods.
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the House of Councillors' budget
committee that it would be unrealistic for Japan to make specific numerical
commitments on its surplus or import ratio. No one could control GDP figures
or the course of imports and exports in a free trade system, he said.
Mr Kabun Muto, foreign minister, added his voice to a growing chorus of
opposition to the US stance, saying Japan would never agree to setting
specific measurable targets.
Mr Miyazawa and Mr Muto were responding to US demands that Japan reduce its
current account surplus from 3.2 per cent of GDP to 1-2 per cent and
increase its ratio of imports to about 3.3 per cent of GDP from a current
2.5 per cent.
The US administration has said it would seek such numerical targets in
bilateral trade talks with Japan, scheduled to begin on Friday in
Washington, in which the two sides are expected to negotiate a new framework
for discussing trade issues.
The talks will be the first formal working-level contact between the two
sides since agreement to set up a new framework for trade relations was
reached between Mr Miyazawa and President Bill Clinton in April.
The two countries aim to work out a broad outline of the trade framework
before the July summit in Tokyo of Group of Seven industrial countries.
However, Japan and the US remain deeply divided on how issues should be
resolved. Washington appears not to have changed its stance that numerical
targets be adopted despite clear resistance from the Japanese side, and
despite the fact that both countries last week endorsed the communique from
the annual OECD ministerial meeting in Paris promising 'to make no recourse
to initiatives and arrangements which are inconsistent with the principles
of free trade, and undermine the multilateral system'.
As the US set out its demands, officials at the Japanese Ministry of
International Trade and Industry insisted yesterday the trade talks needed
to be a two-way exercise with the US doing its share by trimming its budget
deficit.
The request on numerical targets has prompted calls in Tokyo that the US
should also produce figures showing it is reducing the budget deficit.
However, even were the US to do so this would not mean Japan agreeing to
numerical targets, a Miti official said. Japanese trade officials also
emphasised that the bilateral talks should be restricted to issues within
the government's reach, implying that the setting of numerical targets,
under a free trade system, were not.
However, recent comments indicate the Japanese side is open to suggestions
on how to resolve bilateral trade issues as long as the US does not threaten
unilateral sanctions or insist on setting quantitative targets.
Japan is expected to propose that the two countries co-operate on
environmental issues, transportation technology, telecommunications, and
labour and human resources development.

FT  09 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Sumed pipeline plans expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Egypt-based Sumed oil pipeline plans to expand its capacity to pump Gulf
oil to Mediterranean markets and increase its market share there, Reuter
reports from Cairo.
Mr Mohammed Mae'bed, chairman, said three pumps would begin operating at a
booster station south of Cairo in March 1994, taking the pipeline's capacity
to about 2.3m barrels of oil per day (bpd) from 1.6m bpd now. The Dollars
120m (Pounds 77.9m) expansion had originally been scheduled to finish in
September this year.
But oil traders said the increase could aggravate the pipeline's problem of
congestion as plans to develop storage at the pipeline's Red Sea and
Mediterranean terminals were at an earlier stage.
'The problem area is discharging at Ain Sukhna (in the Red Sea),' one trader
said. 'People are fed up with the delays, and boosting the pumping capacity
and the throughput without corresponding storage isn't going to solve that.
In the short term, it's not a good thing.'
Sumed officials say the pipeline is already operating above its nominal
capacity of 80m tonnes per year but there are frequent snarl-ups at Ain
Sukhna. In November last year tankers were waiting up to 10 days to unload
and the delays pushed the price of Iranian crudes up on spot markets.
The 320km pipeline, set up in 1974, carries mainly Saudi and Iranian crudes.
Mr Mae'bed said Sumed was considering adding another 4.5m barrels storage to
its current 2.4m barrels at the two terminals. The company's board would
discuss this month a feasibility study by Bechtel Corp of the US.

FT  09 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland on course to be new Gatt chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, former EC competition commissioner, still looks likely
to be appointed director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade when Gatt members meet this afternoon in special session.
This is despite a vigorous Latin American challenge to his candidacy to
succeed Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general since 1980, who retires at the
end of this month.
Some Latin American countries indicated yesterday they were preparing to
join a consensus in Mr Sutherland's favour. This remains contingent on
'satisfactory understandings' with other Gatt members on how the world trade
body should be run.
The group has already made clear its interest in the third deputy
director-general post likely to be created at today's meeting. Trade
officials have informally discussed a 'package' which would give Mr
Sutherland deputies from the US, India and Latin America.
Japan also has a candidate in mind for the third deputy job but this is
unlikely to prove acceptable to developing countries. Deputy appointments
are made by the director-general 'in consultation with' Gatt members.
Latin American officials say their motives in backing alternative candidates
to Mr Sutherland were never to force a split in the 111-nation organisation,
but to open up the succession debate and serve notice that, in future, the
selection process and Gatt itself will have to be more democratic. Late last
week, Mr Luis Fernando Jaramillo of Colombia withdrew his name, leaving
Uruguay's veteran trade negotiator, Mr Julio Lacarte-Muro, as Mr
Sutherland's sole rival.
No one has questioned Mr Sutherland's abilities - 'excellent' and
'impressive' seem to be the most commonly-employed adjectives to describe
the 47-year-old Irish lawyer, who is currently chairman of Allied Irish
Banks. But many developing countries were offended by the assumption that,
once nominated by the Community and backed by the US, Mr Sutherland was a
shoe-in for Gatt's top job.
For the Latin Americans there was the further indignity that their two
nominees, first proposed when Mr Sutherland was reportedly reluctant to
stand, appeared to be discarded without a hearing.
Latin American and other developing countries have argued recently for a
more open process of selection than the traditional Gatt procedure of
consensus-building through informal consultations. These, by common consent,
have been conducted 'impeccably' by Mr Balkrishan Zutshi, India's Gatt
ambassador and current chairman of Gatt's contracting parties (members).
In the end, Mr Lacarte failed to get much support from outside Latin
America. His supporters are disappointed but not downhearted. 'We've helped
the process to be more transparent and more multilateral,' says one
ambassador.
As a direct result, he says, Mr Sutherland has been twice to Geneva to meet
Gatt ambassadors - though on EC advice he turned down an invitation to
appear before Gatt's informal developing country group. Community officials
argued this could undermine Mr Zutshi's efforts at consensus-building and
encourage politicisation of Gatt, hitherto remarkably free from North-South
conflict.
The Latin Americans say they wanted to make a broader point about the
conduct of Gatt affairs and the hoped-for conclusion this year of the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. 'It's a signal that developing
countries, and Latin America in particular, will not just accept anything
that's put on the table,' says a senior negotiator.

Between January 15 and July 14, the SDR-based rate will be 7.55 per
cent. It replaces the previous rate of 8.1 per cent. The SDR-based rate
will again change on July 15.

Bolivia's trade deficit was far greater last year than feared, rising to its
highest level in more than a decade and damping hopes of growth, according
to central bank figures, Christina Lamb writes from La Paz. The deficit
reached Dollars 561m in 1992, way above the original estimate of Dollars
410m. Imports reached a record Dollars 1.169bn while exports fell from
Dollars 760m to Dollars 608m. This was mainly because of a 50 per cent drop
in the value of hydrocarbon exports due to the ending of a fixed price
agreement on gas sales to Argentina.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Porous Haiti embargo hits the poor most: William Spindler
and Jurek Martin on 'dilatory' moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM SPINDLER and JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE fashionable shops of Petionville, close to Port-au-Prince, Haiti's
capital, there are few signs that the country is under an economic embargo.
Everything from French wines to four-wheel-drive vehicles can be purchased -
at a price.
It is the poor in Haiti, the most impoverished nation in the Caribbean, who
are feeling the effects of an embargo imposed by the Organisation of
American States in 1991. The cost of their essential goods has gone up as a
result and most aid projects have been suspended.
Even the escape routes by sea to the US have dwindled in the face of US
coast guard patrols.
The question of tightening the economic screws on the Haitian regime to
persuade it to allow the return of the ousted president, Fr Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, continues to divide the outside world. Mr Dante Caputo, the former
Argentine foreign minister and the envoy appointed by the UN and the OAS,
said recently that it was 'time to stop dilatory manoeuvres'.
Last Friday, in a tacit recognition that diplomacy had so far achieved
little, the US increased the pressure, freezing the US assets of 83
individuals and 35 Haitian institutions considered to support the current
regime in Port-au-Prince, including those of Mr Marc Bazin, the prime
minister installed by the military and who resigned yesterday. Individuals
and their families will be denied US visas and officials in Washington
freely speculated that an oil embargo might be next.
This action followed the breakdown of Mr Caputo's negotiations over the
inability of all parties, including Fr Aristide, to agree on the deployment
of a 500-strong UN police force to ensure that his return is not accompanied
by civil unrest.
Nevertheless the latest US moves have been criticised as too gradualist. An
oil embargo and the suspension of regular air travel are frequently advanced
as the sort of sanctions which, short of military intervention, are more
likely to force a settlement.
The congressional black caucus has been among those pressing the
administration of President Bill Clinton for a tougher stand than existing
policies, which resemble in many ways those of President George Bush.
As it is, the effect of economic sanctions on Haiti's elite, parties to the
negotiations, have not been great. Trade with Europe, which is unaffected by
the embargo, has increased.
Ships from the Dutch dependencies of Aruba and Curacao regularly bring the
imported goods which Haiti's rich classes crave.
There are easier ways to circumvent the embargo, however. The land border
with the Dominican Republic, which occupies the eastern part of the island,
is only a half-an-hour drive from Port-au-Prince. Indeed, one of the few
projects undertaken by the military-backed government has been the
completion of a paved road on which lorries bring goods from the republic.
A mission from the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and other financial institutions has been in
Haiti for an economic diagnosis.
Mr Jose Luis Larrabure, the UNDP's resident representative, said the
international community was worried about the economic crisis a future
democratic government would inherit and emphasis was being given to planning
projects that could be put into effect rapidly.
The renewed talk of sanctions against the elite has been received with
scepticism in Haiti, after similar threats in the past failed to
materialise.
Mixed US signals have not helped, with Washington's rhetoric calling for the
restoration of Fr Aristide sometimes at odds with the views of US embassy
officials in Haiti who are opposed to his return on the grounds that his
brief period in office proved he was no democrat.
Sources close to Fr Aristide have warned that a civil war may be imminent
and, even before his resignation, little credibility was accorded Mr Bazin's
offer to convene a national reconciliation conference.
Meanwhile, the work of the international civilian mission of the OAS and the
UN, which has been deployed to monitor human rights violations, will become
more difficult. 'The perceived weakness of the international community will
encourage attempts to neutralise or render ineffective our work,' said the
executive director of the mission, Mr Colin Granderson.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Haiti's Prime Minister Marc Bazin resigned yesterday, creating a dangerous
power vacuum in the troubled Caribbean nation whose military refuses to
restore democracy despite the threat of increased sanctions, Reuter reports
from Port-au-Prince.
In Managua, Nicaragua, where the Organisation of American States is
discussing how to step up the pressure, ousted President Jean Bertrand
Aristide said he hoped the news could mean his return to Haiti 'within the
next few weeks or even days'.
Mr Bazin, a former World Bank economist, quit after he had been prevented
from appointing four new cabinet members.
Political pressure had been mounting since Friday when four ministers, some
with links to the police chief of Port-au-Prince, had refused to step down.
Mr Bazin had also lost the support of a small centrist party which had given
him a parliamentary majority.

<TEXT>
AN investigation into links between the Mexican police and drug traffickers,
begun by Mr Jorge Carpizo, the attorney-general (pictured above at a press
conference), has taken a new turn with the charging of six judicial
policemen, writes Lucy Conger in Mexico City.
The six have been charged with protecting the leader of the Sinaloa cartel,
allegedly responsible for a shoot-out with rivals at Guadalajara airport on
May 24 which left a Roman Catholic cardinal and six other people dead.
The detainees, also charged with criminal association and drug-related
crimes, include two federal judicial police commanders and the
director-general of the Jalisco state judicial police, based in Guadalajara.
Mr Carpizo has sent shockwaves through the security forces in the five
months since assuming his post, and is investigating more than 200 federal
judicial policemen suspected of having links to the drugs trade.
Mounting criticism of the investigation prompted Mr Carpizo on Monday to
offer his resignation.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Clinton poised to simplify energy tax: Senator's dogged
opposition may force change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is on the verge of abandoning his plan to tax the
thermal content of fuels, and is instead negotiating for a simpler energy
tax calculated on price.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, has been put in charge of squeezing
the budget package past his former colleagues in the Senate, and is now
negotiating a compromise bill that would reduce the impact of the proposed
energy tax by about a third and make offsetting cuts in spending,
principally on medical benefits for the elderly.
Although the White House insists Mr Clinton still wants 'a broad-based
energy tax, one that is fair and one that encourages conservation,' he
appears to have given up his plan to tax most fuels at 26.8 cents per
million British thermal units, with an additional 34.2 cents per million
BTUs levied on oil products.
Faced by the dogged opposition of Senator David Boren, from the
oil-producing state of Oklahoma, to the BTU tax the administration is now
considering an ad valorem tax.
This would simplify collection but would emasculate the intended
environmental benefits of the energy tax which, as originally designed,
would have favoured cleaner fuels such as natural gas over dirtier coal or
petroleum products.
However, the BTU tax had already been so extensively remodelled by
concessions to farm and industry lobbies that its environmental benefits
would have been muted.
The administration has been working with Senate Democratic leaders on plans
to cut about Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.9bn) from the Dollars 72bn it
originally expected to collect over five years through the energy tax.
Senators also want to postpone implementation of the higher income tax rates
to be applied to upper-income taxpayers from January 1 to July 1, at a
revenue cost of about Dollars 9bn.
To offset this the administration and Senate Democratic leaders are
considering reducing the earned income tax credit proposed for low-income
working families, which was partly intended to compensate for the impact of
the energy tax, and cuts in health benefits under the Medicare programme for
the elderly.
White House officials had been counting on Medicare savings to pay for some
of the expected cost of their healthcare reform plan.
It is possible, however, that Senator Patrick Moynihan, Senate finance
committee chairman, may have deliberately exaggerated the size of likely
Medicare cuts to excite the powerful pensioners' lobby and step up pressure
on rebellious Democrats like Mr Boren, who is the key swing vote on the
committee where Democrats hold an 11:9 majority.
Mr Clinton has limited leeway in his search for a compromise: nothing he
offers will gain a single Republican vote in the Senate, while concessions
to win over one or two right-wing Democrats could cost him votes among
disgruntled left wingers in the House.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Italy widens its inquiry into aviation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROME magistrates yesterday disclosed that they had opened an important new
line of inquiry covering the aerospace sector and business and aviation
contracts.
The investigation centres on the formation of the aerospace group Alenia
through the 1990 merger of Italy's state-controlled defence and electronics
groups, Aeritalia and Selenia.
The magistrates said three senior executives involved in the deal had been
advised they were under investigation for alleged falsification of accounts.
The executives included Mr Fausto Cereti, former chief executive of
Aeritalia, and Mr Enrico Gimelli, his former number in Selenia, both now
joint managers of Alenia. The third person was Mr Fabiano Fabiani, the head
of Finmeccanica, the chief industrial arm of the state holding company, Iri,
which controlled the merging groups. Mr Fabiani is one of the key managers
in the public sector and Finmeccanica is one of the two central pillars of
Iri's operations.
This is the first time Finmeccanica has become directly involved in
investigations by magistrates. Until now investigations into alleged
corruption have stopped at a subsidiary level, as in the case of its
engineering and transportation arm, Ansaldo.
The merger was part of a rationalisation of assets and operations held under
Iri's umbrella. Selenia was previously controlled by Stet, the state
telecommunications holding, and it moved under the wing of Finmeccanica to
shape up to international competition in the nineties.
According to usually reliable leaks from the magistrates, they are examining
the valuations made of the two groups prior to the merger.
During the course of the magistrates' investigation they are also understood
to have branched out to examine certain aspects of Alitalia's operations
purchasing and leasing aircraft. This led on Monday to Mr Giovanni
Bisignani, the Alitalia chief executive, being advised he was under
investigation for alleged falsification of accounts. Yesterday, Alitalia
issued a strong denial, pointing out that the operations in question
represented normal international practice.
Also in the aviation field, it was reported yesterday that police had seized
documentation relating to airport construction work over the past decade.
In another development yesterday, Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist
leader, was informed he was wanted for questioning for allegedly receiving
L360m (Pounds 160,000) passed on via intermediaries from his long-standing
adversary Olivetti, for the supply of information equipment to the justice
ministry.

</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in Italian industry continues to rise, especially in companies
employing more than 500 persons.
According to the latest figures from Istat, the national statistics
institute, the level of employment in large companies fell by 6.5 per cent
in the first three months of the year compared with the same period last
year.
During 1992, companies employing more than 500 persons lost on average 5.5
per cent of their workforce, equivalent to 65,000 jobs.
The speed of job losses increased during the latter half of 1992 and appears
to show no sign of slowing down. Overall 200,000 jobs were lost in industry
in 1992.
Throughout the economy as a whole, the total out of work is 10.5 per cent.
But the true picture of unemployment in industry is masked by extensive use
of the government-financed system of temporary lay-offs which extends over a
two-year period.
The unions, involved in delicate tripartite talks with the government and
the employers on a wage pact, fear the consequences of spending cuts on
unemployment benefits.
In particular, they are concerned that a number of temporary lay-off schemes
are now reaching the end of their maximum funding by the government. With
the recession refusing to bottom out, job losses could begin to pose a
problem for the government.

EC foreign ministers yesterday reached broad agreement on measures to
accelerate the political and economic integration into the EC of six former
communist countries in Eastern Europe.
The package includes faster than expected dismantling of tariff barriers in
footwear, steel, textiles, cars and other industrial goods. It also holds
out the prospect of future EC membership, without offering a firm date.
The new measures cover Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary,
Bulgaria and Romania, all of whom have association agreements with the EC.
These agreements offer preferential trade treatment. A free-trade axis built
around the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and, surprisingly, Spain
pushed through the package which represents a big political success for EC
commissioners, Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Hans van den Broek.

<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday agreed a programme to improve safety at
sea, following a spate of oil tanker accidents in EC waters.
The European Commission is to introduce legislation within six months to
enforce minimum standards on ship maintenance and inspection, and training
of crews, 'with the objective of removing all sub-standard ships from
Community waters'.
EC transport ministers, meeting in Luxembourg yesterday, stopped short of
banning tankers from waters near environmentally sensitive areas, but
proposed that member states identify such nature reserves and put forward
measures to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to protect them.
IMO standards will be the basis for the safety measures.
Some member states are expected to go further than this. Irish officials
said last night that Ireland planned a 20-mile exclusion zone of its coast
for oil tankers and vessels carrying dangerous waste that were in transit
through its waters.
Among the measures planned are:
Common criteria for more thorough port inspection of ships, including
criteria for detaining or refusing access to vessels;
Common standards for the classification societies which guarantee
seaworthiness;
Minimum standards of training for crews based on IMO rules for tankers;
Better reporting systems for vessels carrying dangerous or polluting goods.
The transport ministers also edged closer to a deal on road cabotage, giving
road hauliers the right to ply for trade inside EC countries other than
their own. A new attempt to get a breakthrough will be made at a special
ministerial meeting on June 19.

A LONE gunman, described as a failed author desperate for world fame,
yesterday killed France's wartime Vichy regime police chief, Mr Rene
Bousquet, who deported thousands of French Jews to Nazi death camps in 1942,
Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Bousquet, a senior banker after the war who lived untroubled until 1979
when documents about his past began to emerge. was shot at his home in the
elegant 16th district of Paris.
Mr Bousquet, aged 84, was charged with crimes against humanity in 1991 for
the deportation of Jewish children to the camps. The court of appeal had
been due to decide within weeks whether to send him for trial.
French Jewish leaders who campaigned to bring him to justice condemned the
assassination, saying it deprived France of a chance to establish the truth
about its collaborationist past.

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of employees at the Bank of France yesterday went on strike in
protest against the new centre-right government's plans to make the central
bank independent, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The workers staged demonstrations outside local Bank of France buildings in
the provinces and held a protest march through the streets of Paris during a
parliamentary debate on the issue. They called on the government to give
guarantees to protect jobs after the bank becomes independent.
Union sources said that 80 per cent of the central bank's 17,000 employees
had heeded the strike call. However, a Bank of France spokesman said that
main services had been unaffected by the strike action.
Meanwhile, Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, former socialist minister and one of
the most outspoken members of the opposition, claimed in parliament that an
independent central bank would give Germany's Bundesbank undue influence
over the French economy.
'Never before has a great state institution been defended with such
indifference,' he said.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Swiss ease rules on finance houses
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swiss authorities have eased conditions under which foreign controlled
securities houses can participate in Swiss franc bond underwriting
syndicates, apparently with a view to stemming any further contraction of
Japanese securities company offices in Zurich, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Under a 1989 order, all Swiss-domiciled securities companies wishing to
participate in syndicates had to convert themselves into banks by the end of
last year.
So far, 30 Japanese houses have become banks, but eight remain as finance
houses.
Last year, three Japanese securities companies closed their Zurich offices
partly in response to troubles at home, partly because a much reduced level
of Japan-related business in Switzerland undermined the case for converting
themselves into banks.
However, in the meantime, the Swiss government opened syndicate membership
to all European-domiciled banks. Since April, only the lead manager of a
syndicate has to be Swiss-based. That left foreign controlled securities
houses in Switzerland at a disadvantage to their affiliated banks elsewhere
in Europe.
The Swiss financial authorities, meeting their Japanese counterparts,
acknowledged the anomaly and agreed to be 'very flexible'.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Whale before 'chicken'?: Norway refuses to be cowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG the many angry, often abusive, letters that Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland,
the Norwegian prime minister, has received since she announced that Norway
would resume commercial whaling is a studiously polite protest from an
Englishman in Bristol.
His letter tells of how he had grown to admire Mrs Brundtland's impressive
record on world environmental issues, but then expresses his deep
disenchantment at the decision to defy the eight-year-old ban on commercial
whale catching by the International Whaling Commission.
The whaling issue - the whalers set to sea yesterday to resume hunting, amid
fears of sabotage by green activists - has brought Norway unaccustomed
international notoriety. Not the least effect of this has been a sharp
diminution of Mrs Brundtland's public image as a champion of green issues.
It comes on top of growing tension between Norway and the European Community
as Oslo approaches the key phase of negotiations on its application for EC
membership.
But Mrs Brundtland's government has not stumbled blindly into this
predicament. Her posture on whaling and the EC are part of a strategy
calculated to carry her minority Labour administration safely over the twin
hurdles of a difficult general election in September and persistent public
hostility to the EC which could result in rejection of membership in a
referendum that must precede accession.
In Norway, there is broad acceptance of Mrs Brundtland's argument that the
decision to allow limited hunting of minke whales falls within agreements on
responsible marine resource management reached at the Rio environmental
summit last year. The IWC scientific committee's opinion that the minke
whale is not an endangered species also carries great weight in Norway.
The business community is worried that the economic damage from
international boycotts of Norwegian products would far outweigh the marginal
benefits of renewed whaling to the northern fishing communities.
But officials close to Mrs Brundtland say it would have been politically
risky to have bowed to international pressure on the issue, on which she
enjoys the full backing of the Storting (parliament). One official said that
if the government had postponed the decision 'we would have been depicted as
chickens'.
On the face of it, the whaling issue is not linked to the negotiations on EC
membership, but the two questions have collided. Brussels has refused calls
by Oslo for the minke whale to be removed from the EC's list of endangered
species and the European parliament has adopted a resolution saying whaling
is incompatible with Community membership.
This threatens to complicate an already delicate negotiating process.
Officials in Oslo bristle over what they regard as a near chronic lack of
understanding in Brussels of the sensitivities involved in trying to
persuade the Norwegian electorate of the benefits of membership. A recent
case was a move by Brussels to introduce an oil and gas licensing directive
that would weaken Norway's ability, once in the EC, to decide its own energy
policy.
Mrs Brundtland reacted furiously, comparing the draft directive to a
decision by the EC to adopt a common fisheries policy in 1972 just before
Norway voted in a previous referendum on membership. The decision was widely
blamed for tipping the vote against membership. 'When we first heard about
the oil directive, we almost didn't believe it,' said one official.
Oslo has been criticised for adopting an attitude that it is the EC which
should adapt itself to Norway, not vice versa. But with polls showing
opposition to membership growing to 51 per cent and several opposition
parties gearing up to fight the September election on an anti-EC ticket, Mrs
Brundtland clearly believes she will win neither the election nor a second
EC poll without adopting a tough stance.
Fishing makes a small contribution to Norway's economy, while energy
accounts for about 15 per cent of GDP. But the official said they accounted
together for 60 per cent of the country's 'political GDP'.
Mrs Brundtland has given a virtual veto on the EC issue to her fishing
minister, Mr Jan Henry T. Olsen, who has an anti-EC record. Norway is
fighting to retain the right to determine its own fishing policy and not be
ruled by the EC's fisheries policy. The positive result of the Danish
referendum on May 18 gave some encouragement to Oslo that it may be able to
turn the tide of public opinion in Norway. But of the four countries of the
European Free Trade Association seeking membership in 1995 - the others are
Austria, Finland and Sweden - Norway undoubtedly remains the toughest nut to
crack. This will continue to be reflected in the public stance of the
government in the months to come.

FT  09 JUN 93 / New plant puts GM in the fast lane: Christopher Parkes
witnesses a small miracle worked in Eisenach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN EISENACH, where once 10,000 east Germans laboured to build 100,000
rattle-trap Wartburg cars a year, Adam Opel is just three months away from
its target of producing 125,000 vehicles with less than 20 per cent of the
old workforce.
While most other German car plant managers are contemplating more job cuts
or the prospect of continuing short-time working into the second half of the
year, the management at General Motors' newest European plant is preparing
to recruit at least 600 people to man a third shift.
Mr Jeff Bell, one of 10 advisers guiding the final stages of the plant's
start-up phase, relishes the comparison with the bad old days. But the young
Canadian is more concerned with relating the Eisenach plant's performance to
the bad old ways of its real-life peers and competitors.
Patrolling the walkway above the robotised welding line in the bodyshop,
where human beings do just 2 per cent of the work, he tots up the advantages
of Opel's showpiece works. According to measuring standards set by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it takes just 18.3 hours to build a
car in Eisenach, compared with around 30 hours in the group's works in
Bochum, western Germany, and Saragossa in Spain.
The so-called MIT number at GM's British subsidiary, Vauxhall, is about 25.
'But the quality is not very good. . . . We make the best Astra in Europe,'
he boasts, claiming that cars come off the Eisenach lines with only half a
dozen defects each, compared with 20 at Bochum and 14 in Britain.
But the works is much more than a modern car factory. It serves as a test
site for lean production methods and team working, as a training ground for
new management, and as an example to prove that despite the country's
much-discussed disadvantages, making cars in Germany is and can remain an
economic, competitive proposition.
Mr Bell waves a hand across his super-lean 'buffer' stock of 10 underbodies,
built up to keep work going further down the line if there is a fault in the
body shop. 'There would be 365 in Bochum. A long buffer is inventory. It
costs money,' he says. 'If this line breaks down we have 20 minutes to fix
it before the next production stage runs out of work. They have six hours at
Bochum.'
Down on the final assembly line, Mr Chris Honda, another Canadian import
from GM's CAMI joint venture with Suzuki in Ontario, points to typical
on-hand stocks of parts sufficient for only two hours' work, compared with
days'-worth elsewhere in the group.
The merits of Eisenach's methods were recognised early by rival Volkswagen,
which last year lured away the plant manager, Mr Jurgen Gebhardt, and made
him production director at its Audi subsidiary.
Mr Gebhardt's crucial role, his ex-colleagues say, was in convincing workers
to accept flexible working practices unknown in western Germany.
For example, the Eisenach body shop employs 10 skilled plant maintenance
people per shift, compared with 300 in Bochum. While the new plant is far
smaller, company officials insist that the comparison is valid. The key
difference is that when a western German line stops through breakdown,
non-maintenance workers sit on their hands while it is put right by the
maintenance staff. At Eisenach, idled workers pitch in to help.
A new works, unashamedly Japanese-inspired and custom-built to 21st century
demands, Eisenach is already proving its worth. Not least noteworthy is that
it is able to compete in cost terms with GM's low-pay Saragossa factory in
the production of the company's new small car, the Corsa (sold as the
Vauxhall Nova in Britain). VW, by comparison, has been forced by high German
costs to move all its Polo production to Spain.
But as Mr Bell and Mr Honda readily admit, it cannot escape the consequences
of its position as the most junior member of the international GM family,
and the realities of life in the worst downturn in the German motor industry
since the war. Lacking its own presses - excess capacity elsewhere ruled out
new installations on site - it relies on Bochum and Spain for body parts.
'I'd like us to build as much as we could and keep quality control under one
roof,' says Mr Bell.
Mr Honda also cites quality as an argument for the new works' having more
local sources. 'But Opel wants only one supplier for each part for Spain and
Eisenach,' he says.
Meanwhile, despite its quality record, the plant's Astra output is being
switched to Bochum where the recession has forced the introduction of
short-time working. This will leave Eisenach with the Corsa only, and
postpone full-scale testing of its ability to produce up to seven vehicle
variants on a single line.
Eisenach is a small fish in the group's manufacturing pool. 'You have to
remember that GM sells 1.7m cars a year in Europe, and we have capacity to
make only 150,000 of them,' notes Mr Bell. But it has a potentially more
important role as a breeding ground for what Opel calls its 'missionaries'
to spread the new manufacturing technology and philosophy. The man who set
up its state-of-the-art paint shop is now working at Vauxhall in Ellesmere
Port. Mr Honda's predecessor is now managing a plant of his own in Georgia
in the US.
But something more than missionary zeal is required. Mr Honda, only eight
months in Germany, already recognises the scale of the task confronting him
and his colleagues when their turn comes to spread the message. 'It is one
thing to succeed with a new plant on a greenfield site, manned by new people
who have no prejudices or preconceptions,' he says. It is another to succeed
in places where factories, ideas and attitudes have been established for
decades.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Airbus plans jumbo Boeing challenger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Airbus consortium is pressing ahead with plans to develop a
700-800 seat airliner at the same time as its four-partner companies are
studying with Boeing the development of an even larger aircraft.
Boeing executives confirmed at a Financial Times aerospace conference before
the Paris Air Show that their company was also considering a larger version
of its 400-500 seat 747-400 jumbo.
The US company, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets, agreed
earlier this year with the four Airbus partners - Aerospatiale of France,
Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - to study joint
development of a super jumbo. But Mr Adam Brown, Airbus director of
planning, said yesterday it would be an 800-1,000 seater which would not
compete directly with Boeing's 747-400 which dominates the current 400-500
seater market.
Airbus has thus decided to challenge Boeing with an alternative plan for a
700-800 seater jumbo, called the Airbus A3XX, in a single class
configuration. This would compete with the US company's larger version of
the 747 which it is planning to maintain its dominance of the jumbo market.
Mr Brown told the conference he expected no growth in the commercial
aircraft market over the next 10 years, but he said Airbus remained 'firmly
convinced about the potential viability of our proposed A3XX ultra-high
capacity aircraft'.
New smaller narrow-body airliners were unlikely to be built over the next
decade, he said, but there was a strong case for developing a large capacity
aircraft by the turn of the century. However, given development costs of
more than Dollars 15bn, extensive international collaboration was
inevitable. Airbus was trying to interest Japanese manufacturers in the
A3XX.
Although all the main manufacturers are considering broad co-operation on
such an aircraft, they are also anxious to maintain leadership of any new
collaborative programme. This explains both the discussions between Boeing
and the Airbus partners and their alternative jumbo projects.
At the smaller end of the market, said Mr Brown, the main focus would be on
derivatives of existing airframes rather than wholly new designs. Boeing,
for example, is expected to launch later this year a derivative of its 737
twin-engine narrow body jet.
The financial pressures on airlines, coupled with continuing overcapacity in
the market, were expected to reduce sharply new aircraft programmes over the
next 20 years, Mr Brown warned.
'Over the past 20 years the three prime manufacturers together have on
average launched one major new or derivative programme every year. Over the
next 20 years, it's hard to envisage more than a quarter of this number.'
Mr Homi Mullan, managing director of Chase Investment Bank, said that with
airlines generating inadequate cash flows to support an estimated Dollars
310bn worth of new aircraft required between now and the end of the century,
the World Bank should consider helping more to finance the airline needs of
third world countries. Barely 1 per cent, or the equivalent of Dollars 300m,
of bank infrastructure financing last year supported airline or airport
related projects.

<TEXT>
HOSTILITIES between Bosnian Croats and Moslems reached a new peak yesterday
following the fall of the city of Travnik to the Moslems and the reported
destruction of some 20 surrounding villages with heavy loss of life,
Agencies report.
Fighting moved south towards Vitez, held by Bosnian Croat troops, as the
Moslems sought to link their strongholds of Tuzla and Zenica to the north
with Jablanica and Konjic, two towns they control about 30 miles south of
Travnik.
Croatian radio in Zagreb said more than 250 civilians and soldiers died in
the Travnik region yesterday and 15,000 people had fled. A confidential
United Nations report, made available to Associated Press, spoke of 'heavy
civilian casualties', and 20 villages put to the torch.
The battle for Travnik was over, UN sources said late yesterday. A strategic
junction in central Bosnia, it was a city of 70,000 people before the war,
about 45 per cent Moslem and 37 per cent Croat.
The Croat exodus and an influx of Moslem refugees from other war zones in
Bosnia means Moslems now outnumber Croats five to one.
About 700 Croat soldiers expelled from Travnik by the Moslem assault have
been interned in the notorious Manjaca prison camp by the Bosnian Serbs to
whom they surrendered.
The camp, near Banja Luka, headquarters of the Bosnian Serb armed forces and
the main city of Serb-held north Bosnia, was previously a detention camp for
Moslems. It was closed months ago following a furious outcry in the west
after its squalid conditions were made public.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said some 3,500 Croat civilian
refugees from Travnik were yesterday huddled on Serb-held Mount Vlasic north
of Moslem front lines
The Bosnian Serbs' defence minister, Mr Dusan Kovacevic, said the Croat
prisoners could be exchanged for Serbs held by Croatia or the self-styled
Bosnian Croat republic, Herceg-Bosna, carved out of Croat-dominated
territory in Bosnia's southwest. Civilian refugees could go wherever they
wanted.
British troops saw Moslem forces fire machine guns at fleeing Croat
civilians yesterday, according to UN military sources. Two British UN
soldiers witnessed the incident at Guca Gora, a village northeast of
Travnik. Some 200 Croat civilians shepherded by peacekeepers into a church
were still there last night awaiting evacuation. UN soldiers had ordered
Moslem troops to lay down their weapons to avert a massacre.
Meanwhile, in Sarajevo, Bosnia's unpopular military commander, Sefer
Halilovic, was replaced yesterday in a shake-up of the republic's
hard-pressed armed forces.
The new commander is Rasim Delic, formerly head of the strategic planning
department, it was announced on local radio.
The Bosnian army will also form a sixth corps to be headquartered in the
central town of Konjic, where the Moslems say they are coming under attack
from both Croat and Serb forces.

AT LEAST four more arson attacks on foreign homes and businesses were
reported in Germany yesterday, as politicians and community leaders called
for firm action to combat racism.
Fourteen people, including six children, were taken to hospital suffering
from inhaling smoke, after a fire in a house near Dusseldorf occupied by
several Turkish families.
In a separate incident, a Turkish restaurant owner and his family just
managed to escape a blaze started with four incendiary devices in their home
near Karlsruhe.
The security services fear that racist gangs have embarked on a series of
'copy-cat' attacks, following the deaths of two Turkish women and three
girls in Solingen 10 days ago. Turkish community leaders believe they may be
co-ordinated by extreme right-wing groups.
The government agreed yesterday to hold an emergency debate in parliament
next week on the violence and ways of combatting racism. Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, criticised for not reacting more forcefully to the attacks, will speak
for the ruling coalition.
Changes in the German nationality laws now appear inevitable, with growing
cross-party support for relaxation of restrictive rules that link
naturalisation to German ancestry. But there is strong resistance in Mr
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its sister party, the conservative
Bavarian-based Christian Social Union, to calls for dual nationality.
The clampdown on illegal foreign immigration from eastern Europe continued
yesterday with the proposed introduction of new labour rules for east
Europeans employed in the country.
Government officials, under pressure from IG Bau, the construction trade
union, have thrashed out rules to restrict the ability of east European
sub-contractors on German construction projects to pay their employees
directly.
The new regulations, expected to come into effect later this year, will
force German companies to directly employ east European nationals and pay
for their social insurance. The eastern European sub-contractors, who
provide workers for a third of the cost of German employees, are accused of
undermining Germany's highly regulated wage system. Some sub-contractors are
regularly approached by German companies seeking illegal workers.
While quotas signed between Germany and eastern European countries,
including Russia, allow for 97,000 workers a year to work on short-term
contracts, up to 400,000 are believed working illegally in the country, over
two thirds of them on construction sites.
But the new regulations are likely to have little effect on the illegal job
seekers pouring through the country's eastern borders.
The number of illegal immigrants caught at the Polish and Czech borders
increased by 233 per cent to 29,200 in the first five months of the year, Mr
Rudolf Seiters, the federal interior minister, said yesterday.
While the interior ministry has tightened security at the borders, the
number of illegal immigrants has increased ahead of the curbs on Germany's
liberal asylum law recently passed in parliament.

BA is among several leading western carriers approached. Although the
Chinese are at present seeking advice, they also hope to develop longer term
relationships which could lead to western investment.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, is leading a company delegation to
Beijing this week at the invitation of the CAAC. The Chinese are
particularly interested in BA's privatisation process and experience.
The British airline has recently started non-stop flights between London and
Beijing and has been showing growing interest in developing its presence in
the fast growing Chinese market.
Although BA officials said yesterday it was much too early to talk about
joint ventures, a collaboration deal with a Chinese carrier would represent
an additional component in BA's strategy to become a global airline.
Western aircraft manufacturers are also intensifying their marketing efforts
in China whose airlines have traditionally relied on Russian aircraft but
are now increasingly turning to western airliners.
Mr Robert Dryden, a Boeing executive vice president, speaking at a Financial
Times aerospace conference in Paris yesterday said China was expected to
account for about 14 per cent of the 340 aircraft Boeing expected to build
this year.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Poland's stags muscle in on issues

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RUSH for shares in the Polish government's privatisation issues has seen
the return of one of the features of the old economy of chronic shortages -
long queues - and the use of violence to obtain shares.
Despite a continued fall in the Warsaw stock exchange after its meteoric 175
per cent rise since Easter, small investors remain convinced they will make
a killing on new issues and crowded into banks and stockbrokers' offices to
buy shares in the Vistula garment manufacturer and the Sokolow Podlaski meat
works.
Many had turned up day after day for two or more weeks to check their names
off a list held by a queue committee specifically set up to make sure the
order would be respected when the sale opened on a first come, first served
basis.
Others had hired 'standers' to keep their place as well as bodyguards to
protect the 'standers'. The less subtle simply sent in a hired group of
strong-arm men to make the purchase on the day.
Thus in Krakow on Monday Mr Krzysztof Arabski, a local broker became the
small investor's hero after he refused to serve a dozen or more well-muscled
investors who tried to jump the queue. The group was more successful,
however, in pushing aside a queue outside the Export Development Bank, where
a couple of women accompanying them bought shares.
Scores of similar incidents have been reported of strong-arm men pushing
into queues and buying all the shares available at a given branch. 'In
Bochnia near Krakow one man produced a pistol,' says Mr Arabski.
Yesterday Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, head of the Warsaw stock exchange called on
the privatisation ministry to drop the first come first served system and
offer new issues through the exchange on a subscription basis modelled on
British practice. The securities commission which regulates the market has
asked aggrieved investors to lodge complaints.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Croats flee Moslem assault on Travnik
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN FULLERTON OF REUTERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TRAVNIK, BOSNIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS OF terrified Croat refugees fled Travnik yesterday as Croat forces
hurled mortar and shell fire at positions occupied by Moslem fighters who
have seized most of the central Bosnian town.
The battle for Travnik has turned into a rout for Croats who earlier were
allied with Moslems against Serbs in Bosnia's civil war but are now fighting
each other for territory.
A spokesman for the Croatian Defence Force (HVO) admitted that around 1,000
its soldiers who surrendered to nearby Serb forces on Monday had disobeyed
orders to withdraw to safe positions.
Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, accused Moslems of executing Croat
prisoners in Travnik although there was no independent confirmation of the
claim.
Croats streamed from the Turkish-built town, a relic of the Ottoman empire,
and its surrounding villages on foot or any other means of transport
available. Mules, donkey carts, bicycles, cars and vans laden with
panic-stricken refugees jostled on the roads as Croat mortar bombs and
shells soared over their heads towards Moslem targets.
A young Croat fighter said the Moslems, who outnumber the better-armed HVO,
captured another village yesterday morning and added: 'The Moslems are
attacking right across the front.'
Hundreds of people have been killed in and around Travnik since the fighting
began over the weekend, according to western military sources in the area.
The HVO appear to have taken up positions on high ground south and east of
the town in anticipation of a Moslem attempt to take control of the valley
bisecting central Bosnia. This would allow Moslems to link their northern
strongholds of Tuzla and Zenica with Jablanica and Konjic south of Travnik.
An HVO spokesman confirmed that Croat soldiers and civilians from Travnik
surrendered to the Bosnian Serb army on Mount Vlasic just north of the town
during the fighting. 'I believe they had no other choice' because the
situation in the town is 'a total mess'.
General Philippe Morillon, the commander of UN peacekeepers, planned a
meeting with leaders of the HVO and the Moslem-led government forces in a
fresh attempt to enforce a ceasefire.
In eastern Bosnia, Sarajevo radio reported that Serb forces attacked the
blockaded Moslem enclave of Gorazde with tanks and infantry yesterday and
were bringing up reinforcements.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S economy minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, resigned yesterday, freeing her
to stand as a candidate to become Turkey's new prime minster at a convention
of the conservative True Path party (DYP) on Sunday.
Mrs Ciller, a 47-year-old former Istanbul economics professor - famous for
having forced her husband to assume her maiden name - is one of the leading
candidates seeking to be elected chairman of the DYP.
Whether she wins or not, Turkey will now have to choose a new economy
minister as Mrs Ciller's office made clear yesterday that she would not
return to the cabinet if unsuccessful in Sunday's poll of 1,154 DYP
delegates.
President Suleyman Demirel has declined to interfere in the election,
although his old party colleague Mr Ismet Sezgin, interior minister, is also
expected to announce his candidacy. Education minister, Mr Koksal Toptan,
may join the contest. Whoever emerges winner will have to reforge the
coalition with the Social Democratic Populists in the wake of the shock
announcement on Monday that Prof Erdal Inonu, the SHP leader and current
caretaker prime minister, would stand down in September.
An academic economist, Mrs Ciller has had a brief if chequered political
career since becoming the coalition's economics minister in November 1991.
She has been criticised for continual sparring with Mr Rusdu Saracoglu,
central bank governor and a key figure in the economic reforms of the 1980s
and one of the few senior bureaucrats to survive the change of government.
Her anti-inflation policy has centred on bringing down interest rates, which
she blames for the persistently large public sector deficits. The inflation
rate for May increased to 4.7 per cent from 4.4 in April.
For all that, Mrs Ciller is doing well in the polls which suggest she is
leading candidate for party leader, while Mr Sezgin, her main rival, has
slipped up after being held responsible for the killing by Kurdish rebels of
35 army conscripts near Bingol last month.
Mrs Ciller was elected a member of the party general assembly in 1990 and
entered parliament for the first time in 1991. She once claimed she polled
more votes than Mr Demirel, whose accession to the presidency created the
current contest.

FT  09 JUN 93 / SPD to fight welfare cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE opposition Social Democratic Party in the German parliament yesterday
rejected calls for cuts in social spending to control the soaring budget
deficit, and proposed an alternative DM33bn (Pounds 13.4bn) savings package
for the coming year.
In spite of suggestions from some senior party figures that the huge social
welfare budget can no longer be a 'taboo' for spending cuts, the party
leadership seems determined to fight the government on the issue.
The move would seem to put paid to any early attempt to negotiate a new
cross-party 'solidarity pact' to curb state spending, and keep the central
government budget deficit to a ceiling of DM70bn this year and in 1994.
Senior finance officials believe that only with cross-party agreement can
adequate savings be made in coming years to keep the deficit under control.
Mrs Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy leader of the SPD parliamentary group, and
Mr Joachim Poss, its finance spokesman, yesterday spelt out their
alternative plan for a DM33bn package of cuts and revenue increases which
would avoid any social cuts.
Key elements include a further DM3bn-5bn cuts in defence spending, DM910m in
abolishing fuel subsidies for farmers, DM300m from the manned space
exploration programme and nuclear research, and DM170m in reduced finance
for the government's publicity apparatus.
The SPD is proposing dismantling a series of tax allowances, totalling
DM15bn a year, including cutting allowances on company entertainment, and
abolishing the reimbursement of foreign taxation.
It also wants to introduce a 'labour market surcharge' for those who pay no
unemployment benefit, such as the self-employed, government servants,
ministers and members of parliament.
The plan is intended as an alternative to the DM20bn package of spending
cuts which Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, is proposing. He is calling
for reduced unemployment benefits and cuts in other sensitive social areas
like child allowances and student grants.
The 1994 budget has to be finalised by July 13, when it is to be presented
to the cabinet.

FT  09 JUN 93 / BT objects to Oftel's network charges plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE between British Telecom and Oftel, the industry regulator, over
the charges to be paid by BT's competitors for use of its network could cast
a shadow over the imminent sale of the government's remaining stake in the
company.
The argument, set off yesterday by Oftel's draft plans to guarantee
competitors fair access to BT's network, is unlikely to be resolved before
the BT3 sale next month.
Although stock market analysts believe Oftel's plans have no significant
implications for BT's profitability, potential investors will be warned of
them in the prospectus.
Oftel stops short of calling for BT to be broken up. But it wants to see the
network and retailing sides of BT's business accounted for separately, with
annual accounts for each published to Companies Act standard, and provisions
to prevent BT from discriminating in its network charges between its own
retail arm and other operators.
Mr Don Cruickshank, the new director-general of Oftel, said: 'Our aim is to
obtain the best possible deal for customers in terms of quality, choice and
value for money. Key to promoting competition are the terms and conditions
upon which operators can connect with BT's network.'
Although prepared to publish and justify tariffs for new entrants, BT
believes the proposed rules are too complex. It also objects to the reserve
powers Mr Cruickshank proposes to take to impose a settlement in cases of
disagreement.
BT said: 'As a matter of principle we are against the further extension of
Oftel's discretionary powers outlined in the document because they create
uncertainty and unpredictability for BT and competitors alike.'
BT also objects to the method to be used for determining charges for
competitors in areas - such as London - where for historic or regulatory
reasons BT's retail prices are out of line with its costs.
Mr Cruickshank yesterday appeared unwilling to back down on the principles
behind the proposals. 'BT protests too much,' he said, adding that the
existing regulatory regime was 'slightly short of what is needed to promote
efficient competition'.
Neither side believes the dispute will reach an impasse and require a
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. BT and other operators
have five weeks to comment on the plans.
The issue of inter-connection charges was originally a battle between BT and
Mercury, the Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary which now has about 8 per cent of
the UK telephone market. Since the government decided to end the UK's
telecoms duopoly two years ago, however, numerous new entrants have been
licensed, most of them requiring access to the BT network. BT has a near
monopoly of local telephone connections.
Mr Gordon Owen, chairman of Energis, the National Grid subsidiary which
recently gained a licence to erect a national telecoms network on its
electricity pylons, called for a published set of inter-connection tariffs,
with a right of appeal to Oftel in cases of perceived discrimination.

FT  09 JUN 93 / Law firm's advice to trustees raises doubt on pension rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION fund trustees defending a High Court action brought by the
Securities and Investments Board were advised by a leading law firm that it
was 'almost impossible to pursue a trustee for negligence when it comes to
investment'.
The advice raises questions about the effectiveness of the UK regulatory
framework for pensions, as the government-appointed Goode Committee prepares
its review of pensions law.
The advice, contained in a letter from Mr John Quarrell, a partner in the
West End firm of Nabarro Nathanson, to Melton Medes Pension Trustees,
related to a transaction that led to large losses for the pension fund.
The letter was written in September 1991 after seven employees of Melton
Medes, an unquoted Midlands-based conglomerate, had approached a leading QC
for advice. The letter said: 'You really have to have your fingers in the
till and it must be clearly shown that whilst they are in there they are
purloining large amounts of money, before anyone can bring a likely
successful action.'
Asked to comment on the advice, Melton Medes said questions should be
directed to solicitor DJ Freeman. Mr Marcus Rutherford, a partner in the
firm, said in the light of legal proceedings over the fund 'it would be
inappropriate to comment'.
The trustees had approved a loan of Pounds 4m from two pension funds in the
Melton Medes group to the parent company at uncommercial interest rates. The
loan was repaid in shares in two small quoted companies in which Melton
Medes and Mr Nathu Ram Puri, its chairman, had large stakes. The pension
funds suffered when both companies' share prices fell. The SIB's High Court
writ asks Mr Puri and the trustees for Pounds 691,681, plus interest, to be
restored to the pension funds, or such sum as the court sees fit.
Mr Puri and the pension fund trustees are also the subject of legal
proceedings in the High Court brought by seven employees. They have asked
the court to permit the release of funds from the pension scheme to finance
an action challenging the validity of the trust deeds.

FT  09 JUN 93 / EC seeks more troops for Bosnia peace force: Owen attacks US
over failure to offer ground support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community called yesterday for stronger UN peacekeeping forces
to defend 'safe areas' in Bosnia, including the recruitment of troops from
Moslem countries, Scandinavia and the former Soviet Union.
EC foreign ministers backed the recruitment plan in Luxembourg after Lord
Owen, the EC mediator, warned of a risk of Serbia and Croatia carving up
Bosnia and creating a new 'Palestine' in Europe for the Moslem population.
The move came as fighting in the region intensified, with Moslem forces
capturing the strategic city of Travnik. Heavy civilian casualties were
reported and 20 surrounding villages destroyed.
About 700 Croat soldiers from Travnik who surrendered to the Bosnian Serbs
have been interned in the notorious Manjaca prison camp, a former detention
centre for Moslems closed after an outcry in the west about its squalid
conditions.
EC ministers will present the initiative to Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, in Luxembourg today, amid thinly veiled disappointment
that the Clinton administration has only offered air cover.
The absence of US troops has cast doubts on the effectiveness of the
safe-area plan, and Lord Owen criticised the US decision to hold back. 'If
UN peacekeeping is to succeed, it is debilitating if the US, as the most
powerful country in Nato, is not prepared to put in ground forces.'
Nato is due to discuss the issue in Athens tomorrow. Today Mr Christopher is
expected to be questioned closely by the Europeans on whether the US intends
to contribute ground forces in the event of a political settlement as hoped
for in the Vance-Owen peace plan.
The drive to expand the UN peace-keeping force is to be led by Mr Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general. It marks a desperate effort to plug the
gaps in the peace-keeping force, which has been stretched to breaking point
by the recent upsurge in fighting.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, sought to remove doubts about the
effectiveness of safe areas. He said he was confident that new rules of
engagement could be quickly drawn up so that UN forces could defend
themselves under attack, if necessary by calling on US, UK or French air
power.
Mr Hurd added that 'safe areas' were not a magic solution to the conflict in
former Yugoslavia. 'They are only a temporary, first step aimed at keeping
people alive,' he said.
The original idea of appealing for a wider international force, including
the sensitive issue of Moslem troops, appears to have come from the UK and
France, the main contributors to the UN peace effort. Both say they are
unwilling at present to go beyond their contingent of 2,200 and 5,500 troops
respectively.
British and French officials listed at least half a dozen countries to be
solicited for troop contributions: Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, as well as
Morocco, Tunisia, Pakistan and unnamed Scandinavian countries. Turkey's
position remains questionable due to Greek sensitivities and the risk of a
wider Balkan war.
Estimates of how many troops will be required to defend the 'safe areas'
also varied between 5,000 and 30,000 troops, with the French and British
keen to avoid measures that might be either too provocative or risk sucking
their own troops into the conflict.
Lord Owen presented the putative international force as an 'east and west
European initiative' with the Nato alliance acting as a strategic planner,
first for defending the designated 'safe areas' and later for implementing
the Vance-Owen plan.

FT  09 JUN 93 / SFO asks Turkey for help to break Nadir deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, JOHN MURRAY BROWN, ANDREW JACK and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR officer of the Serious Fraud Office has flown to Turkey in an
effort to prevent Mr Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman, from
travelling from his home in northern Cyprus to the Turkish mainland.
Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO lawyer handling the Nadir case, was holding
meetings with senior officials in Turkey after flying secretly to Ankara on
Monday for a week-long mission to break the deadlock over the businessman,
who jumped his Pounds 3.5m bail on May 5.
News of this latest initiative came as Mr John Major, the prime minister,
admitted that Mr Michael Mates, the Northern Ireland security minister, had
committed a 'misjudgment' but not 'a hanging offence' in giving a watch to
Mr Nadir.
Although Mr Major denied that Mr Mates had acted improperly in raising Mr
Nadir's case with the attorney-general, the question mark over the
minister's judgment was reinforced by confirmation that Mr Richard Ryder,
the government chief whip, had refused to become involved after being
approached on behalf of Mr Nadir.
Speaking in Ankara, Ms Harris said the SFO was 'intent in pursuing all
legitimate means to make sure that Asil Nadir attends the trial he is due to
attend in September of this year'.
Mr John Goulden, the British ambassador in Turkey, confirmed that Ms Harris
had met Turkish authorities. He said it was part of a 'continuing process'
of co-operation on the case between Turkish and British officials.
This is believed to be the first time Ms Harris, the case controller of the
Polly Peck affair, has travelled to Turkey and underscores the growing
concern that Mr Nadir may try to travel there. UK officials believe that
might jeopardise efforts to encourage Mr Nadir to return to the UK to face
charges.
Contacted at his home in Lapta earlier this week, Mr Nadir restated his
intention to fly to Turkey 'very soon', to regain the remnants of his former
business empire.
Mr Nadir would be legally able to own and run businesses in Turkey, although
he is a bankrupt in the UK.
In recent days, Mr Nadir's Turkish lawyers have successfully prevented the
sale of his Gunaydin newspaper title and had a power of attorney given to
his administrators in bankruptcy revoked in the Turkish courts, thus
preventing efforts to dispose of Media Print, a company with assets worth
several million pounds.
Turkey's interior minister, Mr Ismet Sezgin, has said publicly that Mr Nadir
is free to travel to the mainland, although informally Turkish officials are
understood to have urged Mr Nadir not to travel to Turkey. Foreign minister
Hikmet Cetin reaffirmed Turkey's 'full co-operation' on the Nadir affair in
talks with UK officials at the end of May.
In the Commons yesterday Mr Major conceded that Mr Mates had been unwise to
give the fugitive businessman a watch with a supportive inscription.
Mr Major emphasisied that Mr Mates had no financial involvement with Mr
Nadir, his companies or advisers.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, attacked the prime minister over the way
in which both Mr Mates and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, had
raised Mr Nadir's case with the attorney-general.
He accused Mr Mates of undermining the work of the SFO, and described the
whole affair as 'shabby and unseemly'.
Labour is determined to exploit the Tories' discomfort in the current row.
It believes that the government has been hurt because of Mr Nadir's past
donations to the Conservative party.

FT  09 JUN 93 / SFO officer asks Ankara for help over Nadir case

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR officer of the Serious Fraud Office has flown to Turkey in an
effort to prevent Mr Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman from
travelling from his home in northern Cyprus to the Turkish mainland.
News of this latest initiative, undertaken without publicity by the SFO,
came as Mr John Major conceded that Mr Michael Mates, the Northern Island
security minister, had committed a 'misjudgment' in giving a watch to the
fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir, but not 'a hanging offence'.
Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO lawyer handling the Nadir case was holding meetings
with senior officials in Turkey after flying secretly to Ankara on Monday
for a week-long mission to break the deadlock over the fugitive businessman
who jumped his Pounds 3.5m bail on May 5.
Ms Harris, speaking from Ankara, would not comment on which Turkish
authorities she was seeing or what response she had met with so far. She
added: 'We are intent in pursuing all legitimate means to make sure that
Asil Nadir attends the trial he is due to attend in September of this year.'
However Mr John Goulden, the British Ambassador in Turkey, confirmed that Ms
Harris had met Turkish authorities. He said it was part of a 'continuing
process' of co-operation on the case between Turkish and British officials.
This is believed to be the first time Ms Harris, the case controller of the

the watch, and described the whole affair as 'shabby and unseemly'.
Mr Major emphasised that Mr Mates had no financial involvement with Mr
Nadir, his companies or advisers. The Department of Trade and Industry
yesterday responded to calls from MPs - including Mr Robin Cook, shadow
secretary trade and industry - that Mr Heseltine should start proceedings to
have Mr Nadir disqualified as a company director.
The DTI said: 'Mr Nadir is an undischarged bankrupt and as such his
disqualification from acting directly or indirectly in the management of a
company until he is discharged from bankruptcy is not considered necessary.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Heron banks reiterate stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS involved in the restructuring of Heron, the property and trading
group, yesterday reiterated their view that the proposals offered creditors
significantly more than they would achieve if the group was put into
receivership.
UBS, advisers to Heron, pointed to the report from Price Waterhouse, the
accountants, which said 'the restructuring is significantly better than
bankruptcy'.
They were responding to a document circulated by Mr Gary Klesch, a bond
dealer who claimed to represent 10 per cent of Heron's bondholders and said
his firm owns Ecu1m of bonds. Mr Klesch urged holders to vote against the
restructuring which is being presented to creditors at a series of meetings
beginning on June 28.
If the proposals are turned down Heron has said it would go into
receivership. The complex nature of the group, which includes some 300
companies and has debts of Pounds 1.7bn, would make insolvency proceedings
lengthy and costly.
Bondholders are creditors of the parent company which owns only 5 per cent
of the group's assets. They are relying on proceeds from asset sales by
subsidiaries being passed up to the head office company. However, each of
the companies in the group could have a different receiver or administrator.
Some investors bought bonds when the were trading at about 25-28 per cent of
face value, and have seen them fall to 15 per cent currently. It is thought
that these investors are disgruntled and are threatening to vote against the
restructuring in the hopes that Heron will improve terms to bondholders.
However, another banker involved in the deal said 'there is an absolutely
zero likelihood that they will improve the terms'.

Pickets gathered outside the Timex factory in Dundee yesterday to vent their
fury at workers entering the plant to do the work of those dismissed earlier
in the year. The company 'clarified' the terms on which it was willing to
re-hire sacked workers. It said they would face an average cut of less than
10 per cent, not 27 per cent as the pickets have claimed. The Scottish TUC
called for a boycott of the company's products

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: IEL sells undertaker business

<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL Equity (IEL), the Australian investment group, has sold Pine
Grove, Australia's biggest undertaker, for ADollars 102m (USDollars 69.3m).
The buyer is Service Corp, the US funeral company.
IEL, which is part of the Adsteam group, said the sale would yield a book
profit of about ADollars 25m, and the proceeds could be used for payments to
shareholders.
The purchase is the first outside North America by Service Corp, estimated
to be the world's largest funeral company. It will add about ADollars 47m to
its revenue. Pine Grove controls between 13 and 16 per cent of the
Australian funeral market.
Mr R. Waltrip, chairman of Service Corp, said the acquisition represented
the beginning of a truly global company. The deal is subject to Australia's
Foreign Investment Review Board.
IEL is also in the throes of selling its Woolworths supermarket chain, which
is the subject of a planned ADollars 2.45bn public flotation.
Westpac Banking, the big Australian bank, plans to sack 12 per cent of the
staff at its head office for New Zealand operations, Reuter reports from
Sydney. Westpac currently employs 700 people at the Wellington office.
The decision to make staff redundant follows a review of the bank's
operations by an independent consultant.
The review 'identified a number of activities and structures that are no
longer necessary for the current market environment and have been dispensed
with', the bank said.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Solvay warns of first-half
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOLVAY, the Belgian chemicals group, warned yesterday it would record a loss
for the first half of 1993, dragged down by overcapacity, recession and
alleged unfair competition in the European plastics sector.
Baron Daniel Janssen, Solvay's chief executive, told shareholders yesterday
that the group was getting 'a severe buffeting from the European storm'. He
said the plastics sector in particular would suffer 'heavy losses' in the
first six months, which would not be offset by earnings from the group's
other activities.
The outlook for the full year was 'not good', Baron Janssen added, although
there were 'some small signs of improvement' in the US, Britain and Brazil.
He said Solvay expected to to be able to maintain the same dividend policy
for 1993, that is, 'to increase our dividend whenever possible and, if
possible, not to decrease it'.
Solvay directors again urged the European Commission to take action against
cheap imports of soda ash and PVC from eastern Europe and the US. Solvay has
lodged formal requests with Brussels for protection against unfair
competition and Mr Yves Boel, the group chairman, told shareholders that
Solvay was 'disturbed by the Commission's relaxed attitude in the face of
such blameworthy practices'.
Net profits slipped by 13.5 per cent in the first half of last year to
BFr5.88bn (Dollars 176m) and in the full year profits fell from BFr11.7bn to
BFr9.76bn. Shareholders yesterday voted to maintain the 1992 dividend at
BFr500 a share, the same level as in 1990 and 1991.
The impact of recession - particularly in the principal activities of soda
ash and plastics - has forced the company to take drastic measures,
including the closure of its 129-year-old Belgian soda ash plant.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acal shows 13% rise to Pounds 3.15m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACAL, the USM-quoted electronics and industrial controls distributor,
finished the year ended March 31 1993 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.15m,
an increase of 13 per cent over the Pounds 2.78m of the previous year.
The growth was mainly the result of further improvement in the Netherlands,
the turnround in Acal Electronics in the UK, and the success in Belgium with
the acquisition of Betea Components, reported Mr John Curry, chairman. That,
together with Italy and currency benefits, accounted for an increase in
sales of 18 per cent to Pounds 68.9m (Pounds 58.5m).
Earnings per share came to 14.6p (14p). The final dividend is 4.2p for a
total of 6.3p (5.85p).

FT  08 JUN 93 / Abta barred from limiting compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX TRAVEL companies were yesterday granted a high court injunction
preventing the Association of British Travel Agents from limiting
compensation to customers of failed school trip operators.
The decision followed a two-day hearing last month during which Abta said
the failures of school ski trip operators threatened the association's
financial stability.
Last April, the association wrote to schools and education authorities
saying that if failed companies' bonds proved inadequate, Abta would only
refund deposits up to Pounds 25.
Deposits paid more than a year in advance would not be refunded. The balance
of payment would only be refunded if paid less than 10 weeks before
departure.
The six companies - Campus Centres, Equity, Ski Partners, Seasun Holidays,
Travelbound and STS Travel - asked the court to prevent Abta from limiting
compensation until a full hearing could take place.
The attempt to limit compensation is a departure from Abta's policy over the
last two decades of ensuring that none of its members' customers suffered
any loss.
Abta told the court that school operator failures in 1991 had brought the
organisation close to insolvency.
In the current year, school operator failures had resulted in claims of
Pounds 4.2m, of which the companies' bonds covered only Pounds 1.8m. The
remainder had to be met from the association's own insurance. School
operators represented 85 per cent of claims on the association's insurance.
Most of the holidaymakers who lost their money in the collapse of SFV
Holidays last month were Dutch, according to Kingsland Holidays of Plymouth,
which bought SFV's client list.
Mr Simon Law, a Kingsland director, said 130 Dutch and 40 British clients
stood to lose their holidays. A further 650 customers would be able to get
refunds as they booked by credit card. As each booking is for several
people, the number thought to have lost their money is 600. SFV was unbonded
and was not a member of any travel association.

<TEXT>
OSHAWA Group, one of Canada's top three food wholesalers and retailers, says
first quarter net profit rose 33 per cent to CDollars 7.6m (USDollars
5.98m), or 21 cents a share, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The upturn was due mostly to acquisitions completed in 1992. Sales for the
quarter increased 24 per cent to CDollars 1.27bn.
Oshawa expects improving results through the rest of this year as
acquisitions in western Canada and in Quebec are fully absorbed. These have
reduced reliance on the central Ontario market. The network now totals 900
corporate and franchised supermarkets nationally.
Oshawa earned CDollars 41.8m, or CDollars 1.14 a share, in 1992, up 19 per
cent, on a revenue gain of 8.5 per cent to CDollars 5.01bn. The company is
seeking more regional acquisitions.

<TEXT>
US TEXTILE and apparel importers have attacked as 'insanity' a new US quota
to limit the importing of wool suits from Macedonia to 80,000 a year,
cutting the present level by about one fifth, Nancy Dunne writes from
Washington.
The decision, by the government's Committee for the Implementation of
Textile Agreements, was 'another example of the business-as-usual attitude
pervading the US textile programme,' said Ms Laura Jones, executive director
of the US Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel.
'Is this Macedonia's reward for enforcing the UN's trade sanctions against
Serbia, its largest trading partner?' she asked.
The US has been gradually imposing textile and clothing quotas on most
eastern European economies, despite a stated US policy of helping their
development by increasing trade.

easy re-election victory which was also a defeat for the ruling ex-communist
party that dumped him as its candidate, Reuter reports from Ulan Bator.
Preliminary official results from the election on Sunday, Mongolia's first
direct presidential poll, showed Mr Ochirbat with a 20-point lead over his
challenger, Mr Lodongiyn Tudev, the conservative editor.
With about 60 per cent of the votes counted, Mr Ochirbat is leading with
58.3 per cent of the total, while Mr Tudev has 38.1. The remaining votes
were invalid. The results have been finalised in nine out of 18 provinces
and in the two biggest cities.
Unofficial tallies kept by the democratic coalition that backs the president
show Mr Ochirbat has won the third largest city and three other provinces by
large margins as well.
Mr Ochirbat's win will be a grave embarrassment for the Mongolian People's
Revolutionary party (MPRP), which controls the government and parliament.
The party, which ran Mongolia as a Soviet satellite for almost seven
decades, dumped Mr Ochirbat in favour of Mr Tudev in April.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Contest for Los Angeles mayor is too close to call
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES residents go to the polls today to choose a mayor in a tightly
fought contest.
Mr Michael Woo, a 41-year-old councillor and liberal Democrat who is the
grandson of Chinese immigrants, aims to become the first Asian American
mayor of a large US city. But he faces a close race against conservative
Republican Richard Riordan, 62, a political newcomer and millionaire
businessman.
The winner will replace Mr Tom Bradley, a Democratic liberal, and one of the
first black mayors in the US, who is retiring after 20 years in office.
Mr Woo has won broad support from Los Angeles' large immigrant community.
His campaign has focused on South Central Los Angeles, the backdrop for last
year's riots which were sparked by the acquittal of four policemen accused
of assaulting a black motorist, Mr Rodney King.
In contrast, Mr Riordan appeals to more affluent suburban voters; one of his
last campaign stops was in a San Fernando Valley park where a two-year-old
was fatally shot during a gang-related incident on Easter Sunday.
Mr Woo, who is well known in the city as a councillor, was an early
favourite in the mayoral race. However, Mr Riordan, with superior financial
resources has quickly gained recognition. The state Democratic party,
alarmed by Mr Riordan's rise in the polls, persuaded President Bill Clinton
to make the unusual move of endorsing Mr Woo.
Mr Riordan, who says the top three campaign themes are 'safety, safety,
safety,' has pledged to put 3,000 more police officers on the streets with a
plan financed in part by leasing the city-owned Los Angeles International
Airport to a private group.
Mr Woo's public safety plan is less ambitious. He promises to increase
gradually the number of police with money cut from budgets of the mayor and
City Council and from other city departments. He is also supporting a city
ban on cheap handguns, known as Saturday Night Specials.
He has won the endorsement of the Los Angeles Times, the city's leading
newspaper. It said of him: 'In a city with a hundred different voices
straining to be heard - in a city with a lot of conflict and much too much
bad feeling - he is the better listener, and so the better conciliator. And
in this fragmented city, it is the better conciliator who'll get results.'
Whoever wins, he is expected quickly to become a leading figure in state and
national politics as mayor of the second largest US city, which has become
the focus of broad debate on the issues of immigration, racial tension and
inner-city decay.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Kohl defends absence from funeral of Turks
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, yesterday defended his decision not
to attend the funeral last week of five Turkish victims of an arson attack,
saying his presence would simply have provoked the crowd.
In the face of widespread criticism for his decision to stay away - when
federal President Richard von Weizsacker and Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign
minister, both attended - the chancellor insisted: 'I know how to behave.'
He told a television interviewer that his presence would have attracted boos
and whistles from the crowds attending the funeral in Cologne of the two
Turkish women and three girls who died. 'That would have been taken as proof
that I was provoking a Turkish or a German reaction,' he said. 'I know what
(television) pictures get sent round the world. So that is why I know how to
behave.'
He blamed the latest upsurge in racist attacks not on the existence of a
large Turkish migrant worker population, but on the failure to tackle the
problem of 'economic asylum seekers' flooding into the country. Turks and
Germans had lived together for years with scarcely any racial problems.
His interview was broadcast after the federal prosecutor's office had
confirmed that one of the four men charged with the latest murders was the
member of an extreme right-wing political party.
The man, named only as 23-year-old Markus G, had a membership card for the
nationalist German People's Union (DVU), a legal political group which has
won seats in local elections in north Germany. In spite of the discovery,
the prosecutor still believes there was no formal right-wing conspiracy
behind the arson attack in the town of Solingen, north-east of Cologne.
The deaths have sparked a new wave of national protests at the failure of
the authorities to curb extreme right-wing groups, and demands for the
introduction of more liberal nationality laws for Turkish and other
long-term residents. The liberal Free Democrats, junior partners in Mr
Kohl's ruling coalition, yesterday called for dual nationality to be granted
to such applicants.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KLAUS ZWICKEL was yesterday nominated to succeed Mr Franz Steinkuhler as
president of IG Metall, the German engineering union.
His selection, made by the union's directorate, was widely expected and
followed Mr Steinkuhler's resignation two weeks ago after allegations of
insider share trading.
Mr Zwickel, formerly deputy president, is acknowledged as a tough negotiator
but said to lack the political skills of his predecessor.
He takes over Germany's biggest and most influential union at a time of
mounting tension. Mr Hans Peter Stihl, head of the federal chamber of trade
and industry, last weekend demanded a pay freeze lasting several years.
Other challenges facing the union include employers' demands for an end to
the steady reduction in working hours and a return to weekend working.
Mr Zwickel's nomination and that of Mr Walter Riester, the Stuttgart
regional leader, as his deputy, are expected to be confirmed at a union
assembly in October.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dockyard row set to erupt again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL row over the Rosyth and Devonport dockyards threatened to
erupt again last night as it emerged that Mr John Major will today meet Tory
MPs from south-west England who want Devonport to refit Britain's nuclear
submarine fleet, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, demanded that he
should also be able to see the prime minister to put the case for Rosyth, in
his Dunfermline east constituency, to win the Ministry of Defence contract.
Mr Bill Walker, Tory MP for Tayside North, also said he wanted to meet Mr
Major and said Rosyth would prove cheaper. However, south-west Tories are
confident the arguement is going their way.
MPs believe an announcement - which could cause more divisions in
Conservative ranks - is imminent, although Whitehall officials played down
suggestions that cabinet would reach a decision as early as this Thursday.
The government has said both Royal dockyards will be kept open.

FT  08 JUN 93 / BA says Pounds 9m offer was off agenda
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS' original offer of Pounds 9m to end the 'dirty tricks'
dispute with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group was off the table in the
latest round of attempted mediation, Mr Robert Ayling, group managing
director of British Airways, said last night.
He said after the collapse of the mediation attempt by Sir Christopher
Chataway, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, that he believed the
dispute with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic could be resolved
amicably. BA was was still prepared to resolve its dispute with Virgin, 'but
not at any price'.
'I don't fear the issue being resolved through the courts but it is in the
interest of both parties to try to resolve it amicably,' he said.
He confirmed that Mr Chataway had visited Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman,
three weeks ago and had offered to act as honest broker to try to resolve
the dispute.
Sir Colin had made clear from the outset that BA's original Pounds 9m
compensation offer made last March was off the table, Mr Ayling said.
'Christopher managed to bring us together on some points that have separated
us,' Mr Ayling said, adding that all the discussions were conducted through
Mr Chataway with Sir Colin and Mr Branson having no direct meeting.
The original Pounds 9m compensation offer made by BA last March collapsed
because Virgin rejected what it regarded was an unacceptable 'gagging
clause' demanded by BA to settle the 'dirty tricks' dispute.
In the latest negotiations the gagging clause was changed in what Mr Ayling
described as 'an intelligent way'. It was dropped for a 'gentleman's
agreement' on the part of Mr Branson not to rake up the events of the past.
The reason why BA decided to withdraw its original Pounds 9m offer was that
Pounds 5m of that amount involved a long-standing aircraft maintenance
dispute between the two airlines which was already under arbitration.
Since then, the arbitration process had made some headway and BA felt the
engineering dispute should now be left to arbitration.
But Mr Ayling claimed Virgin made clear at the end of last week that it was
Pounds 9m or nothing.

FT  08 JUN 93 / World Trade News: White House takes softer line on Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS in the Clinton administration yesterday promised that the US would
not retaliate if Tokyo failed to meet numerical goals which the two sides
negotiate to remedy trade imbalances.
The softer tone from the US, which has often won trade agreements by
retaliation or threats, was contained in a proposal on a trade negotiating
framework, which will be discussed in Washington on Friday. The proposal was
delivered to Japan's ambassador in the capital.
Tokyo has insisted it will not be dragged into any agreement smacking of
'managed trade' which establishes numerical targets.
Senior US officials still say it is necessary to monitor progress through a
series of multiple indicators in order to get 'genuine objective gauges' of
progress and to measure the need for 'a mid-course correction'.
'Clearly we are looking for results,' an official said. 'It is difficult to
look for results in the abstract.' But there will be 'no retaliatory trigger
contained in the proposal'.
The US proposal calls for negotiations on a series of 'baskets' into which
various trade disputes will be divided. It also wants to set a range for a
reduction of Japan's current account surplus, something in the order of 2
per cent of GNP.
In exchange for Japanese agreement the US would commit itself to following
through on plans to halve the trade deficit over the next four years and
keep US markets open. The latter is a substantial offer, considering the
political pressure on the administration to act against Japan on a wide
range of disputes.
'We hope we can move the relationship forward without the need for bluster
and threats and retaliation and without the need for unprincipled gimmickry,
like requests for the Japanese to limit their auto exports, of the kind the
Europeans have engaged in recently,' one official said.
In line with demands from Tokyo the US will propose a number of policies the
Japanese government alone can undertake without requiring its private sector
to meet specified goals.
'Our goal is to expand trade, not to manage trade,' an official said.
However, Japan must recognise its economic relations are 'far from
international norms' both in its high surplus and its low level of import
penetration.
'We want to see significant progress in three to four years,' he added.
Negotiations are expected to be completed swiftly, with the results
announced at the Tokyo summit in July.

Denmark, which holds the presidency of the EC, hoped an EC-Russia deal could
be initialled at the Copenhagen summit in two weeks and is finalising
arrangements for the visit of Mr Yeltsin, which should begin on June 19,
Andrew Hill writes from Brussels.
But the Commission believes it would be unwise to rush into an agreement for
political reasons before important problems of substance have been resolved.
EC foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg today, will have to decide
whether enough progress has been made to issue a political declaration of
EC-Russian solidarity at Copenhagen, and make Mr Yeltsin's trip worthwhile.

GRUPO Radio Centro, a leading Mexican radio broadcaster, is set to issue
Dollars 65m of stock in Mexican and US markets in an initial public
offering.
The company is the largest radio broadcaster in Mexico City, with nine
stations, and the owners, the Aguirre family, are believed to be interested
in buying up two state-owned television companies due for privatisation.
The equity issue would make Radio Centro the sixth Mexican company to be
quoted on the New York Stock Exchange.
The prospectus says proceeds will be used to pay off debt and finance
potential acquisitions, although it says no such negotiations are currently
pending.
Radio Centro earned revenues last year of Dollars 47.6m, with profits of
Dollars 12.8m. Operations have been squeezed recently by a slowdown in
advertising, reflecting the weak state of the Mexican economy.
Next month the Mexican government is expected to announce the winning bidder
for two television networks, a film studio and theatre chain.
The equity offering is being lead managed by Bear Stearns in the US, and
Bursamex in Mexico.

CONTROL OF Canada's second largest food distributor, the Montreal-based
Univa, with sales of more than CDollars 5bn (USDollars 3.9bn), is again in
play.
E. M. Warburg Pincus, the New York investment group, has dropped its offer
to buy 26 per cent of Univa from Montreal entrepreneur Bertin Nadeau's
Unigesco. The price was to have been CDollars 8.85 a share or about CDollars
200m. This would have allowed Unigesco to repay debt due in the next year.
Unigesco said it has begun negotiations to sell its Univa holding with
unidentified Quebec institutions.
The second biggest holder of Univa is the Sobey family of Novia Scotia with
25 per cent. However this block is potentially for sale.
The next biggest holder is the Caisse de Depot, Quebec's CDollars 42bn
public pension fund, with 13.5 per cent. The Caisse has already indicated it
wants to keep effective control of Univa in Quebec.
Earlier this year the Caisse opposed a CDollars 11 a share bid from New York
investment bankers Blackstone Group for all Univa shares totalling about
CDollars 1bn.

FOLLOWING on the heels of the Brilliance China Automotive minibus
manufacturer, Ek Chor China Motorcycle yesterday said it would become the
second Chinese company to offer its shares to US investors and seek a
listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ek Chor is a Bermuda-based holding company that, in joint ventures with
several foreign companies, operates four motorcycle and automotive parts
manufacturers in mainland China.
Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house lead-managing the issue, said
Ek Chor has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue 4.4m
shares of common stock at between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 a share.
The 4.4m shares sold to US investors will represent 28 per cent of the
company - the rest will remain in the hands of Ek Chor's main shareholder,
CP Pokphand, a subsidiary of CP Group, the Asian agri-industrial
conglomerate.
Bear Stearns also said that application has been made to have Ek Chor's
shares listed on the NYSE. Last year Brilliance China became the first
Chinese company to list its stock on the NYSE, the world's biggest equity
market. Shares in Pokphand, Ek Chor's parent, are also listed on the NYSE.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Big 6 experience black year

<TEXT>
FIVE of the UK's 'Big 6' accounting firms suffered a fall in fee income last
year, according to figures released yesterday.
Only Andersen - comprising Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting - managed
to increase its income, which jumped by 17.5 per cent to Pounds 388.6m in
the year to March 31.
That caused the firm to rise from sixth to fourth in terms of fee income,
just Pounds 2m behind Ernst &amp; Young. Price Waterhouse fell from third to
fifth and Touche Ross became the smallest of the Big 6.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand remained the largest, but also reported the biggest
decline, down 4.2 per cent to Pounds 553m in the year to May 1. In 1991-92
it was the only one of the Big 6 to report a decline.
Total fee income generated by the firms rose by just Pounds 2.5m to nearly
Pounds 2.6bn. The number of partners across the firms fell by 1.4 per cent
to 2,797 and the number of other professional staff by 6.4 per cent to
29,601.
Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner at Price Waterhouse, said: 'It has been a
very hard, lousy grind. The recession has had an impact on our clients which
reflects directly on us.'
Audit, tax and consulting services performed least well across most of the
firms, generally offset by rises from insolvency and corporate
reconstruction work.
Mr Roy Chapman, senior partner at Arthur Andersen, said: 'It pays to be
modest, but I can't really disguise my pleasure. We are pleased but not
surprised. We have followed a reasonably clear strategy, with the right type
of people pursuing the right sort of client.'
The figures in the table have been compiled by the firms with year-ends
adjusted to make the data comparable.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (26): Casa given a capital tonic - Spain
/ Tom Burns on the fortunes of the state-owned group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASA, Spain's state-owned aerospace group, echoes the sector worldwide in
saying the industry is going through its bleakest period for a long time but
at least it has something to smile about.
In February the Instituto Nacional de Industria, the state holding company
which owns Casa, or to give it its full name, Construcciones Aeronauticas,
finally agreed to a Pta42.3bn (Dollars 352m) capital increase. For several
years fresh capital had been a priority and its arrival gives the balance
sheet strength the company had formerly lacked.
Last month a second boost, every bit as important, materialised when the
industry ministry unveiled a Pta120.1bn investment plan, spread over six
years, for the domestic aerospace sector. This has the approval of the
European Community which has undertaken to supply favourable credit lines.
Two-thirds of the plan is targeted at two of Casa's biggest undertakings:
the Airbus programme and development of a fast turboprop passenger aircraft,
the Casa 3000.
The industry ministry's decision to back the aircraft came just a few weeks
after Casa had determined to proceed with its design and building. The
group's commitment came after nine months of exhaustive feasibility studies
with prospective customers and operators. These identified what Casa
believes is a niche in the market.
With a cruising speed of 350 knots at altitudes up to 31,000 feet, the Casa
3000 will have a range of more than 1,000 nautical miles with a full payload
of 70-78 passengers. Designed for the regional air transport market, it will
be built over the next four years and the company believes it will prove the
most economical replacement for small jets operating low-density routes.
Casa says it will provide block times similar to jets, at a spectacularly
low operational cost. However, the big selling point is that it provides jet
comfort at turpoprop costs in both hub-and-spoke and point-to-point
operations.
The aircraft's combination of speed and short turnaround time ensures,
according to Casa, a high operational flexibility and marked improvement in
productivity over conventional and slower turboprops.
Casa has nailed its colours to the inter-regional traffic mast. That is a
sector it knows well through its existing aircraft, the C-212 and the CN-235
and in which it has built up further expertise through co-operation in the
Saab 2000 programme.
Like Saab and other aerospace companies, Casa has made projections for the
growth of inter-regional traffic. It foresees European traffic growing at a
rate of 4.9 per cent between the years 2000 and 2009, an increase of 6.9 per
cent over the same period in Asia and the Pacific region and only slightly
less in the American market.
The Casa 3000 programme could not have come at a better time for the
company. In recent months it has been in turmoil over the debate on the
future of the Airbus consortium and European Fighter Aircraft (EFA)
programme.
A founder member of both multinational projects, Casa has placed a lot of
importance on their continued progress. The company's space division may
well have further cause for gloom if cuts and cancellations are implemented
as a result of reassessment of the European Space Agency, particularly the
future of the Columbus and Hermes programmes.
Casa's maintenance division, a money-spinner for years, has also been
hard-hit. Spain's defence ministry has scaled back its requirements because
of big budget cuts and, worse still in psychological and income terms, the
US Air Force has ended a maintenance contract that Casa had for F15 combat
planes since the 1960s.
Despite these difficulties, the group had a reasonable financial year in
1992. In part, that was due to an increase in sales from Pta87.4bn to
Pta91.8bn. Casa was also able marginally to reduce its labour force and
annual income per employee rose from Pta9.9m in 1991 to Pta10.7m last year.
In 1991-1992 some 300 jobs were shed from the total of 9,338 and the company
is now in the process of losing 450 through voluntary early retirement. This
second round of lay-offs is likely to be followed by a third but it is an
expensive business, adding Pta3.3bn to extraordinary costs this year.
To a far greater extent, however, the 1992 results benefited from a 46 per
cent drop in financial costs to Pta7.3bn. As a result, Casa reduced 1991
losses of Pta6.9bn to Pta3.5bn last year.
This year, after seven years in the red, the group hopes to break even. The
improved balance sheet after the capital increase will no doubt help to
bring that objective within reach. The company is also set to benefit from
successive devaluations of the peseta. The dollar, responsible for about 80
per cent of business, has revalued by about 20 per cent against the domestic
currency in the past year.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (1): The worst may be over - Defence
cuts and the slump in civil aviation have inflicted a severe downturn on the
industry over the past two years. Now there are signs of slow recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent

<TEXT>
The aerospace industry would probably have preferred to gather in Lourdes
rather than Paris this week for the world's biggest airshow.
Barring a miracle, the industry, crippled by the worst cyclical downturn in
its postwar history, still faces a few more years of heavy turbulence.
But there are now signs that the worst is perhaps over. With the recent
rescue by General Electric of the US of GPA, the world's biggest aircraft
leasing company, which has been mired in a growing financial crisis over the
past 12 months, the industry believes it has probably seen the end of the
bad news.
'The entire industry has undergone open heart surgery and is now in
intensive care waiting to recover slowly,' says a senior executive of the
European Airbus consortium.
Aerospace companies and airlines have had to adapt to three years of brutal
recession - which unlike previous slumps has combined a sharp fall in
activity in both the civil and the military sides of the business - by
cutting production, restructuring and reducing staff on a huge scale, and
intensifying their efforts to collaborate with other groups in mergers,
partnerships and other strategic alliances.
The traditional optimism of the industry has been replaced by a new sense of
realism. Although the bottom has probably been reached in the current cycle,
no one is yet prepared to forecast when the recovery will gather steam. The
best estimates are late 1994 or early 1995. But even when the market does
pick up again, it is unlikely to roar ahead as in previous cycles.
Airlines, which have lost more than Dollars 10bn in the past three years,
are still struggling to return to the black. Fierce fare wars, which reflect
the continuing overcapacity in the market at a time of increasing
liberalisation, will keep airline balance sheets under pressure.
With no alternative but to reduce their overall costs, airlines have had to
cancel or defer orders for new aircraft placed during the unprecedented
buying binge of the late 1980s. In turn, manufacturers have had to
accommodate these cancellations and deferrals by cutting production sharply.
Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufac- turer, is reducing
production by as much as a third from 32 to 21 airliners a month by 1994.
Both Airbus and McDonnell Douglas have also been cutting output. Total
deliveries of new airliners are now expected to drop to around 500 aircraft
a year from a peak of 844 in 1991 and 790 last year.
The ripple effect has been felt throughout the industry as suppliers and
subcontractors, as well as manufacturers of smaller commuter and regional
aircraft and aero-engine makers, have had to bite the bullet.
Growth in air traffic is at last improving again and showing a real increase
over 1990, the year before the Gulf conflict. This coupled with economic
recession, sent traffic falling in 1991 for the first time since annual
records started to be kept in 1929.
But the growth has remained far lower than airlines had expected, leading to
overcapacity throughout the industry. The restructurings, expenditure cuts,
and aircraft order cancellations and deferrals are likely to start bringing
capacity back to balance with travel demand by the end of this year.
The retirement rate of older jets is also expected to bolster demand for new
aircraft. Already, about 1,000 aircraft in the world airline fleet are 25
years old - the average life cycle of modern jets. The number is likely to
rise to around 2,500 by the beginning of 1995.
A robust recovery in the rate of new aircraft orders, in the short-term is
unlikely, however, even though the industry continues to expect strong
long-term demand for new aircraft, with deliveries worth more than Dollars
800bn forecast over the next 18 years.
Until airline finances improve, the industry will face the challenge of
financing the high cost of new equipment and aircraft. Most of the recent
cost-cutting measures, according to Moody's, the US rating agency, will only
partially offset the industry's weak financial position.
'We don't know what kind of airline industry will emerge from this
recession, which has already taken some large airlines out of the game,'
says Sir Ralph Robins, the chairman of Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine
manufacturer. He expects little improvement in underlying trading conditions
over the next two years.
Manufacturers have also had to maintain a high rate of research and
development spending on new products with long lead times in order to secure
their longer-term future. With non-recurring research and development costs
growing far more rapidly than inflation, manufacturers in all sectors of the
civil aerospace industry, including airframes, aero-engines and components,
have been scrambling to forge partnerships or, in some cases, combine their
operations in mergers to reduce the high risks of new project development
and to compete more strongly in an increasingly global and concentrated
industry.
Deutsche Aerospace has just taken over control of Fokker, the Dutch aircraft
manufacturer, while McDonnell Douglas is seeking investors to acquire up to
49 per cent of its commercial aircraft activities based in Long Beach,
California. Bombardier of Canada has absorbed Shorts, the Belfast
manufacturer, Learjet, the US corporate aircraft maker, and De Havilland of
Canada. British Aerospace has formed a joint company with Taiwan Aerospace
for its regional jet business and is now looking for partners to invest in
its turbopropeller aircraft activities.
A similar trend of consolidation is now spreading through the defence
sector. Since the end of the cold war, the defence market has been shrinking
as governments have cut their defence spending and reduced the number of new
programmes.
The decline is expected to last several more years. By the turn of the
century, the defence business could be half what it was in the 1980s. The
consolidation of the industry has seen some companies opting to pull out of
some businesses, while others have either sought to merge their activities
with partners or expand by acquiring the defence businesses of rival
companies.
In the guided weapons sector, for example, the cold war spawned more
companies in Europe and in the US making missiles or systems for missiles
than could survive in an age of diminishing government defence budgets. This
has led to a significant shake-up in the US with Loral's takeover of the
former LTV group's guided weapons activities and the sale of General
Dynamics' missiles division to Hughes Aircraft, part of General Motors. In
Europe, British Aerospace is now considering the merger of its missiles
business with those of the French Matra group, while other European
manufacturers are also in active merger discussions.
'A process of natural selection is now taking place in the defence sector,'
says Mr Keith Hodgkinson, aerospace analyst at Shearson Lehman. As the
number of big new defence contracts declines, every deal has turned into a
matter of 'life and death' for many companies, he explains.
Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that trade tensions have
continued to simmer on both sides of the Atlantic. Several US companies have
decided not to exhibit at Paris because they claim French companies have
used air shows to spy on them, a charge rejected with derision by France's
aerospace industry.
Although the US has finally reached a compromise with the European
Commission on the long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies, accusations
have continued to fly between Washington and Brussels over unfair government
support for their respective industries.
And while Airbus partners have agreed this year to collaborate with Boeing
on joint studies to develop a new generation super jumbo, capable of seating
up to 800 passengers, and marking what could perhaps be the beginning of a
new realignment in the world aircraft industry, an atmosphere of suspicion
and mutual distrust continues to prevail.
This was eloquently reflected by the response of a senior Airbus executive
to suggestions that the Europeans had attempted to spy on Boeing to gain
information on its 747-400 jumbo. 'It's as if the famous French chef, Paul
Bocuse, was caught spying at McDonald's to steal their cooking secrets,' he
said.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (29): Weapons guided to mergers -
Restructuring in the US and Europe creates new giants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON BOTH sides of the Atlantic, the guided weapons industry is in mutation.
The announcement that British Aerospace and Matra of France have been
negotiating a missile merger is expected to spur wider restructuring of the
sector in Europe, based on one or two major groupings.
In the US, further consolidation is also expected after the purchase of
General Dynamics' missile interests - including such familiar products as
the Stinger ground-to-air weapon and the Tomahawk sea-launched cruise
missile - by General Motors' Hughes subsidiary last year.
The takeover has created a second giant in the US and world league alongside
Raytheon, producer of the Patriot missile which became a household word in
the 1991 Gulf war. Also in the last year, Loral took over LTV's missile
business after acquiring Ford Aerospace in 1990.
The number of competitors is likely to be further reduced in a climate of
tighter defence budgets.
However, Mr Dan Tellep, chairman and chief executive of Lockheed, maker of
the Trident nuclear missile, warns: 'Size, of itself, is not a guarantee of
success.' He believes companies can still survive in niche markets.
The BAe-Matra plan took shape after BAe abandoned efforts to forge a missile
merger with Thomson-CSF, the French electronics company, in 1991.
The joint venture plan, expected to be completed early next year, will
create a company with annual sales of more than Pounds 1bn. This would be
several times more than any other European company in the field, and if
others were brought into the project could surpass the leading US
manufacturers in missile sales.
The door has been left open to Aerospatiale, now due for privatisation, and
Deutsche Aerospace, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary. These two have already been
talking about deepening their 20-year association in Euromissile, the joint
venture responsible for the Milan anti-tank weapon and the Roland
ground-to-air system.
The question remains, however, of where Thomson-CSF would fit in the French
scheme of things. The announcement of Matra's plans with BAe came shortly
after Thomson-CSF linked forces with Short Brothers in very short range air
defence weapons. This was a direct challenge to Matra.
A further question concerns GEC-Marconi, traditional supplier of guidance
systems for UK missiles. It was at one stage thought likely it might absorb
BAe's Dynamics division. However the latter's sagging fortunes took a turn
for the better last year, particularly when it won the UK contract for a
short-range air-to-air missile - ASRAAM - against a rival project by
GEC-Marconi and Matra.
Matra and BAe hope to strengthen their presence on world markets with
largely complementary product lines. The main area in which their products
overlap is medium-range air-to-air missiles. But the two could combine
efforts in this sector to field an alternative to Hughes' AMRAAM to equip
the Eurofighter 2000. BAe is already working with Saab of Sweden on a new
generation missile in this category, and has been looking at using a
Thomson-CSF seeker.
BAe could also back up Matra's bid to sell its Apache air-to-ground weapon
to the UK. Competitors are likely to include Hughes, with a version of the
Tomahawk, McDonnell Douglas, Aerospatiale and GEC-Marconi with a weapon that
Abu Dhabi has so far paid to develop. BAe does not have its own product to
enter into the competition.
Two other major UK projects are potential victims of the government's
current budget review. A new air defence programme to replace the obsolete
Bloodhound missile may be cancelled or staggered, and a Pounds 3bn nuclear
missile plan for the RAF could well be abandoned. In this climate, companies
are counting to a greater extent than ever before on overseas markets.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (28): Eurofighter goes ahead - David
White on the advantages of collaboration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROFIGHTER will have taken at least 15 years to come into service from
the time Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy agreed in 1985 on the basic
characteristics of a joint aircraft.
The most broadly based collaborative fighter project ever attempted in
Europe, it will have been through several changes of identity in the
process.
The European Fighter Aircraft programme was relaunched last December,
briefly as the New EFA and then as the Eurofighter 2000, but the partners
are still looking for a more inspired name. The rechristening was mainly a
way of enabling Mr Volker Ruhe, Germany's defence minister, to save face
after campaigning to stop the Pounds 32bn project and replace it with a
cheaper and less sophisticated aircraft.
Although revised and subjected to a cost overhaul, the fighter is
essentially the same that aerospace companies in the four nations have been
developing for the past six years, with allowance for different versions to
take into account the partners' different visions of what they want the
aircraft to do.
Details of the changed programme have taken longer than expected to sort
out. The December agreement in Brussels, in which Germany in effect rejoined
the project, was heavily publicised. But when junior ministers met in Bonn
in April to agree on the new programme outlines, the event went unannounced.
Although new military requirements are now set and a new schedule is in
place - leaving production decisions until after the next German elections
in 1994 - many questions have still to be resolved.
These include Germany's share in production. It has so far taken 33 per cent
of development work, based on an original expectation that it would buy 250
of the aircraft. The current working assumption is that it will buy 140.
Together, the number due to be produced for the four partners has shrunk to
about 600 from the initial figure of 765.
New memorandums of understanding and industrial contracts have still to be
signed. Further problems could emerge if, for instance, Germany decides to
instal a cheaper radar of its own choice, instead of the GEC Ferranti-led
ECR90, which is half-way through development, industry experts say the
implications of having to integrate two different radars into the aircraft
'could be horrendous'.
Technical problems, including the generator and the flight control system,
have already caused serious delays. The first prototype, assembled in
Germany, is not due to fly until September at the earliest  - two years
late.
Last year's crisis over German participation blew up after the industrial
consortium, Eurofighter, submitted its price quotation for the production
phase. In their review of the programme, the partners identified potential
savings of between 12 and 23 per cent on the cost of producing the aircraft
and setting up logistic support. Nevertheless, costs are substantially
higher than originally expected.
The UK has confirmed that its estimated total share of the programme stands
at Pounds 13bn at today's prices compared to the 'Pounds 6bn to Pounds 7bn'
stated by the government in 1988, a difference which can be partly but not
wholly attributed to inflation.
The Ministry of Defence says that its projected cost in 1987 was in fact
Pounds 7.8bn and that it was then planning, unbeknown to anyone, to buy 200
aircraft rather than the officially-declared 250. It has now reaffirmed its
intention to buy 250. Allowing for this difference and inflation, it says,
the cost overrun is Pounds 1.1bn. Programme managers add that these
estimates are no more than an indication, in the absence of any production
contracts.
However, the cost of development has also increased in real terms, despite a
regime of fixed, inflation-adjustable prices. The UK share, 33 per cent of
the total, was stated in 1988 as Pounds 1.7bn. It is now put by British
Aerospace, the UK partner in Eurofighter, at roughly double that figure.
One example of how prices can escalate is the flight control system, where
costs are reckoned to have gone up 60 per cent because of contract changes.
The system comes under the overall charge of Deutsche Aerospace, the German
Eurofighter partner. GEC-Marconi of the UK, responsible for the critical
software input, found that the processing power provided for was inadequate.
Some of the functions of the system are due to be dropped to enable the
first flight to place and to be incorporated at a later stage.
Development costs will also rise as a result of the rescheduling of the
programme, with the first aircraft not due to enter service with the British
and Italian air forces until 2000, two years later than previously
envisaged, and the Germans and Spanish not scheduled to take delivery of
theirs before 2002.
The partner governments have accepted in principle that terms should be
revised upwards for Eurojet, the engine grouping of Rolls-Royce, Fiat, MTU
of Germany and ITP of Spain, recognising that the consortium will now have
to support a longer test programme.
Eurofighter, responsible for the aircraft itself, is held to be in a
different position since it is behind schedule on the programme. But it has
also sought an increase, with Mr John Vincent, its managing director,
insisting that 'if you are going to stretch a given programme, it is going
to cost you money.'
On the German side, it has not been clear where payment for the current
development work will come from. The funding requirement for this year,
including outstanding bills left from last year, was about DM1bn, but barely
half of this has been forthcoming. The expected outcome is that Dasa itself
will provide the interim finance, since the other partner countries were not
ready to bridge the gap.
Hopes that some had vested in the project as the foundation of a new
European military aircraft venture have been set back by the arguments of
the last 12 months. Dasa has actively promoted the idea, hoping to draw the
French into a Europe-wide enterprise. 'As a vision we really see it,' says
Mr Harmut Mehdorn, new head of Dasa's aircraft group.
The first step was to be a merger between the programme's administration and
that of its European forerunner, the Anglo-German-Italian Tornado. This
involves joining Eurofighter with the Tornado company Panavia and fusing the
two intergovernmental management agencies, known respectively as NEFMA and
NAMMA.
A merger was to take place last year, but Mr Vincent says he advised
delaying it when the political difficulties surrounding Germany's
participation in Eurofighter erupted.
For all the problems and tensions, however, the partners are firmly
committed to the programme. Even before it takes off, Eurofighter provides a
clear demonstration of at least one advantage of collaborative projects:
that they are extremely resistant to attempts to kill them off.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (27): JAS: real test is yet to come -
Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A troubled development phase, the military side of Sweden's aerospace
industry can at last boast a few successes. In April the JAS 39 Gripen
multi-purpose fighter aircraft successfully undertook its 1,000th test
flight, and this month the first aircraft is scheduled to be delivered to
the Swedish air force, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
For a programme that has fallen a year behind schedule and run well over
cost estimates - and that at times looked as if it might collapse completely
 -these are tangible achievements. But the JAS needs to make a breakthrough
into the export market to ensure commercial success, and so the real test is
still to come. There was acute disappointment when the Finnish government
opted last year to buy 57 new F18s from the US group McDonnell Douglas,
rather than the JAS.
For the moment, the programme is underpinned by a healthy order book from
Sweden's air force, with the final delivery not due until 2001. An initial
order for 30 aircraft was supplemented last year by one for a further 110,
which did much to cushion the blow of the lost Finnish order.
These domestic orders have provided the consortium manufacturing the JAS -
Saab-Scania, Volvo Flygmotor, Ericsson Radar Electronics and FFV Aerotech
(part of the Celsius defence group which is currently being privatised) -
with a good platform from which to launch their drive for further business,
both at home and abroad.
The manufacturers are hoping for further orders from the Swedish air force -
possibly for as many as 150 aircraft - after parliament decided last year to
maintain a fleet of 16 combat squadrons to meet the country's future defence
needs.
Further, they project a worldwide replacement need of 3,000 military
aircraft in the next 10-20 years (even allowing for reduced defence
expenditure), with a possible market for the JAS of half that total. The aim
is to capture orders for a third of the possible market - or 500 aircraft.
This is an ambitious target and the JAS partners accept that they are
unlikely to achieve it on their own. Hence far more emphasis is being placed
on co-operation with foreign partners, specifically other aerospace groups
in the US and Europe. In Europe, discussions have taken place with British
Aerospace, Dassault of France and Germany's Dasa, although no concrete
proposals have yet emerged.
If nothing else, these talks are a recognition of the fact that Sweden, with
a population of just 8m, is going to find it difficult to maintain a viable
aerospace industry on its own, for all its undoubted high technology
expertise. The same thinking lies behind the government's decision to
privatise the defence group Celsius where it is specifically hoped that
private sector status will facilitate co-operation with foreign partners. In
the military aerospace sector, it is considered unlikely that Sweden will
ever again develop a new aircraft on its own as collaboration is seen as the
only way to secure markets cost-effectively.
Saab Military Aircraft, part of Saab-Scania, is reluctant to identify the
markets it is targeting, although countries in south-east Asia, Latin
America and central and eastern Europe have all been mentioned.
Tough competition is likely from the American F16 and F18, Mirage 2000-5 and
Mig 29 planes, which are all in a similar price bracket. However, in
performance terms, its manufacturers say the JAS should be compared with the
new generation of fighters, including the Eurofighter 2000, the Rafale and
the F22.
Whether it turns out good value for its manufacturers is another matter. The
project's delays and the fact that the first 30 aircraft were ordered at a
fixed price are believed to have cost the prime contractor, Saab-Scania,
heavily in the late 1980s. Some ground should be recouped with the second
order, but a real profits take-off will probably come only with export
orders.
One of the arguments that is thought to have persuaded the Swedish
government to persist with JAS is the spin-off effects for the country's
civil aviation business, which is also centred on Saab-Scania. The
commercial side of Sweden's aerospace industry has developed successfully,
but because of the downturn in world market conditions, new orders for Saab
aircraft have not materialised as quickly as anticipated, and some have been
cancelled.
The civilian side of the company's air business is concentrated on two
aircraft - the 35-seater Saab 340 and its bigger sister, the Saab 2000,
which can carry 50 to 58 passengers. Test flights for the latter began only
last year, and the first customer delivery is scheduled for this autumn.
A breakthrough came in the early part of the year when a Chinese airline
agreed to buy five Saab 2000 aircraft this year, and took options on a
further 15 for delivery in 1995 and 1996. But many more such orders will be
needed to recoup development costs.
Saab Aircraft, which comprises Saab Military Aircraft and the commercial
aircraft operations, made a profit of SKr163m last year, or 8.7 per cent in
pre-tax returns on capital employed. That is slightly above the SKr150m
recorded in 1991, even though sales fell to SKr3.92bn from SKr4.93bn. Even
so, it is well short of what the company hopes to achieve in the late 1990s
if foreign orders for the JAS and Saab 2000 come flooding in.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (24): Turning point for Fokker - The
Netherlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER this year, Fokker, the Dutch aeroplane maker, gave up its
independence. However, it gained a rich source of financial support and
capital when it agreed to a 51 per cent takeover by Deutsche Aerospace of
Germany.
The transaction, approved by the European Commission last month, marks a
turning point in Fokker's 74-year history and comes after more than a year
of controversy in the Netherlands. The long, tortuous negotiations between
Dasa and the Dutch government, which had the power of veto because of its 32
per cent stake in Fokker's share capital, were complicated by emotional and
political sensitivities that were inevitably raised by the sale of one of
the country's premier industrial establishments to a big German rival.
Speaking just before he signed the final contract in late April, Mr Jurgen
Schrempp, Dasa's chairman, acknowledged that 'never in history has a
substantial industrial marriage between the Netherlands and Germany worked.'
But, he added, 'this one is going to work.'
The link-up, designed to promote a restructuring of Europe's regional
aircraft sector, comes at a time when both Dasa and Fokker are shedding jobs
as they grapple with poor demand in the world market for new aircraft. Both
companies have recently suffered a decline in profits.
But regardless of the short-term difficulties, the partnership is designed
to be a long-term response to far-reaching changes in global aviation,
including the trends towards mergers and consolidation among the airlines
themselves. 'The time of the national company is past,' says Mr Erik Jan
Nederkoorn, Fokker's president.
For Fokker, the attraction of the deal lies in the financial strength of
Dasa, part of the Daimler-Benz industrial group.
Dasa has bought half of the government's 32 per cent holding and also
acquired new shares in Fokker to lift its stake in a new Fokker holding
company to 51 per cent. The share issue, plus a bond issue and long-term
loans provided by the Dutch state, mean that Fokker will benefit from total
proceeds of more than Fl900m (Dollars 500m), ensuring its future.
A first fruit of the Fokker-Dasa partnership was the recent decision by
Fokker to appoint Mr Horst Steinberg, a senior vice president at Dasa's
Dornier subsidiary, as the company's new head of sales in Asia and the
Middle East
Mr Schrempp has suggested that Fokker may take on the marketing of Dornier's
planes - a 19-seater and a 33-seater turboprop - but no decision has yet
been taken.
Fokker and Dasa will face a difficult decision on when to design and build
the Fokker 130, a 130-seater aircraft that is expected eventually to replace
the Dutch company's current jet, the Fokker 100.
However, Fokker is close to a formal decision to launch the Fokker 70, a
79-seat jet. A prototype made its maiden flight in April, and the new
aircraft is scheduled to be put on public display for the first time during
the trade days of the Paris Air Show.
A central element in the contract regulating Fokker's future under Dasa's
control is that Fokker will be responsible for the future design and
production of aircraft in the 65 to 130-seat range. This stipulation enabled
Fokker to argue that the company will remain a full-fledged aircraft
manufacturer with a wide scale of activities ranging from engineering and
production to sales and product support, thereby overcoming objections in
the Netherlands to the deal.
Fokker also insisted on this 'leadership' role in regional aircraft partly
because Dasa had made clear from the beginning that it intends to bring in
its two partners in the 'Regioliner' design project, Aerospatiale of France
and Alenia of Italy, as shareholders in Fokker, in effect turning the Dutch
company into a four-way 'Airbus' of the regional aeroplane market.
Aerospatiale and Alenia are expected to come on board in three years' time,
when the Dutch government is due to sell off its remaining Fokker shares,
ending state participation in the company. However, this future stage of the
Fokker-Dasa deal is likely to face more intense scrutiny - and possibly
objections - from the European Commission.
The expected four-way participation later this decade will also bring to a
head arrangements for the future of the Fokker 50, a turboprop that competes
directly with the ATR-42, a joint product of the Italian and French
companies. Dasa has given no guarantees about the future of the Fokker 50,
saying only that it will have to continue proving itself in the marketplace.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (25): Future products are a puzzle -
Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS BEEN an annus horribilis for Italy's aerospace industry. Demand for
military and civil aircraft has plunged, there have been allegations of
corruption over helicopters, and the need for restructuring to bring
capacity in line with demand has become ever more apparent, writes Haig
Simonian.
The impact has been shared equally between Alenia, the leading aerospace
group, Agusta in helicopters, and smaller makers such as Piaggio and
Aermacchi, in both of which Alenia has significant minority stakes.
Moreover, there has been a corporate upheaval among the two main
manufacturers. Alenia, formerly a listed subsidiary of the state-controlled
Finmeccanica engineering group, itself controlled by the Iri state holding
company. has now been incorporated as an internal division, as part of a
plan to increase the share float of Finmeccanica.
Meanwhile, the fates of Agusta and the Oto Melara missiles group have been
called into question after last July's government decision to place the
loss-making Efim state holding company in voluntary liquidation. Various
Efim aerospace and defence assets have been 'rented' to Finmeccanica at a
token price pending a longer-term solution, which probably involves their
incorporation into Alenia.
On the defence side, Italy's 30 per cent cut in real terms in military
spending has disrupted production targets, resulting in a halving of output
of Alenia's MX tactical support aircraft, produced jointly with Brazil, to
two a month from four as planned.
From a forecast of 350 aircraft, production now looks unlikely to exceed
200, of which 136 have so far been ordered by Italy and 59 by Brazil. That
gives Alenia enough work until 1995, after which matters become much less
clear.
Originally, the termination of the MX programme was to have dovetailed with
the start of production of the multilateral European Fighter Aircraft
programme. But, as Mr Fausto Cereti, Alenia's joint president explains:
'This programme has so many enemies that it's going forward much more slowly
than expected.'
Alenia's problems on the military side are common to other European
producers. Rising government budget deficits and continuing uncertainty over
future defence needs have led to sharp sending cuts. 'It has become much
more difficult to understand what will be the products of the future,' says
Mr Enrico Gimelli, Alenia's other president.
Matters are no happier on the civil side. Production of the ATR regional
turbo-prop, made jointly with France's Aerospatiale, has not reached
expected targets because of the downturn in demand. 'We had hoped to reach
an output of 65-70 planes a year by 1994,' says Mr Gimelli. 'Instead, it's
running at about 50 a year.'
Alenia executives deny the ATR programme, which has received 540 orders and
options, is still losing money. Production is now around break-even, says Mr
Gimelli, who blames continuing difficulties on price-cutting from
competitors with big backlogs of unsold planes. However, he admits the drop
in demand has held up plans to develop the ATR further.
The group, which is a big sub-contractor for both McDonnell Douglas and
Boeing, has also been hurt by the plunge in the US market. Mr Gimelli is
cautious about signs of a possible upturn after recent airline orders. 'It's
too soon to say there's a recovery in the US, as carriers there are very
sensitive to seasonal developments. We'll have to wait until the summer
season.'
But he is pessimistic about the outlook in Europe. 'I think the real crisis
is just beginning.' European carriers may have been more cautious in
ordering new aircraft than some US counterparts, and the market may still be
in slightly better shape as deregulation-driven competition has not gone so
far. But the impact of falling demand remains acute.
Even Alenia's successful electronics side has had its share of difficulties
lately. Although orders have been maintained and the business is doing well,
the company was dragged into an undesirable spat earlier this year after
winning a Mexican air traffic control order jointly with Thomson of France.
The award of the deal led to accusations of unfair play by the two companies
which led the international ATC field. The case is still rumbling, but
Alenia takes comfort from the fact that IBM, one of the losing parties,
distanced itself from the charges levelled by a local partner. 'It often
happens that competitors claim the two market leaders are too strong,' says
Mr Cereti.
While denying the Mexican spat has hurt its image, Alenia says this year's
two-month strike over job losses at its Naples plant has proved costly,
financially and in terms of prestige. The dispute, resolved after a
compromise on relocating 2,000 of the 5,000 workers first scheduled for
redundancy, led to nail-biting moments as the group saw supply deadlines to
US manufacturers looming.
Alenia widely publicised the pressure levelled by big US clients to persuade
employees to return to work. But the company denies the US threats of taking
future business elsewhere was just a bluff. In the worst case, crucial parts
for one US manufacturer were delivered just a day before the contract
deadline, recalls Mr Cereti. 'We became Japanese-style just-in-time
suppliers without really wanting to,' he admits.
'Obviously, clients were getting worried. We were lucky in that the market
was in recession, so production lines never had to be halted because of us.
But these things leave lingering doubts, and our clients are bound to wonder
what might have happened had the strike taken place when the market was in
an upturn,' he says. 'Customers may have some sympathy for our efforts to
slim down the company. But now we'll have to work hard to show Naples is a
credible plant.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (23): The long search for a super fibre
 -David Fishlock finds Rolls-Royce worried by the level of its R&amp;D support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FISHLOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE'S two big international rivals in the aero-engine business -
General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney - receive R&amp;D support from the US
government amounting to Dollars 760m a year, Sir Ralph Robins told a Commons
select committee in March. The Rolls-Royce chairman complained: 'There is no
doubt that the level of US government support to its industry makes life
very difficult for us.'
His company has received about the same sum from the UK government as launch
aid for civil aircraft, but spread over 21 years. Unlike the US support,
launch aid is reimbursable. Rolls-Royce will pay back nearly Pounds 500m
between now and the year 2001, Sir Ralph forecasts.
Mr Stewart Miller, Rolls-Royce's chief engineer and director of engineering
technology, expands on his chairman's worries in respect of advanced
aerospace materials. 'After efficiency, materials are just as important as
ever they were to the designer, and ultimately efficiency will be limited by
materials,' he says.
Essentially, the big engineering challenges are to drive pressures and
temperatures higher and, at the same time, make the engines lighter. It is
an obvious application for 'simultaneous engineering' for the properties of
the promising new aerospace materials are linked irrevocably to the way
components are made.
Use of steel, for example, has been declining steadily from 60 per cent of
engine weight in 1960 (the Tyne) to about 15 per cent today, and is still
falling. Use of nickel has peaked at about 45 per cent and can be expected
to fall sharply.
Three new types of material are expected to increase their 'market share'
rapidly. For lower temperatures they are the resin-based composites of the
type Rolls tried but failed to introduce with its carbon-fibre fan blade in
the 1960s.
For higher temperatures they are the metal matrix composites - metal
reinforced with ceramic fibres - that promise to take weight out of rotating
parts. And there are the ceramic matrix composites - 'the big prize', as Mr
Miller sees it. Ceramic matrix composites promise to eliminate the elaborate
cooling arrangements now needed for high-temperature rotating metal parts.
'But it's extraordinarily difficult,' he admits.
Mr Miller confesses he has been guilty of undue optimism about when such
materials will be ready to fly. Five years ago the company saw the challenge
as a 10-year project, giving it a new engineering material by the end of the
century. 'It's going to take longer than that.'
The core problem is corrosion: how, when running engines at 1,500 degrees C
 -the melting point of steel - to prevent the fibrous reinforcement from
simply dissolving in its white-hot matrix. The answer is probably a
protective coating for the fibre, to create a 'super fibre' in terms of
high-temperature strength and corrosion resistance. Identifying the
combination that will eventually win a licence to fly is going to be a long
and costly quest. Mr Miller is betting on coated alumina (aluminium oxide)
fibres getting there first.
But a big difficulty is that there are no UK suppliers of super fibres. The
volume of business promised by Rolls-Royce is small compared with the scale
of investment required, and the lead time to commercial use is long. This
problem has driven Rolls-Royce into a Eureka pre-competitive research
collaboration involving some 30 European organisations.
The first, four-year phase of this programme, starting this year, aims to
identify a suitable coated fibre for service at 1,500 degrees C. Rolls-Royce
is contributing about Pounds 0.5m, which will be backed pound for pound by
the government. The obvious risk for the company - and Britain - is that
results will be freely available to a rival aero-engine maker.
Rolls-Royce spends over Pounds 200m a year of its own on research,
development and demonstration. Figures given by Sir Ralph to the select
committee suggest three major sources of public support for its two US
competitors:
from the US Department of Defense's science and research budget - Dollars
400m a year;
from research and demonstration programmes jointly funded by DoD and Nasa -
Dollars 160m a year;
from recovery of R&amp;D costs by companies charging their R&amp;D to the overhead
account on contracts - Dollars 200m a year.
In France, says Rolls-Royce, the principal state support for civil
aero-engine programmes is launch aid for Snecma, GE's state-owned
collaborator. Snecma gets reimbursable loans amounting to Pounds 240m (1990
prices) over 10 years for the GE 90 programme, a direct competitor to
Rolls-Royce's Trent.
In Japan, says Rolls-Royce, Miti has identified aeronautics as the most
important 'sunrise' industry of the 21st century. In 1983 the Japanese
government launched a R&amp;D programme involving about 170 companies to develop
engineering ceramics. R-R believes this has given Nippon Carbon a commanding
position in carbon fibre production and use. Japan began test runs of an
industrial gas turbine made of ceramic components in 1990.
Its aim, says Mr Miller, is to develop an 'all-composite engine'. Its
commercial goal is to supply advanced engine component technology, giving
this the status of, say, avionic systems in future generations of aircraft.
Two other companies - Nippon Chemicals and UBE Chemicals - are also
concentrating on fibre development and manufacture for reinforcing composite
materials.
Although Mr Miller acknowledges that the development of high duty composite
materials is proving more difficult and expensive than was expected a few
years ago, 'our belief in the value of composite materials is as strong as
ever it was.
'The weight savings are potentially enormous,' he asserts. For example, it
may be possible to design a composite compressor wheel with integral blades
only half the weight of the metal version.
But where once sights were set on such critical parts as turbine blades,
less critical components are now being targeted. Rolls-Royce participated in
the Eureka programme, but Mr Miller believes that so crucial is advanced
aero-engine materials technology that Britain should be prepared to pursue
this one alone.
Last year Rolls-Royce proposed a national composite materials R&amp;D programme
involving its suppliers and universities, with government support of about
Pounds 50m a year. The US government, says Mr Miller, spends more - Dollars
150m a year for composite materials R&amp;D.
As Sir Ralph told MPs: 'A new family of materials is coming to revolutionise
aviation and its first application will be on engines.' Unless Rolls-Royce
remained at the forefront of composite materials technology the company
risked losing out, its chairman warned.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (22): No let-up for the Big Three -
Aero-engine manufacturers are restructuring heavily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAS been no let-up for aero-engine manufacturers. 'We are undergoing
the longest and most damaging recession we've ever suffered,' says Sir Ralph
Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group.
'In some parts of the world, we don't know what kind of airline industry
will emerge from this recession which has already taken some large airlines
like Pan Am and Eastern out of the game. As for the defence business, it has
not gone away for good, but what is clear is that it will be half the size
it was,' he adds.
The response to the steep business downturn of the three big aero-engine
makers - General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney in the US and Rolls-Royce in
the UK - has followed a common pattern. All three have continued to
restructure heavily. GE is cutting a further 4,000 jobs and Pratt another
10,000 jobs in the next 18 months. Rolls-Royce, whose aero-engine workforce
has already fallen from 36,500 in 1990 to 29,500 at the end of 1992, is
cutting another 5,000 jobs this year.
But while aero-engine makers have had to accelerate restructuring, they have
also had to continue investing heavily in the development of new products
and technologies to take advantage of the recovery when it finally comes and
maintain their long-term competitive position in perhaps the toughest of all
markets in the aerospace industry.
All three are in the throes of costly programmes to develop new large
commercial engines to power the new generation of widebody aircraft. GE is
investing heavily in the GE90, which reached a thrust level of more than
100,000lb during tests in Ohio this spring. Rolls-Royce is working on the
Trent and Pratt on the PW4000 to build ultra-high thrust power plants.
The first application for these new engines will be the Boeing 777 twin
engine widebody airliner and the Airbus A330 widebody twin. Although the
initial 777s and A330s will not require anything like 100,000lb of engine
thrust (the GE90, for example, will enter into service with its launch
customer British Airways in September 1995 at a thrust rating of 78,700 lb),
all three manufacturers expect demand for power to grow as twin-engine
widebody aircraft become bigger in the future.
Apart from cut-throat competition to sell engines - and none has been
fiercer than in the new large commercial engine market - the sector has
traditionally faced far longer lead times for product development and profit
recovery than other parts of the aerospace industry. Lead times have been
steadily growing and have now stretched as long as 50 years for new engine
programmes.
Rolls-Royce says it takes about 14 years to research and demonstrate a new
technology and another 12 years to apply the results to a complete
aero-engine product range. But as manufacturers traditionally earn low
margins for new engines, they have to rely for their return on investment on
the large after-market for spare parts over the 25-year service life of an
engine. This matches the current expected life of a modern airliner which,
according to Rolls-Royce, is at least 25 years.
Margins for new engines have also been squeezed by the present parlous state
of airline finances. All manufacturers have had to increase the financial
support that they provide to many of their customers to sustain sales during
the industry's current three-year slump.
'We are not only having to give away new engines but we are now having to
make deals with airlines on spare parts. That's how tough it is,' notes Mr
Brian Rowe, the head of GE's aero-engine operations who is expected to
retire later this year.
During recessions, airlines fly less and require fewer spares thus putting
pressure on the aero-engine manufacturers' lucrative spare parts business.
But an additional problem facing manufacturers in the more profitable
after-market sector of their business has been caused by the steady advance
in engine technology. Rolls-Royce says the sharp improvement in modern
engine reliability means that it now takes at least five to six years after
the sale of a new engine before spare parts income starts to flow.
The huge costs and risks coupled with long lead times of developing new
engines has forced manufacturers to rely increasingly on widescale
international collaboration ranging from joint technological studies and
licensing agreements to risk and revenue sharing partnerships and the
setting up of joint engine companies.
Such partnerships have predominated on the civil side of the business which
cannot rely to the same extent as military engines on government research
and development support. GE and the French state-owned engine manufacturer
Snecma have been collaborating for two decades on civil engines with Snecma
holding risk-sharing stakes ranging from 10 to 50 per cent in GE civil
engine projects.
Pratt has forged a strategic alliance with Motoren und Turbinen Union (MTU),
the German engine manufacturer part of Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace
subsidiary. Rolls-Royce has also been increasing its collaborative ventures
with Japanese manufacturers taking a 7.5 per cent stake in the Trent. Rolls
has also set up a joint company with BMW of Germany to develop engines for
business, commuter and regional aircraft.
With development costs and competitive pressures constantly rising, smaller
manufacturers are finding it increasingly urgent to forge new relationships
or expand existing ones with the larger aero-engine groups. This is likely
to lead to more consolidation of smaller companies into the big three.
Some aerospace analysts have even suggested that three big manufacturers are
too many for the market to sustain and that one will eventually have to
merge with a competitor. Sir Ralph believes the three majors will survive.
'But I can't see a place for the smaller players,' he adds.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (21): Plethora of airports - Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE end of 1997, the delta of Southern China's Pearl River could be the
focus of five new international airports. Hong Kong will vie with Macao,
Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Guangzhou to lure the hordes of businessmen heading for
the world's fastest growing region, writes Simon Davies.
Hong Kong had hoped to establish a monopoly role for itself, but the scope
of its ambition is currently proving to be its undoing.
In 1994, Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport, now the fourth busiest in the world,
will hit full capacity, at a time of boom for the Asia-Pacific aviation
industry .
But the world's most expensive airport project, which was to have been a
monument to the success of the British administration in Hong Kong, has
instead become a symbol of the uncertainties represented by the colony's
post-1997 government.
China is apparently unhappy at the Dollars 21bn price tag on Chek Lap Kok
and related infrastructural projects, which compare somewhat unfavourably
with Japan's Dollars 10bn Kansai Airport, and the Dollars 1.3bn expansion of
Singapore's Changi airport. Without Chinese approval of the financing plan,
it would become the world's most expensive white elephant.
The political stand-off has dragged on for a whole year. Surprisingly,
millions of tons of mud have been displaced during that time and a vast
artificial island has begun to appear, providing a platform for the airport.
The underlying logic is that since the airport was in principle agreed by
Britain and China in 1991, work will carry on where possible, and eventually
it will become cheaper to complete than to scrap.
Despite the delays, Mr Hank Townsend, the provisional airport authority's
chief executive officer, argues that the June 30 1997 deadline for the
opening of the new airport is still achievable. 'My concern would be that as
we approach this fall (without approval for the financing plan), the
mid-June deadline becomes less probable,' he said.
It seems impossible that it will open on time - the Chinese could be
forgiven for wanting to host the ribbon-cutting ceremony for such a
momentous project. But with Chinese officialdom stating that it wants the
airport, it appears equally impossible that it will not be completed. More
of an issue is the role the airport will have left to play once it does
open.
Kai Tak has been a major beneficiary of the booming Chinese economy. Many of
the 21m people who flew though the airport in 1992 did so because it is the
only realistic means of access to southern China.
This is particularly galling for the Taiwanese. Under government
regulations, they can visit China only via a third country. As a result of
this, 1.64m Taiwanese visited Hong Kong last year, representing the largest
individual source of tourists.
Inevitably, direct links will be set up by 1997, and Hong Kong is likely to
forfeit a large chunk of this business, accounting for 23 per cent of all
visitors last year. The loss of this business could coincide with the
opening of a new Hong Kong airport with capacity for 35m passengers.
Another factor which will affect passenger demand for Chek Lap Kok is a
rapid increase in local competition. In mid-1996, the Portuguese enclave of
Macao will finally open its international airport. With a capacity of 2m, it
is unlikely to leave a mark on Kai Tak, which processed 22m passengers last
year. However, on the other side of the river, Shenzhen has greater
ambitions.
It plans to process 3m passengers by the end of 1993 and already has
capacity to take 8m, or almost one third of Kai Tak. At the same time,
Guangzhou, the provincial capital city, is working on a replacement airport
and Macao's neighbouring city of Zhuhai wants to get in on the game.
All this smacks of excess. Yet Mr Townsend argues that over-capacity is not
an issue. 'If you have the capacity, people will find a way to use it. The
rapidly increasing standard of living is creating an enormous middle class.
You are tapping a whole new segment of the market that hasn't existed
before.'
He is not alone in this opinion. Mr John Meredith, senior director of the
International Air Transport Association, expects Asia-Pacific average
passenger growth of 8.6 per cent between 1990 and 1995, and 7.5 per cent
between 1995 and 2000.
'The proposed new airports in south-east Asia will be full by the time they
come onstream. Asia-Pacific is set to outstrip the rest of the world in
passenger traffic,' he argued at a recent conference. Iata estimates the
number of flights in the region will double in the next decade.
Hong Kong should play a major part in this boom. It remains the natural
service centre for southern China because of its strength in infrastructure
and communications. Its future must depend on its ability to provide what
China needs, and the airport will be integral to this.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER two years of courting inter- national aerospace companies with a cash
pile in inverse proportion to its knowledge, Taiwan Aerospace Company has
finally arranged a deal which will give Taiwan an embryo civil aviation
industry by the end of 1994, writes Simon Davies.
But the company has a long way to go before it can prove that money can buy
anything. Mr Tsai Fen-doe, a former legislator and engineer of Taiwan's push
into aerospace, admits: 'Taiwan cannot say that in 10 to 20 years it will be
a major competitor in the world aerospace industry. We would be laughed at.'
Taiwan's vehicle industry provides an unfortunate precedent: it remains
over-protected and uncompetitive. It has failed even to develop the
capability for manufacturing engines. TAC also derives from a government
decision that it should evolve from its low-cost manufacturing roots. The
view is that Taiwan should develop capital and technology-intensive
industries.
The aerospace push is being made via a company only 29 per cent owned by the
government, to give it a more independent and competitive edge. Local
companies were persuaded to put up the rest of TAC's TDollars 1.2bn (Pounds
30m) start-up capital.
The group started with big ideas. As one aerospace expert claims: 'They were
sitting on top of a pile of money. But they hadn't manufactured one single
part of a plane and they were under a lot of pressure to find a deal.'
The first stop was McDonnell Douglas, where Taiwan Aerospace proposed to
invest Dollars 2bn to develop a new generation of super-jumbo jets. But
critics argued the world was not ready for this. Legislators succeeded in
blocking the deal and forcing out Mr David Huang, the TAC chairman.
Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president, says there has since been a change in focus.
'I have to strike a delicate balance between medium-term profitability and
long-term investment. I have to walk a fine line.' He argues that even in
the best-case scenario, the McDonnell deal would not have reaped profits for
more than a decade.
The Dollars 250m purchase of 50 per cent of British Aerospace's regional
aviation business represents a more practical approach to Taiwan's ambition
of an evolving aerospace industry. It appears to balance the strengths of
the two partners. Taiwan has an abundance of capital, access to a booming
market for short-haul transportation and expertise in aerospace assembly.
British Aerospace has a product, but it lacks capital and an active
marketplace.
One of the keys to the link-up is the fact that now Taiwan has gained access
to foreign jet fighters, it no longer has any need for its Indigenous
Defence Fighters, the jets that it developed when Beijing blocked foreign
arms sales to Taiwan.
Mr Tsai argues: 'You cannot separate the aerospace ambitions from the
defence plan. Defence was always Taiwan's priority, but now we have F16s and
Mirages, we have to consider how to utilise this excess manpower from
defence.'
The new RJ (which stands for Regional Jet) range will be manufactured in the
Aero Industry Development Centre, taking up slack from the slowdown of the
fighters assembly line. Mr Ko says the Defence Ministry has already agreed
to lease out part of this operation for civil production.
The new production base is at the mouth of a potential goldmine of demand.
Taiwan will produce its first RJ aircraft only by the end of 1994, by which
time Taiwan and China may have agreed on direct flights across the Taiwan
straits.
Economists expect that more than 3m Taiwanese will make the short hop across
the Taiwan straits to China in the first year of direct flights, creating a
market for small jets, such as the RJ. Even without this, Taiwan is in the
centre of one of the world's few high growth aviation centres.
Mr Ko claims: 'We are still a new kid on the block, and we have to prove
ourselves. For the next two years, the industry has problems and we'll take
the opportunity to learn. Then people can take us seriously.'
They are already doing so. Sir Ralph Robins, Rolls-Royce chairman, recently
visited Taiwan to discuss setting up a jet engine manufacturing operation
for the development of a twin engine addition to the RJ series, to be called
the RJX. TAC has also set up a maintenance joint venture with Singapore
Aerospace, and may enter the helicopter industry.
Shareholders are currently being asked to increase TAC's capital base to its
target of TDollars 5.2bn. The government will take up its share, but some
backers have been less willing to back the venture.
They have cause for scepticism. There is little precedent in Asia, where
economic powerhouses such as Japan and South Korea have failed to develop a
civil aviation manufacturing industry, beyond the production of individual
components.
Taiwan has progressed beyond that, and Mr Ko is now looking to joint venture
partners to produce key components for the RJ. But it will take time and
money for this basic assembly line to evolve into a vertically-integrated
aerospace industry.

AT A time when the airline industry in the west faces a slump and aircraft
orders are down, China's aviation market is booming and shows no signs of
easing up.
'Its industry is growing much more than the US aviation business in the
1960s and 1970s, when the maximum growth rate was 12 to 13 per cent
annually,' says a western businessman. 'China's growth rate is more than
double that of the US.'
China's passenger traffic volume rose more than 30 per cent last year over
1991, and it has averaged an annual 25 per cent increase since 1984.
Domestic flights are consistently more than 80 per cent full.
Some business forecasts estimate that China will need to acquire 50 to 60
aircraft a year for the next three years to begin to meet demand. In a
period of tremendous economic reform, China is modernising and restructuring
its aviation industry. At the same time, to cope with the immense growth in
passenger and cargo traffic, it is acquiring a wide variety of planes and
equipment using an array of financing techniques, from leasing to barter
deals to outright purchasing.
Three of the country's state-owned airlines have leased at least 16 Ilyushin
86s from the former Soviet republics. Under the terms of what is called a
'wet lease', the foreign carrier supplies the aircraft, crews, flight
attendants and technical support staff. The Russians are also bartering or
selling Tupolev 154s. Though these aircraft require more frequent repairs
and use more fuel, they are cheaper than their western counterparts.
China has also recently purchased 12 Airbuses from Germany, with options for
13 more in a Dollars 1bn contract.
Boeing is a major player in the China market. It is expected to deliver a
total of 47 aircraft this year. The company signed an Dollars 800m order in
the spring to sell 20 737s and one 757 to China. It is also negotiating to
sell widebody 767 jets, which can carry 260 passengers, to China Southwest,
and an advanced new 777 plane that can seat 390 people, which would go to
Air China.
China has acquired nearly 200 Boeings since Mr Richard Nixon flew in one to
Beijing in 1973 to begin the process of Sino-American rapprochement.
Other foreign companies are also negotiating to manufacture aircraft in
China, but western sources said these discussions are on hold as the Chinese
industry undergoes a reorganisation.
Saab-Scania has been talking with the Chinese about producing a turbo-prop
commuter. Last year, Saab sold some 340s to China Southern. The French and
Italians have also been competing to offer a similar 50-seater model, called
an ATR, to the Chinese. Fokker is believed to be proposing its version of
the turbo-prop.
Since April, the Ministry of Aerospace Industry has been dismembered. The
aerospace functions are now handled by the China Aerospace Industrial
Corporation, and the aviation and manufacturing arms are the
responsibilities of the China Aviation Industrial Corporation.
Although both corporations are still government-owned, this change brings
more decentralisation and a greater emphasis on responding to market demand.
With this restructuring, it is still unclear how much clout the aviation
corporation has and to what extent it is able to compel Chinese airlines to
buy domestically made jets. Many airlines prefer to purchase foreign
aircraft, believing they get a cheaper and better quality product.
At the same time the ministry has been dismantled, the Civil Aviation
Administration of China has also been broken up. CAAC now functions
primarily as a regulatory agency, much like the Federal Aviation
Administration in the US. It no longer retains control of the airports,
though it still keeps authority over some aircraft purchase decisions.
In the face of the country's rapid economic reform, the number of airlines
has mushroomed. At last count, China had 25 to 30 airlines. They can be
organised into three groups:
The first category consists of six major state-owned regional carriers: Air
China, China Eastern, China Northern, China Southern, China Southwestern,
and China Northwestern.
These airlines can float bonds and shares, sign joint ventures, and create
subsidiaries, but still need central government approval for aircraft
purchases.
The second group includes specialised airlines, such as Yunnan Air, which
CAAC controls directly. Despite provincial and local government pressure to
ignore Beijing's directives, CAAC retains authority over these airlines so
as to allocate routes.
The third category of carriers includes all of those owned by
municipalities, provinces, and other shareholders. The largest of these
airlines is Shanghai Air, which has three Boeings now and will have 13 of
them by 2000. Xiamen Air in Fujian province is partially owned by China
Southern, which is based in Canton.
With the decentralisation of the industry and the economic boom, a host of
new problems has arisen.
Safety issues have often taken a back seat to expansion. China's safety
record has been erratic. Last year, four publicly reported accidents claimed
276 lives. And in April this year, turbulence rocked a China Eastern flight
to Los Angeles, killing two people and injuring more than 150.
China also faces a severe pilot shortage. Good pilots have left the major
state airlines for smaller, local ones and much higher pay. Many of the
country's airports have antiquated ground facilities, few radar systems, or
none at all.
To improve its safety record, CAAC recently announced a crackdown. New
airlines cannot be created unless they meet minimum capital requirements,
have qualified pilots and adequate ground control equipment.
New regulations also prohibit pilots from flying overtime and from taking
off or landing in bad weather. Safety inspections and spot checks are being
stepped up. CAAC has also banned unauthorised pilot and technical personnel
recruitment from one airline to another in the country.
'All of this will take time,' a western business executive says. 'China is
trying to leapfrog to the latest available technology without going through
the steps western countries have taken.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (16): Vista of freedom - France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BALLADUR government has opened a new vista for France's aerospace
industry by including Aerospatiale, the country's leading aircraft and
missile maker, and Snecma, the aero-engine manufacturer, as well as Thomson,
the electronics group, in its list of state companies to be sold off.
Pressing though the government's need is for cash, the aerospace industry is
most unlikely to field the first candidates for privatisation. The losses of
Aerospatiale and Snecma deepened last year, while Thomson's group profits
were sharply down.
But the privatisation legislation carries no time limit, and once it is
passed, the government says, the companies concerned will have more freedom
to forge new industrial partnerships even before they reach the stock
market.
There is, of course, no question of these aerospace companies swimming right
out of the orbit of the French state, which will retain an effective form of
control through the defence budget and 'launch aid' for civil aircraft. The
government has not specified in which companies it will take 'a golden
share' allowing it to block takeover bids, but it is more than likely that
this mechanism will be used in the aerospace/defence sectors.
Faced in 1992 with its first contraction of business in 30 years, aerospace
companies have already been trying to strike new alliances both inside and
outside France as a way of stemming money and job losses.
Aerospatiale's joint Eurocopter company venture with Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa) got off to a bad start last year, with sales falling 12 per cent and
500 employees being laid off. But it has been talking about rationalisation
in missile-making to both Matra and Thomson, though the latter has decided
to link forces with Shorts, the Canadian-owned Belfast firm, in making very
short range ground to air missiles.
The previous Socialist government has brought Dassault, France's military
and business jet maker, into closer partnership, particularly in R&amp;D, with
Aerospatiale. But the two companies' product range remains very different.
For the long term, Dassault has started talking to British Aerospace about a
joint successor aircraft to the Rafale and the European Fighter Aircraft
which the two companies are building separately. In parallel, Snecma, which
has made the Rafale engine by itself, is discussing co-operation with
Rolls-Royce, a diversification from the French company's long-time
partnership with General Electric of the US on civil engines.
All this strategic manoeuvring is taking place in a business trough which Mr
Henri Martre, former head of Aerospatiale and current president of Gifas,
the French aerospace association, does not believe will end before 1995.
Gifas reported that total turnover last year fell by 1.5 per cent to
FFr101.4bn, while employment in the industry dropped again - despite
substantial short-time working - to 111,600.
The 1.8 per cent decline in civil sales was sharper and less expected than
the smaller 1.2 per cent drop in military sales, which shows signs of
bottoming out. The general problems of the airline industry, and the
particular plight of Air France which lost some FFr3.2bn last year, were the
root cause. Aerospatiale and its three Airbus partners kept their second
place (31 per cent) in the world market for airliners of more than 100
seats. But the pleasure of seeing Airbus orders rise from 101 in 1991 to 136
in 1992 was alloyed by the fact that last year also saw previous orders for
95 Airbus cancelled. The Franco-Italian ATR consortium making regional haul
aircraft also had a disappointing year, while Dassault's civil business is
essentially marking time until its Falcon 2000 range comes on stream.
France's aerospace industry knows it can expect little joy from the French
defence ministry, whose equipment budget has declined by 8 per cent over the
past two years and is likely to bear the brunt of further austerity cuts by
the Balladur government. But military exports bounced back last year with a
4 per cent rise, while orders increased by 21 per cent, compensating for the
30 per cent decline in 1991. This was mainly thanks to a large order from
Taiwan for 60 Mirages 2000-5s and some 1,500 missiles. A number of avionics
and electronics firms will feel the benefit of this order, but most will go
to Dassault and Matra, makers of the Mirages and most of the missiles
concerned.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (17): Merger wave to continue - The US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US aerospace industry is in the throes of a wrenching contraction as it
struggles with the twin problems of a downturn in the civil aviation
business and a shrinking US military budget.
The result has been tens of thousands of job losses across the sector and,
on the military side of the industry, a merger wave which still has a
considerable way to run.
The civil aerospace business should eventually recover, as the US and world
economies shrug off their current weakness, but the end of the Cold War
means the military contractors face a long, one-way decline in demand.
US government spending on all types of military supplies is estimated to
have dropped from a peak of Dollars 206bn in 1987 to Dollars 161bn last year
and analysts expect it to fall to around Dollars 130bn by 1997.
In previous US downturns, contractors have been able to ameliorate their
difficulties by building up overseas sales, but the growth potential far
from matches the scale of domestic cutbacks.
North American companies divide equally on whether military exports will
increase or decrease over the next four years, according to a new survey,
conducted by consultants Ernst &amp; Young, of global defence industry attitudes
towards the challenges facing the sector.
This backdrop poses tricky strategic decisions for military contractors, who
are being pushed by market forces either to acquire their rivals, and thus
gain a leading position in a particular sub-sector of the market, or to sell
out to companies which can achieve this critical mass. Those which delay too
long risk being left out in the cold, facing a gradual slide to
insignificance.
An article late last year in the Harvard Business Review by Mr Jerrold
Lundquist, of management consultants McKinsey, argued that 'today a dozen
defence companies compete in six or more market segments. Tomorrow they will
compete in two or three.
'Several large companies and scores of small ones will fold altogether. In
1992 there are 13 companies in the space segment and 16 vie for a slice of
the avionics pie. By 1997 there will be only five or six in each group.'
The Ernst &amp; Young study found almost all North American companies expect
significantly more consolidation, with some 60 per cent expecting a large
number of sub-contractors to leave the defence business.
The industry's most aggressive deal-maker so far has been General Dynamics,
until recently the second largest defence contractor, which has just sold
its tactical military aircraft business to Lockheed for Dollars 1.525bn.
The main product of the General Dynamics division is the F-16 fighter,
output of which is now well past its 1980s peak, but it and Lockheed were
already partners (along with Boeing) in the development of the F-22, a new
generation of radar-dodging fighters.
The Lockheed deal was only the latest in a series of disposals by General
Dynamics which also included Cessna, the light aircraft manufacturer (sold
to Textron) and its missiles operations (which went to Hughes Aircraft).
Nevertheless, the latest deal took analysts by surprise because Mr William
Anders, the General Dynamics chairman, had repeatedly insisted that tactical
military aircraft was a core business he wanted to hang on to.
Yet he had also complained that his efforts to buy businesses had been
frustrated by the reluctance of rival contractors to sell off sub-critical
operations.
The largest single defence deal to date was struck last November, when
Martin Marietta - a leading manufacturer of space launch vehicles, such as
the Titan family of rockets, as well as military electronics, information
systems and missiles - acquired General Electric's aerospace business for
Dollars 3.05bn.
The GE business supplies radar, sonar avionics and armaments systems,
missiles system components and commercial satellites. The deal positioned
Martin Marietta to become the leading US aerospace electronics supplier.
However, buying a rival is only the first stage in building a successful
business. The two sides have to be smoothly integrated. Martin Marietta, for
example, recently formed six new sectors to align similar businesses and
warned that it expected lay-offs as it continued the consolidation process.
McDonnell Douglas, the largest US defence contractor of all, faces big
problems in civil aircraft, where it has lost its position as the
second-largest manufacturer in the world to Europe's Airbus Industrie, and
on the military side of its business.
There is a large question mark hanging over the fate of the controversial
C-17 transport it has been developing for the Pentagon and which is way
behind schedule and far over budget. In a letter to the company in early
May, the Pentagon warned that unless the company takes 'immediate and
aggressive action' to improve its management of the programme, the jet might
be cancelled. Some congressmen would like to see the programme scaled back
to only half the 120 aircraft originally envisaged at a cost of up to
Dollars 40bn, while others would be happy to kill it.
Apart from the C-17 and a bitter dispute with the government over who should
pay for the cancelled A-12 programme, McDonnell's large military aircraft
business, which includes the F-15 and the F/A-18 fighters, is solidly
profitable and last year won some important new contracts, including an
order from Saudi Arabia for 72 F-15s.
However, the commercial business faces an extremely uncertain future. It is
modestly profitable, after big cuts in its workforce, but it has not won any
big new orders in almost two years and its product range - the narrow-bodied
MD-80 and the wide-bodied MD-11 - is more limited than that of rivals Boeing
and Airbus.
It plans to build a new super-jumbo jet, the MD-12, but is so financially
stretched it cannot afford to do so alone. Last year it tried to get
partners among Asian nations to invest equity in the commercial aircraft
business in return for part of the MD-12 manufacturing operations.
So far, these efforts have been unsuccessful and the project has been put on
hold until conditions in the airline industry pick up. Yet without the
MD-12, many analysts question its long-term ability to survive in the
commercial business.
Boeing is also suffering from the recession, which is forcing it to cut
28,000 jobs, or a fifth of its employees, between the start of this year and
the middle of next, while production on all its jetliners is being cut by an
average of 35 per cent by mid-1994.
For all that, a battened-down Boeing, with a share of around 60 per cent of
the commercial aircraft market and a firm backlog worth around Dollars 83bn,
should be well placed to take advantage of the next cyclical market upturn.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (18): The engine heats up - The Asia
Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Mr Donald Schmidt, acting director for the Asia Pacific of the
US Federal Aviation Administration looks out over the runways of Changi
airport in Singapore.
'The growth of aviation in this part of the world is incredible,' he says.
'I've been here since 1988 and just by looking out the window, watching the
increase in flights, I can tell how fast aviation is moving in this region.
It's like an engine heating up.'
The statistics support Mr Schmidt. There has been double-digit growth in
airline traffic across the Asia Pacific in each of the past 20 years.
The International Air Transport Association forecasts that passenger numbers
in the region will double between now and the year 2000. The region will
then account for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide passenger traffic and by
2010 that figure will be more than 50 per cent.
Iata predicts that passenger traffic in south-east Asia will grow by more
than 9 per cent in each of the next three years, compared to annual growth
forecasts of 3.9 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in North America.
As passenger numbers have grown, so the whole focus of the aviation industry
has shifted. By the year 2005 Boeing predicts that the Asia Pacific will
surpass the US as the largest market for aircraft deliveries.
Countries buying aircraft have been demanding more technology transfer and a
greater share of aerospace manufacturing. The need for these 'offset'
arrangements means aircraft manufacturers are basing increasing amounts of
their component manufacturing in the region, both on the civil and military
sides of the industry.
But this is not the only factor behind the growth of the Asia Pacific
aerospace industry: in many cases, particularly related to aircraft
maintenance, the Asia Pacific is a better financial proposition. Last year
United Airlines of the US purchased seven 747 200s from Qantas, the
Australian carrier. United had the aircraft modified and serviced in
Singapore rather than back in the US.
'Singapore has the facilities, a very competitive cost structure and a good
reputation for doing the work on time,' says Mr Terry Waldo, United manager
in Singapore.
Some manufacturers have sought to form strategic alliances - such as the
recent joint venture to manufacture regional jets announced between British
Aerospace and the aerospace industry in Taiwan. Almost every country in the
region has some form of aerospace industry: Airrod in Malaysia carries out
work on US military aircraft and a growing number of other maintenance
tasks. There is talk of possible technical collaboration between Malaysia
and McDonnell Douglas.
IPTN in Indonesia has, in a little over 10 years, reached a stage when it is
now in the process of manufacturing its own turboprop jet, the N250.
Meanwhile Singapore has built itself up into a regional maintenance centre.
The industry grew, from the mid-1970s, out of the repair and maintenance of
military aircraft. The facilities provided by Changi airport, consistently
voted as the world's best, have encouraged local and foreign aerospace
enterprises to develop.
Nearly 50 companies in Singapore carry out a wide variety of maintenance,
from complete 'nose jobs' on 747s to maintenance of some US air force
fighter engines.
While the bulk of Singapore's aerospace industry is concerned with repair
and overhaul, various manufacturing processes are also being undertaken,
from a Singapore-French-Chinese venture to design and manufacture a new
light helicopter, to the building of cabin service carts.
Dr Otis Chen is managing director of Turbine Overhaul Services, a joint
venture between state-owned Singapore Technologies and United
Technologies/Pratt &amp; Whitney. TOS employs 300 people repairing and upgrading
aircraft jet engine turbine blades and vanes.
'This industry is a truly global one,' says Dr Chen. 'We're like a garage,
with components coming in from anywhere in the world. It's evolving fast and
you have to constantly upgrade to accommodate new technologies.
'At our end of the business we don't feel the draught from the troubles of
the airline industry. We're working at full pitch and contemplating
expanding. People are still flying, engines still have to be overhauled.'
Tax incentives to high tech industries make Singapore attractive. The
government provides a wide range of back-up services. But even in a region
which is experiencing flyaway growth, the aerospace industry is highly
competitive.
Singapore has to work hard to maintain its position against other
fast-developing regional centres where labour costs are often considerably
lower. There are problems of labour shortages and an insufficient supply of
highly trained engineers.
China, viewed as an potential vast aerospace market, is a distance from
Singapore. Significantly, Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering recently announced
plans to move certain heavy overhaul facilities to China, both to tap into a
low-cost labour market and to develop its China business.
'The aerospace industry in this region is on a very steep growth curve,'
says Mr Schmidt of the FAA. 'If Asia Pacific governments can standardise
their aerospace regulations and co-ordinate their traffic control systems,
it will keep on expanding. There is enormous potential out here.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (15): Helicopter deal at risk - Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<TEXT>
THE AEROSPACE industry has more than a passing interest in the campaign
leading up to Canada's general election later this year.
One of the hottest political issues in recent months has been a CDollars
5.8bn order signed by the Progressive Conservative government for 50
European-designed EH-101 helicopters.
Mr Fred Sutherland, president of the Aerospace Industries Association of
Canada, says that as many as 400 Canadian companies, led by Montreal-based
Paramax, stand to benefit from the contract. They would also gain valuable
export work for future EH-101 sales to other countries.
The helicopters are required for search-and-rescue and anti-submarine work.
But by common consent, they are among the most costly of their type on the
market.
Coming at a time when the squeeze is on many other areas of public spending,
the contract has given the government's political opponents an irresistible
opening. The issue has been blown up even further by the coincidence that
the defence minister, Ms Kim Campbell, is both the frontrunner to succeed Mr
Brian Mulroney as prime minister and is in charge of the department which
ordered the helicopters.
The opposition Liberal party has promised it would try to cancel the
contract if it wins at the polls. Few would be surprised if the
Conservatives scaled back the order even before the election.
Any cut, however, would be a further setback to companies which are already
being forced to retrench as orders shrivel for both military and civilian
aerospace equipment.
Canada's aerospace industry is the world's sixth biggest. It has been hit by
many of the same blows inflicted on its counterparts elsewhere - the
recession, cuts in military spending and the deep slump in the civilian
aircraft market.
In a trend typical of the industry, Canadian Marconi, which is 52 per cent
owned by the UK's GEC, has chopped its workforce by a third over the past
three years. Marconi relies on military orders - the bulk of them from the
US - for three-quarters of its work. Like other companies, it is
diversifying in an attempt to lower its reliance on defence orders. It has
already bought a stable of global positioning products, and is on the
look-out for other acquisitions of products, technology or companies.
Bombardier, by far Canada's biggest aerospace company, has been able to
soften the blow somewhat by rationalising the activities of the businesses
it has bought over the past few years in north America and Europe.
For instance, the Canadair Regional Jet division, based in Montreal, has
pooled its marketing and customer support resources with de Havilland, the
commuter aircraft maker in which Bombardier bought a majority stake last
year. De Havilland's plant in Toronto has been assigned paintwork and
interior fitting for the RJ. It is also supplying wings for the latest model
of the Learjet, Bombardier's US subsidiary. Yet another Bombardier company,
Short Brothers of Belfast, Northern Ireland, is designing the Learjet 43
fuselage.
Still, intense competition in the commuter market has taken its toll on
Bombardier. De Havilland is closing its assembly line for two months this
summer. The RJ production line, currently producing two aircraft a month,
will reach full capacity of four a month, at least a year later than
planned.
With the airframe market so crowded, Mr Sutherland predicts that the
brightest spots in Canada's aerospace industry will be companies able to
find a specialised corner of the market.
Those which have already sprung to prominence include CAE Industries, a
world leader in manufacturing sophisticated flight simulators; Spar
Aerospace, the satellite communications company whose best-known product is
the 'arm' attached to US space shuttles; and Vancouver-based MacDonald
Dettwiler, which specialises in satellite-based data collection, also known
as remote sensing.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (14): GPA's fall from grace - Roland
Rudd on a crisis in aircraft leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S biggest aircraft leasing company recently averted examination,
the Irish equivalent to administration, by pulling off a last-minute deal,
subject to certain conditions, with GE Capital, the financial services arm
of General Electric of the US.
If GPA Group's 138 banks agree to restructure the group's Dollars 5.2bn of
debts, the agreement with GE will close in the next few months. GE has
agreed to buy 45 of GPA's aircraft worth Dollars 1.35bn, giving it breathing
room at least until the end of March 1994, and has an option to take a
minimum of 65 per cent of the equity for less than Dollars 300m.
GE will pay for its controlling stake only when it exercises its option,
which could be as late as March 1997. For a company that was once
capitalised at more than Dollars 3bn, GPA's fall from grace has been
spectacular.
The downturn in the world economy, in the world airline industry, in demand
for aircraft, and perhaps most important of all, in the supply of equity for
aircraft finance, led to GPA's problems.
Mr Craig Jenks, head of Airline/Aircraft Projects consultancy in New York,
believes the reduced availability of long-term, low cost funding which
adversely affected GPA was result of straightforward, legitimate credit
concerns.
'The definition of a creditworthy airline is increasingly murky. A year ago,
credit was assumed to vary directly with size, with the big carriers seen as
the top credits. This is no longer the case.'
Yet GPA has a big rival in the aircraft leasing business, namely the
International Lease Finance Corporation, the Beverly Hills subsidiary of AIG
insurance group, whose revenues have increased by more than 112 per cent
since 1989, from Dollars 334m to Dollars 731m at the end of 1992.
This contrasts with GPA's results, recently filed with the US Securities
Exchange Commission.
For the end of March 1993 GPA lost Dollars 128.1m of revenue, more than 11
per cent of its total lease revenue compared with Dollars 71m the previous
year and just Dollars 4.8m in 1989. The group was forced to repossess 26
aircraft; a further 27 aircraft remained on the ground while other
repossession costs and bad debts written off increased the total amount of
lost revenue. GPA's aircraft sales fell from Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 746m.
The only bright spot has been the core leasing business, which under Mr Phil
Bolger increased revenues from Dollars 435m to Dollars 528m. However, after
restructuring costs that are expected to run into hundreds of millions of
dollars, the group will make a significant loss for the year end to March
1993.
There are three main reasons why GPA has recently performed so poorly
compared with ILFC.
GPA's bulk-purchasing of aircraft, directly from the manufacturers, worked
well during the worldwide aircraft shortage that developed in the late
1980s. In the recession of the early 1980s airlines were financially
stretched. In the US their problems were compounded by deregulation.
As the aircraft manufacturers found their order flow falling, GPA and other
companies in the operating lease business offered cheap aircraft. Airlines
were also pleased with new sources of off-balance sheet finance.
However, GPA's success in this area promoted a further explosion of Dollars
17bn worth of options and firm orders in 1989. Two years later it was taking
delivery of 10 per cent of all new aircraft as the industry went into one of
its worst ever recessions.
The group misjudged the potential in eastern Europe. At the beginning of
1990 it allocated Dollars 2bn of aircraft to east Europe for the coming
decade. Mr Jenks says: 'This was a massive overestimate of ex-Comecon
ability to pay dollar rentals.'
As the market turned against GPA, it suffered a significant deterioration in
the credit quality of its lessees. Some defaulted, such as VASP, the
Brazilian airline, forcing GPA to repossess aircraft; others rescheduled
lease rentals, and American West Airlines filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
Faced with Dollars 12bn of firm orders from aircraft manufacturers to the
end of decade and more than Dollars 5bn of total debts, the company decided
at the beginning of 1992 to raise equity via a global flotation. But it was
pulled because of the lack of demand. The fate of GPA was determined largely
by its inability to raise that equity, which it has tried to do on many
occasions over the past year.
If the banks agree to the restructuring the group's bondholders receive
Dollars 762m in principal payments and Dollars 220m in interests. Mr Jack
Hersch, research director at MJ Whitman, which specialises in selling bank
debt, believes these payments are unrecoverable from future operations. He
recommends that investors avoid the bank debt at current prices of 75 cents
in the dollar and only purchase it as 66 cents or less.
Most of the GPA's lenders are relieved that the end of the group's
difficulties is at long last in sight. But the pessimists, such as MJ
Whitman, believe the GE deal is only a temporary fix to GPA's problems and
that only examination offers GPA the chance to restructure on a long-term
basis.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (12): Calls for support still unheeded -
Paul Betts on the message to government from industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEADS of Britain's aerospace industry have been filing in to a trade and
industry committee in the House of Commons during the past few months. Their
message has been invariably the same.
They warned that unless the government started digging deep into its pocket
to provide the industry with more research and development funds, the UK
risked losing its pre-eminent position as a world aerospace leader.
The industry, with an overall turnover of Pounds 11bn last year, accounted
for about 4 per cent of UK manufacturing output and about 3.5 per cent of UK
manufacturing employment. With exports of Pounds 7.7bn last year, it
accounted for 9 per cent of all UK exports of manufactured goods and
contributed about Pounds 2.5bn to the country's balance of trade in 1992.
An annual average growth of 12.6 per cent over the last decade means it has
also outperformed the rest of UK manufacturing industry in terms of
productivity, accor- ding to the Department of Trade and Industry.
But during the past three years of deep recession in the civil aerospace
sector, compounded by the decline in government defence spending, the
industry has faced pres- sures that are altering its shape and putting at
risk its long-term prospects.
Employment has fallen from 194,000 people in 1989 to 146,000 at the end of
last year. It is still falling as aerospace and defence companies continue
to announce new restructurings and job cuts.
Rationalisation has also led to greater consolidation in the industry and
the search for international partnerships and mergers.
British Aerospace, the coun- try's biggest company in this sector, has
forged an alliance with Taiwan Aerospace for its loss making regional jet
activities, resulting in the closure of its historic plant at Hatfield
outside London.
It is in advanced discussions to merge its guided weapons business with the
French Matra group and is looking for international partners for its
turbopropeller commuter aircraft business based in Scotland.
Rolls-Royce, the engine manufacturer, is also talking with Taiwan over the
possib- ility of Taiwanese investment in the family of regional aircraft
engines it is devel- oping with BMW of Germany. Like BAe, it is
rationalising its sites, closing its helicopter engine plant at Leavesden in
Hertfordshire and an aero- engine component facility at Parkside, Coventry.
In the aerospace component sector, Dowty has been taken over by TI group and
Lucas has been regularly cited as vulnerable to a takeover. Shorts of
Northern Ireland, the country's oldest aircraft manufacturer, has been
absorbed by Bombardier of Canada and has reached partnership agreements with
Thomson CSF of France in the short range missiles business and with another
French company, Hurel-Dubois, in the field of engine nacelles.
But the industry warns that it requires government support to develop a
coherent strategy for the future. 'Unless the UK develops such a coherent
strategy, our aerospace industry will fall behind,' says Mr Roy McNulty, the
president of Shorts who will also become this month president of the Society
of British Aerospace Companies, the industry's trade association.
In 1992, for the second consecutive year, the UK aerospace industry was
behind France in the world league. In terms of turnover, it is now in third
place after the US in first and France in second.
With the exception of Belgium, the industry has also been growing more
slowly that the aerospace sector of other European Community countries. EC
statistics show the UK aerospace sector grew by 1.5 per cent from 1980 to
1991, while its French counterpart grew by 4 per cent, Italy by 4.2 per
cent, Germany by 8 per cent, Spain by 7.3 per cent and the Netherlands by
10.2 per cent.
'The industry has not benefited from the hands-off approach of the UK. We've
simply not been spending enough and we've not been getting the same amount
of support as other countries,' Mr McNulty says.
In common with other indus- try leaders, he believes the government should
increase its support for aerospace research and development from the current
level of about Pounds 25m to about Pounds 100m a year.
'The government is spending more money on astronomy than on aerospace R&amp;D;
they should be supporting aerospace much more since it is one of the few
manufacturing success stories of this country instead of looking at the
stars in the sky,' he says.
Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, told the parliamentary committee
that Britain had been outmanoeuvred by foreign governments in the aerospace
business because of its unwillingness to collaborate with industry. He urged
government to intervene to help UK aerospace avoid 'continuing industrial
decline'.
In recent months, the dialogue between government and industry has improved
significantly. The government has continued to give its strong support for
the European Fighter Programme (now renamed Eurofighter 2000) which is still
clouded with uncertainty. But Eurofighter apart, the industry believes the
government must contribute more to ensure the UK remains at the leading edge
of new aerospace technological developments.
The SBAC has emphasised that aerospace companies will need to invest heavily
in new technologies at a time when product development costs are growing by
between 5 and 10 per cent a year above inflation. However, companies are
finding it increasingly difficult to sustain high rates of investment
because the return on their sales continues to be squeezed by recession, the
slump in the civil aircraft market and declining defence spending.
With the trend towards a global aerospace industry, the challenge for the UK
will be to play a leading role in the international partnerships being
forged. But UK companies will also have to be in a position to bring to the
table their own contribution to future aerospace technology and innovation.
As the Royal Aeronautical Society recently put it in its submission to the
parliamentary committee investigating the state of the British aerospace
industry: 'The government's aerospace policy priority should be the explicit
recognition of aerospace as a key industry. This has been one of the first
initiatives of the Clinton administration in the US.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (13): Cost rules out competition -
Michael Donne on plans for a second generation supersonic airliner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE outlook for any second-generation supersonic transport aircraft to
replace the Concorde in the first decade of the next century - say, around
2005, by which time Concorde will have been in service for close to 30 years
 -is still one of the great uncertainties in the world aerospace industry.
Many people in the manufacturing industry are convinced that such a venture
is technologically feasible, and that a market will emerge for it.
Governments for the most part remain cautious, and the airlines, ravaged by
the recession of the past 2 1/2 years, which has cost them billions of
dollars, are at present in no mood to offer enthusiastic encouragement to
such a venture.
Even those that are broadly in favour, such as British Airways and Air
France (the only two airlines now offering supersonic services with
Concorde), say that any successor must not only be profitable to buy and fly
from the start, but also environ- mentally acceptable in terms of noise and
emissions in the upper atmosphere.
To achieve these objectives, wide-ranging studies are being undertaken by
the world's main aerospace manufacturers, including Aerospatiale of France,
Alenia of Italy, British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace of western Europe,
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US, Tupolev of Russia and the Japanese
aircraft industry, together with leading engine builders General Electric
and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK.
These companies work together in a loosely-knit group, exchanging ideas,
with each still possessing a significant level of independence. There is as
yet no commitment by anyone to build anything. The notion of an eventual
second-generation SST, however, is expected to gain something of a boost by
President Clinton's insistence that the US government-owned National
Aeronautics and Space Administration must focus more attention and money on
aeronautics than on space affairs.
Such a major policy change by Nasa seems likely not only to stimulate
interest in second-generation SSTs, but also in such other new aircraft
types as a subsonic 600-plus seater. The US president's plans for a
commission to study ways of boosting the ailing US airline industry may also
give some impetus to a second-generation SST programme.
But all that appears to be emerging from the research so far is that an
aircraft seating about 300 passengers, with a range of 5,600 to 6,000
nautical miles and a speed of a little more than twice that of sound, or
1,500 mph, but with considerably quieter and cleaner engines, might well be
a feasible proposition for service from about 2005 onwards.
This is a still a long way from any kind of coherent and practicable design,
development, production and marketing plan.
In the technological field, much more work has to be done in refining
overall aerodynamic and structural design, in determining what new
lightweight materials could and should be used - and in such areas as
improved fuel consumption, reduced engine noise and less pollutant
emissions.
Of all these aspects, the latter two are among the most important. Even if
all the other technological difficulties are solved, no second-generation
SST will get off the ground if its engine noise and overall emissions
levels, especially of nitrogen oxide (NOx), in the upper atmosphere are
unacceptable.
This will be especially so since environmental pressures seem likely to
become even more severe, perhaps leading to a toughening of regulations on
noise and emissions in commercial aviation by the early years of the next
century.
Other areas which have to be addressed are those of cost, and the detailed
design, development and production arrangements.
Concorde's development and production cost of around Pounds 1.9bn in 1975
monetary terms is roughly equivalent to more than Pounds 7bn in today's
prices.
Even allowing for improvements in production techniques, such as
computer-aided design and manufacturing technology, and the extensive use of
cost and weight-saving materials, a big second-generation SST is unlikely to
cost less than Pounds 10bn for design, development and initial production.
At that price, there is unlikely to be a market for two competing designs,
if the currently loose consortium were to divide into two competing camps
(perhaps with the US pitted against the rest), even if market forecasts of
upwards of 300-plus such aircraft are considered realistic. Competing
designs would inevitably result in a bitter SST war, with all that means for
soaring costs, market fragmentation, and uncertain and even unprofitable
returns.
A more sensible scenario - already finding support in some of the companies
involved - would be for the consortium to become much tighter, with an
eventual agreement on a global co-operative venture, involving one common
concept acceptable to all and with each sharing in the design, development
and production programme, and in the costs.
Provided the industrial partners could put together a convincing case for
such a venture, supported by detailed market studies as to sales prospects,
it is probable that any funds the partners themselves could subscribe would
be supplemented by cash from the external financial community.
Two other factors must also be taken into account. The first is how rapidly
and how strongly the airline industry can recover from the current
recession, recoup its losses and return to profits in the era of renewed
traffic growth which lies ahead, thereby enabling it to embark upon
procurement of ambitious new types of aircraft.
The second is how well the external financial community can recover its own
shaken confidence in commercial aviation as a long-term money-spinner,
sufficiently not only to meet the airlines' needs for cash to finance their
recovery and renewed growth, but also to help the development of such a
speculative high-technology venture as a second-generation SST.
Alternatively, governments could become directly involved financially, but
past experience indicates there are many pitfalls in such an approach.
The best solution would be for everyone - aerospace industry, airlines,
governments and financial institutions worldwide - to become involved in a
partnership to develop and market one design that all could use.
Such a solution would be unprecedented in world commercial aviation, and
would perhaps be difficult to achieve. But it may yet prove to be the only
sensible and commercially viable way of ensuring that any second generation
SST emerges early in the next century.
Solving the technological and environmental problems may indeed be easier
than the problems of sorting out the ultimate industrial and financial
arrangements for such a major venture.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (11): Airport expansion takes off to
cope with traffic growth - Environmental factors now loom large
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY ALL airports are undergoing some form of modernisation and expansion
to enable them to cope with the anticipated growth in passenger and cargo
traffic over the rest of this decade.
The Gulf War in 1991 severely depressed passenger traffic. The International
Civil Aviation Organisation's statistics showed 1991 scheduled (domestic and
international) passenger numbers down 3 per cent from 1.16bn in 1990 to
1.13bn.
The subsequent recovery, albeit slowed by the recession, has been steady. In
1992, airlines carried 1.17bn passengers.
The ICAO scheduled passenger forecast is for average annual growth up to
2001 of 5 per cent a year worldwide, with total passenger numbers reaching
1.8bn and freight 29m tonnes a year by that year.
In Europe, that forecast means that the 1990s passenger total of 394m will
reach 653m by the year 2000 and more than 1bn by 2010, even allowing for
competition from the Channel Tunnel which is due to enter service in 1994.
The tunnel may siphon off several million passengers a year from direct air
services between the south-east of England and the near-Continent (Paris in
particular).
However, there will be less diversion from air to rail services the further
into western Europe or to the north and west UK that intra-European
passengers wish to travel.
Airport authorities are thus obliged to think now about how they will cope
with that anticipated traffic growth. They know it can take many years for
airport expansion projects to move from conception to operational status.
This is not only because such projects are among the biggest - and most
expensive - individual civil engineering tasks, but also because
increasingly their design and development are governed by environmental
factors which did not affect airport developments in the early commercial
aviation era.
In the UK, the average time for an airport development to pass through all
its planning, design, and construction phases is about 10 years. In some
parts of Europe, it can take much longer - it took 30 years of political,
financial and environmental wrangling before the Franz-Joseph Strauss
airport at Munich emerged last year.
Overall, it is estimated by the ICAO that between now and 2010, as much as
Dollars 350bn will have to be spent worldwide on airport projects to meet
traffic growth.
That figure represents construction costs alone - terminal buildings,
runways, aprons, and immediate direct access roads. It does not include
fitting out for full operational status - radars, landing systems,
furniture, internal decoration, and equipment costs such as fire equipment
and information systems.
Nor does it include ancillary costs that may be required, such as external
road and raid links or external urban infrastructure costs to cover such
supplies as gas, water, electricity, and aircraft fuel.
If these costs are included, the total world airport development bill for
the next 15 to 20 years could run closer to Dollars 400bn.
The figure may seem high but becomes more understandable when one considers
that the projected Terminal Five at Heathrow, London, is likely to cost
Pounds 800m to Pounds 900m. It will cater for up to 30m passengers a year,
bringing Heathrow's total to 80m passengers a year). The first phase of the
new Terminal Two at Manchester, which opened earlier this year, has cost
Pounds 265m. It will raise capacity from 12m to 18m passengers - a second
phase will lift it to about 24m.
A new terminal and associated facilities at Frankfurt is costing about
Pounds 588m (DM1.5bn). Schiphol is well down the road on a Dollars 2.2m (Fl
3.5bn) expansion programme including a big new passenger terminal.
Kansai Airport on reclaimed land in Osaka Bay, Japan, has cost more than
Pounds 500m and Chek Lap Kok off Lantau Island, to replace Hong Kong's
saturated Kai Tak, is likely to have cost even more when completed by 1997
with further outlays required for road links with the mainland.
The latter developments - for offshore airports - illustrate what may become
a trend in the light of increasing pressures on land and environmental
constraints on noise and pollutant emissions, especially in congested areas,
such as western Europe and south-east Asia.
Only a few places in Europe have room for new runways. Paris Charles de
Gaulle already has two and is destined to have a third by 1997, with
additional terminals now available and more planned, to enable the airport
to handle 80m passengers a year by the end of this decade.
Space is available for another two runways on the Roissy site. Collectively,
this makes Paris the biggest European rival to Heathrow for international
air passenger and cargo traffic.
Elsewhere in Europe, lack of space dictates that the expansion of facilities
in anticipation of traffic growth is largely being met by extensions to
terminals or the construction of new ones within existing airport
boundaries.
BAA, the former British Airports Authority, is planning Terminal Five at
Heathrow to fight competition from nearby continental airports such as
Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, and thus preserve London's pre-eminent
position in European commercial aviation.
The additional capacity will be achieved without additional runways. This
will mean greater use of existing and new wide-bodied aircraft and possibly,
within the next few years, 600-seat aircraft.
The increase is within the current runway capacity at Heathrow, with no
growth anticipated in night flights or the maximum hourly rate of movements.
Many argue that this expansion at Heathrow is unacceptable, and that
consideration should be given to alternative solutions before any government
decision on Terminal Five is taken in 1997 after a public planning inquiry
which is expected to start later this year.
One alternative is the private-venture Marinair plan for an offshore
two-runway airport on an artificial island in shallow water in the Thames
Estuary near Sheerness, with passengers being conveyed by high-speed rail
link from a main terminal at Tilbury on the north side of the Thames.
Marinair, although imaginative, is not without precedent - the UK planned an
offshore airport at Maplin off Essex in the early 1970s, but abandoned it at
the time of the first oil crisis in 1974. The Marinair plan has been
submitted to the government's special airports study group, Rucatse - Runway
Capacity in the South-East.
The project has begun to win considerable support, especially from
environmental groups around Heathrow, and much is likely to be heard about
it at the planning inquiry. Even so, its promoters know they will have to
work hard to win its acceptance over the Terminal Five concept, which is
being pressed strongly not only by BAA but also British Airways and other
airlines using Heathrow.
Whatever happens about Terminal Five, it is clear that the spate of airport
improvements and developments will gather pace through the rest of this
decade. Indeed, a continuously rolling programme of expansion is likely to
emerge to meet the inexorable growth in passenger and cargo traffic.
Even if offshore airports are currently the least favoured option for new
developments in the crowded European environment, they may be more seriously
considered early in the next century when planners will have to prepare for
traffic growth beyond 2025.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (9): Freedoms, but no bonanza - Single
European Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the Single European Market in air transport has now been in place
since January 1, its effect to date has been less dramatic than many people
both inside and outside the airline industry had hoped.
There have been few 'new entrant' airlines and few new routes and services.
Most of the activity on fares has been in reductions in a battle for the
premium fare business class passengers, rather than the major cuts 'across
the board' that many passengers had been led to expect.
The 'Third Aviation Package,' giving effect to the SEM in air transport gave
airlines three significant new 'freedoms'.
First was the right to set their own fares, subject only to tightly drawn
safeguards against unfair or predatory pricing, with the Commission itself
having the right to arbitrate in the case of disputes.
Second was that any airline meeting common safety, nationality and financial
fitness criteria would be entitled to an operating licence anywhere in the
Community (with restrictions on charter airlines being swept away) - the so-
called 'freedom of access'.
Member countries could still regulate access to domestic services for their
own airlines, but only on a non-discriminatory basis - they could not do so
just to protect national flag-carriers. Member-states also retained limited
scope for restricting access where congestion or environmental problems
could be demonstrated, but again only in a non-discriminatory way.
Third was the introduction of 'consecutive cabotage' - the right of an
airline from one country to operate limited capacity on onward domestic
route sectors in other member countries (ie London to Frankfurt and then on
to Berlin).
Full cabotage - the right of any airline to fly anywhere in the Community -
becomes effective only from April 1 1997.
Earlier hopes that all this would amount to a bonanza for airlines and air
travellers have foundered so far, with the European airline industry plagued
by serious operating difficulties. These have been complicated by the
airlines' efforts to achieve cross-border mergers or alliances so as to
become larger and stronger players in the international aviation arena.
One of the most difficult problems has been the persistence of the economic
recession, which has savaged airline balance sheets - overall worldwide
industry losses over the three years 1990-1992 are estimated at over Dollars
10bn, and will be further increased by end-93. A substantial proportion of
those losses has been incurred in Europe.
The result has been a paucity of new entrants to the industry. One has been
Air Russia, in which BA has a 31 per cent stake, along with Aeroflot and
other Russian aviation interests holding the other 69 per cent. Formally
created last year, Air Russia is expected to start services to Europe next
year at the latest.
But the emphasis has been on the introduction of new routes by existing
airlines (and even those have been comparatively limited), or increasing
frequencies on existing services. Some routes have even been axed - for
example, some European scheduled operations by Dan-Air were eliminated when
British Airways acquired that airline last autumn.
BA's German venture, Deutsche BA (formerly Delta Air), in which BA has a 49
per cent share, has introduced several new routes, including Berlin to
Moscow, Munich to Ankara, Stuttgart to Venice and Munich to Dresden, while
the French-based TAT, in which BA has a 49.9 per cent stake (with an option
on the other 50.1 per cent), has also launched new services.
By far the most active development has been in adding frequencies to
existing routes to meet traffic growth. That occurs where the airlines
concerned have either already been in possession of the necessary 'slots' -
take-off times - or have been able to gain additional ones, often by
juggling schedules to enable them to transfer less busy services to off-peak
periods, thus releasing precious peak-time slots for more profitable
operations.
Apart from the economic climate, the slots problem is probably now the most
serious constraint on the development of European air transport. Increasing
traffic, the lack of adequate ground infrastructure (not only runways but
also terminals), and the need for extensive improvements in air traffic
control throughout Europe (because of not only past inadequate investment
but also lack of harmonisation and integration of facilities throughout
Europe) are all part of the problem.
Efforts by the EC itself to solve the problem by preferential treatment for
new entrants, stricter rules to deal with airlines failing to use allocated
slots, and introducing more scheduling committees to control slot
distribution at major airports, can be only temporary palliatives. Until
increased infrastructural investment results in more runways, more terminals
and fully harmonised and integrated air traffic control, the slots problem
is likely to remain.
The most evident effect of the SEM so far has been in the fares arena. But
although Lufthansa cut fares early in the new year, and was followed by
other airlines, in recent weeks the activity has been focused more on
airlines' efforts to generate higher-yielding business class traffic,
leading to a 'class war' throughout Europe, with Aer Lingus, Air France,
British Midland and KLM among those involved, while other carriers have
introduced reduced-rate season tickets, or improved the quality of cabin
service.
All this, however, has stemmed more from a desire to win back the many
business travellers (and their employers), who in a recessionary economic
climate were rebelling against the high costs of business class travel in
Europe and trading down to economy class, than from a genuine desire on the
part of the airlines to use the SEM fares freedom to generate overall
traffic growth.
European air transport has not been a money-spinner for some time. BA's
1991-92 annual report showed that Europe (including the UK) generated
turnover of over Pounds 3.3bn (Pounds 911m of it from continental Europe),
but produced an operating surplus of only Pounds 20m, the airline's strong
profits in that year coming from other parts of the world. Many other
airlines are in a comparable, if not a worse, position.
This indicates that signif- icant cuts in European economy fares will do
nothing for airline balance sheets, and will only be sustainable if
accompanies by rigorous cost- cutting.
It remains to be seen just how many EC airlines will be in a fit financial
state by April 1 1997 to take advantage of the totally liberalised European
air transport market that then becomes effective.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (10): Lack of 'slots' hits the regionals
 -Michael Donne reports on a sector growing faster than the trunk airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER RECENT years, Europe has developed an exceptionally large and diverse
regional aircraft manufacturing industry.
But recently it has been suffering from a shortfall in new orders as the
economic recession has bitten into airlines' balance sheets, resulting in
severely curtailed aircraft re-equipment programmes.
In turn, manufacturers have been obliged to reduce aircraft production rates
and labour forces to survive. One consequence has been a renewed interest in
the possibilities of new strategic alliances, if not outright mergers. Some
have already occurred, and in the near future there may be further
significant realignments in the industry's overall structure.
The European regional aircraft industry supplies virtually every regional
airline need, from small 10-seat twin turbo-prop airliners to 100-plus seat
twin-jet aircraft.
Despite the recession, there is no lack of innovation, and many of the
companies involved are looking ahead with new ideas for product improvements
or entirely new aircraft models.
Few people doubt that better times will eventually emerge. Estimates for
world traffic growth through to the early years of the next century are
encouraging - the International Air Transport Association foresees European
air passenger traffic rising from the 1990 level of 394m to 501m by 1995,
653m by the year 2000, 821m by 2005 and to just over 1bn by 2010.
Though much of that traffic will continue to be handled by the trunk-line
carriers, especially on direct inter-city routes, the prospects for regional
operations are excellent. For underneath the trunk-line routes is a vast
network of complementary 'commuter and feeder' operations linking hundreds
of smaller towns and cities with each other as well as with the major 'hub'
airports in capital cities.
Such operations are essentially short-haul. The average sector distance in
western Europe is close to 400 kilometres or about 250 miles, but many
regional flights are for much shorter distances.
They are performed mostly by small turbo-propeller powered airliners, which
means that they are quieter, and therefore more environmentally and
neighbour- hood friendly, capable of using smaller airfields as well as the
big hub airports. The regionals thus provide a significant social as well as
economic role in worldwide commercial aviation.
As a result, regional airline traffic in western Europe has been rising
faster than that of the main trunk airlines in recent months. The European
Regional Airlines Association's members registered average growth in 1992 of
16 per cent over 1991, against about 5 to 6 per cent for the major trunks.
This trend seems likely to continue, as recovery from the recession
strengthens, and the effects of the EC's 'third aviation package' of
liberalisation measures, including freedom of market entry and access to new
routes, takes full effect (although unlimited 'cabotage' - the ability to
operate unfettered services in other countries - will not become effective
until April 1 1997).
However, like the larger airlines, the regional sector has its problems.
These include shortage of 'slots' (take-off times) at many big airports,
which makes the introduction of new routes and services more difficult, and
congestion in the air, which leads to delays for all operators.
Such constraints prevent the regionals from fulfilling their ambitions of
expanding faster in the past, and thus also serve to curb their requirements
for new aircraft.
Nevertheless, though worldwide orders for twin turbo-prop air- liners, still
the backbone of the world's regional fleets, fell away sharply in 1992, it
has been estimated that demand to the end of the decade will average 200 to
250 aircraft a year, with the small twin-jets, such as the Canadair 50-plus
seat Regional Jet and the new Fokker 70 of up to 79 seats, averaging about
50 a year. Through to 2010, the world market is estimated at several
thousand aircraft, worth around Dollars 60bn.
Most deliveries seem likely to go to the US and western Europe, where
regional airline development is already extensive, but demand for regional
aircraft elsewhere is also likely to be strong, especially in south-east
Asia where overall traffic growth is likely to be faster than anywhere else.
In all, worldwide from north America and western and eastern Europe to
Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Russia and Taiwan, there are more than 30
manufacturers of all sizes engaged in struggles for shares of this
extraordinarily large and diverse market.
Clearly, not all of these types are likely to make money in the years ahead,
despite the big demand that is expected to emerge. Rationalisation of the
industry is inevitable, to reduce industrial overcapacity, and achieve
higher production rates and better financial results.
This has already begun. In north America, de Havilland of Canada has been
acquired by Bombardier Group (which also includes Learjet of the US,
Canadair and Short Brothers of Belfast). In western Europe, Aerospatiale of
France and Alenia of Italy led the way some time ago with their alliance
through Avions de Transport Regional.
This has now been followed with both the British Aerospace alliance with
Taiwan on regional jet manufacture, and that between Fokker of the
Netherlands and Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, whereby Dasa took a 5l per
cent stake in Fokker.
Many see the Fokker move as a major step towards the inevitable
restructuring of Europe's regional aircraft manufacturing industry. Since
Dasa already includes Dornier, the Fokker deal gives the new group a
significant stake in the market with a wide range of typesand potential for
further developments - a new Fokker/Dasa 130-seater jet airliner is under
discussion.
Over recent months, virtually everybody has been talking to everybody else
about collaboration in some form or another. It has even been suggested that
there is scope in western Europe for setting up a new international
consortium of the Airbus type, devoted exclusively to meeting the world's
regional aircraft requirements.
It remains to be seen whether such a grandiose plan ever sees the light of
day.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (7): Phones start to ring again - David
Boggis finds business aviation executives more optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BOGGIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIMISM is returning to the UK's business aviation industry after a period
that left companies 'punch drunk' and 'shell-shocked', according to Mr Danny
Forman, chief executive of the General Aviation Manufacturers and Traders
Association.
Gamta, which works from offices near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, represents
business aviation in the form of companies ranging from equipment suppliers
to executive-jet dealers. It promotes the growth of general aviation which,
it explains, makes up more than 90 per cent of all UK-registered civil
aircraft.
With the dark days of recession finally over, Mr Forman says, 'the phones
are ringing' with inquiries - not just about aircraft acquisition but about
flying training.
Flying training is important because many of the industrial company
executives responsible for placing orders for aircraft or charter services
are pilots first and buyers later.
Upbeat confidence also comes over from Mr Anthony Hutton, director of the
Flight International Business and Light Aviation Exhibition, a
trade-oriented showcase for general aviation due to be open at North Weald
airfield, Essex, on September 8-11.
Mr Hutton, who notes that his show has no flying display or other crowd
entertainment, reports 'an extremely optimistic' view of the future among
companies. That has emerged since last September's Farnborough air show
after a deterioration in confidence over the preceding year.
Not all the indications are so buoyant. In some companies, the corporate
aircraft fleet has become a casualty of the recession.
United Biscuits has sold its King Air twin-turboprop. BP, the oil
multinational, has got rid of a much costlier fleet, all jets: an
intercontinental Gulfstream IV and two medium-range British Aerospace
125-800s (otherwise known as the Corporate 800).
United Biscuits explained: 'In the present climate, we could not justify the
aircraft.' The company's executives are still travelling, but mostly now on
airlines. If business is pressing, or if several people need to travel, the
company will charter an aircraft.
BP's decision follows a recent management change. The company said: 'We
decided it was not cost-effective to use the jets this way.' Now BP's use of
charters has increased, mainly to countries of the former Soviet Union.
Ms Janice Hahn, of the Business Air Centre, a London charter broker, agrees
that business from industrial companies has increased. Having received
little such business during two years of recession, BAC now finds old
clients returning with urgent requests.
'Bookings are up by about 30 per cent,' Ms Hahn says. The proportion of
business that BAC receives from industry is going up. 'They are going out
there to look for business.'
Business for the centre looks unlikely to come from Glaxo. The company
operates four jets and, after a review of costs, is getting rid of only one,
a Gulfstream IV. The other three are staying, Glaxo says, because 'it makes
efficient use of executive time'.
The aircraft that remain are a BAe 125-800, operated within the US; a
Dassault Falcon 900 used by the board; and another G-IV, which runs a
shuttle between Heathrow and the company's facility in North Carolina. There
is no direct airline flight on that route.
Glaxo comments: 'Our senior people are encouraged to visit the markets.'
Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB, makers of earth-moving equipment, says
of the company's BAe 125-800: 'It's my office in the air.' The company
places importance on the amount of work that can be carried out actually
during a flight.
Sir Anthony adds: 'We have looked at giving up (the jet) as one of the ways
of cutting overheads, but I think it is a valuable sales tool - particularly
during a recession when you have got to go out and get customers.'
JCB, which exports more than 70 per cent of its production, also operates an
Agusta A109 helicopter from its base at Rocester, Staffordshire. One recent
operation involved ferrying 20 clients from Rocester to a site at Milton
Keynes. It took four flights but, in all, the company says, the helicopter
proved 'more cost-effective than rail'.
Whatever the pros and cons of owning your own aircraft against chartering
time on someone else's, one dealer believes it can give a company the best
of both worlds. Air Hanson, of Blackbushe, Surrey, which distributes
Beechcraft's range - including the King Air, market leader in the
twin-turboprop cabin class - is offering aircraft on lease as well as for
sale.
Mr Mike Lacey, Air Hanson's aircraft sales manager, says: 'Aircraft are
being targeted by accountants as unnecessary expenses.' In the light of
that, leasing becomes attractive, as the aircraft remains off the balance
sheet.
Air Hanson's drive for more customers, in either form, reflects worries
about the health of the UK economy in relation to economies in Europe. 'A
great number of businessmen don't take the continent seriously,' Mr Lacey
says. He adds: 'My concern is that there has been a net exodus of aircraft
from the UK, and the French and German aviation community is growing.'
The dealer's campaign for lease customers emphasises the Beech Starship, a
strikingly unusual design with a canard foreplane, fins at the wingtips, and
turboprops driving pusher propellors. The Starship's impact on the European
market has so far been limited.
Its competitors include Cessna's Citation range of twinjets. Cessna, which
is based, like Beech, in Wichita, Kansas, has a representative office in
Surrey that handles marketing for the UK, the Iberian peninsula and the
Middle East.
Mr Barrie Sampson, regional sales manager for the Citation, says that, with
the 2,000th of the type recently rolled out, the aircraft has overtaken the
Learjet range to become market leader in the light jet category. Citation
clients may deal through a finance company that will own the jet and lease
it to the end-user, but Cessna wants sales, not leasing deals.
Mr Sampson is optimistic that his office will sell six or so of the 120
Citations that Cessna hopes to move this year. Over the past quarter, he
says, 'there has been a significant pick-up in the level of interest in the
market.'
His positive tone is echoed by Bob Crowe Aircraft Sales at Cranfield,
Bedfordshire. Mr Bob Crowe says the mood among buyers has altered in recent
months compared with the previous couple of years.
'We have never been so busy, talking to qualified buyers,' he says. 'Sales
this past six months have been extremely strong. There has been much
interest from UK buyers in the past two months.' Otherwise, many sales have
been to buyers abroad.
The company handles a big proportion of used aircraft, as well as dealing in
new aircraft sales of the turboprop Cessna Caravan I and II. Up to 25
aircraft a year pass through the company's hands, giving a turnover in a
typical year of Dollars 7m.
The 'punch-drunk' days for the UK business aircraft market seem to be over.
The industry is off the ropes and beginning to fight back.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (8): Cut-throat scraps over space -
Profitability in this high-risk sector is threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BLUE skies that once attracted aerospace companies to commercial space
markets are clouding over. A combination of technological and political
changes is saturating the markets for launchers, satellites and ground
equipment and threatening profitability and confidence in this high-risk
business.
Most of the commercial space industry is about telecommunications, a sector
being driven so quickly by technology that future growth prospects are being
undermined.
Each generation of satellites packs in yet more transmitting power, using
the latest miniaturised electronics. At the same time, the rocket
improvements have gradually pushed up the average weight of a satellite:
launchers can now put satellites weighing several tonnes into space.
The result is huge jumps in the numbers of telephone calls each satellite
can handle, a rate of increase far larger than the growth in the number of
long distance telephone calls actually made.
At the same time, improvements in rocket accuracy and satellite design mean
that satellites last longer in orbit. Lifespans have crept up from less than
10 years a decade ago to more than 14 years now. With satellites lasting
longer, they need to be replaced less often.
Add to that the power of undersea fibre optic cables, which compete with
satellites to carry long distance calls, and it is clear that the number of
new satellites that will be needed by the world's telephone companies is
likely to be limited.
That is not the end of the commercial space industry's concerns. While
established companies fight each other over a shrinking market, new
competitors are entering the fray. The end of the cold war has brought in
Russia and China, eager to sell their launch services for hard currency.
Japan, too, is nearing the end of the development of a large rocket, the H2,
and its electronics companies now supply many of the essential parts of
US-built satellites.
The non-commercial space industry is suffering as well, as governments seek
to cut spending. Nasa, the US space administration, is in the throes of a
re-organisation triggered by budget cuts. And the European Space Agency has
cancelled or postponed several large projects such as the Hermes manned
space station. The governments of France and Japan are exceptions with their
increased space budgets.
These developments have affected all three parts of the space industry,
rocket launchers, satellites and ground equipment.
In launchers, Europe's French-led Arianespace consortium is strengthening
its grip on the market. Rivals in the US have slipped further behind in the
last year. Confidence in General Dynamics has suffered badly as three of the
last eight Atlas launches have failed while McDonnell-Douglas' Delta rocket
is smaller than launchers made by Arianespace and is being left out in the
trend towards larger satellites.
China, too, has been hit by question marks over who was to blame for the
failure of a launch late last year. The giant Russian space industry is
being constrained by tight restrictions placed on it by the US government.
And despite the uncertainties facing Russia, China and General Dynamics,
Japan will not try to sell its H2 rocket for commercial contracts.
Executives at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, one of the contractors on the
Y260bn project, say the market is simply too small for another new entrant.
Even Arianespace faces an uncertain future. The next model of launcher is
the Ariane 5 which was designed partly to put the European manned space
station Hermes into orbit. Now it will have to rely more on the commercial
sector.
In satellites, Hughes Aircraft of California maintains its dominant
position, largely against US rivals GE and Loral.
Between them, the US companies have all but overwhelmed the European
communications satellite construction industry. Some Europeans have carved
niches as subcontractors supplying parts such as solar panels for US
satellites. Others have not even been able to do this: British Aerospace,
for example, has all but abandoned satellite construction and was unable to
find a buyer for the remains of its business.
Many, such as France's Aerospatiale, and Matra-Marconi, a joint venture
between France's Matra Group and the UK's GEC, rely on domestic or European
public sector contracts for scientific research and earth observation
projects.
Ground equipment markets are dominated by Japanese companies such as
Mitsubishi, NEC and Toshiba. But they, too, are concerned that space markets
are limited.
Mr Hiroshi Kanai, general manager at Mitsubishi Electric's commercial space
programs department, says there is pressure in Japan to buy US technology to
help reduce the Japanese trade surplus.
The increasing power of telecommunications ground equipment, in parallel
with developments in satellites, means that the market will not grow
quickly, says NEC, Japan's biggest supplier of antennas.
Despite all these concerns, there are still opportunities for growth for the
space industry. One that many have pinned their hopes on is the construction
of global mobile telephone communications networks based on satellites.
There are several rival proposals. Motorola, an electronics company that was
at the forefront of the spread of conventional cellular telephone networks,
has its Iridium scheme. The plan is to launch 66 small satellites to ring
the planet and allow mobile telephone users to dial anywhere from almost
anywhere.
Similar schemes, using fewer satellites, have been proposed by Loral and
Inmarsat, the international mobile telecommunications consortium, and
others. If any took off, satellite builders and ground equipment makers
should enjoy a stream of orders.
Rocket builders might not fare so well. Since the satellites for the network
would be small, the number of organisations able to launch them increases.
Several US companies could launch small satellites, perhaps with rockets
carried into the upper atmosphere on aircraft. Lockheed, for one, has plans
to cut launch prices to as low as Dollars 14m for such satellites - less
than a quarter of typical rates on existing launchers.
Even this might not be enough to match Russia. It can launch several small
satellites at a time on converted multiple warhead ballistic missiles.
The threat of such competition from Russia last month led to the US to
impose strict limits on the frequency of Russian launches. It also put a
floor on the price that Russia could offer.
Critics point out that there is no provision for retaliation against Russia
should the deal between the two countries be broken. They argue that a
similar agreement with China failed to prevent deep discounting by Beijing.
Such scraps are likely to continue as the space business becomes more
cut-throat. The combination of technological and political change has
transformed the space industry from one accustomed to relative certainties,
with few suppliers and few customers, to one where uncertainty rules. It is,
perhaps, no longer a business that can be run by former civil servants and
air force chiefs, but one that will have to live by the rough rules of
international commerce.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (5): The bigger, the better - Why the
trend to larger widebody jets seems unstoppable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SIZE rather than speed is becoming the dominant trend in commercial
aviation. 'The next big challenge for the industry will be the development
of ever-larger jumbos capable of carrying 600 to 800 passengers rather than
a second generation supersonic airliner,' says Mr Adam Brown, planning
director at the European Airbus consortium.
The average size of airliners has been growing steadily during the past
decade from 176 seats in 1980 to 193 seats last year. Boeing, the world's
biggest commercial aircraft manufacturer with about 60 per cent of the
western market, forecasts the average will increase to about 227 seats by
2010. It expects larger widebody aircraft will account for 58 per cent of
all seats delivered during the next 18 years.
This trend towards larger aircraft is driven by two factors: long-range,
non-stop travel is expanding while on shorter routes big aircraft are seen
as a way of beating congestion at busy airports. The new generation of
jumbos also offers airline operators the opportunity to reduce their
operating costs through a combination of enhanced technology and greater
capacity.
Although the recession in the airline industry has forced the three big
manufacturers - Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus - to cut production
following a series of order cancellations and deferrals from financially
pressed airline customers, all have forged ahead with development of new
widebody aircraft.
Boeing, which has dominated the long-distance widebody market with its
four-engine 747 jumbo, is now in advanced development of the 777, a new
family of twin-engine widebody airliners with versions for medium range
flights and others for longer routes.
It has invested about Dollars 4bn in the development of the 777 which will
enter service in 1995. The three Japanese aerospace companies (Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries) have
participated closely in this programme with a share of around 20 per cent of
the new aircraft.
The European Airbus consortium is now mounting an increasing challenge
against Boeing's dominance of the big widebody market with its new family of
A330/A340 widebodies. The A340 entered service this year. This four-engine
airliner boasts the longest range of any civil aircraft capable of flying
non-stop with a full passenger load for 16 hours or more. Later this year,
the European consortium will start delivering to customers the A330, the
twin engine sister of the A340.
In this market, McDonnell Douglas is competing with its MD11 three-engine
jet. Although it has been retrenching heavily in the face of the industry
slump, it is continuing to study the development of a larger stretch version
of the MD11 as well as of a new, even bigger four-engine jumbo, the MD12.
However, these plans depend on the company's ability to complete the
restructuring of its commercial aircraft activities by finding new
international partners to invest in these operations and help fund the
development of new large aircraft. McDonnell Douglas attempted to negotiate
a partnership with Taiwan Aerospace but the Dollars 2bn deal finally fell
through last year. The US company is now talking to potential partners in
the Asia-Pacific region as well as other parts of the world to create a new
joint partnership company for its commercial aircraft activities.
Apart from the big three western civil aircraft manufacturers, the Russian
aerospace industry, with a long history of producing very large aircraft, is
now also seeking to penetrate the western widebody market. It is forming
alliances with western aerospace partners to develop jets for the
Commonwealth of Independent States and other world markets.
To compete against the A330/A340, the 777 and the MD11, the Russian
manufacturer Ilyushin has co-operated closely with US manufacturers to
develop the Ilyushin 96M. This four-engine widebody with seating capacity
for 386 passengers is the fruit of co-operation between the Russians, the US
Pratt &amp; Whitney group, which is providing the engines for the new aircraft,
and Rockwell-Collins, which is supplying the avionic equipment and systems.
European and other US aerospace companies are now increasingly interested in
working with the Russian industry. While strong on airframes, the Russians
are seeking western help in particular for engines, avionics and cabin
interiors to develop new airliners according to western standards for
aircraft certification and passenger comfort.
But the biggest challenge of all for the commercial aircraft manufacturers
will be the development of a very large aircraft capable of seating up to
800 passengers. Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas have all been studying
plans to build a super jumbo. They have already had extensive meetings with
potential airline customers to discuss their needs and the possible timing
when they would require a very large aircraft to enter service.
'Both Boeing and Airbus came to see us some time ago to ask us whether we
had greater need for a new generation supersonic aircraft or a super jumbo.
We said the big aircraft,' says Mr Kenzo Yoshikawa, purchasing director of
the Japanese airline All Nippon Airways. Other large carriers in the
Asia-Pacific region, the US and a few in Europe have also expressed interest
in a new large aircraft to enter their fleets at the turn of this century.
But the development of a super jumbo faces significant technical and
financial hurdles. 'It's always a nightmare building a big aircraft,' says
Mr Ken Brundle, head of aircraft operations at Shorts, the Belfast-based
aerospace company.
An aircraft of such size will require a significant amount of composite
materials to keep its weight down. Many safety issues are raised, such as
how to evacuate large numbers of passengers from both the top and upper
decks of a double deck airliner. Terminal gates will probably need to be
redesigned and runways strengthened. For maintenance, new extra large
hangars will have to be built. 'Existing ground facilities and equipment are
simply not adequate to handle such a double deck giant aircraft,' says Mr
Hideo Aoki, the engineering and maintenance director of ANA.
The costs of developing a super jumbo are an even bigger obstacle. The
manufacturers estimate development would cost well over Dollars 10bn. 'From
an economic standpoint the crucial question will be how many of these
aircraft will be needed. Estimates range from 200-300 aircraft to around
600-700 aircraft. I think 300 is probably the more realistic number,' Mr
Yoshikawa says.
At these costs, no single company could contemplate assuming the full risk
of developing a super jumbo on its own. The only way forward will be through
wide-scale co-operation between big manufacturers.
This has already led to perhaps a significant move in international
collaboration in the commercial aircraft industry with Boeing's decision to
join forces with the four Airbus partners (Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche
Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain) to study jointly a super
jumbo. These companies are now also seeking to encourage others to join them
including McDonnell Douglas in the US, the Russians and Japanese
manufacturers. All agree that there is unlikely to be room for more than one
super jumbo project.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (6): Giants emerge to jostle for
position in world market - Paul Betts on how airlines are adapting to lower
traffic growth rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE AIRLINE industry is in a state of turmoil. 'All indications are that the
early 1990s will be remembered as perhaps the most critical period in the
industry's evolution,' says Mr Karl-Heinz Neumeister, the secretary general
of the Association of European Airlines.
Although traffic is now recovering after the slump caused by the combined
effects of the Gulf war and economic recession, many world airlines are
continuing to show heavy losses as they struggle to survive in an
increasingly competitive market.
Apart from the traffic slowdown - in 1991 airline traffic fell by 3 per cent
to show the first decline since the second world war - airlines have had to
adapt to a regulatory revolution which has seen liberalisation spreading
from America to Europe and in other regions of the world.
There are signs of a structural change in the traditional 'boom and bust'
cycle of the industry. Previous cyclical downturns have been followed by
sharp recoveries. In the current cycle, however, the pick-up has so far not
only been slow but has seen continued pressure on airline revenue yields.
While airlines have seen their lower yielding economy cabins filling up with
passengers again, first and business class traffic has remained sluggish.
Some airlines have reported drops of between 10 to 20 per cent in first and
business class passengers this year, while others say the trend of
passengers downgrading from first to business or from business to economy
class is continuing.
The capacity offered by airlines has also been outstripping passenger
demand, although International Air Transport Association figures suggest
that capacity is gradually becoming more balanced with demand in recent
months. But there are still about 800 aircraft lying idle in the Arizona
desert because of lack of demand, and the industry will remain under heavy
pressure until the excess capacity in the market is finally absorbed.
Overcapacity has fuelled fierce fare wars as carriers have attempted to fill
their seats and maintain market share at the expense of very poor financial
returns. As a result, the airline industry reported a heavy loss of around
Dollars 5bn on international scheduled services in 1992. Accumulated losses
during the past three years now total more than Dollars 10bn and the
industry is expected to show another big loss this year.
Both the airline industry and commercial aircraft manufacturers have been
revising downwards their estimates for long-term traffic growth, which will
be principally driven by real gains in gross domestic product in the
industrialised markets. They now expect overall traffic growth to average 5
to6 per cent a year in the 1990s. The Asia-Pacific region is likely to grow
most rapidly by about 10 per cent a year, while growth will be only around 4
per cent a year in the more mature European and North American markets.
But with traffic growth rates down from the high levels of the previous
decade and more competition, an increasing number of airlines are
struggling. One response has been to cut costs in an effort to improve
productivity. Nearly 50,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1991 as a
result of restructuring. But this has not been sufficient and the past two
years have seen a number of airlines disappear, including famous names such
as Pan Am and Eastern and younger ones including Air Europe.
More structural adjustments will be necessary ifairlines are to survive in
the new world order. At the same time, the twin pressures of deregulation
and the increasing globalisation of the airline market are accelerating the
consolidation of the industry.
In the US, after more than 10 years of deregulation, the industry is already
heavily concentrated around a handful of giant carriers, with American
Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines the three largest. Although
these large carriers have also been hit by big losses and are cutting
capital expenditure, they continue to have their eyes firmly set on
international expansion in a drive to become global carriers.
In Europe, consolidation is now gathering momentum as airlines scramble to
forge strategic alliances and partnerships with other carriers to build up
their critical mass and compete in the global market.
British Airways has led the way by investing around Pounds 600m in the last
four months in a series of strategic stakes in other airlines including
USAir, Qantas of Australia, the regional French carrier TAT and a small
German airline called Delta. It has also taken over the loss-making
operations of Dan Air, the UK regional carrier based at London's Gatwick
airport, and of Plymouth-based Brymon.
BA has been able to take advantage of its financial strength and the
weakness of others to build this formidable set of global alliances. But
other European carriers are now also actively seeking to increase
co-operation links with other carriers to survive in the global market.
One of the most significant developments of recent months has been the
partnership discussions between four European medium-sized airlines -
Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Austrian Airlines - aimed at combining their operations under the umbrella
of a single jointly-owned company. Between them, the four carriers would
create Europe's biggest airline and what they call 'a fourth force' in the
European market to compete against the big three - British Airways, Air
France and Lufthansa.
Air France has also been increasing its mass by absorbing UTA, the French
independent long haul carrier, taking over Air Inter, the domestic French
airline, and acquiring a strategic equity stake in Sabena of Belgium. For
its part, Lufthansa is currently negotiating an alliance with American
Airlines and discussing partnerships with other carriers including Austrian
Airlines.
While jostling to position themselves in the global market, airlines
continue to be worried by the problems of congestion in the skies, because
of inadequate air traffic control systems, and on the ground, because of the
slow pace of new development at crowded airports. Both threaten to clip the
wings of growth when the recovery in air travel starts gathering steam. As
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, recently put it: 'The overriding
challenges we face are essentially two: the increasing level of deregulation
in the industry and the old chestnut of infrastructure.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (2): Upturn is still awaited - Paul
Betts on the prospects for commercial aircraft manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT manufacturers around the world have been scrambling to
cut production and employment so as to adapt to the siege-like conditions
facing the industry.
Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets with about 60
per cent of the world market, is reducing overall production by 35 per cent.
It announced this year it would cut 28,000 jobs over the next 18 months.
McDonnell Douglas, now trailing behind the European Airbus consortium as the
world's third commercial aircraft maker, is reducing its workforce by 10 per
cent this year after cutting it by 20 per cent last year. By the end of
1993, the group's overall employment will have dropped from 121,000 in 1990
to about 78,000.
All four Airbus partners - Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - have had to scale down output to match
the slowdown in the European group's expected deliveries of new aircraft
during the next three years. Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director,
says the consortium's production is now expected to grow from about 150
aircraft this year to about 170 in 1995, compared with an original target of
225 in 1995.
The industry's cyclical downturn has been longer and fiercer than previous
ones. Since the advent of the jet age, the world travel industry has
suffered three major slumps which were followed by sharp recoveries. But the
situation is different this time because the slump has coincided with a
decline in the defence side of the aerospace business, which helped sustain
manufacturers during the previous cyclical downturns.
Although all three big manufacturers remain confident about long-term
prospects for the industry, they are uncertain when the market will finally
pick up. Most conservative estimates expect the upturn to occur around 1994
or 1995. Recovery is likely to be more gradual and less vigorous than in
previous cycles.
Airlines, which have made a cumulative loss of more than Dollars 10bn on
international scheduled services over the past three years, are continuing
to defer and cancel new aircraft orders booked during the buying spree of
the late 1980s.
Boeing now concedes in the 1993 edition of its annual industry market
outlook that 'it was evident that airlines and leasing companies were
ordering more aircraft than was necessary to meet demand,' and that the
manufacturers in turn increased production to meet this demand.
In 1989 alone, at the height of the order boom, a total of Dollars 90bn
worth of new jet orders was booked by the manufacturers. Bookings last year
fell to Dollars 29.9bn in reaction to overcapacity, difficulties in
financing, slow traffic growth and monumental airline losses.
Although cancellations and order deferrals will eventually slow down as the
balance between capacity and demand improves, a significant problem will be
financing. 'The airline industry is plagued by growing financial
difficulties,' acknowledges Airbus in its 1993 market study. 'Current
financial difficulties mean that many airlines are unable to raise funds to
replace ageing fleets,' it adds.
The replacement of older aircraft together with air travel growth are the
two main components for aircraft demand. Airbus expects some 2,100
narrowbody jets and 500 widebody airliners to be retired over the next five
years to make way for some 3,300 new aircraft. Boeing for its part estimates
that of the 12,005 aircraft to be delivered between now and 2010, 25 per
cent will be to replace older jets.
So far, however, the rate of retirements has been much slower than the
manufacturers had expected. Airlines have delayed ordering new equipment in
the face of dire financial difficulties. New sources of financing will also
have to be found to support the Dollars 815bn that Boeing believes airlines
will need to invest in new aircraft over the next 18 years to meet traffic
growth and their fleet renewal needs.
In spite of the cost reduction and restructuring programmes launched by
airlines during the latest recession, all are finding it hard to make any
adequate return. One reason is the continuing decline in real terms of their
revenue yields and margins are expected to remain under pressure even when
stronger recovery finally occurs. In contrast, new aircraft prices have been
constant or increasing in real terms.
'A quantum reduction in aircraft price through production cost improvements
is necessary for the financial health of both the airline industry and the
manufacturing industry,' British Airways, one of the few large profitable
carriers, recently warned. Around the world more than 700 aircraft, which
could be used, are grounded or for sale. While both the airline and aircraft
manufacturing industries are near the trough of their economic cycle, BA
says: 'Unless there is an early resumption of long-term growth, together
with new aircraft prices that airlines can afford, current orders could be
further threatened with implications for the whole supply chain.'
Manufacturers have responded by introducing greater automation in design,
manufacturing and assembly processes to improved dramatically productivity.
But this has not been sufficient to offset the ever-increasing costs of new
product development.
Non-recurring research and development costs have been growing far more
rapidly than inflation at a time when balance sheets have continued to be
squeezed by the recession in the industry. At the same time, no manufacturer
can clearly afford to risk abandoning or placing on ice future product
development programmes if it wants to remain competitive in the longer term
and take advantage of the eventual market recovery.
This has pushed manufacturers towards increasing international co-operation
and seeking risk-sharing partners for new project developments. Even Boeing,
reluctant in the past to share its programmes, has been actively talking for
the first time of forging equity links with other international partners.
For Boeing the practice of contracting with global suppliers was at first
small, but it has been steadily growing over the years. Its first 707 had
almost no foreign content. The 727 had less than 1 per cent, the 737
slightly more. Collaboration with other partners expanded with the 767 when
the Seattle manufacturer established risk-sharing agreements with Japanese
manufacturers and the Italians. The Japanese subsequently took a 20 per cent
risk-sharing stake in the 777, Boeing's big twin engine widebody programme,
already at an advanced stage of development.
McDonnell Douglas sees the solution of its problems in collaboration and
global partnership. Mr John McDonnell, chairman of the US aerospace and
defence group, wants to set up a new commercial aircraft company with a
series of international equity partners prepared to invest in the
development of new products.
Mr McDonnell failed to clinch a partnership last year with Taiwan Aerospace,
which was proposing to invest Dollars 2bn for a 49 per cent stake in the
Douglas civil aircraft business based in Long Beach, California. But the US
group says it is engaged in mature discussions with a number of potential
partners, including several in the Asia-Pacific region.
If successful, it would give McDonnell Douglas a similar risk sharing system
operated by Boeing with the Japanese manufacturers and by the four European
manufacturers in the Airbus consortium. 'Airbus has become a model for such
ventures in the aerospace and other capital-intensive industries,' says Mr
Pierson.
In the span of 20 years, Airbus has developed a highly sophisticated system
for the integration of complex industrial processes across Europe, created a
network of co-operation between major European manufacturers, and set in
motion an irreversible trend of trans-national co-operation in the industry.
'Investments in research and development, production and after-sales service
for large civil aircraft were, are and probably will remain, simply
enormous,' says Mr Pierson. 'A new aircraft programme today is in the
Dollars 3-4bn bracket with a maximum risk of exposure close to Dollars
7-9bn. Such risks are simply too much for a single manufacturer to bear,' he
explains.
In the face of all these pressures, new realignments are starting to emerge
which could lead to a profound transformation in the structure of the
commercial aircraft industry over the next decade. The first eloquent signs
that this is beginning to happen is the agreement at the end of January
between Boeing and the four partners of Airbus, its main European rival, to
study the joint development of a super jumbo capable of seating up to 800
passengers.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (4): Helicopters held back - Delivery
forecasts have been cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWS will be when a helicopter programme happens on time and according
to plan. In both the US and Europe, all major military projects - the
backbone of the industry - have been subject to delays in development or
procurement.
Manufacturers have scaled down their forecasts for deliveries over the next
10 years, particularly on the military side. But total deliveries of civil
helicopters were lower than expected last year at 650, compared with more
than 1,000 in each of the previous two years and a rate of around 1,500 a
year in the early 1980s before sales slumped.
Excluding small piston-engined craft, industry predictions are for a gradual
recovery on the civil side from last year's 380 deliveries, with predicted
averages of close to 500 a year up to 2002.
In the military sector, industry forecasts point to a market of about 12,600
helicopters in the 20 years from 1992 to 2011, worth about Dollars 105bn.
North America is expected to account for about 4,000, Europe 3,300,
south-east Asia and Australasia about 2,500 and the Middle East 1,100. Peak
delivery levels are expected from 2003 to 2008.
What the industry will look like by then is a subject for speculation.
Westland has continued to talk about closer ties with Agusta, while
Eurocopter, the joint venture between Aerospatiale of France and Germany's
Deutsche Aerospace, advocates broader European links. Since last year.
McDonnell Douglas, which bought its helicopter division from Hughes in 1983,
has been in the market for 'joint ventures, partnership or sale'.
This might mean different product lines going to different companies.
Eurocopter is understood to have been interested in a purchase last year,
but transfer of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter to a foreign company was
clearly out of the question.
McDonnell Douglas sees the helicopter division drawing good profits from the
Apache for years to come. But one executive commented: 'It's hard to make a
successful company out of a single product.'
The Apache is being put forward, in a joint bid headed by Westland, as the
leading contender for a UK army contract due to be decided next year for
some 100 helicopters, worth about Pounds 2bn. Among four other groups
invited to bid, the main rivals are the CobraVenom, an updated version of
the veteran Bell SuperCobra led by GEC-Marconi Avionics, and the Eurocopter
Tiger, which is under development for French and German forces. British
Aerospace is heading the Tiger bid for the UK. The helicopters are due to
enter service - barring further delays - in 1998.
Two European naval and utility helicopter projects - the
Franco-German-Dutch-Italian NH-90 and the Anglo-Italian EH101 - are now
fully under way. The EH101 last year won a Canadian contract for 50 naval
helicopters, but that would be vulnerable under a change of government.
In the US, the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, beset by two
prototype crashes and attempts by the last US administration to stop the
programme, is expected to be reinstated. But army plans, including Apache
upgrades and purchase of a fleet of 1,292 Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche
scout helicopters are being reviewed. The Dollars 40bn Comanche programme
has been slowed down, with the operational deadline slipping four years to
2003.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (3): After the cold war - David White on
the cost of military aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY CAN our air forces not make do with simpler aircraft? Why is it
necessary to push technology - and costs - to such extremes?
The questions, frequently asked nowadays in a climate of declining defence
budgets, are not new.
If governments had taken the advice given to them in 1917 by Cyril Hall, in
his book By Land, Sea and Air, they would have stuck to biplanes. In a
section on Modern Weapons of War he pooh-poohed the hopes that Germany, in
particular, had vested in the monoplane.
'The monoplane,' he wrote, 'has a very limited speed range. It maximum speed
may be anything up to 120 miles an hour, but its minimum is seldom less than
90 miles an hour. You can see what a grave disability is this high speed.
Accurate observation is impossible, because the observer is travelling too
fast clearly to see what is taking place on the ground. And it is too high
for bomb-dropping, For what sort of chance of hitting the place at which it
is aimed has a missile dropped from an aeroplane travelling at 90 miles an
hour?'
This argument seemed to justify his conclusion: 'It is highly unlikely that
the development of the monoplane will be carried further.'
Its echoes can be heard today. The end of the cold war has, in the past
couple of years, brought a whole series of new combat aircraft projects
under criticism and scrutiny. Because of the time needed nowadays to bring
new aircraft into production, the fighters now under development were all
conceived when the cold war was at its height.
In the US, industry has sensed the imminent crunch. General Dynamics' sale
to Lockheed late last year of its Fort Worth aircraft operation, maker of
the successful F-16, means that there are now two primary poles for design
and manufacture - McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed.
Lockheed was already linked with General Dynamics in the F-22 project, the
top-of-the range fighter designed to succeed McDonnell Douglas's F-15. Until
the F-22 award in 1991, Lockheed seemed to be in the process of being
sidelined after the completion of its F-117A stealth aircraft programme. Now
the Fort Worth acquisition, says Mr Dan Tellep, Lockheed's chairman and
chief executive, has 'fundamentally transformed the landscape of military
aircraft in the US.'
Even if the F-22 project were cancelled - one of the options, if not the
most likely, under consideration at the Pentagon - Lockheed would count on a
role in whatever took its place. 'It wouldn't devastate us,' says Mr Tellep.
Priority has been given by the new Pentagon team to sorting out the four new
tactical aircraft projects planned for the US Air Force and Navy. All are
clearly not affordable in the same timeframe. The odds favour the F-22,
although possibly with a curtailed and slower programme, and the new E/F
versions of McDonnell Douglas's carrier-borne F/A-18 Hornet. This would be
at the expense of plans for a new multi-role fighter and the A/F-X naval
strike aircraft, successor to the A-12 project, cancelled two years ago.
Northrop's B-2 strategic stealth bomber programme has already been cut to 20
aircraft, and the Pentagon has threatened to stop the McDonnell Douglas C-17
heavy transport aircraft and find an alternative to the troubled Dollars
41bn programme. Other options for heavy airlift, if the contractor fails to
meet requirements, are versions of Boeing's 747 and 767 airliners, a
life-extension of the current Lockheed C-141 Starlifter or a restart of
production of its C-5 Galaxy.
Europe's moment of panic appears to have passed with the patching-up last
December of differences between Germany and Britain on the future of the
European Fighter Aircraft.
The existence of three new-generation European fighters - the Swedish JAS 39
Gripen, the French Rafale and the Anglo-German-Italian-Spanish Eurofighter,
all of similar delta-wing design with 'canard' foreplanes - may seem
excessive. But all are now secure, even though Germany still places a
question-mark on its commitment on the production phase of Eurofighter.
The lightweight, multi-role Gripen (JAS is an abbreviation for fighter,
attack and reconnaissance) is the furthest down the road. This is despite
the setback suffered in 1989 when its first prototype crashed (not a unique
occurrence: the US F-22 had a similar mishap in April 1992 at Edwards Air
Force Base in California). The first production model of the aircraft -
single-engined, in contrast to the twin-engined Rafale and Eurofighter -
flew in March, and 140 are on order for delivery between now and 2001.
Dassault's Rafale, launched at the same time as the Eurofighter, has stolen
a march on its heavier four-nation rival inasmuch as it at least has
prototypes flying. But the programme could be vulnerable to cuts or further
delays in purchase plans. Three different versions are being built -
one-seat and two-seat aircraft for the air force and a carrier version for
the navy. Current plans are for some 320 in total with the first navy
squadron entering service late in 1998 and the first air force squadron at
the end of 2000.
Preliminary discussions are already under way on new collaborative
arrangements for the next generation. British Aerospace has begun contacts
with Saab on a possible aircraft to fill the gap in the market now being
successfully occupied by the Hawk trainer-cum-fighter. It has also talked to
the French on the next frontline fighter to succeed the Rafale and
Eurofighter. France cannot afford to go it alone again, and British
industrialists and officials believe that any future project on this scale
in Europe can be undertaken only on the basis of Anglo-French co-operation.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Ministers warned on Whitehall market testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS have been warned that they could lose control of public
expenditure if Civil Service financial management functions are contracted
out to the private sector.
Mr Syd Norris, principal finance officer at the Home Office, has told the
Treasury that plans to contract out internal audit and accountancy services
threaten to reduce 'control over the cost, content and quality' of Whitehall
spending.
Several departments are putting financial management functions out to tender
as part of the government's market-testing programme launched last November.
They include the Department of Social Security, which pays out Pounds 80bn a
year in pensions and benefits, and Customs and Excise, which collects Pounds
70bn a year in indirect taxes.
Mr Norris's warning comes amid signs that the government's market-testing
programme has fallen several months behind schedule. Some of the delay has
been blamed on Civil Service resistance to the proposed changes.
Departmental accounting officers have (raised their concerns about the
accountability of those who would handle public money following the
Treasury's circulation of draft guidelines on contracting-out
finance-related functions.
The guidelines have been drawn up by Mr Tim Burr, Treasury Officer of
Accounts, who is responsible for government accounting issues and relations
with the powerful House of Commons Public Accounts Committee.
One concern is whether departments can retain enough in-house expertise to
act as an 'intelligent customer' and monitor performance.
It will be hard for finance staff to carry out these roles if they no longer
have day-to-day management experience, according to Mr Norris.
In his submission to the Treasury, Mr Norris says that 'ensuring that the
public funds . . . are well-managed and safeguarded should be easier to the
extent that the accounting officer uses directly employed staff whom he can
change at will'.
Concern is also expressed over the Treasury's guidance that almost any
financial management function can be contracted out. Mr Norris asks the
Treasury to specify which skills need to be kept in-house 'to maintain risk
at an acceptable level'.
The government's market testing programme was due to have contracted out
almost Pounds 1.5bn of work and the jobs of 44,000 civil servants by the end
of September.
One information technology company has reached the tender stage in only one
of the six contracts for which it is bidding. A senior manager in the
company says the remainder are unlikely to be completed before the end of
the year and blames delays on civil service resistance to market-testing.

FT  08 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE derivatives sector opened quietly but came to life at mid-morning,
driving the underlying equity market ahead for a brief period. Overall,
however, traders commented that business was thin and that investors
remained unconvinced of the outlook for domestic interest rates and for
share prices.
Attention was switching towards the September contract on the FT-SE 100
Index, which will take over this month from the June contract as the
market's chief driving force.
At one stage the June contract, now at an effective nil premium against fair
value, was strong against the cash market, but trade was two-way and there
was not enough volume to enable the best levels to hold.
At the close the June contract was on offer at 2,850, but it began to drift
off later as Wall Street made a slow start and trading volume in London died
away.
Business in traded options was reduced to 26,069 lots from Friday's 28,691,
with the FT-SE 100 option decreasing its contribution from 8,796 contracts
to 6,319. Among the individual stock options, British Gas stood out with
3,955 contracts transacted, with Marks and Spencer on 3,650 close behind.
British Steel was also in demand, recording 2,300 contracts, although this
reflected no significant interest in the underlying stock.

FT  08 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone bought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that US investors have continued to increase their holdings in
Vodafone, the cellular phones group, coincided with the shares extending
last week's strong showing and moving up to their highest level since
mid-1989.
Only last week the company announced that US holdings of Vodafone stock had
risen to 186.5m shares, or 18.5 per cent of the group's issued capital.
Yesterday Vodafone said US investors now spoke for 19.13 per cent, or 192.3m
shares, in the company.
Vodafone is scheduled to report preliminary figures this morning, with the
more optimistic analysts looking for profits in the region of Pounds 325m
and a dividend total of around 7p. There are also strong hopes in the market
that Vodafone will deliver an upbeat message on current prospects, including
good news of 'usage' or call rates in its cellular phone business.
Vodafone shares touched 471p at one point yesterday, prior to ending the day
a net 11 higher at 465 1/2 p. Turnover was a heavy 7.5m shares.
The profits warning issued by Jeyes Group saw the shares plunge to 315p
before closing a massive 122 off at 317p.
Drug shares continued to underperform the rest of the UK market, and were
again restrained by a sluggish opening performance by Wall Street.
Glaxo managed a minor rise at 591p, but SmithKline Beecham 'A' ended 4 1/2
lower at 449p. Wellcome, unsettled by the Aids conference being held this
week in Berlin, and worries about the Retrovir patent trial scheduled to get
under way in the US on June 28, dipped 7 more to 753p, extending its recent
run of poor performances.
Zeneca eased 3 1/2 to 617 1/2 p and the new nil-paid 4 1/2 to 19 1/2 p. ICI,
on the other hand, just failed to pierce the 700p level, closing another 8
to the good at 697p.
Two big block trades in British Gas, each of 3.9m shares and both transacted
at 289p, catapulted Gas to second place in the list of London's most heavily
traded stocks. Gas settled a shade harder at 289p after 10m shares
transacted.
Lasmo extended its recent bout of strength, moving up to 162p before closing
a net 4 higher at 161p after turnover of 2.7m. Dealers reported further
sizeable support for the shares from US sources, ahead of the current round
of presentations to US institutions and the forthcoming full ADR listing.
Lasmo escaped being dropped from the prestigious FT-SE 100 Index last week
when the newly demerged Zeneca entered the index, and may well escape the
drop into the FT-SE Mid 250 Index when the FT-SE steering committee meets to
consider its quarterly review of constituents tomorrow.
Shell Transport, due to deliver a presentation to institutions in London
next Monday after a series of meetings with international institutions,
outpaced British Petroleum, closing 7 stronger at 610p. Strauss Turnbull,
the stockbroker, was an aggressive buyer of the shares and told its clients
that the stock was 'massively undervalued'.
Talk that business services group BET would announce a cut in the dividend
when it reports figures next week led to heavy dealing in the stock. Volume
rose to 5.7m as the shares gave up 4 to 111p.
Speculation that British Aerospace was likely to win an order for 200 Hawk
aircraft with a total value of up to Pounds 4bn brought a strong advance to
make it one of the day's best performing stocks.
The shares pushed through the 380p barrier, the price of the 1991 rights
issue, for the first time since 1991 to end 17 ahead at 387p in trade of
3.7m.
Further orders, particularly for the Tornado, are also said to be in the
pipeline.
A badly executed sell order caused a slide in Simon Engineering. The shares
closed 9 lower at 37p.
Engineering group James Wilkes was once again the subject of bid
speculation, with stakeholder Suter named as the likely predator. The former
closed 8 up at 88p, while the latter was unchanged at 151p.
The sentiment in BAe boosted several other stocks in the aerospace sector
thought to be potential beneficiaries of orders for BAe. These included
Rolls-Royce, 3 firmer at 143p, and Smiths Industries, 4 up at 345p.
Hartstone Group, the hosiery manufacturer hit last month by a profits
warning, staged a minor rally, closing 5 1/2 up at 45p.
The stores sector was buoyed by better than expected consumer credit figures
for April. Trading volume increased steadily during the day.
A more cautious analyst said many stores were largely rallying from
disappointing performances over recent days and a particularly poor trading
day on Friday. Kingfisher closed 8 up at 594p and Boots rose 5 to 440p.
Marks and Spencer were 4 firmer at 341p.
Property shares continued to ride the wave of market confidence triggered by
Mr George Soros's move into the sector. British Land added a further 8 at
332p xd.
Jacques Vert, designer, maker and retailer of women's fashions, outperformed
a generally subdued textile sector. The shares moved forward 9 to 85p.
Courtaulds Textiles advanced 6 to 371p in thin trading.

FT  08 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Trafalgar rights fear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volume in international conglomerate Trafalgar House rose to a hefty 12m,
making it the day's most heavily traded stock and the shares gave up 4 to
106p as fears that the company would soon be calling on investors for more
cash swept through the market.
Speculation of a rights issue was fuelled by reports in the weekend press
and by the close of business yesterday a feeling that a cash call was
inevitable had grown. One analyst said: 'The balance sheet is still
stretched and I just cannot see how they can avoid one.' However, Mr Geoff
Allum at NatWest Securities said: 'It will be difficult for them to get a
rights issue away. I think it is more likely that Trafalgar will attempt
disposals.'
Such a move would be the third time in less than two years that Trafalgar
had called on the market, having raised Pounds 204m in February this year
through a sterling issue and Pounds 310m through a rights issue in July
1991.

FT  08 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hopes lift PowerGen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much better results than expected from PowerGen, the electricity generator,
together with an upbeat statement on current year prospects and the carrot
of an accelerated dividend payout, fuelled a substantial surge in the
generator's shares.
The PowerGen stock price raced up to equal its year's high of 368p, up 13,
on 4.2m shares traded as the market absorbed the news.
A utilities specialist said: 'The company's profits were a good Pounds 5m
above the most optimistic of analysts' forecasts and the 14 per cent
increase in the dividend total was at the top end of expectations.'
The real thrust of the shares' advance, the analyst added, came from the
company's statement that it intends to bring down the level of dividend
cover from the current 3.5 times to around 2.5 to 2.7 times: 'a simple
calcula-tion means that even on a modest level of earnings growth the
dividend will grow by a minimum 15 per cent over the next two to three
years'.
Residual market worries over heightened interference from the electricity
industry regulator Offer are minimised, according to specialists, by the
fact that the government will want to unload its remaining 40 per cent stake
in PowerGen, and also in National Power, within the next couple of years.
'The government cannot put the squeeze on the company if they are hell bent
on selling the rest of the shares,' said one trader. National Power, trading
ex the 1.2p final dividend, added 10 at 353p on 3.3m dealt.

FT  08 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Advance renewed in poor turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAGUE AND poorly sub-stantiated hopes for a reduction in UK base rates
continued to sustain the London stock market yesterday as it opened the new
trading account. Volume was unimpressive and, in spite of a 14.9 points
gain, the FT-SE 100 Index was off the top at the close and still lowly
placed in its latest trading range.
The hope that a further cut in domestic interest rates might provide a
stimulus for consumer spending lent support to the brewery and some other
selected consumer sectors at first. But much of the encouragement to the UK
stock market came from good company results.
In early trading, which was helped by a somewhat technically inspired gain
in stock index futures, the Footsie advanced by nearly 20 points to brush
the 2,850 mark. Investment support, however, was not sufficient to breach
the 2,850 level and the market softened towards the close as Wall Street
came in with an early loss of 8 points on the Dow.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,844.8 for a net gain of 14.9.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index rebounded, finishing 9.8 ahead at 3,184.9, within
seven points of the all-time high reached last week.
But trading volume, at only 456m shares through the Seaq system, made a poor
comparison with the 625.6m shares traded on Friday - although Friday's
business was worth Pounds 1.27bn in retail, or customer, value and thus
maintained the recovery in genuine investment activity of the past
fortnight. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up around 64 per cent of
yesterday's Seaq total, at the high end of recent daily averages.
The speculation of a cut in UK base rates by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new UK
chancellor of the exchequer, continued in spite of doubts expressed by
several leading UK equity strategists. Mr Peter Thorne at Nikko commented
that, while base rates may be cut by 0.5 percentage point 'as evidence
accumulates' that the economic recovery is faltering, this may add only 50
points to the FT-SE 100 Index.
At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett warned that recent company results could
prove highly significant. He points out that the price/earnings multiple on
the FT-Actuaries 500-share Index is now around 19.3, raising queries once
again over valuations of the London stock market.
The debate over domestic interest rates was little affected by a further dip
in sterling yesterday , nor by the modest improvement in government bond
prices. The City of London has now accepted that developments on base rates
may depend on the political outlook, and in particular upon the important
speech in London next week by Mr Clarke.
Speculation on interest rates is likely to focus on the May retail sales
figures, which are due on June 16, just 24 hours before Mr Clarke delivers
his Mansion House speech.
The London market was helped yesterday by a pause in the US selling of
pharmaceutical stocks. Although Zeneca remained out of favour, ICI again
found the buyers. Oil shares, also important components of the Footsie,
remained very firm, with some of the second line North Sea stocks finding
buyers.
Support for the domestic consumer issues appeared to be lightly based.

FT  08 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases as confusion on
data persists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices edged lower in subdued trading yesterday as investors
struggled to find their economic bearings in the wake of last Friday's
surprisingly strong May employment report, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 13.01 down at 3,532.13. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 slipped 2.37 to 447.69, while the Nasdaq composite retreated
7.40 to 694.61. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 237m shares.
The week opened with investors still confused about the state of the
economy. Last Friday's unexpectedly strong showing from the labour markets -
the 209,000 gain in non-farm payrolls during May was well above forecasts -
failed to lift share prices, primarily because the news forced bond yields
higher, and only added to the uncertainty surrounding the progress of the
apparently faltering economic recovery.
Thus, with doubts still surrounding the outlook for the economy, and with
bond prices little changed at midday, the equity markets drifted yesterday
for lack of a firm direction from external forces. Some traders warned that
the markets were settling in for a long summer of listless trading, with
prices probably moving within a relatively narrow range.
Advanced Micro Devices, after a delayed opening due to an order imbalance,
plunged Dollars 4 1/4 to 23 3/4 in volume of 5.2m shares on news that the
company's main rival, Intel, had won a legal ruling on Friday that will help
it in its battle to restrict AMD from selling clones of Intel's best-selling
microchip. Intel, traded on the Nasdaq market, rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars
58 1/8 in volume of 11m shares.
Parker &amp; Parsley climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 30 1/8 after announcing
plans to sell some oil and gas rights to Louis Dreyfus for Dollars 157m, and
to raise its offer for the energy partnerships owned by Prudential
Securities from Dollars 466m to Dollars 508m.
BankAmerica declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 in volume of 2.7m shares after
Prudential Securities lowered its rating on the bank's stock from a 'hold'
to a 'sell'. Other banking issues were also lower as investors worried that
interest rates might soon be raised by the Federal Reserve: Citicorp shed
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 26 3/8 , Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
28 5/8 and Chemical Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 35 1/2 .
Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber plummeted Dollars 7 1/2 to Dollars 25 1/8 on 6.5m
shares traded after stating that second-quarter sales would probably fall
below the level achieved a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, Repligen forged ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 7 3/4
as the company began trials of its therapeutic vaccine for carriers of the
HIV-Aids virus.
Canada
TORONTO finished on a mixed note after reduced but fairly busy trading. The
TSE 300 index was 2.4 off at 3,892.2, although advancing issues narrowly
outnumbered declines by 363 to 354. Volume came to 57.3m shares, down from
Friday's 75.6m, and trading value fell to CDollars 564.9m from CDollars
713.7m.
Nine of the 14 sub-group indices were higher, led by pipelines, up 1.5 per
cent, and transportation, 1.2 per cent stronger. The day's biggest decline
belonged to financial services, down 1.4 per cent. The gold and energy
groups closed little changed.

FT  08 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong under pressure
as Seoul hits a new high
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE afternoon arbitrage selling eroded earlier gains, and the Nikkei
average ended easier in low volume. Many investors remained inactive ahead
of Wednesday's public holiday for the royal wedding, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei relinquished 38.05 to 20,844.19 after a day's high of 21,101.80
registered in the morning and a low of 20,829.54 minutes before the close.
Volume fell to 351.4m shares from Friday's 563m. Investors have been
reluctant to take positions ahead of Wednesday, and the futures and options
settlements on Friday, while some have also been deterred by a number of
economic indicators to be revealed this week.
The government will release its monthly economic report on Thursday,
followed by the Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly survey of business
sentiment, on Friday.
In spite of the Nikkei's loss, rises led falls by 523 to 504, with 165
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained a
marginal 0.15 at 1,671.85 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
3.30 to 1,269.21.
THK, a bearings company on the over-the-counter market, suffered from
rumours, which it later denied, that it was facing financial difficulties.
Nevertheless, the rumours prompted a fall in the OTC average of 17.80 to
1,645.51.
On the main market, prices fluctuated on technical trading. Some property
companies were higher on rumours that Mr George Soros, the international
fund manager, was targeting the property markets. Mitsubishi Estate moved
forward Y20 to Y1,150.
Banks were bought by foreign investors, many of whom have relatively low
weightings in this sector. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y30 to Y2,080 and Fuji
Bank put on Y10 at Y2,330. Regional banks were also higher, with Kanto Bank
up Y340 to Y5,150.
Aids-related stocks continued to be sought, with Olympus Optical, reported
to be developing Aids diagnostic equipment, appreciating Y10 to Y1,290 in
active trading.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 10.63 to 23,361.60 in volume of 24.9m shares.
Roundup
THE WEEK opened with many markets seeking fresh directions.
HONG KONG lost ground under pressure from a late round of profit-taking. The
Hang Seng index fell 32.76 to 7,124.73 in turnover sharply down to HKDollars
3.1bn from Friday's HKDollars 4.9bn.
Cheung Kong was a focus of trade, off 10 cents at HKDollars 27.40, having
hit a low of HKDollars 27.20, while HSBC Holdings fell victim to a late wave
of selling, retreating 50 cents to HKDollars 71.50. Wharf Holdings shed 10
cents to HKDollars 20.20.
There was also selected bargain hunting, China Light gaining 25 cents at
HKDollars 39.50 and Hongkong Land up 40 cents to HKDollars 16.10.
SEOUL rose to a 31-month high, with investors encouraged by hopes that a
breakthrough in talks between North and South Korea might soon be reached.
The composite index added 11.69 at 766.28 in turnover of Won977.5bn.
Forecasts of good first-half results from pharmaceutical and chemical groups
left most stocks in this sector at their daily highs. Hanyang Chemical and
Isu Chemical each rose Won600 to Won12,600 and Won13,800 respectively.
SINGAPORE weakened further as investors continued to take profits after
recent strength. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 14.76 lower at
1,856.12 in volume of 136.75m shares against 186.11m.
TAIWAN was easier, with economic data released on Saturday showing a fall in
inflation last month unable to lift sentiment.
The weighted index, which had opened slightly lower, extended its loss in
late trading to end 51.23, or 1.2 per cent, off at 4,317.00. Turnover fell
to TDollars 19.6bn from the TDollars 26bn seen in Saturday's half-day
session.
Financials remained weak, with the major banks losing between TDollars 1.50
and TDollars 3.
MANILA was encouraged by Friday's news of lower inflation and Philippine
Long Distance Telephone's recovery in New York.
Inflation fell to 6.7 per cent in May from 7.9 per cent a month before. The
composite index rose 16.88 to 1,604.17 in turnover of 301.7m pesos, against
291.8m pesos. PLDT put on 10 pesos at 965 pesos.
AUSTRALIA drifted lower in a featureless market. The All Ordinaries index
shed 2.5 to 1,738.5 in ADollars 186.43m turnover. CRA lost 6 cents to
ADollars 13.12.
BOMBAY rose on better than expected results from Tata Iron and Steel. The
BSE index finished 56 ahead at 2,392.
BANGKOK weakened as investors took profits on a number of new issues which
had made their market debuts last week. The SET index slipped 4.94 to 827.14
in turnover of Bt4.32bn.

FT  08 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Finland waits for interim reports
season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global equities moved quietly into June with last week foreshortened by the
Whitsun holiday. Gains in Japan outweighed miniscule declines in Europe and
the US to leave the FT-Actuaries World Index up 0.1 per cent in local
currency terms.
The biggest falls came in markets which, to date, had produced the largest
gains. In Europe, Finland dropped on profit-taking after a rise of 47.9 per
cent in the five months to May 28; in the Pacific, Hong Kong fell on news
that China had decided not to support its currency on some of its
semi-official swap markets.
Goldman Sachs noted last week that news from Finland recently has been
almost exclusively about rights issues: 'The fact that several of these
proposed cash calls (Nokia, Metsa-Serla) have been directed to foreign
investors and that they will improve liquidity further has made the market
reaction mild.'
Goldman is still positive on the Helsinki market but says that near-term
performance will depend on the tone of the interim reports due this month.
'Most of the companies should show strong improvements on last year's
levels,' it adds, 'thanks to the devaluation effect on their large net
exports (on average around 35 per cent), even if the high debt in foreign
currency will reduce the benefits somewhat.'
Hong Kong, the second-best World Index performer this year, showed its
weakness mostly in companies with significant exposure to China. On the
mainland, Shanghai and Shenzhen B share indices fell in sympathy, and a
broker said foreign investors had lost their confidence in China's economy,
and currency.
Mexico's 2 per cent decline was the more worrying because it was already the
only constituent market showing a loss this year. However, Latin American
Securities in London says that what happened amounted to 'a siesta in a
quiet week'.

FT  08 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Madrid falls 1.7 per cent
after Socialist victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES demonstrated more volatility than of late yesterday, on political
swings, on profit-taking and on technical grounds, writes Our Markets Staff.
MADRID took its losses mostly in the banking sector as the general index
dropped 4.42, or 1.7 per cent to 256.82.
The Socialist election victory reduced the prospect of interest rate cuts.
Among banks, BBV fell Pta75 to Pta3,090 and Central Hispano by Pta100 to
Pta3,400.
Turnover eased by Pta3bn to Pta20.1bn. Rationalisation measures in the
energy market left most utilities flat, and relatively strong but Endesa,
perceived as the loser in this situation, fell Pta110 to Pta4,365.
FRANKFURT accelerated its rate of advance, the DAX index closing 17.76, or
1.1 per cent higher at 1,655.61 as turnover rose from DM5.1bn to DM5.2bn.
Dealers said that trade was mainly chart driven. In the automotive sector,
BMW rose by DM8.80 to DM464.50, Daimler by DM11.80 to DM573.80 and
Volkswagen by DM6.80 to DM331.50. There were reports of a number of 'buy'
recommendations for carmakers from major German banks.
The 'big three' banks, however, did not speak in unison. DB Research was
optimistic for Daimler, but it saw sales volume problems at Volkswagen.
At Dresdner, Mr Lothar Weniger said that the bank had reduced the
underweighting level of Daimler in mid-May, and that it was about to go up
to market weight.
Commerzbank said that it was recommending banks, insurance companies and the
major chemicals as equity investments, and carmakers - particularly VW and
Daimler - for trading purposes.
PARIS was lifted mainly by futures driven trading in the absence of major
corporate news. However, overall sentiment was helped as a number of
international fund managers lifted their market weighting on France.
Nomura, for instance, has recently issued an upbeat comment on French
equities, noting in particular that domestic interest rates are likely to
continue falling, while weakness of the DM is expected to slow down, 'if not
entirely halt', the pace of German monetary easing.
The CAC-40 index rose 28.17 to 1,887.86, but off the day's best level of
1,894. Turnover was FFr3bn.
The oil sector featured ahead of today's Opec meeting in Geneva: Total
gained FFr4 to FFr272 and Elf Aquitaine FFr5.70 to FFr380.30.
MILAN suffered as investors gave a broadly negative reaction to the news,
announced after Friday's close, that Ferruzzi had appointed five banks,
including Mediobanca and BCI, to draw up a restructuring plan for the group.
The banks are the group's major creditors and some analysts have suggested
that a debt-for-equity swap may be arranged.
Ferruzzi finished down L47.90 or 4.5 per cent at L968.10, but off a year's
low of L956, while Montedison slipped L52 or 4.6 per cent to L1,080.
The Comit index closed down 10.74 at 520.68 in low turnover estimated to be
around L200bn. Mr John Stewart of Milan brokers Pastorino commented that a
number of factors had been exercising a brake on the market recently: the
euphoria following the change of government had now died down; the
privatisation programme remained confused; and corporate results over the
last couple of weeks had underlined the debt burden of many major groups.
Another strong influence on the market yesterday was Sunday's first round
voting in municipal elections which showed waning support for the main
parties.
ZURICH celebrated a second consecutive record high with the SMI index
closing 24.6 higher at 2,308.9. Banks led the market, SBC rising by SFr6 to
SFr381 and CS Holding, ex a SFr75 dividend and ex rights worth SFr67 a
share, ending a net SFr42 higher at SFr2,580.
AMSTERDAM showed a strong finish helped by a strong dollar and German
market. The CBS Tendency index advanced 1.0 to 105.7.
Among the day's best performers, Royal Dutch, up Fl 1.70 to Fl 167.60 and
Unilever, up Fl 1.20 to Fl 194.30, advanced on the currency theme.
HELSINKI fell 1.8 per cent in thin trading, the Hex index off 21.7 at
1,143.3, as investors awaited the publication of interim results.
ISTANBUL, closed last week for a religious holiday, put on 2.5 per cent on
expectations of good half year results, and ignoring a rise in monthly
inflation data. The 75-share index improved 208.19 to 8,583.94 in turnover
of some TL800bn.
TEL AVIV climbed in active trading on optimism over Middle East peace
prospects, the Mishtanim index rising 4.59, or 2.3 per cent to 205.05 in
turnover of Shk226m.
WARSAW dropped 9.5 per cent, 15 of its 17 stocks hitting their limit down of
10 per cent as the WIG index dropped another 319.7 to 3,034.2. Turnover was
only 82bn zloty, after 371.9bn last Thursday.
The following notice was issued last Friday by the FT-SE Eurotrack indices
committee:
The FT-SE Eurotrack indices committee has today approved, following the
announcement that the Bearer and Part Certificated lines of Nestle will be
converted into the Registered Stocks, that both Nokia (Finland) and CRH
(Ireland) will become constituents of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 and 200
indices.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Money Markets: French rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in French franc interest rate markets were bullish yesterday about
the prospect of further policy easing by the Bank of France, even though the
authorities left official interest rates unchanged, writes James Blitz.
The French franc has performed strongly against the D-Mark on the currency
markets in recent days, and there was speculation about another cut in the
Bank of France's intervention rate, currently at 7.50 per cent. In the
event, this interest rate was left unaltered in the central bank's weekly
operation.
However, the currency's strength raised speculation that the French
authorities would be able to reduce interest rates at a more aggressive pace
than has been set by the Germans. French franc interest rate futures were
yesterday discounting lower interest rates in France than in Germany in June
and September.
French cash rates have been below their German counter-parts for several
weeks. But this is only the second day on which the trend has emerged in
futures markets.
The June French franc contract closed 7 basis points higher at 92.54, while
the September contract was up 12 basis points on the day at 93.32.
Euromark futures were only mildly stronger. The June D-Mark interest rate
contract ended at 92.45, up 2 basis points on the day. The September
contract finished 2 basis points firmer at 93.23.
The weaker rise in German interest rate contracts was partly due to the
perception that the D-Mark was losing ground across the board on the
currency markets, and that this would make German rate cuts more difficult
to implement.
However, D-Mark weakness allowed the Danish authorities to cut rates for the
first time since Denmark voted Yes to monetary union on May 18. Denmark's
discount rate was lowered from 8.25 per cent to 7.75 per cent.
Dealers in sterling markets took a more downbeat view of interest rate cuts,
following press reports that the UK government was shying away from any more
easing.
The September short sterling contract closed 7 basis points down at 94.19.
Three-month money finished slightly firmer at 5 15/16 per cent, following
difficulties removing a Pounds 1bn shortage.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar softens after big boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR softened slightly against the D-Mark yesterday following the US
currency's powerful performance on Friday in the wake of the May payroll
report, writes James Blitz.
Friday's non-farm payroll figure, showing a net rise of 209,000 on the
month, was well above market expectations, and the dollar rose 3 pfennigs
that day to close at DM1.6225 on what dealers said was a huge volume of
dollar buying.
However, at least one dealer talked of some selling into the dollar rally on
Friday evening, and that mood continued yesterday as bank dealers took
profits following the big move. The dollar lost 35 basis points on the day
in London to finish at DM1.6190. In New York it ended trading at DM1.6195.
Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, believes
the dollar's next move against the D-Mark is still upwards, because of the
familiar problems of the German economy.
But he also thinks that President Bill Clinton's political problems are
becoming an increasing hindrance to the dollar's rise in the short term.
The Democrats' loss of Texas in last weekend's senate by-election may make
it more difficult for the president to get his energy tax bill through
Congress. At the same time, the president has been facing new difficulties
getting officials nominated to key posts in the administration. 'Some of Mr
Clinton's political problems need to be cleared up before the next big move
upwards,' said Mr Hannah.
The D-Mark continued to look soft against most European currencies
yesterday, above all the peseta, which rallied powerfully in the wake of the
victory for Mr Felipe Gonzalez's PSOE in the Spanish elections.
Foreign exchange dealers had assumed that Mr Jose Maria Aznar's Partido
Popular would have aggressively cut interest rates had it been elected. The
assumption in the markets yesterday was that Mr Gonzalez would be more
cautious about rate-cutting, and Spanish money market interest rates were
unchanged yesterday.
The peseta closed at Pta76.84 to the D-Mark from a previous finish of
Pta78.27. It remained in second place in the ERM grid with a divergence
indicator of plus 49 percentage points. The French franc again performed
well against the D-Mark, ending at FFr3.370 from a previous FFr3.372.
Sterling weakened against the D-Mark in Monday's early Asian trading as
dealers continued to take the view that there could be a near term cut in UK
base rates.
However, although the pound touched DM2.45 in trading in Australia,
rate-cutting fears dissipated in Europe. Sterling finished at DM2.4650, up
1/4 pfennig on the day.
Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, believes the
pound is likely to retain a floor at DM2.45, considering economic
difficulties in Germany.

<TEXT>
THE BP-Statoil alliance expects to invest up to USDollars 3bn on the
development of the Chirakh oilfield in Azerbaijan, according to an internal
Statoil document that also spells out development plans
The two companies have been reluctant to produce investment figures because
of fears that negotiations now under way might be adversely affected.
The Anglo-Norwegian alliance, which holds a 50 per cent stake in the field,
aims to complete negotiations with Azerbaijani officials in mid-1993 on
development terms and conditions.
Socar, the Azerbaijani state oil company, holds the other 50 per cent. Of
the Alliance total shareholding, Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company,
holds 18 per cent, which means it will invest up to Nkr3bn (Pounds 285m) to
cover its share of development costs.
That would be the biggest investment ever made by Statoil outside Norway and
would have to be approved by the government and possibly by the parliament.
Chirakh's oil reserves are estimated to be between 1bn and 1.5bn barrels of
oil. It also has some gas.
One steel platform substructure is already in the field and two others are
under construction in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital. According to preliminary
plans, two drilling platforms at present under construction are aimed to be
installed in the field at the end of 1995 with 20 wells drilled from each.
In addition, the process platform may be installed at the end of 1996 and
produce oil from 1997.
A third drilling platform is to be installed in 1997 from which 50 wells
will be drilled. Production from the field is expected to be reached by 1999
at a rate of 200,000 barrels a day.
The alliance will build the platforms locally but the modules will have to
be built in the West and transported via the Black Sea or the Baltic.
One 36 inch diameter oil pipeline and a 28 inch diameter gas pipeline from
Chirakh are planned to link to an 800,000 barrels of oil a day capacity oil
terminal and a gas terminal with capacity to handle 4.3bn cubic metres
annually.
The oil is to be transported further through another pipeline to Iskenderun
on the Turkish Mediterranean sea coast while the gas will be used locally.

<TEXT>
WESTERN PARTNERS in a Russian oil extraction joint venture have said they
hope to be able to continue a project which is seen as a test of Russia's
ability to attract foreign investment to its ailing energy sector.
Phibro Energy Production, a subsidiary of Salomon, which owns 45 per cent of
the White Nights joint venture, had threatened to pull out of the project
unless the Russian side, a state-owned company called Varyoganneftegas,
radically changed its behaviour.
Mr Brian Lavers, Phibro's chairman, said on Friday that crisis talks, begun
last month with Russian partners in the Siberian town of Raduzhny, would be
resuming in 10 days time.
''We haven't solved all the problems. . . (but) we're definitely making
progress towards being able to continue with the White Nights joint
venture,' he said.
Phibro has alleged that Varyoganneftegas had threatened to halt payment of
contracts and of US workers on the site, and to stop efforts to obtain the
necessary licences and export tax exemptions. The US company has spent some
Dollars 115m on the project since it started two years ago.
Mr Lavers declined to give details of what kind of progress had been
reached, but he said 'the most important single issue' was to persuade the
Russian government to start operating an export tax exemption for joint
ventures created before January 1 1992. The exemption was announced last
July but the Russian authorities had not yet set up a committee to implement
it, he said, adding that in the mean time the company had paid Dollars 10m
in tax.
Mr Robert Denham, chairman of Salomon, told Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
Treasury Secretary, before he paid a brief visit to Moscow last week, that
the action contemplated by Varyoganneftegas was 'theft'. Mr Bentsen noted on
Friday that one of Russia's big problems was 'capital to further modernise
and increase investment in equipment. They can expand much faster if they
get additional capital'.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada eases barley controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCELERATING liberalisation of the North American grains trade has been
underlined by a Canadian Wheat Board decision to loosen its hold on domestic
barley sales and exports to the US.
The move reinforces other measures over the past four years that have eased
trade controls and contributed to a big rise in grain trade between the US,
Canada and Mexico.
The barriers will come down further under the North American trade
agreement, which is due to be take effect next January. Under Nafta, Mexico
has agreed to replace import permits on wheat with moderate tariffs. The
Mexican wheat market has been opened significantly to US and Canadian
exporters over the past year by channelling imports through the private
sector rather than the now-disbanded government procurement agency.
Canadian farmers can in future choose between selling barley through the
Wheat Board or through private traders. In addition, curbs on imports of US
barley and barley products will be lifted on Aug 1. Mr Michael Wilson,
Canada's trade minister, said the new rules would create 'a true continental
market for feed and malting barley which will benefit farmers on both sides
of the border'.
According to a recent consultant's report, the changes will lift Canadian
barley producers' revenue by about 17 per cent. Critics of the new policy
are concerned, however, that it could further weaken the authority of the
Wheat Board and increase pressure for the board to give up its monopoly on
wheat sales.
Thanks in part to the removal of import permits in 1991 under the US-Canada
free trade agreement, the US has become Canada's second biggest market for
durum wheat, used for pasta. Exports to the US soared to 276,000 tonnes,
equal to about a quarter of the US durum market, from the start of the
present season last August to mid-March, compared to 202,000 tonnes in the
same period last year and virtually zero in 1990. Meanwhile, US shipments of
pasta to Canada have jumped seven-fold.
The Wheat Board relinquished control over oats exports in 1989 at virtually
the same time as bilateral import curbs were dropped. In addition, almost
all Canada's flour mills have either been bought by or folded into joint
ventures with US companies.
According to Agriculture Canada, flour exports to the US reached 51,000
tonnes in the first seven months of this season, more than double the
average in the 1980s.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec ministers gather for a
tough bargaining session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS OF the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries gather in Geneva
today to negotiate a new production quota for the third quarter of this
year.
The indications are that bargaining will be tough and oil prices have
weakened in the run-up to the meeting in the expectation that the oil
producing cartel will continue to exceed its self-imposed production
ceiling.
Analysts say that Opec production has recently amounted to about 600,000
barrels a day more than the official 23.6m b/d total, with Iran, Kuwait and
Nigeria the main culprits. Given the uncertainty in the market, a roll-over
of the present arrangements might seem the most logical outcome.
However Opec will have to consider Kuwait's demand for an increase in its
quota from 1.6m b/d to over 2m b/d now that its oil industry is getting back
into shape. Kuwaiti officials have touring other Opec members ahead of the
meeting to lobby for a bigger share.
The outlook for oil demand shows only a small growth, but the coming period
will be influenced by stock building ahead of the winter months, and this
extra demand could provide Opec with the leeway it needs.
Estimates of the likely stock build vary between 600,000 and 800,000 b/d,
meaning that total demand for Opec oil could rise above 25m b/d in the
period ahead.
If Opec ministers decide the raise the ceiling they will have to choose
whether to share out the additional production on a pro rata basis, or on
the basis of capacity.
Analysts at the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies say that a pro
rata agreement would principally benefit Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela,
but a capacity-based deal would mainly benefit Iran. In both cases, Nigeria
would have to cut output.
The centre says Opec is in a difficult position, but will probably be forced
into a compromise based on a combination of the two approaches.

GOLD drifted lower on the London bullion market, but dealers said that it
had survived several tests of support at Dollars 372 a troy ounce. There was
a lot of nervousness around the morning fix after Friday's 40-minute fix
when the price jumped Dollars 3-Dollars 4. 'Nobody really wanted to buy this
morning and the price just came right off,' one dealer said. The market
found little encouragement from New York, which opened weaker. London's
robusta COFFEE closed just above the day's lows, but dealers noted some
early signs that the downward move might be running out of steam. The market
continued to be driven by technical factors in New York, where the breach of
support at 60 cents a lb for the July contract late last week put it on the
defensive. New York raw SUGAR prices were easier at midday as the market
continued to absorb Cuba's declaration of a 45-day force majeure last week.
Analysts said that uncertainty over whether Russia and China would look for
alternative supplies inspired nervousness. COPPER appeared to be
consolidating on the LME after Friday's volatile trading, with three-month
metal settling into a range between Dollars 1,820 and Dollars 1,850.

THE PERUVIAN government officially announced yesterday that it was
soliciting offers for up to 100 per cent of its holding in Centromin, the
country's largest state-owned mining concern.
Chase Manhattan is handling the promotion. An information memorandum is
available to prospective purchasers on signature of a letter agreeing to
respect confidentiality.
Centromin owns and operates seven production units, all located in the high
central Andes. The company was formed in 1974 after the expropriation by the
then military government of the mines and La Oroya metallurgical complex
previously owned by the Cerro de Pasco Corporation of the US.
The La Oroya complex, one of the world's largest, produces five main refined
metals - copper, zinc, lead, silver and gold - as well as 17 by-products
such as arsenic, antimony and sulphuric acid. Last year's sales topped
Dollars 400m and more than 70 per cent of output was exported.
Centromin has been badly decapitalised over the years, although recent
management changes have resulted in greater efficiency. But huge investment
will be required from the new owner, not least in urgent environmental
improvements at La Oroya.
Although no official announcement has yet been made, the government is
believed to favour selling the operation as a whole.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Shephard
gets warm welcome from her new flock - Britain's first female agriculture
minister brings a fund of goodwill to a difficult job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVITED TO comment on the appointment of Mrs Gillian Shephard as Britain's
minister of agriculture in the recent cabinet reshuffle the chairman of the
Norfolk branch of the National Farmers' Union replied: 'It's the second good
thing that's happened - the first was the rain and the second was Mrs
Shephard's appointment.'
Well, the soil had become very dry towards the end of May and Mr Charles
Wharton, who made that comment, is a hard-headed commercial farmer as well
as holding the NFU office. He knew the rain would be good for his income and
he clearly hoped Mrs Shephard would be too - but with her he could only
hope.
A native of Norfolk as well as representing a constituency in the south-west
of the county, Mrs Shephard told that story against herself at the weekend
during the first policy speech of her administration - once again in
Norfolk. Her audience of farmers shared her amusement at the practical
response of one of their neighbours. But they also seemed happy to give the
new minister the benefit of the doubt, for the time being at least.
For Gillian Shephard has a good record among farmers in Norfolk. Before she
became an MP in 1987 she had been an active and effective county councillor.
During her meteoric rise to cabinet level, culminating in her last job as
secretary of state for employment, she also found time to pursue farming
issues in her constituency.
Notable were her successes in persuading plant health authorities, in what
is now her own ministry, to modify punitive regulations relating to the
sugar beet disease rhizomania and her advocacy of the case for fairer
treatment of irrigating farmers during the drought and water shortage two
years ago.
Farmers from her constituency say that she has listened to and, perhaps more
to the point, understood their problems. Her family background as the
daughter of a Norfolk smallholder and cattle dealer will continue to stand
her in good stead as she battles with the complexities of the European
Community's common agricultural policy and the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade over the years to come. Indeed she says she relishes the task and
now has the political post she always wanted.
In her speech last Friday evening she dropped a few hints about her approach
to the job. She would, for instance, review the case for the winding up of
the Potato Marketing Board. Previously, following rulings from Brussels,
this was thought to be a certainty with only the timing in question. But Mrs
Shephard apparently remains to be convinced that the functions of the Board
should be sacrificed on the altar of the EC Commission and says she will
look at it before making her decision.
Moreover one of the main planks of her approach to the EC, she said, would
be to ensure UK agriculture benefits from European policies and does not
suffer discrimination in comparison with other member states.
British farmers will be pleased with that assurance. They have heard many
stories of farmers in other EC countries gaining unfair advantage. Whether
these are all true or not, they believe UK farmers' and traders' relatively
unblemished reputation for straight dealing has been tarnished by
allegations of fraud against the Common Agricultural Policy. Recent stories
concerning the illegal sale of intervention store wheat, said to have been
taking place in Italy, are just the latest in a long line of such
misdemeanours in other countries.
That said, UK farmers would resent the imposition of yet more red tape and
regulations to avoid such problems. Indeed there is a good case for reducing
those already affecting the industry. More than a year ago Mrs Shephard's
predecessor, Mr John Gummer, admitted as much to an audience of farmers and
said he would try to eliminate some of them. Perhaps significantly, that was
just before the last general election.
In the meantime little appears to have been done to honour that pledge
except that a few weeks ago Mr Nicholas Soames, one of Mr Gummer's and now
Mrs Shephard's ministerial colleagues at the ministry of agriculture,
repeated that 'regulation must not inhibit enterprise'.
Mrs Shephard, the first woman in the post, also thinks there are too many
regulations and will be looking at the list to see what can be done. But,
she adds, we must be careful to ensure that food health standards are
maintained. There should, she says, be less secrecy and more openness
regarding any food problems. That way minor difficulties should not become
major crises.
All of which ties in with the new minister's concern for the image of
agriculture. She believes, she says, that success in her new job is vital,
not only to farmers but to the rural ethos and the economy as a whole. The
food trade gap, she concedes, has been increasing in recent years as
retailers have sourced more of their produce abroad. This is a trend that
must be halted and reversed.
Moreover, the future of the Food From Britain promotional agency, which has
been under review for several months, is one of many matters in her pending
tray. Rumour has it that the recommendation will be that FFB should
concentrate its limited resources on exporting food and leave the home
market to look after itself. I for one do not believe that that would be
appropriate. Import substitution must be of as much importance to British
agriculture and the British economy as exports.
What is needed is a brave new initiative to promote home-grown food to
British consumers. But what British farmers seek more than anything else is
a long-term approach. They feel that for too long government and EC
agricultural policies have been lurching from crisis to crisis. They yearn
for vision and leadership of the kind not seen since Labour's Tom Williams
was agriculture minister in the post-war government. They know the
priorities are different now but they would support any minister who could
provide positive signposts to the future.
So, is Gillian Shephard that minister? There are those in her Norfolk South
West constituency who believe that she is. Perhaps they are forgetting the
fact that the whole system of farming politics, controlled as much of it is
by Brussels, is more complicated now than in the days of food shortages.
Perhaps they are unaware of the limitations imposed on even a skilled and
prominent member of the cabinet.
Eight days into her new job she was saying all the right things and, like
many other Norfolk farmers, I wish her well. But, as she doubtless
understands, her honeymoon period will only last as long as her policies are
approved of by a farming community that has generations of collective
experience in complaining.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Gonzalez victory prompts long-dated rally
in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE surprise election victory of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's socialist prime
minister, sparked a half-point rally in long-dated Spanish government bonds
yesterday.
Dealers said the main feature of the market was the flattening of the yield
curve as long-dated bonds outperformed short-dated issues.
Many investors, both foreign and domestic, were keen to do lengthening
trades - to switch out of short-dated issues into long-dated bonds - on the
assumption that the socialist government would cut interest rates gradually.
'The curve had been very steep as the market had discounted a PP
(conservative People's Party) victory which would have meant faster rate
cuts,' said Mr Steve Major, bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais.
Mr Jouni Kokko, economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'The decisive
victory means a vote of confidence in the ERM and a gradual easing in money
market rates - so we won't see a float of the peseta or quick interest rate
cuts.'
However, he added that the next interest rate easing could take place as
soon as next week at the June 15 repo.
The Meffsa futures contract rose from 88.55 to end at 89.00, having been as
high as 89.15 at one stage.
TECHNICAL pressures sent German government bonds lower at first, although
they rallied later on hopes of an interest rate cut to close marginally
higher.
Bund futures fell in the morning as traders sold heavily to square their
books ahead of yesterday's expiry of the June contract.
There was pressure from dealers hedging against a new DM3bn Treuhand bond
issue. The June 2003 issue was given a 6 7/8 per cent coupon.
Dealers said there was little demand for 10-year German paper at present as
investors became increasingly cautious over the prospect of over-supply.
Economic analysts were searching for signals of a further cut in the repo
rate following comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the vice-president of the
Bundesbank, on Friday.
The German central bank has maintained its repo rate at 7.6 per cent for the
past month and opinions are divided on whether it might be prepared to shave
it by a few basis points tomorrow.
The September bund futures contract was 25 basis points lower at one stage
but closed six basis points higher on the day at 94.09.
FRENCH government bonds benefited more significantly from Mr Tietmeyer's
comments, and received a further lift from a rate cut in Denmark.
Economists said the Bundesbank vice-president had argued for lower rates in
France than in Germany on Friday. This combined with a general fillip from
Denmark where the central bank cut its discount and key deposit rates to
7.75 per cent from 8.25 per cent effective today.
On the Matif, the June futures contract was bid up by 0.60 to end at 117.30
on turnover of 110,000 contracts during official trading.
IN the UK, overseas buying, specifically from Germany, sent the September
gilt futures contract up to 103.22 from 103.14.
Further progress was held back as domestic investors concentrated on
Friday's announcement of new gilts issuance.
The Bank of England offered Pounds 600m in government bonds split evenly
between 7 1/4 per cent Treasury stock due 1998, 9 3/4 per cent stock dated
2002 and 9 per cent stock dated 2012.
Dealers said around Pounds 50m of the 2002 issue and Pounds 50m of the 2012
issue was taken up.
ITALIAN government bonds closed slightly higher helped by the strength of
the lira and hopes of lower interest rates.
Dealers said the local elections at the weekend, which showed strong gains
for the protest and left-wing parties at the expense of the mainstream
parties, had little impact on the bond market.
The September Liffe futures contract ended up 0.03 at 99.67 on relatively
low volume.
US Treasury prices rebounded from last Friday's heavy losses yesterday,
posting solid gains at the long end of the market amid dealer short-covering
and municipal bond defeasance.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 103
1/16 , yielding 6.878 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was up  1/16 at 99, to yield 4.274 per cent.
After last week's late declines, which were prompted by a
bigger-than-expected increase in May payrolls, prices got off to a firm, if
uninspired, start.
Analysts had expected the heavy losses to bring some bargain hunters into
the market, and they did.
JAPANESE government bonds ended mixed yesterday, with the benchmark cash
bond closing firmer while futures ended weaker on the day.
The bond market opened on a weak note, continuing Friday's decline and
following the fall in the US Treasury bond market in response to
stronger-than-expected US jobs data.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB opened at 4.58 per cent, and moved to
4.54 per cent before ending the day at 4.555 per cent.
The September futures contract opened at 107.28 and fell to a low of 106.99
before recovering to end at 107.15.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: France plans to launch
FFr40bn bond this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government plans to launch its record FFr40bn convertible bond
issue before the end of the month. The bond will raise capital for France's
economic regeneration programme.
A provisional date of June 28 has been set for the issue, to be targeted at
private investors who will be able to convert their bonds into shares in
newly-privatised French companies or into tax-efficient long-term savings
schemes.
Mr Edouard Balladur, France's new centre-right prime minister who late last
month unveiled proposals for the special bond, is keen to launch it as soon
as possible.
However, the government will have to wait until the necessary legislation
has been passed to authorise the issue and to allow extra time in case of
legal challenges.
Investors are likely to be given 10 days after the launch to subscribe to
the issue. The government has yet to announce whether a special tranche will
be reserved for international investors.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, recently abolished the restriction
whereby foreign shareholders were not permitted to own more than 20 per cent
of the equity of privatised French companies.
The names of the lead managers have yet to be disclosed. However, big French
banks, such as Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais are expected to dominate
the operation.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Italy lifts credibility as a borrower
with Dollars 1.5bn FRN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Italy made substantial progress in restoring its credibility
as a borrower in the international capital markets, with the launch of its
Dollars 1.5bn issue of five-year floating-rate notes yesterday.
Italy's debt has taken a battering in the secondary markets in the last year
due to concerns about its creditworthiness, which were exacerbated by the
country's political instability. The latest downgrade by Moody's to A1
excluded a further group of investors, including many central banks, who are
not allowed to buy debt rated less than AA.
However, sentiment towards Italy may have turned, with expectations that
political reform will gain momentum under the new government of Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, the former central bank governor.
The pricing of Italy's notes at a margin of 25 basis points above the London
interbank offered rate (Libor) represented a tightening of the spread which
investors are willing to accept for Italy paper - and a cost saving for the
republic.
Italy's fixed-rate five-year Eurodollar bond offering, also via Morgan
Stanley, was launched last month at a yield spread of 65 basis points over
the comparable US Treasury, which represents a margin of around 40 basis
points over Libor, if swapped.
The discounted margin over Libor of 30 basis points for the latest
floating-rate note issue therefore represents a reduction in funding costs.
Houses holding senior syndicate positions on the transaction reported strong
demand for yesterday's issue from an unusually broad range of investors,
including bond fund managers, who are not normally buyers of FRNs.
Recent strong US economic data has strengthened expectations that the
Federal Reserve may soon move to raise interest rates, encouraging investors
to hold at least some portion of their portfolios in floating-rate assets,
they said.
However, some other dealers said that sales were rather slow, due to a lack
of focus on the deal by investors still expecting Italy to launch a global
bond offering.
Mr Alberto Giovannini, head of foreign borrowing at the Italian Treasury,
pointed out that foreign currency debt, while important to debt management
policy, totals only 3 per cent of the republic's outstanding debt.
At the start of the year, Treasury officials said they planned to raise
Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn in the international bond markets; close to
Dollars 6bn of foreign currency debt has been issued.
The Bank of China is preparing to launch a Dollars 200m issue of five-year
floating-rate notes today, via Credit Suisse First Boston. The notes will be
priced at 50 basis points over Libor.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P places Chrysler debt on
CreditWatch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, has placed the BB+ senior
debt rating of Chrysler Corporation, the US car manufacturer, on CreditWatch
with positive implications.
If the company is upgraded, even by a single notch, its rating will be
lifted from speculative to investment grade, which would allow Chrysler to
access a broader investor base and help reduce its funding costs. The move
would be particularly important for Chrysler Financial Corporation, the
credit arm, which is a frequent borrower in the bond markets, according to
Mr Edward Tyburczy, an S&amp;P managing director. Chrysler's rating has improved
steadily since it hit a low point of B+ in 1992.
The agency said that Chrysler's 'earnings and cash flow are significantly
exceeding prior expectations, due largely to overwhelming success with new
products and steps to enhance operating efficiency.'
Chrysler's BB- rated preferred stock has been placed on CreditWatch.
Chrysler has total consolidated debt of Dollars 14bn.
IBCA, the UK-based rating agency, has raised the long-term debt rating of
Standard Chartered, the British bank, from A- to A. IBCA said that in spite
of heavy losses in 1992 due to its exposure to a securities fraud in Bombay,
results were 'not markedly inferior to 1991'.

Email

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMAIL, the Australian domestic appliance maker, reports net profits little
changed for the year ended March, thanks to a steep decline in interest
costs and a lower tax bill.
On sales 6 per cent higher at ADollars 1.47bn (USDollars 1bn), the company
made profits after abnormal items of ADollars 55.5m, against ADollars 55.3m
a year earlier. The dividend is going up from 17 to 17.5 cents a share.
Email's interest costs fell from ADollars 15.7m to ADollars 6.5m as a result
of reduced borrowings and lower interest rates. The year's result takes in a
strong second half, during which net earnings rose 13.5 per cent after a
weak start.
Email predicts a profit improvement in the current year with betting
trading. It said exports had continued to grow and margins were increasing
despite strong competitive pressure.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Foschini advances 25% to R103m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOSCHINI, the South African clothing and jewellery retail group, overcame a
difficult trading environment last year to record a 25 per cent increase in
net attributable income to R103.3m (Dollars 32.4m).
Turnover rose 19 per cent to R1.16bn for the year ended March. Operating
profit was 20.6 per cent higher at R225m. Earnings per share rose 25 per
cent to 232 cents.
Mr Stanley Lewis, chairman, said it was difficult to predict a sustained
economic upturn, but said Foschini was confident of 'an improved result' in
the year ahead.
He said the results reflected 'our spread of stores, effective preparation
in anticipation of a difficult year, and a commitment to managing costs,
enhanced systems, and sharpened focus on product range'.
Foschini had invested more in the centralisation of group credit operations,
and in strategic systems development, Mr Lewis said. With new stores opened
during the year, and an accelerated refurbishing programme, the group
expanded by 20 to 713 stores.
Foschini has four principle operating divisions - Foschini, American Swiss,
Markhams, and Pages - which together retail clothing, jewellery and
accessories to the middle-income market. The company also holds an effective
controlling investment in Oceana Investment Corporation, which has a 36.4
per cent interest in UK fashion retailer, Etam.
The company is paying a final dividend of R63.4m, making a total payout for
the year of R102m. This is to be satisfied by the issue of new shares, in
the proportion of one for 41 held.
Profits for the year were helped by lower interest charges but had to take
account of reduced income from associates.

Tata steel unit

<TEXT>
TATA Iron and Steel (Tisco), the flagship company within India's giant Tata
group, reports a 40 per cent drop in net profits, to Rs1.27bn (Dollars
40.7m) for the year ended March, Reuter reports from Bombay.
Tisco said margins had been pressured throughout the year by recessionary
conditions. It is cutting the dividend from Rs3.5 to Rs2.5 a share.
Mr Ratan Tata, chairman, said prospects would pick up this year as the
economy revived, and if government spending on construction projects rose.
He hoped to maintain this year's dividend.
He expected sales to increase by 10 per cent in the current year, but
declined to give a forecast for profits.
Mr Tata said India's steel industry slipped into recession last year after
being hit hard by government spending cuts.
He was optimistic about a revival in the current year. The company expects
strong export sales to Asian markets, particularly China.
Sales of products and services last year rose Rs5.65bn to Rs33.52bn. Volume
in steel products rose 138,000 tonnes to 1.87m tonnes. Steel production, at
2.08m tonnes, was 106,000 tonnes higher.
However, gross profit declined to Rs4.81bn from Rs5.59bn because of lower
margins, the company said.
Tisco said phase three of the company's modernisation programme had made
good progress during the year, adding that a new blast furnace was now in
full operation.
It said its hot strip mill was undergoing trials and would soon be fully
operational. Other units of the modernisation programme, as well as a new
cement plant, would be completed in the current 12 months.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: TCI enters Japanese cable TV
market

<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S largest cable television operating company, Telecommunications
(TCI) of the US, is entering the Japanese cable TV market via an investment
in a unit of Sumitomo Corp, the Japanese trading house.
TCI is taking an 18 per cent stake in Cable Soft Network, a supplier of
cable TV programmes serving Japan's 160 cable TV operators. It is currently
100 per cent-owned by Sumitomo.
The investment, which will cost TCI about Y300m (Dollars 2.8m), reflects
growing interest in the budding Japanese market from US cable TV companies.
It follows a deal by Time Warner Entertainment Japan - 50 per cent-owned by
Time Warner of the US; 25 per cent by Toshiba; and 25 per cent by C Itoh,
the trading house - to provide technical assistance to a cable TV operator
based in Fukuoka, in southern Japan.
TCI's investment in CSN will provide Sumitomo with valuable marketing and
operations management expertise.
The Japanese cable TV market is still in its infancy compared with the US
market. CSN, for example, was only founded in 1989, while TCI started in
1955.
The US cable TV company serves more than 10m customers in 49 states, while
the entire Japanese market is estimated to be only about 700,000 households.
However, the deal will provide TCI with an early entry into a small, but
growing, market. The forecast for the year to March 1994 is for cable TV in
Japan to reach 1m households.
The deal will also expand TCI's global interests. It already has interests
in 17 franchise areas in the UK to provide both cable and telephone services
in partnership with US West, the telecommunications group.
Time Warner said although it was interested in Japanese cable TV, it had no
specific plans yet to enter that market.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Merger provisions keep ABSA
growth to 12%

AMALGAMATED Banks of South Africa (ABSA), the country's largest banking
group, increased earnings per share by 12 per cent to 121 cents in the year
ended March. It was the bank's first year of trading in its current form,
after two large mergers in 1991 and 1992.
The results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, lag those of
ABSA's main competitors. This was blamed on numerous one-off costs
attributable to the January 1992 merger with Bankorp. Foremost among these
were costs related to the retrenchment of 5,000 staff and increased bad debt
provisions.
Mr Piet Badenhorst, chief executive, said given that the group had
experienced a 'crisis year', the earnings performance was satisfactory. The
bank is stepping up its dividend by 10 per cent to 43.5 cents a share.
Net interest income rose to R3.7bn (Dollars 1.16bn) from R2.2bn before the
merger.
Bad and doubtful advances, however, rose by 73 per cent to R781m, reflecting
the legacy of poor lending at Bankorp and ABSA's more conservative
provisioning policy.
Total doubtful debt provisions, including provisions in subsidiaries
acquired, rose to R1.87bn from R637m, or 2.86 per cent of advances.
Mr Badenhorst said ABSA had 'gone to great lengths to provide adequately'
and hence anticipated this figure declining in the year ahead, provided the
state of the economy did not deteriorate.
With other operating income rising to R4.7bn from R2.8bn, and operating
expenditure increasing to R3.6bn from R2.2bn, pre-tax income advanced to
R1.08bn, against R670m. A large jump in the tax bill to R446.1m from R199.8m
left net income, before extraordinary items, 39 per cent higher at R683.8m
(R491.4m).
The smaller increase in earnings per share reflects the 24 per cent rise in
the number of shares in issue following the merger.

MERRILL Lynch, the largest securities house in the US, confirmed yesterday
that Mr Daniel Tully, president and chief executive, will replace Mr William
Schreyer as chairman at the end of this month, when Mr Schreyer retires.
The rise of Mr Tully was expected - when he was appointed chief executive in
May 1992, the firm indicated that Mr Tully would eventually take over from
Mr Schreyer as chairman.
Yesterday's announcement, however, leaves open who is to succeed Mr Tully.
Among possible candidates for the top post are Mr John Steffens, head of the
firm's individual investor business, Mr Herbert Allison, head of the
investment banking operations, and Mr David Komansky, who is in charge of
Merrill's debt and equity markets business.
Alliance Communications has filed a preliminary prospectus with Canadian
securities regulators for a public offering of common shares, Reuter reports
from Toronto.
The issue is being underwritten by Midland Walwyn Capital, Wood Gundy,
Gordon Capital Corp and Marleau Lemire Securities.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Shooting Star aims for
domination - Simon Holberton charts the rise of the Hong Kong TV broadcaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the emerging battle for the attention of Asia's television viewers, Star
Television, the Hong Kong-based satellite TV company, is no shrinking
violet.
Talk to senior Star executives and you will hear forecasts of dramatic
growth within the industry. They predict the number of broadcast TV channels
to expand from the current five 'free-to-air' channels to anything from 80
to 100, mostly pay channels, by 1996.
Underlying this outlook is a strategy of dominance in the skies - by seeking
to corner available, and soon to be available, satellite capacity - and on
the ground by tying down cable TV distributors. Company executives say money
is not a problem.
The main reason for this, they say, is Star's owner. Star is 50 per cent
owned by Mr Li Ka-shing, one of Hong Kong's wealthiest men, with the rest
owned by Hutchison Whampoa, which Mr Li also controls. Another reason is
that of the Dollars 600m committed in 1991 to Star and its sister company
Media Assets, which buys programming, only Dollars 360m has so far been
spent.
Star began broadcasting in May 1991 and by the end of the year it had five
'free-to-air' channels running 24 hours a day. According to research
commissioned by Star, by February this year more than 45m viewers, in 38
countries from China to Indonesia and Japan to Afghanistan, were tuning into
one of its five chan-nels.
It is these sort of figures that have attracted US and British media
companies. The initial interest from Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation
and Pearson, the diversified UK conglomerate, was for equity participation
in Star TV itself.
These preliminary discussions are believed to have foundered on the issue of
control. Star executives say that Mr Li, for the foreseeable future, does
not want to cede control of the network to any outsider.
Mr Murdoch appears to have retreated to consider his next move, while
Pearson's current aim, these executives say, is now more modest. It could
result in joint venture deals for an English-language education channel -
which would dovetail well with Pearson's educational books expertise - and
co-operation on a planned business news channel.
Indeed Star's preferred relationship with potential partners is of the joint
venture type. Four of the five channels it currently broadcasts - BBC World
Service News, MTV, Prime Sports and a Mandarin Chinese station - are this
type of arrangement.
'We want to do partnership deals at channel level,' says Mr Julian Mounter,
Star's recently installed chief executive. 'We are talking to a lot of
people about equity in channels. There has been considerable interest in
wanting to invest in our free-to-air service, or our subscription service.'
By the end of this year, or early next year, Star plans to begin
broadcasting five more pay-TV channels. As satellite capacity expands so
Star plans to acquire the use of more transponders, or transmitters, and
push out more TV channels, especially pay channels.
'When we start subscription services we will be able to move from
pan-regional to a whole series of national opportunities,' Mr Mounter says.
Star is also investing in new broadcast technology - based on digital
compression - and may well be the first commercial broadcaster to use it.
Digital compression allows a single transponder to broadcast up to eight
separate TV channels at once.
The company currently broadcasts on an AsiaSat satellite - Hutchison owns a
third of AsiaSat, together with Cable and Wireless and Citic, Beijing's
international investment arm - where it has 11 transponders (of 24) and
exclusive rights to broadcast TV internationally.
AsiaSat plans to launch AsiaSat2 towards the end of 1994 or early 1995 and
APT Satellite, a mainland Chinese consortium, will launch Apstar2 around the
same time. Both satellites will have large 'footprints' - the area where a
TV signal can be received - covering up to 75 per cent of the world's
population and extending from Tokyo to Berlin and Ulan Bator to Hobart.
Star has an option to take eight transponders on AsiaSat2, of a total of 32.
It was recently reported that it has signed a Dollars 350m deal with APT to
lease 20 of Apstar2's 34 transponders. When asked if the report were true,
Mr Mounter was evasive, only saying: 'We have a deal with AsiaSat and
nothing has changed.'
In both cases, Star is believed to be seeking exclusive rights, thereby
squeezing out potential US and European competitors which might want to
start a rival network. But Star's position is not as strong as it may want
others to believe; it is based as much on weakness as it is on strength.
If Star is to realise its ambition to corner the market it will need the
outside capital which co-operative deals with other operators or programming
providers brings. The Li family may even have to consider outside equity
par-ticipation at the company level in addition to the channel level.
The costs of leasing transponders are high - Dollars 1.25m to Dollars 1.5m a
year each - and so is investment in new broadcast technology, such as
digital compression. Star is reluctant to talk about costs associated with
this and the cost of its back-up satellite link station in Thailand.
An indication of size of the start-up costs and their impact on a large
company was given in 1991 when Hutchison, Star's joint owner, made a
controversial change to its accounting policies. For its telecoms and media
businesses it changed from the accepted accruals method of accounting to one
where costs and revenues are accounted for as they are paid or received.
Also, it decided to amortise start-up costs and expenses over periods of up
to 10 years.
Star will provide no details of its financial situation, including
advertising revenues. Mr Mounter claims that advertising revenues are
growing strongly. He also contends that Asia is a more homogeneous
advertising market than Europe. 'Asians have more of corporate view of life.
They do not have a resistance to pan-national campaigns,' he claims.
Star appears closer to cracking one early problem it encountered:
programming. There was early resistance to selling Star 'software' because
it was broadcast to so many countries. Providers were concerned that they
could not sell theirs in local markets.
'To distribute to 38 countries is expensive,' says Mr Mounter. 'The profit,
after expenses, of distributing to them all is small. So when they equate
what they can get from coming to a one-stop-shop like us with the
difficulties of revenue collection in Asia they are beginning to think
again.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Klockner write-off plan approved
by creditors

<TEXT>
KLOCKNER-WERKE, the ailing German steel producer, yesterday won overwhelming
approval from its creditors for a debt relief scheme, paving the way for the
company to write off nearly 50 per cent of its DM2.7bn (Dollars 1.66m) debt.
Creditors, dominated by the leading German banks, will receive between 40
and 60 per cent of their claims. Small creditors, owed no more than
DM10,000, will be fully reimbursed.
The approval also leaves Klockner free to reopen negotiations for the sale
of a significant share of its steel assets, a company spokesman said.
The company is considering selling at least a 50 per cent stake to an
outsider, Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, Klockner's chairman, told the
Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper yesterday.
The sale of Klockner-Edelstahl, the special steel division, was announced
earlier this year pending the success of the debt-relief scheme.
The subsidiary is to be sold for a symbolic DM2 to Mr Jurgen Grossmann, its
chairman until February 15. Druker, a Frankfurt-based consultancy company,
will acquire 25 per cent of the shares.
Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's two largest steelmakers, also announced
last month that they would lead a European consortium of steel producers to
bid for Klockner's cold-rolling mill, the most profitable part of the
company.
But Mr von Rohr said he would not sell such an important asset without also
negotiating the sale of a part of Klockner's hot-rolling mill, an area of
the European industry which suffers from severe overcapacity.
Any move by Klockner to sell part its core steel assets will be watched with
some trepidation by other German steelmakers which have expressed worries at
the prospect of the company emerging better able to compete in a market
still affected by over-capacity.
Under pressure from other steel producers, including German steelmakers, the
European commission insisted on significant capacity cuts at Klockner before
agreeing to write-off part of its DM175m loan.
Under its agreement with the commission, signed last Friday, Klockner will
reduce its pig-iron capacity by 33 per cent to 2.4m tonnes per year. The
company's crude steel production will fall by 20 per cent to 2.8m while its
hot-rolling mill capacity will decrease by 12 per cent to 3.7m tonnes.
The company plans to tear down one of its two blast furnaces in Bremen in
answer to the EC demand that its production cuts be made irreversible.
Creditors will also be entitled, over the next 8 years, to receive a third
of the group's distributable profits, including earnings coming from its
non-steel divisions, as long as this does not make up more than 50 per cent
of the debt they have agreed to cancel.
The debt-relief plan is expected to be approved today and tomorrow by the
creditors of Klockner's steel subsidiaries, most of whom are the same as
those of the holding company.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rights issue for BK Vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BK VISION, the Swiss investment holding company specialising in financial
companies, is raising SFr220m (Dollars 151m) in its second rights issue in
less than a year.
BK, which was formed by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank in October 1991, recently
attracted attention by contesting decisions by the board of Union Bank of
Switzerland. BK is the largest UBS shareholder with a 15 per cent stake
worth SFr820m.
Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, manager of BK, said that the rights issue would enable
the company to increase its investments and would increase the liquidity of
its shares.
The issue is on the basis of one for every five registered or bearer shares
held at 220 per cent of nominal values; that is, SFr1,100 for each new
bearer share and SFr220 for each new registered share.
The net asset value of BK, which also holds shares in Zurich Insurance and
Leu Holding, has jumped from SFr728m when its last rights issue was launched
in August, 1992 to SFr1.27bn (SFr1,273 per bearer share) on Friday.
Mr Schiltknecht said BK believed that financial shares would continue to
perform well.
The economies of most industrialised countries were bottoming out, interest
rates would continue to fall and restructuring in the banking sector was
accelerating.
He said trading in BK shares had picked up significantly in recent months,
partly in response to the company beginning to market itself in Germany, and
the directors were uneasy about the price of the bearer share, at SFr1,275,
being so close to the net asset value.
BK's strategy, which has aroused controversy in Swiss financial circles, is
to hold significant stakes in a small number of financial institutions with
a view to having some influence on their strategic direction.
Early this year, the company publicly objected to the decisions of the UBS
board to evict a director and to create new capital that could be used
without prior shareholder authorisation.
In its latest interim report to April 30, BK said only that it regretted the
UBS decisions. Mr Schiltknecht said yesterday that the directors were still
assessing what, if any, further action to take.

drug group

<TEXT>
THE BIDDING war for Office Commercial Pharmaceutique (OCP) hotted up
yesterday when Gehe, the German drug distributor, raised its offer for
France's largest drug wholesaler, to 16.8 per cent above a French-American
bid.
In one of few recent contested takeovers in France, Gehe is offering FFr985
a share in a full bid for OCP, which is now worth FFr2.6bn (Dollars 480m).
Dr Dieter Schadt, Gehe's president, said 'the very high price' reflected his
company's desire to 'shorten the process', started by Gehe with a bid of
FFr800 a share in February.
Gehe, however, was not confident yesterday that its bid would knock out the
rival bid mounted by Cooper, a French pharmaceutical company, in alliance
with Bergen Brunswick of the US. 'Both sides have a lot of ammunition,' said
Dr Dieter Kammerer, Gehe's vice-president. He said a third bidder could not
be excluded and noted that McKesson, the large US pharmaceutical wholesaler,
had shown interest in getting into Europe.
Gehe's first bid was disallowed by the French courts because of an
arrangement between the German company and Mr Jean-Pierre Duche, a former
president of OCP who runs the French company's operational distribution
units Eurosante and OCP-Repartition. The court ruled that the arrangement
was unfair because it would have denied the Franco-American consortium
effective management of OCP even if it gained the shares of the contested
French company.
As a result of the ruling, any successful bidder for OCP has been promised
effective control of the entire operation.
There was no word last night on whether Aura Expansion, the bid vehicle of
Cooper and Bergen-Brunswick, wants to improve its FFr865-a-share offer,
which runs until June 28.
Gehe said if it got OCP, it would bring its German drug wholesaling
operation, which has 18 per cent of the German market, under OCP. The new
grouping would function as a European unit.
Gehe executives said they planned to recoup their investment in OCP by using
their information technology know-how to improve the French company's
margins. Drug distribution is highly complex in France and Germany because
it requires serving lots of individually-owned pharmacies several times a
day, in contrast to the UK which allows chains of chemist shops.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: SME buys 50% of Cepsa catering
concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SME, the Italian state-controlled foods, catering and retailing group due to
be privatised, has taken another step in its foreign expansion with a plan
to develop about 100 motorway catering outlets in Spain, creating 3,000
jobs.
Autogrill, SME's catering subsidiary, is buying 50 per cent of Procace, a
catering offshoot of the Spanish Cepsa oil and chemicals group. The two
companies will build 15 motorway restaurants in a first development phase,
which will be extended with the construction of about 10 restaurants a year
over the next decade.
Autogrill did not reveal how much the stake had cost, nor the size of its
future Spanish investments. A company official said the Spanish motorway
catering network was relatively undeveloped and offered considerable
opportunities.
Autogrill has been seeking to expand beyond the mature Italian market, in
which it is the dominant force. The group, which has 328 motorway catering
outlets, along with 44 restaurants in Italy's main cities, claims to be
Europe's third biggest catering group. The company had sales of about
L1,100bn (Dollars 753m) and operating profits of L36bn.
Its roadside restaurants are a familiar sight on Italy's autostrade, while
its city-centre catering activities are now being restructured.
Earlier this year, Autogrill extended its foreign operations by buying '4
Pentes', a French motorway catering concern owned by the Elitair group. The
company is the third biggest motorway catering operator in France, with 15
sites and sales of about L17bn. When the deal goes through in October, the
sites will be modernised and redeveloped.
No price for the French transaction was revealed.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Fondiaria debts put at L2,000bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FONDIARIA, Italy's third biggest private-sector insurance group, which
posted consolidated losses of about L580bn (Dollars 392m) last year, is
believed to have run up debts of about L2,000bn to finance foreign insurance
expansion and diversification at home.
The debt estimate, yet to be confirmed at Fondiaria's annual meeting, is
appreciably higher than formerly believed. The size of borrowings indicates
the task facing the group's new management under Mr Arrigo Bianchi di
Lavagna, appointed managing director earlier this year.
The debts stem from Fondiaria's investment in Aachener und Munchener
Beteiligungs, Germany's second-biggest insurer, and expansion into areas
such as hotels and clinics in Italy.
The German venture, effectively wound up last month with the DM985m (Dollars
615.6m) sale of Fondiaria's 21 per cent stake in AMB, cost about DM1.2bn,
excluding financing charges. No figures are available for the size of the
domestic diversification. However, the move into hotels and clinics,
involving management as well as ownership, is not believed to have been
profitable.
Mr Bianchi di Lavagna, in his first newspaper interview, said about L185bn
of last year's losses stemmed from difficulties in reinsurance, handled by
the holding company on behalf of subsidiaries. A large proportion had come
from 'stop loss' policies for one subsidiary.
Earnings had also been hit by extraordinary losses on equity stakes, notably
AMB and the diversified operations, and by interest charges on borrowings.
He said turning round the Fondiaria group, which comprises La Fondiaria
Assicurazioni, La Previdente and Milano Assicurazioni as its three main
operating subsidiaries, involved tariff increases and more selective vetting
of policies on the loss-making third party car insurance side.
The group is Italy's leader in third-party motor risks, with over 13.5 per
cent of the market. Fondiaria would also have to reinforce and 're-educate'
its sales agents to sell a wider range of policies and products, he said.
The group has already indicated it intends to sell non-core activities to
reduce debts. Negotiations on the disposal of Banca Mercantile, a 13-branch
Florence-based bank owned jointly with Ferruzzi, are already under way.
Other assets suitable for disposal include the group's five hotels and
health activities. However, Mr Bianchi di Lavagna stressed the company would
avoid a fire sale, and was currently weighing up the possibility of using a
bank intermediary to obtain the proceeds for its stakes in AMB and the EPIC
insurance partnership ahead of the May 1994 payment date.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: An uncomfortable animal seeks big game
status - Guy de Jonquieres looks at Cadbury Schweppes' plans to change its
international image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY Schweppes thinks it suffers from a perception problem. 'People today
want an uncomplicated, two-word description of everything,' says Mr Dominic
Cadbury, chairman. 'But if you are more than national, yet less than global,
you are an uncomfortable animal to describe.'
The stock market seems to agree. Until last autumn, Britain's largest
confectionery and soft drinks company was a City darling. Applauded for the
quality of its management, its tight focus on two core businesses and its
strong commitment to product innovation and brand support, its shares
handsomely out-performed the UK food sector from mid-1991.
But recently, Cadbury's City halo has slipped and its share price with it,
although the latter has recovered partially in the last few weeks. As its
premium rating has eroded, some erstwhile fans have begun to wonder if their
earlier enthusiasm was overdone.
This swing in sentiment seems hard to pin only on Cadbury's recent
performance - or on the fading of long-standing speculation that it was a
prime bid target.
True, pre-tax profits rose only 5.7 per cent last year, well below the
annual growth to which investors have grown accustomed. But the results,
depressed by a Pounds 14m restructuring charge, handsomely exceeded
expectations and were accompanied by bullish management forecasts for this
year.
The doubts most often expressed concern the longer term. One is that Cadbury
has outgrown the UK but lacks a convincing international expansion strategy.
The other is that, to secure future growth, it must take some bold strategic
initiative soon.
Mr Les Pugh, food industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, says Cadbury is 'at
a watershed'. Mr John Campbell of NatWest Securities, which recently issued
a bearish report on the group, argues that it is 'in a strategic bind.'
'Baloney,' replies Mr Cadbury, insisting no dramatic moves are needed or
likely. 'Our task is to go on growing the business by incremental steps.
We've done it in the past 10 years - why should we not be able to in the
next 10?'
He points to the success of both UK businesses, Cadbury Ltd and Coca - Cola
&amp; Schweppes Beverages, the six year-old venture with Coca-Cola, in
increasing sales and profits. Both are the market leaders and earned margins
of more than 10 per cent last year.
Sceptics agree that the record is impressive, but wonder whether the
businesses can grow much faster than their markets in the future. They argue
that Cadbury Ltd has profited from one-off rationalisation at Trebor
Bassett, its sugar confectionery division, and from temporarily weaker
performances by rivals Nestle and Mars.
Meanwhile, the recent sale by Terry's, United Biscuits' chocolate division,
to Philip Morris of the US has brought another heavyweight contender into
the UK.
But the keenest debate centres on Cadbury's international businesses, into
which a growing share of resources has been channelled. Seventeen of its 20
acquisitions in the past five years were abroad and accounted for Pounds
900m of the Pounds 1.25bn total spent. But while half of sales has for some
years come from abroad, the share of profits has slipped from 63 per cent in
1989 to 55 per cent last year.
Cadbury's overseas operations, spanning some 150 countries, are widely, but
thinly, spread. It is clear leader only in a few - mostly traditional
Commonwealth markets. The group says exploiting profitable sub-sectors of
the market matters more than overall category leadership and scale.
Nonetheless, it has recently been stung by the sceptics into raising the
profile of its international ambitions, particularly in confectionery, where
foreign expansion has historically received less emphasis than in beverages.
'The aim is very clear. We intend to be part of the big league,' says Mr
David Wellings, who became group chief executive last month after running
the confectionery business. He wants Cadbury to rise from fourth position in
the Dollars 45bn world market to rival Philip Morris for second place behind
Nestle. The challenge is how to do it. Cadbury sold its US operations in
1988 to Hershey, which makes its brands under licence, though it remains
free to sell sugar confectionery there. Cadbury also concedes it is weak in
continental Europe, where its confectionery sales in France, Germany and
Spain were Pounds 269m last year.
The group needs acquisitions to expand further in Europe and is counting on
competitive pressures to shake out more candidates. But rivals have already
purchased many of the best targets, and most of those remaining are small
and privately-owned. They are also being eyed just as eagerly by Philip
Morris and Nestle, which have deep pockets and reputations for paying
sky-high prices.
Mr Wellings remains undaunted. 'If we can't find a ready - made hotel to buy
in Europe, we'll build our own brick by brick.' he says.
Apart from Australia and New Zealand, where Cadbury is well-entrenched, that
leaves Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The group thinks these regions are
set for rapid growth and has long had a presence in all of them. It recently
built a plant in Egypt and plans another in China.
However, the investments needed to build sizeable businesses in so many
countries look formidable. Though the group's balance sheet and cash flow
are strong, Mr Cadbury admits new markets take time to contribute to the
profits stream which he is committed to increasing every year.
Nor is the Cadbury brand that powerful an asset. Though the company is known
worldwide, its name and established confectionery lines mean little to
consumers in many countries. Even in Europe, Mr Wellings says, UK products
need to be re-formulated and re-branded locally. In beverages, the
challenges are different. Brands such as Schweppes and Canada Dry are
genuinely global. However, like much of the group's beverage range, they are
niche products with limited mass market appeal. Though the world's third
largest soft drinks producer, Cadbury Schweppes' 4 per cent market share
puts it far behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.
The group's prosperity hinges on balancing between two options. Either it
can franchise its brands to other soft drinks bottlers, which minimises
investment but also control over distribution. Or it can invest in its own
bottling facilities, as it did by acquiring a Mexican mineral water company
for Pounds 188m last year. That gives a firmer grip on marketing but
requires high sales volumes to be economic.
Cadbury Schweppes' success in treading this tightrope has depended heavily
on its agility and skill in forging alliances around the world with its
bigger rivals. 'We can help Pepsi by strengthening its ability to compete
with Coke, and we can help Coke by filling niches in its portfolio,' says Mr
Frank Swan, head of the group's beverage business.
That did not prevent an uneven performance in continental Europe last year,
due partly to structural changes and fiercer competition in the soft drinks
business. But Mr Swan thinks these shifts will also create chances for deals
and ventures which Cadbury is well-placed to seize.
In the US, he says, the group can continue to grow profitably by
distributing existing products more widely. But he would also like to expand
its modest 4 per cent market share and brand portfolio through acquisitions.
He does not rule out a deal with Dr Pepper, the soft drinks group which
Cadbury tried to buy in the 1980s and which has US sales double those of the
UK company.
But some observers believe that, with Mr Wellings as chief executive, any
big medium-term developments are more likely be outside soft drinks  - a
view reinforced by his recent emphasis on the global ambitions of the
confectionery side.
Nor does Mr Wellings exclude expansion into new fields. While dismissing as
speculation reports that Cadbury had discussed a possible merger with United
Biscuits earlier this year, he says: 'Just because we make products that are
brown and sold in little packets doesn't mean that is the only business we
are going to be in. It is a statement of fact that we're in confectionery
and soft drinks. It need not be a statement of intent.'
What lies behind those comments is unclear. The group's top managers
emphasise that they remain pragmatic about how to further the group's
development and will take opportunities as they come. 'Acquisition,
alliance, joint venture - we're open to it,' says Mr Wellings.
However, that also implies a dependence on the right opportunities turning
up at the right moment. Perhaps the one certainty is that, as a group which
is committed to sustained increases in annual profits and has already
experienced the threat of hostile takeover, Cadbury knows it cannot afford
to disappoint the expectations its performance has created among its
shareholders.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Western Selection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At March 31 1993 net asset value of Western Selection, the investment
finance company, was 18.82p, and 21.75p taking the market value of listed
associated undertakings.
Operating profit for the half year to March fell from Pounds 27,000 to
Pounds 24,000, but the previous period had to combat costs of Pounds 50,000
from discontinued operations. Earnings per share were 0.16p (losses 0.11p).
The half year included the dividend from Burlington Group. It was maintained
but the gross amount fell because of the reduced credits available following
the Budget.
Western has a 39.6 per cent holding in Creston. The latter plans an
acquisition for shares, which Western supports, and that will reduce its
stake to 15.3 per cent.

AS A result of losses in its new vessel, London &amp; Overseas Freighters saw
pre-tax profit fall from Dollars 2.67m to Dollars 1.86m (Pounds 1.2m) in the
year to March 31.
The accounts are now stated in dollars as the company moved its domicile to
Bermuda a year ago. The dividend this time is 2 cents gross, which will be
converted into sterling unless individual shareholders decide otherwise. The
1991-92 payment was 1.25p net.
Directors said the reduced profit could be blamed on trading of the acquired
Nestor, now renamed London Enterprise. Its losses have been Dollars 630,000
since being transferred from Scoresby.
This year London Enterprise will be overhauled with consequent loss of
revenue. In mid-July the newly built tanker London Pride should be delivered
to trade under the profitable charter to Chevron.

During the second half total assets of the fund appreciated by 13.2 per cent

But that was not enough to recover the underperformance of the opening half,
and over the year total assets rose 3.4 per cent compared with an increase
of 8.3 per cent from the Index.
On the income side net revenue fell from Pounds 840,000 to Pounds 755,000

Molynx Holdings, the closed circuit television, security and building energy
management systems maker, showed no improvement in the second half of 1992
and finished the year with a loss of Pounds 486,000.
It is omitting the final dividend to leave the total at 1.3p (4p).
The loss, against a profit last time of Pounds 1.93m, was made from sales of
Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 22m).
Operating profit in CCTV fell from Pounds 1.16m to Pounds 515,000 reflecting
the severity of recession in the UK during which nearly all main customers
were reducing capacity.
Management systems moved from a profit of Pounds 1.18m to a loss of Pounds
578,000 which was spread across all markets of operation. Savage trading
conditions in UK construction hit margins hard.
Gearing at the year-end was 82 per cent and steps will be taken to reduce
borrowings.
Losses per share came to 1.9p (earnings 10.7p).

<TEXT>
Aberdeen Trust, the investment and unit trust management company, reported
profits of Pounds 981,000 pre-tax for the six months to March 31.
The outcome, achieved on turnover of Pounds 7.15m (Pounds 5.59m), compared
with profits last time of Pounds 1.04m and was struck after reorganisation
costs totalling Pounds 600,000, including a compensation payment of Pounds
150,000 to a former director for loss of office.
The costs masked a sharp improvement at the operating level - profits moved
ahead from Pounds 1.19m to Pounds 2.07m - reflecting strong growth in fund
management and currency benefits. Interest charges, however, jumped from
Pounds 221,000 to Pounds 523,000 as a result of the transaction last
September with Century Life.
Earnings per share dipped to 0.81p (0.97p) and the interim dividend is
halved to 0.5p; a final of 1p is forecast, however, which would maintain the
total at 1.5p.

Of the shares, 6.82m are being sold by existing holders and the balance by
the group to raise Pounds 2.05m net for reducing borrowings prior to
suitable expansion opportunities.
The group operates from Askern, near Doncaster, and is the largest UK maker
of despatch and shipping reels used for storing, transporting and dispensing
cables, wire rope and similar products.
In the year ended July 31 1992 turnover fell from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds
16.4m and operating profit from Pounds 3.32m to Pounds 3m. But crediting
non-recurring items pushed up the pre-tax balance from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds
3.87m.
In the eight months to March 31 1993 turnover had reached Pounds 10.7m,
operating profit Pounds 1.95m and the pre-tax figure Pounds 1.87m. For the
full year the pre-tax profit is forecast at Pounds 2.7m with earnings per
share of 11.04p. The first dividend will be a special 2p in January.

to Pounds 956,000 for the six months to March 31.
Mr Paul Gotley, chairman, said that, as indicated, the current year started

helped by the successful development in the UK of Solomat sales.
Sales rose 13.2 per cent to Pounds 10.5m. Excluding Solomat for the first
three months the increase was 5.5 per cent.
For the full year 1991 - 92 pre - tax profits were 16 per cent higher at

deducting costs, the net contribution was Pounds 764,000.
The cost of acquiring Touche Remnant was Pounds 43.4m, including expenses.
After allowing for the effects of a pension fund holiday and for the costs
of integrating the businesses, Henderson wrote off Pounds 24.4m of goodwill
against its assets. As a result, shareholders funds fell to Pounds 36.8m,
from Pounds 60.2m at the end of March 1992.
The main fall in profits occurred in the first half when stock markets were
weak. However, second half profits, at Pounds 8.1m, were also down from the
Pounds 8.2m recorded in the second half of the previous year.
The group suffered some further losses of pension fund clients, reflecting
disappointing investment performance in the late 1980s. However, Henderson
said that its performance had recently improved, although it was 'still too
early' to say whether it had seen the end of client losses.
The acquisition of Touche Remnant turned the group into the UK's largest
investment trust manager and there will be a marketing relaunch this summer.
The range of unit trusts is set to be rationalised, with fund mergers
expected to reduce the number of trusts from 35 to 21.
Operating profits were Pounds 9.66m (Pounds 10.1m) and interest income fell
from Pounds 6.91m to Pounds 5.48m due to lower interest rates and the loss
of cash spent on the acquisition.
There was a loss from associated business of Pounds 585,000, mainly
reflecting costs at Seligman Henderson, the US venture.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Critchley moves ahead to Pounds 3.05m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITCHLEY GROUP, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer which came to
the market in November, increased pre-tax profits by 35 per cent over the
year to March 31.
Strong demand in the UK and overseas, coupled with the acquisition of EPC
Identification Systems of the US in April last year, helped lift profits to
Pounds 3.05m (Pounds 2.26m).
Turnover increased 24 per cent to Pounds 24m (Pounds 19.2m) of which Pounds
1.89m was attributable to EPC. Overseas sales accounted for 43 per cent.
Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 19.1p (15.3p) out of which a 4.8p
dividend is proposed.
The core electrical cable accessories and identification products business
increased sales 26 per cent to Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 13.8m) and operating
profit 14.5 per cent to Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 2.22m).
New products, particularly HSI, the computerised wire marking system which
is now Critchley's biggest seller, and sale of cable accessories
manufactured in LFH (Limited Fire Hazard) plastic materials, made 'good
contributions.'
Main customers in the UK for these products include thepower generation, oil
and gas, and rail industries.
Direct exports from the UK rose 21 per cent mainly reflecting strong demand
for specialist products. Mr Chris Humphrey, finance director, said margins
were 'fractionally' higher.
The group's two other companies, Critchley Wound Components and Critchley
Enclosures, both serving the electronics industry, also improved their
performance.
In April the group acquired the BT Label Centre for Pounds 1.5m cash. The
business, subsequently renamed Critchley Label Centre, produces printed
plastic identification labels for BT and a growing number of industrial
users.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clive Smith succeeds in avoiding bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLIVE SMITH, the entrepreneur once involved in two natural resource
companies under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, yesterday avoided
bankruptcy when a majority of creditors owed more than Pounds 20m accepted
his proposals for repayment at a rate of 8.13p in the pound.
However, some creditors remained sceptical about the outcome of the vote and
determined to take the issue further.
In a meeting lasting more than two hours Mr Smith was questioned closely
about his links with some of the creditors who voted in favour.
Most particularly, they sought information about his relationship with
Richard Pearce and Son, a Hong Kong registered company with the same Irish
address as Mr Kelvin Myles, who has manged many of Mr Smith's offshore
interests.
Mr Smith denied he had any connection, direct or indirect, with the Hong
Kong company. Richard Pearce's proxy was voted by the meeting's chairman Mr
Graham Wilson, the insolvency practitioner who arranged the creditors'
meeting.
Representatives also asked for details of any assets Mr Smith holds offshore
and questioned the validity of allowing Newsham Investments to vote its
claimed Pounds 3.8m debt. Newsham is a vehicle for the Smith family
interests.
One creditor leaving the meeting commented: 'We remain sceptical. We have
been promised today information about Mr Smith's offshore trust fund but we
have yet to receive it.'
Some creditors' representatives also sought information about the nature of
Mr Smith's involvement with Alpine (Double Glazing), the windows company,
which ceased trading late last month.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hicking ahead 31% to Pounds 2.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HICKING Pentecost, the industrial products and textiles company, maintained
its progress over the past three years with a 31 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 2.85m in the 12 months to March 31.
Mr Tudor Davies, managing director, said he was pleased with the rise from
Pounds 2.17m and added that the devaluation of sterling should have a
favourable impact on next year's results. Export sales accounted for Pounds
6m - mostly in textiles - of the Pounds 29.5m (Pounds 24.6m) turnover.
Mr Davies acknowledged that the textiles side had proved the most resilient
 -it lifted operating profits 30 per cent to Pounds 2.32m on sales 9 per
cent ahead at Pounds 20.5m. Operating margins rose to 11.3 (9.5) per cent.
Since he and Mr John Lister, chairman, joined the group, they have added the
industrial products side to the previously floundering textile group. He
said they had been more adept at managing the core than either had imagined
they would be.
However, Mr Davies said that the group was looking for opportunities to
create a third leg - 'so as not to be too dependent on textiles'.
Operating profits in the industrial products division rose 7 per cent to
Pounds 640,000 on turnover up 55 per cent at Pounds 9m. The turnover figure
was boosted by three acquisitions for an aggregate Pounds 2.84m.
Other acquisitions were predicted by Mr Lister: Mr Davies suggested that in
textiles they would be bolt-on, possibly making use of Hicking's in-house
dyeworks.
Mr Lister said that in view of the 'excellent results and strong cash
generation', a 20 per cent rise in the final dividend to 2.65p is
recommended, making a total of 4p (3.4p), payable from earnings of 11.64p
(10.07p).

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Leigh Interests blames coal side for 33%
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REDUCED contribution from coal extraction and higher interest charges were
blamed by Leigh Interests, the waste management company, for a 33 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended March 31.
Profits were down from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 9.5m following a sales
reduction from Pounds 118.9m to Pounds 109.2m.
Increased investment and acquisitions were responsible for a rise in
borrowings from Pounds 38m to Pounds 50m, representing gearing of 72 per
cent. Interest charges were up by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 4.2m.
Capital expenditure is expected to be cut from Pounds 24m to between Pounds
15 and Pounds 20m. The company continued to invest in a national network of
waste collection, disposal and treatment facilities.
Mr Malcolm Wood, chairman, said that while the commissioning delays of new
plant in the Midlands held back profits in that region, the reduction in
volumes of waste in previous periods in the south of England had ended.
The mainstream environmental business reported reduced operating profits of
Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 13.5m) on sales of Pounds 93.7m (Pounds 97.3m).
Operating profits from the extraction and processing of coal fell from
Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 1.3m following the decreased production from the
company's reserves, in consequence of the review of the coal industry and
delays in granting of consents for new open cast mines.
During the year Leigh acquired 120 acres of freehold land at Rugby, which it
already occupied on a leasehold basis, for Pounds 3m.
Earnings per share fell from 15.5p to 10.3p. The final dividend is
maintained at 5.37p making an unchanged 7.83p.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eastern boost as Oriflame rises 34%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance in eastern Europe helped Oriflame International, the
direct sales cosmetics group, increase pre-tax profits by 34 per cent to
Pounds 11.9m.
Sales rose by 29 per cent to Pounds 83.6m in the year to March 31, although
the group said trading conditions had been difficult in its traditional
Scandinavian and UK markets. However, there were some signs that these
economies would improve over the next 12 months,
Although earnings per share rose by 30 per cent to 20.4p (15.7p), the final
dividend is held at 8p, giving an unchanged gross total of 12p.
The group said it had not increased the dividend because it spent Pounds
3.2m on its Dublin production facilities, increased working capital and
invested in Norway and Portugal. It was confident that this investment would
increase earnings and that dividend growth would resume next year.
Mr Robert af Jochnick , chairman, said: 'This has been a highly successful
year for Oriflame in most of our markets and in eastern Europe in
particular. We have increased our investment in our production facilities
and this, coupled with our geographic spread, gives us great potential for
further successes in the future.'
The group said its manufacturing operations had begun to experience the
anticipated economies of scale as a result of the integration of ACO, the
Swedish skin care brand which it bought for about Pounds 10m at the end of
1991. ACO products added Pounds 12.1m to sales and made a strong
contribution to group profits.
The group's 25 per cent stake in Oriflame Eastern Europe and position as
primary supplier to that associate continued to bear fruit. Sales to eastern
Europe more than doubled to Pounds 6.4m and Oriflame Eastern Europe more
than doubled its contribution to pre-tax profits to Pounds 3m.
Mail order sales of the Oriflame and Vevay brands in Denmark rose. But after
consideration of the contributions from Vevay in France and the UK, the
group decided to cease trading in these markets.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Jeyes shares drop 28% on trading warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Jeyes plunged 28 per cent yesterday after the cleaning products
group said current trading was substantially below market expectations and
revealed greater than expected reorganisation costs.
The shares fell 122p to 317p, some 68p below last July's rights issue price
that took the group into continental Europe and nearly doubled sales.
The profits warning is a severe set-back for Jeyes which floated in 1988 two
years after a trend setting management buy-out from Cadbury Schweppes and
had since won a heady stock market rating.
Mr Jimmy Moir, chief executive, said operating margins in the UK, the
group's largest market with 45 per cent of sales, had fallen from 8 per cent
to 3 per cent in the first half. Margins had been hit because a sharp
increase in promotional spending designed to gain market share had coincided
with a period of zero price inflation.
Market shares had increased sharply in hygiene wipes and bleach but all the
reduction in margin had been felt directly on the bottom line, Mr Moir said.
Exports were 18 per cent below where the group had anticipated they would
be.
Jeyes also made a Pounds 600,000 provision to reduce the size its management
overhead following the Globol acquisition in Germany. While the group was
expecting to have to reorganise the manufacturing plant, it had not
anticipated the cost of reorganising the management.
German sales, margins and operating profits from Globol were ahead of plan
and last year's levels.
Overall, the group would be Pounds 2m short of the expected level of pre-tax
profits in the first half. Mr Moir said he remained confident that the
second half would be in line with expectations. 'In many ways the forward
view is not bleak,' he said. 'None of the benefits (of the reorganisation)
have been felt in first half.'
Market share would be much higher in the second half without some of the
cost of achieving higher sales. But lower interim profits meant the pre-tax
outcome for the full year would be 'well below market expectations', he
said.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clydesdale Gp defers introduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLYDESDALE Group, the Glasgow-based electrical goods retailer, has postponed
the Stock Exchange flotation scheduled for later this month. It said that
profits, though showing a substantial increase, were below expectations.
Operating profits in the year to April 3 1993 were Pounds 5.62m, compared
with Pounds 4.4m in the previous 14 months. But it had forecast operating
profits of about Pounds 7m, and that was included in a report on the company
by NatWest Securities, its broker.
Group sales were Pounds 141m, a 27 per cent rise on the Pounds 111m of
1991-92. A direct year-on-year comparison showed growth of 42 per cent.
Clydesdale said current trading and expansion strategies had proved
successful in a poor economic climate and it was well placed for an upturn
in consumer confidence. It had made a good start to the current year and was
optimistic about the outturn for the year as a whole.
The company wants to float on the basis of better profit figures, which
could mean waiting a year.
The flotation would have raised Pounds 30m in new money to wipe out most of
its borrowing and to finance further expansion in England. It had been
expected to value the company at about Pounds 80m.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Emap up 56% and new magazines on the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMAP, the media and exhibitions group, is planning its most significant
slate of new magazine launches for many years.
Mr Robin Miller, chief executive, said yesterday plans were well advanced
for new magazines in motoring, music and other leisure areas in both the UK
and Europe - an immediate investment in the region of Pounds 5m.
He was speaking as the group announced a 56 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 42.4m for the year to April 3 - underlying profit growth
of 24 per cent excluding the effects of last June's Pounds 78m rights issue
and new accountancy standards.
Mr Graham Ross-Russell, chairman, said the record results had been achieved
with no help from the economy and 'we are not expecting much assistance in
the year ahead'.
The strongest performer was consumer magazines where operating profit rose
17 per cent to Pounds 24.2m on turnover up from Pounds 115.1m to Pounds
142.6m. The group had 24 titles in the Top 100.
The worst result came from newspapers and printing where there was a 15 per
cent fall in operating profit to Pounds 6.7m. Emap lost a significant
contract - the printing of the Sport newspapers to the Daily Telegraph. The
loss and tight margins led to restructuring and a cut in overall pay of
20-30 per cent for about 100 printers. Newspaper advertising was down by 1
per cent although there were signs of improvement in the final quarter.
Exhibitions showed an 11 per cent increase in operating profit to Pounds
6.4m and the first full year of Radio City and Kiss FM saw revenue up 18 per
cent and profit of Pounds 800,000. Emap has applied for a new AM licence in
London for a service aimed mainly at women.
The largest percentage leap came in business publishing where profits rose
from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 4.6m, mainly reflecting the acquisition of
Maxwell Business Communications. There was also a maiden contribution from
the 14 business titles bought from International Thomson.
'We increased profit margins on the Maxwell titles from 4 per cent to 9 per
cent. We hope we can do the same with the Thomson titles,' Mr Miller said.
A final dividend of 5.825p lifts the total by 9 per cent to 7.9p, payable
from earnings of 17p (12.1p).
COMMENT
Emap continues to produce good results from a stable formula of launching
new titles and going for careful acquisitions. The group will have to
continue doing that to justify its high market rating - a current 37 per
cent premium on the FT-A All-Share Index. The group is, however, not relying
on any help from the economy in their budget forecasts for the current year.
A sustained economic recovery could transform the outlook for the company.
Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 47m and Pounds
49m this year.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Field float carries Pounds 150m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIELD GROUP, the folding carton maker, has issued the pathfinder prospectus
for its flotation and announced results for the year to April 4 showing a
rise in operating profits from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 12.6m.
The group aims to raise Pounds 90m through the flotation, expected to value
Field at about Pounds 150m. There will be a placing and public offer divided
with about 35 per cent going to the offer.
Of the proceeds, Pounds 18m will cover sales by existing shareholders,
including some directors, Pounds 21m will redeem preference shares and
Pounds 48m will repay zero coupon bonds. These securities were issued at the
time of the management buy-out from SCA, the Swedish paper and packaging
group. That would leave Pounds 3m of net new money for the company.
Mr Keith Gilchrist, chief executive of Field, said the group had started the
current year well with sales and profits higher. He said the group had
supplied 21 of its top 30 customers for more than 20 years. The top 30
account for two thirds of group sales.
Growth would come, he said, from an upturn in consumer spending, new product
launches, customers rationalising their suppliers, and the potential for
cartons to replace other packaging such as plastics. Field has developed a
carton for shampoo, as well as liquid detergents and motor oil. There would
be benefits from Pounds 50m of capital expenditure over the last five years.
Over the last four years and despite a slight fall in the UK market for
cartons, Field's UK operations had shown volume growth of 35.8 per cent. In
1990 Field bought Mareen, a Belgian carton company.
Mr David Nussbaum, finance director, said that sales excluding Mareen since
the 1988-89 financial year had risen by 11.3 per cent per year compound and
operating profits by 8.8 per cent.
Sales in the latest financial year, which covered 53 weeks, rose from Pounds
124.5m to Pounds 138.7m. Operating profits were before a Pounds 2m
exceptional cost relating to the write-down of property assets.
After the float the group would have no net debt, Mr Nussbaum said, but the
acquisition of the packaging business of Boots, the retail and
pharmaceutical group, would give gearing of about 9 per cent.
The pricing for the float is to be announced on June 23, with the public
offer closing on June 30. First dealings are to start on July 7.
The sponsoring bank is Schroders, and James Capel is the broker. Investors

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Price cutting leaves JFB 38% lower at
Pounds 2.07m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON &amp; Firth Brown, the metals and engineering group, said continued
price competition was behind a 38 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the
half year ended March 31, writes Roland Rudd.
Profits declined from Pounds 3.32m to Pounds 2.07m on increased sales of
Pounds 63.3m (Pounds 60.3m).
Mr Martin Llowarch, chairman, had expected the devaluation of sterling to
help JFB 'fight against some fairly frightening price cuts'. But its German
competitors had reacted by reducing their prices by a further 15 per cent.
He said: 'Notwithstanding the UK devaluation, our European competitors'
determination to maintain market share, given their lack of domestic markets
and despite a higher cost base cannot be ignored.'
Operating profits from Firth Rixson edged up from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds
1.55m.
Viking Metallurgical Corporation, purchased from Quanex for Dollars 12.8m
(Pounds 8.5m) in March, exceeded expectations.
Light engineering, which manufactures products such as cables and machinery,
saw its operating profits fall from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 1.7m.
JFB had net cash balances of Pounds 4.8m, excluding medium-term borrowings,
after spending Pounds 1.9m on capital investment and Pounds 4.9m on
acquisitions in the half year. The interest charge of Pounds 730,000
compared to a Pounds 83,000 credit reflects the investments and lower
interest rates.
Earnings per share fell from 1.6p to 0.8p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 1p.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Paying the price for never saying 'no': Haig Simonian
reports on the debt problems facing Italian group Ferruzzi-Montedison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI-MONTEDISON, the Italian chemicals, energy and agro-industrial
group, which recently reported record losses, is facing the most testing
fortnight in its history.
It is negotiating the restructuring of its L15,123bn (Dollars 10bn)
borrowings, a deal which could involve Italy's first debt for equity swap.
Under new rules proposed by the Bank of Italy, the creditor committee of
five banks, headed by Mediobanca, may seek to convert some of the loans into
shares.
Action is urgent to stop Ferruzzi-Montedison buckling under the weight of
debt and losses. Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company, lost
L1,519bn (Pounds 675m) last year, compared with net profits of L115bn in
1991. Montedison, its main operating subsidiary, lost L1,244bn against net
profits of L168bn.
The Ferruzzi family has promised radical changes. Serafino Ferruzzi, the
holding company wholly owned by the family, will let in outside capital,
heavily diluting the family shareholders. Ferfin and Montedison will be
forced into big disposals.
'Ferruzzi-Montedison's problems are a tale of empire building, based on an
inability to turn down acquisitions, irrespective of their effect on debt,
and to cut investment, even when cash flow is crumbling,' says one analyst.
The group is Italy's second biggest private-sector company, with revenues of
L19,900bn last year. It has mushroomed from its origins in farming and
commodities trading. When the founder Serafino Ferruzzi died in 1979,
leadership passed to the charismatic and domineering Mr Raul Gardini. He led
it into chemicals (Montedison), cement (Calcestruzzi), insurance (Fondiaria)
and a string of other operations, including a barely profitable national
newspaper (Il Messaggero) and a heavily loss-making TV station
(Telemontecarlo).
The takeovers created an increasingly indebted conglomerate, with too few
synergies and too little management talent. The strains were masked by the
booming 1980s, but became impossible to hide in a recession.
Mr Gardini left in a huff in November 1990 after failing to receive the
family's blessing for a buy-out of the government stake in the Enimont
chemicals joint venture. Belatedly, the family saw the group must slim.
The baton passed to Mr Carlo Sama, a senior executive married to one of Mr
Serafino Ferruzzi's daughters. But time was running out. Mergers were out of
fashion; potential buyers were harder to find in a recession; earnings had
started to dive.
Negotiations on the disposal of the Erbamont pharmaceuticals operation,
mooted last summer, were strung out for months as Sweden's Procordia haggled
over the price. It took a 51 per cent stake two months ago. Such are
Montedison's cash needs that the remaining shares, not expected to be sold
until 1994 or so, were passed to a bank intermediary to raise funds sooner.
A big plastics joint venture with Shell has still not been finalised. The
transaction, now possibly nearing completion, involves pooling the two
companies' plastics interests, including Montedison's US-based Himont
subsidiary. Separately, Ausimont (speciality chemicals) and Calcestruzzi may
also be sold.
The Erbamont deal will cut group debt by about L1,900bn while the Shell
joint venture should shift a further L2,000bn off Ferruzzi-Montedison's
books. But so great are the pressures that even Edison, which has invested
heavily in new electricity generating capacity, may be on the block. The
company reported net profits up 25 per cent to L152bn last year.
The disposals will return Ferruzzi-Montedison to its agro-industrial roots,
with Eridania-Beghin Say its main business, plus some chemicals activities.
Merging Montedison and Ferfin may also be on the cards.
Ferruzzi executives claim the disposals will mark the line behind which they
will defend the rest of the group. But claims that Fondiaria, Italy's third
biggest private-sector insurer, is an integral part of the empire are
unconvincing.
Fondiaria is controlled jointly by Ferfin and the family of Mr Camillo De
Benedetti, who died earlier this year, through the Gaic holding company.
Ferruzzi has already started to flex its muscles there.
Fondiaria plunged into a L580bn loss last year on the back of misjudged
foreign expansion. But Mr Alfonso Scarpa, the managing director who had
guided its foreign growth, has now left the company. And soon after,
Fondiaria sold its 21 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs,
Germany's second biggest insurer, for DM985m.
Observers are uncertain whether Ferruzzi's exertion of control over
Fondiaria, now chaired by Mr Sama, is an attempt at a turn-around or a
preliminary to disposal.
Last week, analysts welcomed the company's rosy portrait of its long-term
future. The shares were briefly buoyed up by that vision and by rumours that
Mr Sergio Cragnotti, a former managing director now running his own
financial group, might return in some unspecified role. They have since
fallen back, and yesterday Ferfin closed below its nominal value.
Short-term prospects for Ferruzzi-Montedison remain grim. Although first
quarter operating profits rose, chemicals show little sign of improvement.
And still the acquisitions continue: Eridania-Beghin Say is bidding for part
of the Italian SME foods group now being privatised. Some habits die hard.

FT  08 JUN 93 / PowerGen flags big dividend rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the electricity generator, yesterday announced a change in its
dividend policy which could spell annual rises of at least 15 per cent.
It also declared an 18 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 425m on
turnover up 3 per cent to Pounds 3.19bn.
Sir Graham Day, chairman, said the company would reduce its dividend cover
'over the next two to three years towards 2.5 to 2.7 times'. The current
figure is nearly 3.5 times after an 18 per cent rise in earnings per share
to 36.5p and a total dividend of 10.5p, up 13.5 per cent.
Mr Bill Dale, utilities analyst at SG Warburg Securities, said annual
dividend rises of 19 per cent were in prospect for the next three years: 'It
could easily be in the 20s.'
Shares in PowerGen rose 12.5p to 368p. National Power, the other main
generator, gained 9p to 353p on hopes it would follow suit on dividends.
PowerGen's improved profitability was helped by the company becoming the
largest single supplier to the competitive, non- franchise market of large
industrial and commercial customers. Sales increased by 42 per cent to more
than 17 terrawatt hours, and the company expects a 10 per cent advance this
year.
A considerable reduction was made in operating costs. Salaries and overheads
were down by Pounds 191m to Pounds 563m and the number of employees fell
1,100 to 4,900. This compares with more than 9,000 three years ago.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said the dividend policy change had been made
possible by the removal of several uncertainties, including the completion
of the coal review and the signing of five-year coal contracts.
'The white paper did not change anything,' he said. 'The government decided
we could continue to make our own decisions.' On the level of strategic coal
stocks that should be held by the generators, PowerGen thought 4m tonnes was
about right, against current stocks of 15.5m tonnes.
Mr Wallis said it was unlikely PowerGen and National Power would be referred
by the electricity regulator to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission:
'Stephen Littlechild will want to say 'look at what I have done' rather than
'look at what the MMC has done'.'
The likelihood of a reference was also diminished by the decline in
PowerGen's market share. Mr Wallis said this could fall to about 22 per cent
by 1997-98, against 29 per cent last year. The construction of 3,000 MW of
gas-fired electricity would mean the fall in its market share would be less
sharp than would otherwise be the case.
Mr Wallis said he did not see a long term future for High Marnham and
Drakelow power stations. Offers for them would be considered.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Receivers go into Alpine after order book sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS have been appointed to Alpine (Double Glazing), one of the UK's
oldest home improvements companies which ceased trading at the end of May.
The announcement follows news that Alpine's directors sold the group's order
book to a newly formed company only four days before it ceased trading.
Alpine customers yesterday received letters from the new owner, Neonbeam,
which now has the same address as Alpine in north London.
The sale of the order book leaves little in the way of assets for creditors
to recoup. In March 1992, one month after the company was purchased out of
administration with backing from Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur
with offshore interests, Alpine sold all of its plant, machinery and office
equipment to a Guernsey-based company, Finchfleet.
A letter dated March 30 1993 from Finchfleet states that Alpine has no title
or ownership in such goods.
Mr Grant Jones, of City accountants Morison Stoneham, was appointed receiver
on Friday by Western Trust and Savings, the West Country bank which holds a
charge over Alpine.
'The debenture holder has sought to preserve the position of the creditors
with the appointment of a receiver,' Mr Jones said. 'The receiver hopes this
process will protect the good name of Alpine, one of the oldest names in
home improvements.'
Mr Jones said yesterday he would be investigating any sale of assets prior
to his appointment. 'The receiver's fixed and floating charge covers any
sale of the business in the period prior to his appointment,' he said.
Neonbeam was an off-the-shelf company purchased by a Regency Financial
Services on May 11. Regency shares offices with Mr Graham Wilson, the
accountant who has called a creditors meeting to discuss liquidation of
Alpine on June 15. Mr Wilson, who also represents Mr Smith, was arrested
last August on suspicion of defrauding creditors in an insolvency procedure,
is on police bail.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Retail fillip helps BAA to 49% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the privatised UK airports operator, reported a 49 per cent advance
from Pounds 191m to Pounds 285m in pre-tax profits, helped by a recovery in
passenger traffic and retail sales, combined with sharply higher
productivity.
Passenger volume at BAA airports rose 8 per cent to a record 77.7m (72m) for
the year to March 31. After falling 3.7 per cent in the opening half,
passenger revenue improved 2.5 per cent in the second.
The company said the recovery in passenger spending at airports reflected an
improvement in the general economic outlook as well as the positive impact
of sterling's devaluation.
Retail income, which rose 10.5 per cent to Pounds 321.7m, was set to
overtake traditional income from airport landing charges over the next 18
months.
Income from airport charges grew only 1.7 per cent to Pounds 369.3m despite
the 8 per cent increase in passenger traffic. This reflected tougher Civil
Aviation Authority price regulations.
Overall, revenues rose 5.5 per cent to Pounds 952m.
Sir John Egan, chief executive, described a 7 per cent rise in underlying
pre-tax profits, before provisions and gains from asset sales, as 'very
sound' in a testing climate for the aviation industry. The company was now
'cleared and ready for take-off.'
He was confident BAA would show much higher annual profit growth over the
medium to long term, compared with its medium term forecast of an annual
average traffic rise of 4 per cent.
Underlying profits rose to Pounds 297m (Pounds 279m). They included lower
property provisions of Pounds 29m (Pounds 55m), reduced staff restructuring
costs of Pounds 5m (Pounds 36m), a Pounds 5m charge for retirement benefits
and a Pounds 24m gain from the sale of the electricity distribution network
to London Electricity.
Productivity increased 27 per cent. Staff numbers fell 19 per cent to 8,417.
The company had a positive cash flow for the first time since it was
privatised seven years ago, with a net cash inflow of Pounds 163m.
Borrowings were cut by Pounds 102m, reducing gearing from 50 to 36 per cent.
Earnings per share rose 37 per cent to 41.7p (30.4p). A final dividend of
9.75p lifts the total to 16p (14.5p).

FT  08 JUN 93 / Land Rover deal to sell in Japan under Honda banner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Land Rover Discovery, the successful UK-built four-wheel drive vehicle,
is to be sold under an alias in Japan as the Honda Crossroad in a move to
tempt Japan's domestically-biased new car buyers.
Rover said last night that the deal was 'unique in modern automotive
history, because it is the first time that a Japanese car manufacturer has
put its own badge on a foreign car for the Japanese market'.
Imports captured only 4 per cent of the Japanese car market last year.
Land Rover is to create 300 jobs at its Solihull plant in the UK to increase
Discovery production from 700 to 900 a week from September as a result of
the deal with Honda and to meet demand in some European markets, in
particular the UK. The workforce will rise to 8,400.
The plant should receive a further boost next year, when the Discovery is
scheduled to be launched in the US through the UK group's own distribution
network.
The Discovery was launched in Japan in 1991 through the Rover dealer
network, but the marketing agreement announced last night will give the UK
vehicle maker access to one of Honda's domestic sales channels and promises
to double Discovery sales in Japan. Honda is planning sales of more than
1,000 in the first year.
The deal marks a further step in the far-reaching alliance between Honda and
Rover. The Japanese carmaker already holds a 20 per cent equity stake in the
Rover vehicle operations, and a large part of the modern Rover car range is
based on Honda technology.
The Land Rover Discovery marketing deal for Japan is the first time that the
product flow has been reversed.
Honda lacks a presence in the fast-growing world market for four-wheel drive
leisure/utility vehicles, unlike its domestic rivals Toyota, Nissan, Isuzu
and Mitsubishi Motors.
For North America it reached agreement late last year with Isuzu to sell the
US-built Isuzu Rodeo four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicle under the
Honda name.
The deal with Land Rover is aimed at filling the same gap in its product
range in its domestic market. Honda also imports the rival Jeep Cherokee
from the US, but for sale under the Jeep brand.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Gonzalez may have to seek coalition partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER Felipe Gonzalez of Spain yesterday celebrated his fourth
successive general election victory by preparing a government which he has
promised would contain many new faces.
That administration could also include the conservative Catalan Convergencia
i Unio as a coalition partner, although Mr Gonzalez might try first to form
a minority government.
The peseta rallied powerfully inside the European exchange rate mechanism
yesterday in the wake of Mr Gonzalez's victory.
Foreign exchange markets greeted the surprisingly comfortable victory by Mr
Gonzalez and his Socialist party by lifting the peseta. In London, it
finished at Pta76.84 against the D-Mark after closing on Friday at Pta78.27,
and remained in second place in the ERM grid.
The Madrid stock market took a gloomier view of the Socialist victory and
the general index fell 4.4 points in moderate trading.
The markets had assumed that a widely predicted victory by the conservative
People's Party, led by Mr Jose Mara Aznar, would have resulted in early cuts
in interest rates to revive the flagging Spanish economy.
Mr Gonzalez, backed by the Bank of Spain, is likely to be much more cautious
about lowering rates and is likely to concentrate in the next few weeks on
introducing fiscal austerity measures and a tough 1994 budget to defend the
peseta against attack by speculators sceptical of Socialist determination to
cut public spending and budget deficits in the middle of a recession.
In Sunday's election, the Socialists won 38.68 per cent of the vote and 159
seats, but lost their overall majority. Mr Gonzalez had held 175 seats in
the 350-seat parliament since the last election in 1989.
The PP won 141 seats, with the PP vote increasing from 25.9 per cent (107
seats in 1989) to 34.81 per cent. There were nearly 3m voters new to the
party.
There were no immediate clues as to whom Mr Gonzalez might invite into a
coalition if he were to form one.
The most likely partner would be the CiU, which governs Catalonia. With the
CiU's 17 seats, the Socialists would have an overall majority in parliament.
The Catalans are conservative and fiscally disciplined and the markets would
view an alliance with them favourably.
But Mr Gonzalez might find it easier to persuade his party to support
potentially unpopular policies if he initially formed a minority government,
rather than depending on a conservative coalition partner.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Thatcher reopens Tory wounds over Maastricht: Lords speech
presses fresh case for referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS Thatcher reopened deep Tory party wounds over Europe yesterday by
launching in the House of Lords a fresh campaign to force a referendum on
the Maastricht treaty.
The former prime minister said she would never have signed the treaty, and
told Mr John Major that Britain had more to lose than any other European
Community country under it. Without a referendum on the treaty, the
government would 'betray' the people's trust in the UK's parliamentary
system.
Lady Thatcher warned that Maastricht would turn the British and other EC
parliaments into 'little more than an agency' of the European Commission and
Council because of the 'massive extension' of powers to Brus-sels.
Her calculated remarks will serve as a rallying point for Euro-sceptic
lords, adding further to the sense of disarray in Mr Major's Conservative
party.
Lady Thatcher's outburst revived tensions that precipitated her downfall as
prime minister. Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary - standing just
behind her - warned that Euro-sceptics had moved 'into a position which now,
alas, is approaching deep hostility to the essence of the Community itself.'
Most Euro-sceptic MPs still believe the Lords' overwhelming pro-European
slant will allow the Maastricht bill a relatively smooth passage.
The Lords will sit three hours earlier than normal today because of the
record 130 peers wanting to speak in the second reading debate. No votes are
expected this week.
Lady Thatcher, heard in near-silence in a crowded chamber, said Maastricht
was intended explicitly to pave the way to a European union. She added: 'I
suggest we don't want to go any further on that train.'
For the government, Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, took a swipe at the
former prime minister, saying that Maastricht was 'less far-reaching' than
the Single European Act - signed by Lady Thatcher.
Lady Thatcher said Maastricht went 'much, much wider' than the Single
European Act, extending the powers of the Commission from 11 to 20 areas of
government and providing 111 new occasions when decisions can be by
qualified majority voting.
She attacked the Commission for reneging on assurances that the extension of
qualified majority voting needed to create a single market would not
interfere with nation states' freedom over fiscal policy, the free movement
of people and employees' rights and interests. Those assurances had been
given by Lord Howe, she said, but the commission had 'piled on' extra
regulations.
She welcomed the government's decision to refer the working time directive
to the European Court on the ground that it had been enacted wrongly - and
against Britain's wishes - under a qualified majority voting.
But she said the Court's judges were biased towards an integrated European
Community and threatened to undermine the principle of the rule of law on
which British democracy was based.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Clarke firm against early ERM re-entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday dismissed the prospect of early
British re-entry to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System.
The British and German economies 'are so far out of line that the conditions
are not remotely there for Britain to rejoin the ERM', Mr Clarke said. The
chancellor's forthright remarks came during a day of negotiations in
Brussels with other EC finance ministers.
Making his first statements on policy since taking over from Mr Norman
Lamont as chancellor, Mr Clarke also said that tackling the British budget
deficit was 'one of the most important items on the agenda'.
He voiced concern at the depth of the German recession and the effect on its
European partners. Underlining the point, the EC commission delivered a grim
warning to ministers that economic recovery in the EC as whole was unlikely
before the second half of 1994.
The commission forecast that the UK economy would outperform its main
competitors, with growth of 1.7 per cent this year.
Mr Clarke put up a roadblock against Community plans for two controversial
taxes - the carbon energy tax and a tax on imports of works of art. Further
negotiations are expected on both taxes.

FT  08 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Henderson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If only Henderson Administration could reproduce such impeccable timing on
behalf of its clients. The acquisition of Touche Remnant looks well-judged
given the rise in UK equities since the deal was struck in the autumn, and
the dwindling returns on cash. With annual cost savings running at around
Pounds 6m - and no sign of damage to Touche's business - Henderson is right
to be pleased with the marriage so far. The acquisition of Touche's clients,
though, cannot disguise the fact that its own pension fund division is
losing business.
The confidence of big pension funds will only be restored by a marked
improvement in investment performance. Touche's talent and other new faces
recruited this year should make a difference. Henderson's investment returns
are already better than in the dark days of the late 1980s, although some
way off the pace set by Phillips &amp; Drew and Schroder. Rationalising and
relaunching the stable of unit trusts this year will also have to be handled
well if Henderson is to capture its share of new retail money.
If these hurdles can be overcome and with Pounds 28m still in the bank,
Henderson might be tempted to buy more earnings. Having weakened its balance
sheet by writing off goodwill, another big acquisition would be difficult to
swallow. However, the pension fund management business shows every sign of
consolidating. There must be a fair chance that others will be emboldened to
follow Henderson's example.

FT  08 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Klockner-Werke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rescue plan agreed by Klockner-Werke's creditors yesterday will
doubtless come as a great relief to the company and its workforce in Bremen.
But what is good for the company is not necessarily so for the broader
European industry. Klockner is closing a blast furnace yet its crude steel
capacity will be cut by only 20 per cent and its hot-rolled output by a mere
12 per cent. Cancellation of 60 per cent of its debts effectively gives it a
substantial subsidy from German banks into the bargain.
It may be tempting to regard such a solution as sufficient, since European
steel prices have been rising this year while production is down. But that
has been possible only because of voluntary restraint by west European
producers while those in east Europe have taken fright at the threat of
protection. With the German recession deepening, there is not much chance of
demand reviving this year. When it eventually does, there is a strong chance
that the battles for market share will begin all over again.
Supporters of the Klockner solution argue that it is preferable to
bankruptcy, which would have allowed its assets to be sold off on the cheap
 -creating a cost advantage to the buyer. There are echoes of this in the
present scheme, though. Klockner is talking of writing down the value of its
Bremen mill and selling a 50 per cent stake in it. Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch
have already expressed an interest. If the German industry can be
revitalised in this way, subsidised producers in Spain and Italy will be
more determined to hold their ground.

FT  08 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: BAA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite BAA's 49 per cent profits increase, it is hard to argue that its
shares are undervalued. Viewed as a retailer, BAA already trades on a
similar forward multiple to Marks and Spencer. As a property company, it is
on much the same discount to net assets as MEPC. As a loosely-regulated
monopoly, BAA yields considerably less than the electricity supply
companies. Stripped of exceptional charges, its underlying profits increase
last year was just 7 per cent. Since BAA's earnings are likely to grow more
slowly than the market average over the next two years, it is easy to
understand its recent share price softness.
Still, it would be unwise to dismiss BAA's attractions altogether. Last
year, the company made impressive productivity gains - largely by shrinking
its workforce by 19 per cent. Expanding its retailing activities is also
proving lucrative given the marginal costs involved, although its reliance
on duty free sales is a concern.
Any company making Pounds 324m of operating profits from Pounds 952m of
revenue must be on to a good thing. That, in turn, suggests the CAA, BAA's
regulator, has been too soft despite its formula for airport charges of RPI
minus 8 percentage points. In three years' time, BAA will be even better
off. It will be able to charge RPI minus 1 percentage point. Calls for a
tighter regime will then be tempered by the need for BAA to fund Heathrow's
fifth terminal. Shareholders would doubly rue a more rigorous regulator if
BAA had to ask them for the cash.

FT  08 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: The coal dust settles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the hardline noises coming from the electricity generators,
British Coal's 'reprieved' pits are not long for this world. In February,
there was much talk of the government forcing the generators to take an
additional 65m tonnes of coal over five years. National Power and PowerGen
offered to take 40m tonnes. Now it seems a only a few million tonnes may be
bought this year and next, and the pits will close.
Since a basic five-year coal deal has been signed, much of the uncertainty
about future coal prices has been removed. That deal requires the generators
to take less coal than hitherto, so they can start to run down stocks and
release cash. Similarly, the very strong underlying profits and cash flow of
the business has partly been masked by heavy provisions and a high capital
spend. The generators now have a secure financial cushion which will allow
them to release profits, cash and dividends over the next three years.
Dividend increases of 15 per cent compound will doubtless tempt investors
offered leaner pickings elsewhere, especially if voluntary market share
reductions mean that the generators avoid an appointment with the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
Yet while there is still plenty of air to come out of the tyres further down
the profit and loss account, boosting turnover will remain a problem.
National Power intends to spend Pounds 1bn overseas to find new revenues.
PowerGen is sniffier about the rates of return available. The success or
otherwise of diversification may finally mark a point of difference between
the two companies.

FT  08 JUN 93 / The ball's back in his court: Felipe Gonzalez may have to
seek partners in his bid to revive Spain's ailing economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is surprise on a lot of Spanish faces as the scale of Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez's election victory on Sunday sinks in. To have won 159 seats
in parliament, given the combination of economic recession and political
attack he was facing, is a mighty achievement. Nobody came anywhere near
predicting it.
Yesterday, the political analysts and experts were being unusually cautious.
Having predicted a closer race and possible defeat for the prime minister,
few were brave enough to guess what he might do with his fourth successive
term in office. The best lead came from the foreign exchange markets, where
the peseta strengthened sharply against the D-Mark yesterday morning, and
closed at Pta76.84, from a previous Pta78.27.
The markets reacted warmly because of the widespread assumption that the
Socialists, with enough seats to form a stable coalition or minority
government, would not rush into a series of interest rate cuts. Had the
opposition People's Party won, the markets would have expected a quick dash
towards lower rates. But the rise in the peseta - devalued for the third
time in nine months just three weeks ago - also carries an inherent danger.
Unless the government takes tough economic action to tackle the country's
chronic unemployment, deepening recession and investment drought, the peseta
could again come under pressure.
Aware of the potentially delicate position of the peseta, and of the loss of
his overall majority in parliament, held since 1982, Mr Gonzalez will try to
move swiftly on both the economic and political fronts.
Despite losing 26 seats, the Socialists are still 18 clear of the PP, headed
by Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the conservative challenger who increased his share
of the vote by 10 per cent. With more people - 9.08m - voting Socialist this
time than in 1986 or 1989, In voting left of centre, Spaniards have made it
clear they are comfortable swimming against the political tide in Europe,
for the time being.
More accurately, they still have confidence in Mr Gonalez as their leader.
His victory should make it easier for him to bring the powerful left wing of
the Socialist party to heel at a special party congress expected later this
year. Party officials have prevented Mr Gonzalez from implementing tough
fiscal policies and labour reforms since 1989. As economic and social policy
choices have become starker over the past four years, and as the economy has
deteriorated, he needs a united party more than ever.
The recession has narrowed his options. Tax revenues are down and any
serious cuts in infrastructure spending would be unpopular. Not
surprisingly, both Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar agreed, separately, during their
campaigns, that the only way to promote growth would be to negotiate a pacto
social - a social pact - between the trade unions and employers to help hold
down wage increases and remove rigidities from the labour market. Nobody
knows quite how such a pact would work, and the only man who has tried (and
failed) to implement one, the finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, may
leave the government.
Mr Gonzalez is convinced that if he can stem wages growth, running at about
7 per cent this year, the downward trend in interest rates can be
accelerated as inflation, at an annual rate of 4.6 per cent, is brought more
firmly under control. To achieve wage moderation, however, he must bring two
large trade unions, hostile to the conservative thrust of his economic
policies, together with the employers federation, which campaigned for his
defeat after the party watered down a controversial anti-strike law drafted
by the government.
Both the socialist UGT and the communist Comisiones Obreras national unions
are interested in recovering the political influence they had before Mr
Gonzalez began moving sharply to the right in the mid-1980s, so they may
support him. Mr Gonzalez is likely to attempt a rapprochement at least with
the UGT, which split from the Socialist party in the late 1980s.
Engineering a social pact will not be easy. To have any chance of meeting
the Maastricht treaty's economic convergence targets - which Mr Gonzalez is
determined to do - the labour market would require reforms to make it easier
to hire and fire workers, something the unions would oppose. But there would
be trade-offs in the form of apprenticeships and training. On the employers'
side, the prime minister may try to persuade them to make specific
commitments to plough back profits into their businesses. In return, the
government could perhaps offer tax concessions.
Discussions involving unions and employers might also make it easier for the
government to begin running down and even closing loss-making public sector
companies and, perhaps, privatising those which could be profitable.
Without a pact, Mr Gonzalez's fourth term threatens to become as bereft of
achievement as his third. The two biggest drains on the public purse
continue to be unemployment benefits and health care, neither of which can
be contained - beyond trimming waste - without serious political damage. In
essence, the pact would be a way of diverting effort from the unsolvable to
the solvable.
Mr Gonzalez has a breathing space. The country does not expect a rapid
escape from the recession or from high unemployment - 3.3m people are
officially out of work - and it has been primed during the campaign for the
tough austerity programme necessary for recovery.
Such a programme, plus the pact, and a tough 1994 budget, are all
politically feasible. Sunday night changed Spanish politics not simply
because the vote ended the country's tradition of outright parliamentary
majorities but because Mr Gonzalez himself says he has changed. 'I have
understood the message of the people,' he said. That message is to get off
his pedestal and compromise.
He could do this by bringing fresh faces into the government, along with
non-party members. For many Spaniards this is an alluring prospect,
promising a more open administration. By pinpointing the areas of waste,
inefficiency and illegal political financing, Mr Aznar may have done Mr
Gonalez a favour during the campaign.
But as he begins to manoeuvre the unions and employers to his negotiating
table, Mr Gonalez must also decide whether the 159 seats the Socialists have
won are enough to allow him to govern as a minority, making long-term pacts
with the conservative ruling CiU in Catalonia and perhaps the PNV in the
Basque country. Or he could form a coalition government with one or both of
them.
No doubt he would wish to go it alone, but in the CiU at least, there is a
debate over whether to enter national government. Mr Miguel Roca,
parliamentary leader of the CiU, is close to the Socialists and has
ministerial ambitions, but the Catalan leader, Mr Jordi Pujol, worries that
helping the Socialists to govern might cost him support during Catalan
elections, which the Socialists also contest.
Given the economic obstacles the next government will have to overcome, the
PP will want to see life made as difficult as possible. A proliferation of
regional parties in the national government would work in its favour because
if anything should go wrong, they would share the blame. The PP believed it
would win the election and in many cases lost close races to small
conservative regional parties. Somehow, the PP has to find an accommodation
with the scattered regional right or seek to capture the regional vote. Both
would take time.
The result was a bitter blow for the conservatives. The PP is a vituperative
party and conceivably could blame Mr Aznar. But that would be reckless. He
has raised the PP's game to the point where Spain, for the first time in
more than a decade, has a worthy opposition.
Mr Aznar repelled some voters with his arrogant style but in conceding
defeat on Sunday he was gracious and generous, finally revealing two
impressive qualities when it was too late. The next time, provided he does
not hide his humanity away again, he will be a real threat to Mr Gonzalez.
Until then, Mr Gonzalez has been given an unprecedented opportunity to
tackle the weaknesses in economic policy and in his relationship with his
party that were exposed during his third term. The last Socialist leader in
the European Community, he will be keen to prove that the key to growth does
not lie on only one side of the political spectrum. He faces some big tests,
but he has more than 9m Spaniards rooting for him.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand, the agency which has the thankless job of privatising eastern
Germany's industry, may soon get a taste of its own
medicine.
After selling off more than 12,000 companies since it was set up in late
1990, and closing down a few thousand, many of its own staff are now looking
elsewhere for new jobs.
With only 1,000 companies left on the books, the Treuhand intends to close
down its New York and Tokyo offices this autumn, and the agency itself will
be wound up by the end of next year.
The Berlin-based investment relations department, which looks after
potential foreign investors, will be cut back from 15 to 10 by the end of
this month. But the big question is the future of Ms Birgit Breuel, the
agency's 55-year-old president.
She has been been mentioned as a possible successor to Sir William Ryrie,
the British civil servant who has been running the International Finance
Corporation, the private-sector arm of the World Bank, for the last nine
years. Ryrie has an open-ended contract but he turns 65 in November, the
normal retirement age for World Bank types. It is understood that she has
already been invited to join the IFC board.
Others say she might end up in the Chancellery in Bonn. She might even
return to politics - she was minister of finance in Lower Saxony until
joining the Treuhand in October 1990. Whatever the outcome, it is highly
unlikely that Ms Breuel will join Jacques Attali's EBRD.

Argentina's charm offensive against the Falkland Islands gathers pace. Guido
di Tella, the urbane Argentine foreign minister is to be guest of honour -

The one-hour programme will go out live on June 18 and the Beeb promises
that neither questions nor responses will be edited. Whose idea was it?
'That's a bit hazy,' says a member of the BBC production staff. But di Tella
clearly has an agenda; he recently sent the Falklanders a letter telling
them how nice the Argentines really are.
On that occasion they politely told him to sling his hook. On air, they may
have some fruitier comments. But di Tella, a former Oxford don, is cooler

When it comes to winning public accolades there is not a lot to choose
between South Africa's two chief constitutional adversaries - Roelf Meyer
from the government and Cyril Ramaphosa from the African National Congress.
Last week they received two honours jointly, flew to America together, and
in the words of a local columnist 'grew so close that they could wear each
other's smiles'.
When it comes to humour ANC secretary general Ramaphosa has had an edge over
the Afrikaner constitutional minister up to now. However, Meyer is learning
fast from his opposite number. When the two men jointly accepted their 'man
of the year award' from the ANC newspaper, the New Nation, last week, Meyer
recalled that when he attended a lunch after the president's momentous 1990
speech unbanning the ANC, the wine on the luncheon table was from the estate
'Allesverloren' (All is lost). At the New Nation banquet the wine was
'Buitenverwachting' (Waiting outside) - fair comment on the political
situation.

Much consternation among the 'Big 6' UK accounting firms yesterday over
delays in the production of the annual fee income figures from one of their
number, Ernst &amp; Young.
Bitter rumours between all the firms abound each year over the undiluted
quantity of creative accounting that goes into their preparation. This year
they had agreed to release them simultaneously to the press and each other
at 11am.
All churned off the fax as planned except for Ernst &amp; Young's, which did not
appear till nearly 1pm. The firm vigorously denied that it waited to see its
nearest competitor before preparing a figure, even though its results were
just a sliver ahead of Andersen. All necessary manipulation was done blind
several weeks ago, it seems, just like its competitors.

When the Princess of Wales acquired her German-built Mercedes sports car
there was such a fuss that she was forced to hand it back and trade down to
a Ford. But Japan's new royal couple does not suffer the same insecurities
and the word is that they will be flaunting the palace Roller for this

Although there could always be a last-minute hitch, the newlyweds plan to
ride through Tokyo in a Pounds 160,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche 1V. Given that
Japanese carmakers are trying to break in to the luxury end of the market
and Rolls-Royce sales in Japan took a dive last year, it would seem a
heaven-sent public relations opportunity for the UK car maker.
When Miss Masako Owada, Japan's princess-to-be, was shown riding in a Toyota
Corolla to work in January, sales of the Japanese model soared. But even in
its current straitened circumstances, Rolls-Royce shows no inclination to
publicise its coup. 'It's a strictly private affair,' purred the lady at

FT  08 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Victory tasks for Gonzalez
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FELIPE Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, has clinched a feat that
Britain's Margaret Thatcher failed to achieve and Germany's Helmut Kohl has
not yet pulled off. By an unexpectedly clear margin, he has won a fourth
term as leader of one of Europe's main industrialised democracies.
Additionally, by stemming the tide of losses by Europe's left-wing parties,
Mr Gonzalez has made himself the chief standard-bearer for what is left of
European social democracy.
The role brings both burdens and benefits. In opting for four more years
under Mr Gonzalez, but removing his previous absolute majority, the Spanish
electorate has shown him less than full-hearted confidence. Voters displayed
considerable scepticism about Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party, weakened above
all by corruption allegations. But this seems to have been outweighed by
still greater doubts over the prospect of rule by the inexperienced
conservative challenger, Mr Jose Maria Aznar.
The prime minister has the opportunity to turn victory to the cause of
placing Spain more firmly in the mainstream of European integration. But he
will need to show a sense of realism and urgency that in recent years has
often eluded him. The voters clearly expect changes in the Socialist party,
which has dispensed an unhealthy degree of influence over the state
apparatus. Even more urgently, a new approach is required in economic
policy. After registering an average of 4 per cent growth in gross domestic
product between 1985 and 1991, Spain is now mired in the European recession,
with a 21.7 per cent unemployment rate and a current account deficit around
4 per cent of GDP.
Supply-side economic reforms have been promised as often as they have failed
to materialise. Straitened economic circumstances impose new necessities. Mr
Gonzalez should strive to make them virtues. He needs to bring in steps both
to improve the flexibility of the country's notoriously rigid labour
markets, and to restructure inefficient public sector industry.
Measures to promote job creation must be combined with renewed efforts to
hold down inflation and maintain the improvement in Spanish competitiveness
gained in three peseta devaluations since September. Spain's inflation rate,
1.2 percentage points above the EC average, is still too high.
The loss of the Socialists' absolute majority may help Mr Gonzalez rally the
consensus needed for unpopular solutions. Mr Gonzalez for the first time
will have to come to terms with minority parties. This raises the need for
delicate compromise. But, in areas such as breaking up centralised wage
bargaining, this may enable the prime minister to wriggle free from his
party's shackles. Mr Gonzalez faces an uphill task, but it is a fight worth
conducting. On Sunday's evidence, the Spanish people are willing to give him
the benefit of the doubt. He now needs to show he has the mettle for the
struggle.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Weak beer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER SINCE Britain's ill-fated Beer Orders were introduced four years ago,
beer drinkers have had to swallow annual price rises well above inflation.
Now they are to get less for their money as well. But while the government
is to blame for the Beer Orders fiasco, this time it is up to the brewing
industry to account for its actions.
In recent weeks, several large brewers have quietly decided to lower the
alcohol content of their products. Bass, the biggest, is reducing the
strength of almost a third of its brands by as much as one-seventh, while
raising wholesale prices by 3.6 per cent. That is well ahead of the headline
inflation rate in the year to April.
Producers are fully entitled to adjust product formulations and prices.
However, when changes affect something which is as basic to a product's
character as alcohol is to beer, one would expect them to keep consumers
properly informed. In this case, no such effort was made, and the way in
which the changes have been made encourages the disagreeable idea that the
brewers have something to hide.
The ostensible pretext for their decisions is the introduction this month of
a new system of levying excise duty on beer. Under the old method, which
dated from Victorian times, duty was assessed prior to fermentation. In
future, it will be paid on the final product. The switch was prompted by
complaints from the industry that the old system was cumbersome and
inequitable, and by the need to align UK practice with the rest of the
European Community.
The new system was developed by Customs &amp; Excise after three years of
consultation with the brewers and modelled on their proposals. Customs &amp;
Excise says the main elements were communicated to them a year ago, and the
duty rate was fixed in early March. Yet the industry has suddenly decided
that the new system is discriminatory. Last week, on the day it came into
effect, the Brewers' Society complained that had it applied during the
previous 12 months, it would have yielded Pounds 64m, or 3 per cent, more in
duty than the old system. That, the society claimed, breached government
pledges that the change would be fiscally neutral.
The industry has yet to explain clearly why it has waited so long to expose
this alleged discrepancy. The only reason offered is that it did not have
until recently all the information needed to evaluate the new system. That,
however, is vigorously denied by Customs &amp; Excise and hardly carries
conviction, given the industry's close involvement in the exercise from the
outset. It also raises questions about the brewers' ability to do their
sums.
Wherever the truth lies, the brewers appear determined that the consumer
will be made to pay, through higher prices and furtive product changes which
they have made no serious effort to communicate to the public - let alone
defend. This kind of attitude is associated with old-style monopoly
nationalised industries, not with a modern competitive business. If, in
these circumstances, beer consumption continues to decline, the brewers have
only themselves to blame.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Pay-off punch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTEL, the UK's biggest pension fund, intends to vote against the
re-election of any company director who is on a rolling contract of more
than 12 months.
This policy, outlined in a letter to top company chairmen from Mr Alastair
Ross Goobey, Postel's chief executive, seems wholly sensible. If there is
one piece of common ground in the debate over executive pay, it is that
managers should not be rewarded for failure. Yet the three-year rolling
contract, fast becoming the standard in British industry, ensures just as
big a pay-off for a poor manager as for a good one. If Postel's initiative
helps stamp out the three-year rolling contract, the fund will have done a
service both to the pensioners it represents and to the companies in which
it invests.
Mr Ross Goobey's move is welcome, however, as much for what it signals as
for what it contains. Typically, the debate over executive compensation is
unproductive because complaints over the substance of pay decisions are met
by a defence of the process used to reach them. The more intense the
complaints over substance, the more agonisingly refined the process, and so
on, in an endless dialogue of the deaf.
If an impeccable process delivers unacceptable results - as, too often, has
been the case in big British companies - the problem lies in the connection
with the outside world. Non-executive directors are supposed to act as
proxies for shareholders in the pay-setting process. If they fail to do so,
it is partly because they do not hear a clear message of concern from the
shareholders they represent.
Postel is at last sending such a message. Though it is leaving the absolute
level of top salaries to the discretion of companies' remuneration
committees, it clearly wants the issue to be taken seriously. As a
self-managed, largely independent fund, it is in an unusually strong
position to make its views heard.
Many other institutional investors are part of companies with their own
chairmen, chief executives, remuneration committees, and share options - a
situation which limits their freedom to comment on the pay packets of their
peers.
There is one other reason for welcoming Postel's move. The corporate
governance of British industry will greatly benefit from a willingness by
institutional investors to use their votes to back up their opinions. By
promising to use Postel's voting power in this fashion, Mr Ross Goobey has
set an encouraging example. Could he turn next, please, to voting down
underperforming boards of directors?

FT  08 JUN 93 / Personal View: Unemployment - a letter to Mr Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAYARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You are right - European unemployment is a scandal. At 10 per cent, it is
especially high just now because of the economic downturn. But the real
scandal is the average level of unemployment in the European Community over
the last five years - no less than 9 per cent of all workers.
Since unemployment differs so much from one OECD country to another, your
strategy of reform can draw on this experience. Three main features explain
the varying levels of unemployment: how unemployed people are treated; how
young people are trained; and how wages are determined.
In most European Community countries unemployed people get money too easily
and are give too little help. Generally unemployment benefits are available
for a substantial period, often indefinitely. At the same time far too
little is done to help people to become employable. Typically, only one in
10 of the unemployed receives training, and such training is often of poor
quality.
This deadly combination explains our long-term unemployment - more than a
third of Europe's unemployed have been out of work for over a year. This
long-term unemployment does nothing to control inflation, since those
concerned are no longer of interest to employers and are thus an ineffective
supply of labour. It is thus a total economic waste and dreadful fiscal
burden.
So we need a fresh approach, tailored to preventing long-term unemployment.
This means spending money on active labour market measures in order to save
money on benefits and lost taxes. It means a personnel placement officer for
each unemployed person. It means more and better training. And in the last
resort it means resources to buy jobs for hard-to-place workers.
The way to deal with long-term unemployment is to prevent it. Once people
are long-term unemployed it is very difficult to help them in any way that
is cost-effective. Indeed, misguided attempts to do so account for many of
the failures of active intervention.
Instead, we need high-quality programmes for people who have been unemployed
between six and 12 months. Once enough good programmes are in place, the
duration of benefits can be cut to a year. Income maintenance beyond that
point would then be conditional on work or training.
Most unemployed people have lost a previous job through normal economic
change, as some industries decline and others rise. They should be treated
as an important resource for the industries of the future. We should no
longer let them slide into self-distrust.
Next, there is the problem of mismatch. The relative demand for skilled
workers has been reduced by technological change and by low wages in the
newly industrialised countries. But the pattern of skills in the European
workforce has not adjusted adequately. To an extent the problem will correct
itself, since the relative shortage of skilled labour has increased wage
differentials and thus the incentive to acquire skill. But wages are not
fully flexible and this generates an inefficient level of unemployment,
requiring public intervention and public expenditure.
Thus the 1990s have to be an era of educational expansion, as the 1960s
were, but with a heavy focus on vocational education for the less able young
people. One reason for low unemployment in Germany is its near universal
system of skill training. Other European countries need to guarantee some
training to every young person.
Finally, Europe is the continent of trade unions. In this context,
decentralised bargaining simply leads to wage leap-frogging as soon as
unemployment is reduced. Wage restraint can only be achieved through higher
unemployment or through employer solidarity and social consensus about
wages.
Tackling unemployment means tackling these three issues. There are many
possible distractions - above all, the fallacy that, due to technical
progress, it is ever more difficult to provide jobs. If that were so, we
should nearly all be unemployed by now. There is no lump-of-output to be
produced. Technology makes possible a better life. So there is no advantage
in artificial inducements to early retirement or restricted hours of work.
Unless we treat people as Europe's main resource, we cannot hope to return
to full employment. But if we do so, we can at least guarantee everyone a
job within one year. Why not make that a European goal for the decade?

FT  08 JUN 93 / Losing lots of layers: John Gapper on the reshaping of
NatWest's bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Derek Wanless looks remarkably fresh-faced for a man in charge of a bank,
given the unpopularity of the industry. A little over a year after becoming
the youngest chief executive of a high street bank, he appears to have
weathered the stream of criticism of UK banking with undiminished good cheer
and optimism.
Mr Wanless, 45, has been an employee of National Westminster Bank since
graduating from Cambridge. So he might be expected to display some
irritation over attacks on banks for offences as diverse as mixing up credit
card charges, increasing fees to customers, and limiting loans to small
businesses.
But he has his reasons to remain chirpy, as he made clear yesterday in an
interview on the changes he has brought about at the UK's second-biggest
bank. While NatWest has had its share of criticism from customers - and even
staff - it has recently avoided much of the opprobrium over management
quality directed by shareholders at its rival, Barclays.
Barclays had to announce this spring that it was seeking a new chief
executive from outside to convince shareholders that it had made a clean
break with the lending mistakes of the 1980s. NatWest had already acted
decisively a year before by installing a largely new and young senior
management team under Mr Wanless.
Mr Wanless has thus been able to conduct management reforms in an atmosphere
of relative calm. He emerged as chief executive after Mr Tom Frost stepped
aside in March last year to concentrate on his defence to unfounded
accusations of deception during a government inquiry into NatWest's part in
a rights issue from the Blue Arrow employment group.
Mr Wanless demurs at the suggestion that the Blue Arrow affair was a
blessing in disguise in allowing NatWest to reshuffle senior management.
'I'm the wrong person to ask,' he says, in what remains a distinct
north-eastern accent. 'But I find it very hard to think that what we went
through for all those years was worth it.'
Some of the new generation have come from outside. Mr Richard Goeltz, the
chief financial officer and an American, joined last year from Seagram, the
US drinks group. Mr Stuart Chandler, in charge of strategic development,
came from the Bank of England.
Mr Wanless has won respect in the industry, both because of his intellectual
pedigree - he has a first-class degree in mathematics - and because he
appears to understand most parts of what is a complex business.
But High street banks are not easy institutions to change quickly. 'When I
first came I had not seen so many layers of bureaucracy since I read
Milton's Paradise Lost,' says one senior manager. 'There were archangels and
angels, and seraphim and cherubim everywhere I looked.'
The bank's entrenched conservatism is one reason why Mr Wanless argues that
it would be counter-productive to impose changes too rapidly for staff to
understand and assimilate. 'Most of the things we are trying are intended to
improve service, but there is a danger that in putting those things into
practice, you have exactly the opposite effect,' he says.
This caution means that, although NatWest under Mr Wanless has displayed
willingness to cut its vast array of businesses - shedding retail banking in
France, Japanese domestic equity operations and US credit card merchandising
in the US - some doubt remains about whether the bank is willing to take the
most painful decisions, such as disposing of larger operations, if they
prove necessary.
Technological innovations in retail banking, including telephone banking,
raise questions about whether banks such as NatWest will be able to reduce
costs quickly enough to avoid being undercut by new forms of competition.
Even the 7,000 job losses last year, and the 4,000 expected this year might
not be radical enough.
Mr Wanless rejects the suggestion that NatWest is too cautious to change at
the speed required. 'There is no limit to the size of decision we would be
prepared to make were it right for the bank,' he says. As evidence, he
points to the recent flow of divestments in markets where it does not have
'a substantial enough starting point from which to develop'.
The most important change has been is to reduce the size of the management
group to which the bank's four main businesses report. These operations - UK
branch banking, international business, US branch banking, and the NatWest
Markets investment bank - are monitored by a head office staff that has been
cut from 400 to 150, excluding staff in obligatory roles such as auditing.
This group is split into three functions: Mr Chandler's human resources and
strategic development; Mr Goeltz's performance management; and a group risk
function under Mr John Melbourn. The idea is to enable the bank to have a
clearer view of what businesses it should be in and how these should be
operated.
Mr Goeltz has been working on new performance measures to avoid a repetition
of past mistakes. Part of this involves developing what Mr Wanless calls
'measures of long-term health' of NatWest's various operations. These
measures include asset quality, unit costs, customer satisfaction and staff
motivation.
While some of these are 'soft' measures, others such as asset quality will
be reflected directly in the profit and loss account in future years. Mr
Wanless says unit costs are particularly important because they indicate the
strength of the bank's defences against competitors which use technology to
undercut its higher-cost operations on price.
Yet he also thinks these measures will prevent the bank from adopting a
short-term view, for example by cutting costs in ways that damage service
and demoralise staff. The question is whether such a broad view of
performance will deliver the sustained increase in returns on capital which
all banks are now seeking.
The alternative might be a gradual break-up of operations within the old
unwieldy bank which Mr Wanless wants to slim down rather than divide.
NatWest's chief executive thinks his bank can achieve results in line with
companies in other sectors - given the reforms and greater economic
stability.
Lloyds Bank, recently the most successful clearing bank, has made its mark
by emphasising shareholder value. But Mr Wanless says NatWest needs to
please staff and customers too. 'It is too easy to say that in the long run
all these things go together, but there is a considerable element of truth
to it, especially in a service industry,' he says.

FT  08 JUN 93 / The Tories can rely on Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith has a choice. He can let a taxi-cabful of trade union bosses
run the Labour party, or he can try to run it himself. It is not much of a
choice. If he caves in to Mr John Edmonds, the general secretary of the GMB
union, he might as well give up politics and retire to compose a guide to
hill-climbing in the Highlands. If he fights for his party's independence he
may lose anyway. The short-term winner can only be Mr Paddy Ashdown, the
leader of the Liberal Democrats. The long-term beneficiary is likely to be
the Conservative leader, whoever he or she may be at the time.
Yes, the plot does have a familiar ring to it. The GMB voted yesterday to
oppose the exclusion of trade unions from the selection of Labour's
parliamentary candidates. Several unions also plan to retain their 40 per
cent share of the vote for the party's leader and deputy leader. Mr Smith
wants participation in the Labour party's procedures to be limited to
members of the party. Mr Edmonds will have none of that. He refers to what
he calls two groups of Labour members - the 200,000 individuals who pay by
direct subscription, and the 4m. who pay a 'political levy' through their
trade unions. 'We believe that everyone who contributes should have the
right to participate,' he said.
It sounds as reasonable as it is wrong-headed. So does the compromise
offered to Mr Smith by the National Union of Public Employees' conference
yesterday. Under this deceptive formula, Nupe's political levy-payers could
declare themselves supporters of Labour and no other party, thus becoming
'registered' members. Like Mr Edmonds' rationalisations, this is a sham.
Votes delivered by union machines to the party headquarters are not true
democratic votes. They never can be. Somewhere along the line apparatchiks
control them. The unions' inability or unwillingness to perceive this will
be the death of the party they founded and still finance. 'Apparently some
Labour politicians think we are an electoral liability,' Mr Edmonds said
yesterday. He can say that again. Labour will not win another election if
people think that they are electing puppets. The ineffably reasonable Mr
Edmonds is demonstrating that he aspires to be a puppet master, first, last
and always. He will do his best to retain control.
If Mr Smith persists, Mr Edmonds will be able to demonstrate his power. He
can deploy a negative 'block vote' of some 650,000 GMB members at Labour's
conference in October. His fellow-bosses from the Transport and General
Workers' Union, Nupe, the MSF union and others can throw in veto cards with
a combined value of 2m-plus. End of story. A few general secretaries can
thus publicly and unashamedly block reform in a manner that would turn the
Russian parl-iament's speaker, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, puce with envy.
This is not the end of Mr Smith's troubles. As he is discovering, the Labour
movement can always be relied upon - by the Tories. Whenever the trade
unions' party is doing well, a bogey-man comes along to act as a
vote-repellent. Once it was Mr Tony Benn; another time it was Mr Ken
Livingstone; for a while it was Mr Arthur Scargill. The latest aspirant for
this historic post, which is surely nurtured by Conservative Central office,
is Mr John Prescott, Labour's spokesman on transport. He was trounced when
he put himself forward as a candidate for deputy leader, but he has learned
nothing. Now he has emerged as the dummy on Mr Edmonds' knee, his wooden
crescendos reverberating in public as he insults the team of 'modernisers'
around Mr Smith.
This little drama must be of some comfort to Mr John Major. The prime
minister is in a spot of bother himself, but he can console himself with the
thought that it is better to have governed and lost than never to have
governed at all. Whether he stays or goes, he will have won a general
election and made his mark. The Labour leader has no such consolation to
rely on. If, as seems possible, Mr Smith is brought down by Mr Edmonds, he
will never have experienced the delights of sitting in Number 10 Downing
Street and enduring the vilification of the media and the electorate.
Only Mr Ashdown can smile at what is happening. He has much to gain, and
nothing to lose. The leader of the Liberal Democrats may indulge himself in
fantasies about becoming prime minister, but he is not likely to perish of
disappointment if he fails to achieve what most people believe to be
impossible. After all, under-secretary of state for Wales in a Labour-led
coalition is still further than he can realistically hope to get.
Yet today he is enjoying a fine run, which may become prolonged. Only four
years ago he stood amid the ruins of the former Liberal and Social
Democratic alliance, a symbol, some said, of the end of third-party politics
in Britain. Now the Liberal Democrats can fairly claim the support of
perhaps a quarter of the voters. Mr Ashdown commands an advancing army of
local authority councillors. He can look forward to further triumphs in the
south-west of England. His party's recent victory at Newbury cost Mr Norman
Lamont the chancellorship; its possible forthcoming win at Christchurch
could cost Mr Major his premiership.
It will be seen at once that these excursions into the land of power are
likely to be short-lived. The Liberal Democrats are prospering because the
government is regarded as incompetent and Labour remains unmodernised. To be
fair, Mr Ashdown has added to his party's strength by taking unequivocal
positions on matters such as the Maastricht treaty and intervention in
Bosnia. Voters can see through the careful equivocations of the prime
minister and the leader of the opposition; some are attracted by the Liberal
Democrat's clear-cut stands on principle. But that said, Mr Ashdown has not
managed to sell any overriding general principle that, in the electorate's
eyes, would both distinguish his party and dispel the killer belief that it
can never win.
Well then, can Labour? A slam-bang open battle for control with the union
leaders, with Mr Smith laying his job on the line and yet winning, could
solidify the Labour vote. I'll believe that when I see it. A Lib-Lab pact?
We are more likely to see the two non-conservative parties cancel one
another out, as the government climbs upwards from its post-recession
trough.

<TEXT>
Sir, As chairman of a modest public company, County of Kent Developments, I
have just presided over my third annual general meeting. As on the two
previous occasions, in spite of there being some 300 on the register and
their being properly notified, not one shareholder (save the directors)
attended the meeting.
This may indicate absolute confidence in the board of directors or the total
despair on the part of the shareholders.
However, the question I pose runs as follows: is three consecutive AGMs of a
public company without a shareholder in attendance (save the directors) a
record or are there others among your readers better qualified for inclusion
in the Guinness Book of Records?

Sir, I am horrified to note that the European Commission is likely to

next to go in the new State of Europe, perhaps the three-pin plug? After

FT  08 JUN 93 / Letter: Progress continues on plans for a nuclear waste
repository
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL FOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bronwen Maddox ('Storing up long-term doubts', June 4) suggests that
this company's plans for a nuclear waste repository are 'stalled'. In fact
we are making steady progress.
In April, Cumbria County Council granted planning permission for an
extensive array of monitoring and geotechnical boreholes at our Longlands
Farm site near Sellafield. Once we have initial results from that drilling,
early next year, we will be able to finalise a planning application for our
proposed rock characterisation facility, or 'rock laboratory'.
The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee, in its latest annual
report, reiterated its welcome for our plans for that underground facility.
As we stated last autumn, work in the rock laboratory will be essential to
develop the 'unequivocal evidence' on hydrogeological conditions to which
the committee's report has referred and which we and the safety regulators
will need before waste disposal could begin.
Neither are repository costs 'unknown'. The NAO itself has reported current
best estimates of undiscounted lifetime costs in the region of Pounds 3bn.
Tighter estimating will follow as improving knowledge of the site allows us
to undertake more detailed engineering studies - keeping within known
technology and aiming at minimum cost. While the cost of underground
disposal is high in absolute terms it is small in relation to the quantity
of nuclear electricity generated. Thus, a Pounds 3bn cost would be
equivalent, even in the crudest undiscounted terms, to only about a tenth of
a penny per kWh of nuclear power generated since the l950s and up to 2030.
Inevitably, there are uncertainties over precise timing of our programme -
as our published plans acknowledge. These reflect the scientific realities
of the step-by-step approach necessary for a confident and cost-effective
evaluation of site suitability and also the constraints of the planning
system. But, with a flexible strategy and the necessary resources committed
on the ground, we are maintaining momentum to make early deep disposal a
reality, as government policy requires.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Letter: Welfare cuts versus an increase in taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HARRY SHUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your leader of June 1 ('Mr Major's next steps') calls for public debate on
where cuts in the welfare state should fall. Yet surely intellectual
consistency also demands some discussion as to whether such cuts are
preferable to tax increases?
To deny this is to cling to the oft-disproved supply-side myth, revived with
such enthusiasm in the 1980s, that tax cutting and deregulation tend to
promote sustained economic prosperity. Now that has been exploded yet again,
honesty requires us to recognise that, since cutting taxes (or more
accurately shifting the burden from the rich to the poor) has not generated
the promised economic miracle, there is no justification for not reversing
the process.
The obscenity of expecting the less well-off to pay the price of Thatcherite
folly - and thus prospectively join the ranks of the 6m or so already on
income support - is regularly illustrated in your own columns. Witness the
spectacle (highlighted by Lex, 'In at the deep end', May 27) of the
privatised water industry - having been allowed to levy its own tax on
captive consumers and being largely absolved of paying taxes itself for
years - pouring its super-profits into overseas investments that are both
highly speculative and quite irrelevant to the well-being of our domestic
economy.
Is it not an insult to the moral sense as well as the intelligence of the
public to suggest that a nation which can afford such waste cannot also
afford the welfare state?

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Batchelor ('Negotiating the barriers', June 1) rightly refers
to the difficulties and burdensome administration of new rules on
value-added tax, especially the completion of statistical trading reports.
One might be impressed by the apparent sophistication of Customs &amp; Excise
computer systems to process such volumes of trade data.
However, we find it astonishing that VAT offices are able to confirm whether
a VAT number applies to a particular European company, but, given the names,
are unable to advise the correct VAT number for the occasional firms that
our time-consuming and expensive mail, fax and phone communications have
been unsuccessful in obtaining.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Letter: Why Lamont's removal from office was just (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MARKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his defence of Mr Norman Lamont, Bill Robinson writes that 'his
senior colleagues agreed that the ERM debacle was not his fault', and that
other countries 'have not found it necessary to change their finance
ministers along with their ERM parity'.
The difference from other countries is that, shortly before the exchange
rate was floated, quite a few billions of Britain's foreign exchange
resources were spent on buying sterling at a rate some 10 to 15 per cent
higher than that which has ruled in the market ever since. Responsibility
for exchange rate policy, including intervention, rests with the Treasury
and the Bank of England, chiefly the former. It was for being the person
responsible, at least formally, for incurring such huge losses that Mr
Lamont had to go. If in some way it was not actually 'his fault', whose was
it? In a democracy we should be allowed to know.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J R L CUNINGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article, 'Hounded out by fiction and foes' (June 4), Bill
Robinson asked: 'Why did we keep on reading that the City had lost all
confidence in the chancellor?' and then basically fails to provide an answer
except by reference to Mr Lamont's numerous indiscretions in his private
life.
The real reason why the financial community 'gave up' on Mr Lamont, and is
close to doing the same on the prime minister, is that both men, having
pursued an economic policy which was clearly not in the country's best
interests, were only forced to change tack following the UK's brutal
ejection from the exchange rate mechanism.
Like the Bourbons they seemed incapable of learning from their mistakes and,
if Mr Lamont's removal from office was the result of pressure from the
media, then the reporters concerned have done the country a considerable
service.

<TEXT>
You never know, television may yet grow up. Usually documentaries on social
subjects reflect the politically correct view: Boo] to landowners and
non-socialist governments, Hooray] for the little people. It makes better
television. Today's Assignment considers projects for dams in India and Sri
Lanka of a sort normally considered to be among the best ways of providing
cheap electricity and water. We are told, however, that opponents say such
dams destroy the habitat of people and animals while the extra power and
water are often grabbed by rich farmers and industrialists. Usually this
would ensure the hostility of the documentary maker, yet the billing for
today's programme (7.45 BBC2) ends by asking 'But is the new orthodoxy as
doctrinaire and blinkered as the one it replaces?' This suggests a quite
abnormal maturity. BBC2 also puts together a fascinating sequence of
90-second opinion pieces shown some weeks ago in which all sorts of people
enthused over their favourite works of art. Together they make a 35-minute
programme, The Great Picture Trail (9.45).

FT  08 JUN 93 / Arts: The Venetian Twins - Theatre out of London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The Italian Moliere': so Voltaire called Carlo Goldoni. Like Moliere,
Goldoni often relied on commedia dell'arte formulae for his plots. The
Venetian twins of this play, Zanetto and Tonino, sundered for yonks, with
contrasting manners but identical looks, happen to arrive in Verona at the
same time and keep bumping into each other's acquaintances and fiancees,
with predictably chaotic results. Sounds familiar? Yes, Goldoni's guys from
Venice might often be Shakespeare's boys from Syracuse - if plot were all.
But nobody would have compared Goldoni with Moliere if all he had done was
to follow a formula. He knew how to rejuvenate a comic recipe with humanity,
satire and emotional truth. Last year, when Giorgio Strehler's staging of
Goldoni's Le Baruffe chiozzotte visited the National Theatre, Londoners saw
a classic demonstration of how deep his comedy runs.
Michael Bogdanov's new RSC staging of Ranjit Bolt's new version of the play
is, as Clement Crisp would say, very other. Costumes and language veer
between 18th and 20th centuries, and between Italy and England. And Bogdanov
inflates chunks of it into British pantomime horseplay - to the extent of
stepping out of character. All this reaches its most far-fetched early on,
when an orchestrated sword-fight grows so over the top that the actors wound
a member of the audience: imagine the fuss. Not only the police arrive to
see what's up, but also (on press night, at any rate) David Calder, the
RSC's new Shylock, from the theatre next door. What a riot] Guffaw, scream,
cackle.
But Goldoni (remember Goldoni, boys?) was so much the master of his medium
that he could cloak the sun and turn a comedy dark with sudden death. When
this happens near the end of The Venetian Twins, the RSC audience cannot
help realising how much more integrity this play has than Bogdanov's staging
allows. (I speak as one who had guffawed too.)
The play's most virtuoso touch is that one actor plays both twins. David
Troughton plays Zanetto/Tonino with conquering panache - though you cannot
believe that this Zanetto is used to riches, and he (like Bolt's text)
overdoes Zanetto's stupidity. As the fop Lelio, Guy Henry shows us again
what a sublime comic character actor he is. With minimum effort, he manages
to be, at the same time, verbose, effete, pompous, lugubrious, hilarious,
and vulnerable; and he can be funny just by blinking. But we already knew
this much; he is in danger of dwindling into an 'act' instead of growing as
an actor. He needs directors more subtle than Bogdanov.
Most of the rest are just energetic cardboard and paste. Sarah Woodward is a
two-dimensional Rosaura, Jenny Quayle a one-dimensional Beatrice (neither
funny nor serious), Sian Radinger a coarse Colombina, Jonathan Philips an
overwrought Florindo (and will someone confiscate his eyeliner?). Even Robin
Soan, recently so exemplary in Three Birds Alighting on a Field, lets the
Doctor become a crusty stereotype.
Some music by Terry Malcolm introduces, interrupts and sometimes accompanies
the action. Conflating isolated lines from Verdi, Sullivan, and 'O sole
mio', it is played with cheerful ghastliness by the town band from
Inferno-atte-Po. Ho ho but not all evening ho.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Arts: 'Volpone' in Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By some strange fluke, there is a rush of Venetian premieres in the Midlands
this week: new productions of Jonson's Volpone at the Birmingham Rep, and at
Stratford-upon-Avon of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice and Goldoni's The
Venetian Twins. (Even Matthew Hart's new work for Birmingham Royal Ballet
featured Venetian blinds.) In several ways, Bill Alexander's Volpone staging
is a sequel to the Othello with which, in March, he launched his new
Birmingham Rep regime. And where does Act One of Othello take place? Venice,
city of intrigue.
As long as you cut it judiciously, Volpone is a remarkably playable comedy,
and it adapts well to different stagings. This Volpone is as fine a
production as Nicholas Hytner's 1990 staging at the Almeida in London. Where
Hytner evoked the intimacy of Venice by having water swishing around the
perimeters of the small stage area, this one evokes the city's scale, with
an arching bridge looming high above the Rep's large stage. The designer,
Kit Surrey, has taken his basic Othello set - huge tiles lining floor and
walls - and dyed it brown and gold.
This production's skill lies in contrasting public and private scenes, in
telling the story with robust vitality, and in giving surprising comic
emphasis to several supporting characters. Corvino (Jamie Newall), whose
grossly misogynistic treatment of his wife Celia can be so disturbing, is
here a comic monster. The scenes involving Sir Politic Would-be and his wife
(all omitted by Hytner) are here made hilarious , .
Everything is so lucid and onward-moving that it hardly matters that several
central roles are miscast. Or that Alexander has cut not only such songs as
Jonson's Catullus translation 'Come, my Celia, let us prove' but also
Volpone's three special minions - his dwarf, hermaphrodite and eunuch (in
Hytner's staging a crucial symptom of Volpone's wealthy corruption). Or that
Alexander and Surrey somewhat diminish the play by locating it (like
Jonathan Miller's Merchant of Venice) at the turn of the last century, with
cafe society, boaters, and frock coats.
Bernard Horsfall, though urbane and amusing as the still hub of the action,
is a Volpone/fox neither cunning nor predatory. He lacks the acid for such
remarks as 'women and men of every sex,' and he is too obviously the passive
dupe of the parasite fly, Mosca. In which role Gerard Murphy is not just
wrong - impossible to imagine him either buzzing or flying - but also
over-indulges all his worst hark-at-me mannerisms: the odd back-of-the-mouth
tone formation; the unspontaneous delivery of even so simple a line as 'Do
so'. By contrast, Andrea Mason's Celia is coarse and under-refined, her
elocution as weak as her maquillage is strong.
Yet these and other flaws hang light in the scales. I loved the detailed
ensemble playing in the big trial scene, the sense of Venetian open-air
chat, the vivid sweep of the whole satire. As in Othello, 20 extras help to
swell the big scenes. And Alexander's decision to bring the front of the Rep
stage right forward beyond the proscenium arch continues to pay dividends.
Stagings now project here so surely that I relish the whole balance of steep
auditorium and deep stage. In three months Alexander has made the Rep, whose
acoustic I used to dread, into a theatre I look forward to revisiting.
Birmingham Rep until June 26

FT  08 JUN 93 / Arts: Post War expectations - William Packer reviews the
exhibition at the Tate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the historian, of art or whatever, no subject could be more fascinating
in its tragic complexity than that of France and the French through the
1940s, the years of the Second World War and its immediate aftermath, of the
Nazi Occupation and the Vichy State, of collaboration, resistance and
liberation, and of the upheavals and horrors of the epuration, the
retribution and reconstruction that followed. In any Paris bookshop today,
50 years on, the flood of new material and analysis to be found demonstrates
that the collective national conscience is still mightily exercised, and is
only now coming to terms with those awful times.
The arts have their place in this process. Paris had been the natural
intellectual and creative centre of Europe since the Revolution. Here, to
the avant-garde, was where all that was new, in thought and practice alike,
found its true home. It was a symbolic and emotional position made all the
more poignant by physical isolation during the War. And after the War, it
seemed, here was the promised land, the Paris of Picasso and Leger, of
Giacometti and Dubuffet, of Sartre and Camus, of Cocteau and Malraux.
Living largely on its past it may have been, but so Paris continued at least
until the late 1950s in what it still saw as its natural and rightful
position, centre stage. Certainly Paris was central to any British
engagement with the avant-garde in those years. But such has been the
rewriting of art history since the 1960s that today we would hardly think
so. The emergent influence of America, and of New York especially, was
undeniable, but at least for a time yet the creative equivalence and mutual
exchange between the new world and the old were assumed. Indeed it was
magnificently acknowledged even so late as 1964, in the Gulbenkian survey at
the Tate of The Painting &amp; Sculpture of a Decade: 1954-64.
Today, leaving aside such individual reputations as Giacometti or Dubuffet,
the more general creative enterprise of those years is all but forgotten;
seen, if at all, in the light of subsequent American achievement, as poor,
minor, irrelevant stuff. Wols, Fautrier or Bram van Velde to set beside
Pollock or Rothko; Helion beside Warhol or Lichtenstein; Gruber beside
Fischl; Artaud beside Schnabel, Basquiat or Clemente? You must be joking.
In this respect, in bringing into the light the work of 11 artists active in
Paris in that period, Paris Post War at the Tate is only to be welcomed.
Each artist is given a distinct space and a clear showing in proper
strength. Picasso we may take as read, and indeed his presence here is more
token than substantial, and rightly so, for he could too easily have taken
over. His presence in Paris throughout the War remains ambiguous, largely
undocumented and unexplained. He emerges at the Liberation, declares himself
communist and takes on, if only nominally, the leading public role in the
purging of the community of artists. He was always a special case.
For the rest, the attentuated, distressed, existentialist figures of
Giacometti are familiar, as too is the art brut of Dubuffet, though his
dense grounds, scored and layered and inscribed, graffiti-like, with
mannikin idiograms of a knowing, primitive innocence, grow ever more
unshocking and seductive.
Antonin Artaud, who died in 1948 at 54, is the great rediscovery, with his
dessins-ecrits and, most especially, his portrait drawings, close,
desperate, expressionist images of the head alone. If history comes round
the second time as farce, so art comes round again as mere style and
decoration. Artaud's sophisticated psychological intensity only confirms the
essential triviality of the graffiti art of recent years, and the work of
such heroes as Basquiat, Schnabel, who made direct visual quotation of
Artaud, and Clemente.
Francis Gruber, too, more than deserves his revival. He died at 36 in 1948,
and the work here actually dates from the War itself, which he spent in
Paris. His is a bleak, uncompromising vision of the human condition, his
figures scrawny, the setting barely furnished, the realisation harsh and
awkward. But interesting as his work is for itself - and we may as well be
speaking of the assured abstraction of van Velde, or the stylised simplicity
of Helion's nudes - the lack of a fuller context is all too soon apparent.
In short we have an exhibition interesting enough in itself, but one in
which the sum is somewhat less than its parts. Here are eleven reputations
usefully re-examined, but where are the rest? If Picasso, why not Leger,
Braque, Matisse, Bonnard; if Gruber, why not Balthus and Buffet; if van
Velde, why not Manessier and Soulages? This is no plea for an exhaustive
review, after the fashion of the Barbican's excellent Aftermath of 1982, but
rather for something a little fuller and more comparative. The exhibition,
by its title, raises expectations that in the event it does not try to
fulfill. It is opportunity missed.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Arts: Intractable 'Carrington'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In January 1932, Lytton Strachey declared 'If this is dying, then I don't
think much of it.' Seven weeks after he died his companion Dora Carrington
(b. 1893) killed herself. Now, Jane Beeson's play Carrington at the Minerva
Studio, Chichester tells the story of this overlooked and intense artist
whose life represents the easy privilege and the hard radicalism of
Bloomsbury in the 1920s.
Beeson has chosen a fine but intractable subject. Carrington lacks structure
and shape. The play charts a Lyttony of ambidextrous goings on between
Strachey, Carrington, the artist Mark Gertler, Lady Ottoline Morrell and the
Woolfs. Carrington evolved a sexual identity worked out between the coolly
homosexual Strachey and the hotly heterosexual Gertler. What emerges is a
picture of her studies at the Slade through to her troubled menage a trois
with Strachey and her husband, Ralph Partridge, whom she married in May 1921
in order to stay close to Strachey.
Beyond this circle the Bloomsburies hover en masse: Bell, Fry, the Sitwells,
Nicolson and Sackville-West, Maynard Keynes, even the Lawrences. It was
contact with the wider intellectual community which redeemed Carrington's
life from indulgence and self-absorption. But she left, with a few dozen
perfectionist paintings, a sense of talent wasted in depression and energies
squandered in indecision.
As matter for a play, Carrington's life presents few dramatic possibilities.
The subject is difficult, and where the action fails to convey the
complexities, the caricatures fare best: Virginia Woolf (played by Lucinda
Curtis) is languid and vicious, while Ottoline Morrell (Dawn Keeler) keeps
lubriciously hearty; both are most themselves. Woolf says vatically,
'Carrington grows older and her doings are of a sort that age'; while
Ottoline chirrups 'Tomorrow, my darling, I'll take you to the asparagus beds
 -we'll talk there.'
Strachey (Robert Pickavance) is all flutter and fascination, quick with bon
mot and willowy opinion. Carrington herself (Toyah Willcox), inhabits the
spaces between the other characters, rather as she did in life. Willcox
plays her nervily, tugging at her dress, romping around the open set,
scratching at a charcoal sketch. But little in Annie Castledine's direction
explains the absorbing and singular passion that Carrington felt for
Strachey. She wrote: 'Strachey was the only person to whom I never needed to
lie, because he never expected me to be anything different to what I was.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Arts: Mikhail Baryshnikov - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The saddest words in ballet are 'But you should have seen him (or her) when
. . .' When the muscles were resilient, the style uncorrupted, the dance
fresh. On Saturday night Mikhail Baryshnikov danced at Sadler's Wells with
his White Oaks Project, on the second evening of a two-day visit, and ah]
you should have seen him then. At an age - he is in his 46th year - when
most male dancers have retired, or should have retired, Baryshnikov is
dancing with sublimest grace, artistry, physical resource. He has, for
several years, eschewed the classic repertory which he illuminated
permanently for us with his physical genius. Instead, he has found and
inspired roles - notably from Twyla Tharp and Mark Morris - which examine
his still dazzling prowess. And he remains what he was when we first saw him
in the Kirov season of 1970, a uniquely gifted and uniquely satisfying
dancer.
In this White Oaks programme he danced Mark Morris's Three Preludes, a solo
set to Gershwin's piano studies; Twyla Tharp's Pergolesi, an extended and
bravura exercise using six movements from Pergolesi string concerti; and he
was a member of the ensemble in Morris's Mosaic and United, which realises
two string quartets by Henry Cowell. The programme was completed by Hanya
Holm's gruesome Jocose, in which the other White Oaks dancers were called
upon to be oh-so-roguish to the Ravel violin sonata. Someone had better get
the sonata to a dry cleaner quickly: such choreography is dangerous.
A distinguishing quality of Baryshnikov's dancing has ever been its clarity.
The classicist's ideal of movement pure, sharply-drawn and impeccably
shaped, is always realised in his art. This was what Leningrad training
brought to a God-given physical instrument. And this is still a glorious
constant of his art, allied to that other, and intensely personal, gift of
seamless, huge-spanned phrasing. We see the dance as an essence, unalloyed
and potent, set in long lines of beautiful and subtly-conceived activity.
Baryshnikov now is, miraculously, Baryshnikov then.
In Three Preludes (in black trousers and top; white socks, vest, gloves)
Mark Morris sets him exploring Gershwin's relaxed and jazzy writing.
Baryshnikov is insouciantly brilliant, deep inside the syncopations, playing
with rhythm, phenomenally exact in line and accent. He takes on the shape of
the music - and of its historical period. In Pergolesi, Twyla Tharp offers a
culmination of her long association with Baryshnikov's dancing, which dates
back to Push Comes to Shove in 1976, and encompasses such varied pieces as
The Little Ballet and Sinatra Songs. Baryshnikov, in white, dances
tirelessly in a sequence of numbers that show him, as always in Tharp
choreography, riding on waves of energy and rhythm, cutting classic steps
into fresh and off-beat shapes, whipping into a movement and suddenly
holding it in suspension. Mercurial in its physical aspects, light in touch
as in execution, the piece is by turns mocking - Baryshnikov sends up with
sharpest wit his own repertory, Giselle's wilis, Nijinsky's roles - and shot
with intense feeling. It is about Baryshnikov in several ways - as virtuoso,
as repository of a great tradition, as balletic icon. It is a magnificent
study, sublimely danced by an artist whose greatness we recognised when we
saw him dance Jacobson's Vestris solo in 1970 - and in an odd way Pergolesi
recalls that earlier exercise, too - and whose greatness is undiminished,
and even more rewarding, today.
Mark Morris's Mosaic and Untitled is new this year, and very fine. Henry
Cowell's string quartets are mysterious, introspective music, haunted by
glissandi and shimmering sonorities, with dark shifts of mood. Morris
fleshes them out with movement no less questioning, because firmly rooted in
the scores. Baryshnikov and the White Oaks troupe are caught up in
unexplained meetings, secrets, and a stunningly clever burst of fake folk
dance (clearly dictated by Cowell's writing). It is a stimulating work -
like a Paul Klee come to life - and is admirably danced. Baryshnikov and
White Oaks must return soon.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Retrial in Dollars 1bn treasure case -
Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The three-year battle in the US courts over the treasure of the SS Central
America, which sank in 1857 180 miles off the South Carolina coast with
Dollars 2m in Californian gold on board, is about to reach its climax
following a refusal by the US Supreme Court to hear an appeal by the
explorers, Columbus-America Discovery Group, who found the ship in 1987.
At the end of June, the US District Court in Norfolk, Virginia, will retry
the case to determine the salvage award due to the explorers. Opposing them
are 39 insurance companies awarded ownership of the wreck on the basis that
they paid for the original loss - despite not producing policies or evidence
of claims of payment and not searching for the ship for 135 years. The
treasure is now worth about Dollars 1bn.

laundering - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Detailed guidelines have been issued by the Bank of Italy to banks on the
operation of a 1991 law aimed at preventing banking channels being used to
launder money from serious crimes. The law puts banks under an obligation to
report 'suspicious' transactions carried out by their clients. According to
Italian law firm, Carnelutti, the guidelines provide a list of unusual
transactions which should put banks on the alert.
The list includes: transactions disproportionate in value to the financial
standing of the client or to the nature of the transaction itself;
transactions in cash for substantial amounts; frequent transfers of
substantial amounts to or from abroad; frequent transactions on behalf of
third parties who never appear; and refusal by clients to provide
information when requested.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: German advertising ban overruled by
court - European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has ruled that a price advertising restriction
in the German unfair competition law infringes Rome Treaty rules on free
movement of goods. The ruling confirms that the treaty may outlaw national
marketing rules which are capable of hindering the sale of goods imported
from other European Community countries. It makes no difference that the
offending rule applies equally to domestic products.
The ruling followed a reference from the Bundesgerichtshof in unfair
competition proceedings brought against Yves Rocher GmbH. The German unfair
competition law prohibits comparative price advertising which is
eye-catching in the sense that it draws attention to a new price of a
product by juxtaposing it with the old price. Yves Rocher had used this form
of advertising to promote the reduced prices of its products made in France
and sold largely by mail order through its subsidiary in Germany.
Confirming earlier case law, the court said national legislation restricting
or banning particular methods of advertising or promoting goods was capable
of restricting the volume of imports since it affected the choice of
marketing methods available to imported products.
The fact that a business was forced to adopt a method of advertising and
sales promotion in the member state concerned, and to abandon a method which
it considered effective and which it used in other states, was capable of
restricting imports.
This means the national law will be precluded by European Community law
unless it is justified as necessary to satisfy a legitimate public interest
such as consumer protection or the prevention of unfair competition.
The German government claimed the price advertising ban was introduced to
protect the consumer since price comparisons frequently lead to mistakes by
consumers. The consumer can easily be misled because he is not in a position
to check the new price against the old. Advertising with price comparisons
is also likely to suggest a price level which is more advantageous than
necessarily justified.
The court added that the national law must also be proportionate to the
objective pursued. The court said the German law was not limited to price
comparisons which were wrong but covered those which were right as well if
they were eye-catching. It concluded that price comparisons were prohibited
not because they were wrong but because they were eye-catching. It followed
that all eye-catching price advertising was prohibited whether true or
false. Accordingly, the ban went beyond what was necessary to protect
consumers from misleading advertising.
The ban went too far because it applied to price comparisons which were not
misleading and which were true and therefore useful in helping consumers
exercise choice. An examination of other national laws showed the consumer
could be informed and protected by means less restrictive of intra-Community
trade.
The German government also argued that the ban did not infringe Rome Treaty
rules because it had an insignificant effect on the free movement of goods.
The court said except where the effect on trade was hypothetical, the
intensity of the effects on intra-Community trade was irrelevant.
C-126/91: Yves Rocher GmbH, ECJ FC, 18 May 1993.
French restrictions on contact lens distribution upheld
The court has ruled that French legal requirements that optical equipment
can only be sold by qualified persons are precluded by the Rome Treaty.
However, it said requirements that lenses should only be sold in business
premises run by qualified opticians were justified under the treaty's
exception for import restrictions resulting from national marketing laws
intended to protect public health.
In the absence of EC rules on public health, Community countries can make
their own rules provided they are in accord with the treaty and are
proportionate to the objective of protecting public health.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Haggling a discount on criminal
justice - John Mason on calls for formal plea-bargaining in England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The introduction of a formal system of plea bargaining into the English
criminal justice system - a move that would have far-reaching consequences
for the courts' handling of all crime from burglary to fraud - now appears a
distinct possibility.
Plea bargaining, where defendants agree to plead guilty in exchange for a
lesser sentence, is known to be under active consideration by the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice due to report in July. The growing consensus
among lawyers is that the commission is likely to favour it if sufficient
safeguards can be built in.
The move, which is supported by the bulk of the legal establishment, is
driven by largely pragmatic considerations. The post-war rise in crime has
left the English legal system dangerously overstretched when dealing with
all forms of crime. Plea bargaining is seen as a means of radically reducing
the number of cases going to trial.
The legislation of the 1980s aimed at financial crime has created a separate
problem - lengthy and costly fraud trials. The problems encountered in fraud
trials, such as Blue Arrow, has left confidence in such proceedings dented.
There are a number of suggestions, such as earlier disclosure of the defence
case, on how to bring these trials under control. But the complex nature of
the offences means there is only limited room for improvement. The problems
of making these trials shorter and more manageable are likely to remain
almost intractable. Plea bargaining is seen by many as the most effective
solution.
To some degree, the introduction of formalised plea bargaining would amount
to an extension and formalisation of what already takes place. Although
officially discouraged, prosecutors and defence lawyers often confer
informally with the frequent result that some charges are dropped if a
defendant pleads guilty to a lesser charge.
But what is not possible is negotiation about sentence. It was once possible
to obtain a reasonable indication from the judge before trial what length of
sentence he had in mind. The scope for this, however, has been reduced in
recent years.
Under the plea bargaining system favoured by most judges and barristers,
judges would indicate the length of sentence before trial by reference to a
system of guaranteed 'discounts' for an early plea.
A point of contention would be whether or not to adopt the American practice
of giving the prosecution the power to decide sentence discounts - a power
seen by many lawyers as likely to result in unfair pressure on defendants to
plead.
With fraud and other financial crime, plea bargaining is also in line with
current thinking about the enforcement of financial regulation. With a loss
of confidence in the UK's current self-regulatory regime expressed by
several leading City figures over the past three years, many have looked to
the model provided by the American Securities and Exchange Commission as the
way forward.
This is the approach favoured by the Serious Fraud Office whose director, Mr
George Staple, has advocated plea bargaining to the Royal Commission as the
most effective way of cutting the time and expense of fraud trials.
Mr Staple's thinking, based on the American experience, goes further. In
line with the reassessment of which financial misdemeanours are dealt with
by the courts and which by regulatory authorities, he sees the SFO and other
criminal prosecutors collaborating further with regulators. Plea bargaining
could then be part of a system which includes substantial fines, restitution
to the victims of financial crime and other regulatory penalties such as
disqualification.
The intention is clear. Mr Staple emphasises that the public interest
demands that, because of the seriousness of some offences, such cases be
dealt with by the courts.
But the prosecuting authorities will be looking for a guilty plea at a very
early stage, perhaps even before charges are brought.
The scenario envisaged is one where, after the SFO first acts, defendants
co-operate from the outset knowing that plea bargaining will be available.
Deals will be done along the lines of those done in the USA in the case of
Mr Ivan Boesky.
How this would work in practice is uncertain. With more 'routine' crimes,
such as burglary, the issues are more straightforward and most lawyers
expect the introduction of plea bargaining would produce fairly instant
results.
With white collar crime, the outcome of its introduction is less
predictable. One lawyer speculated how the Guinness scandal might have been
dealt with had there been formal plea-bargaining. How would Mr Gerald
Ronson, who received a one year jail sentence and a Pounds 5m fine for his
role, have responded if given the chance to negotiate at an earlier stage?
Guilty pleas from Mr Ronson and others convicted over Guinness would have
avoided the long court proceedings that took place over some six years. On
the other hand, how much room for manoeuvre would the judge and prosecutor
have in such a case before the final deal was seen publicly as resulting in
too lenient a punishment?
The public appetite for such a pragmatic approach to the delivery of justice
would have to be addressed. Safeguards to prevent the innocent being
pressurised into pleading guilty is the other main concern.
Among defence solicitors in white collar crime, opinions vary on how great a
danger this would present. According to Mr Anthony Burton, of Simons,
Muirhead and Burton, such problems would be relatively easily dealt with in
the case of the average fraud defendant.
Usually intelligent, middle class and well-versed in the techniques of
negotiation, most fraud defendants would be better able to cope with the
pressures of bargaining, he believed. They would also have been in contact
with their lawyers for longer than 'blue collar' defendants and be surer of
their advice.
Mr Burton sees principled reasons for introducing plea bargaining. Any
defendant should have the right to know whether or not he faces a jail term.
But he does not think this will necessarily lead to the very early pleadings
some prosecutors hope for. Defendants would still want to wait until the
case against them was clear before starting to negotiate.
Mr John Clitheroe, of London solicitors Kingsley Napley, foresees the
introduction of formal plea bargaining resulting in a tremendous increase in
the pressures on both defendants and their legal advisers.
Any advice to plead guilty could only be given with considerable time and
thought, particularly given the possibility that pleading guilty to a less
serious charge could still result in loss of reputation or livelihood
through disqualification.
A business background and experience of negotiation may have only limited
value to the white collar defendant considering making a plea, he said.
Unlike many burglars, it is likely to be their first encounter with the
criminal justice system.
'There is nobody in the world who panics more than the City professional
facing the prospect of going to jail,' he said.

FT  08 JUN 93 / People: Mitchell moves out to join the Dowty diaspora
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Triplex Lloyd, the West Midlands engineer which has been reshaping its top
management since the sudden death of chairman and chief executive Jim Dael
last summer, has recruited Bob Mitchell from Dowty Aerospace as its new
finance director. John Foley, the former finance director who was appointed
group managing director in December has been fulfilling both roles since
then.
Mitchell, 40, who joined Dowty in November 1989, has stayed on as finance
director of Dowty Aerospace after the takeover by TI. His boss Bruce Ralph,
chief executive of Dowty until the acquisition, is now chief executive of
Glynwed International.
'We were looking for international experience' says Foley, 36, who points
out that there are, moreover, useful similarities - in terms of size and
length of negotiations - between drawing up power generation and aerospace
contracts.
At the same time, Triplex's overall business is shifting towards the
high-tech end of the castings business, an area in which Mitchell, with his
aerospace background, should again feel at home.
He moves, however, to a smaller operation; turnover at Triplex Lloyd is
around Pounds 180m compared with Pounds 300m at Dowty Aerospace.

FT  08 JUN 93 / People: Tibbett and Britten's ambition overseas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two non-executive directors appointed by Tibbett and Britten illustrate both
the distribution and logistics group's continuing relationship with
Unilever, and its growing international ambitions.
Michael Johnson, 59, retired as head of information technology for Unilever
in January, after 30 years with the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group. For
the last three years he was responsible for Unilever's IT policies, designed
to take advantage of the capability of open systems.
Ivan Kingston, 60, is currently chairman of Malmgren Golt Kingston, a
consultancy which advises government and commerce on international trading
policy and related regulatory issues. He has particular expertise in market
access in Japan, North America and the EC.
John Harvey, chairman and chief executive of Tibbett &amp; Britten, was a
Unilever director before he led the buy-out of his company from Unilever and
Van Gend &amp; Loos (the Dutch railways) in 1984. He said: 'I have known Michael
and Ivan for many years. They each bring wide international and specialist
experience to the board, which will prove invaluable as our growth
continues.'
Since the buy-out, and flotation in 1986, Tibbett and Britten has maintained
close links with Unilever. Last year the UK represented more than 90 per
cent of Tibbett and Britten's revenue, but by the end of 1993, overseas
operations will account for more than 25 per cent of turnover.

FT  08 JUN 93 / People: Briscoe clears his desk at Midland Global Markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, is moving to rival
gilt-edged market-maker SG Warburg later this summer. He will join the
research team as senior gilt-edged market economist, filling the seat
vacated by John Shepperd, who recently moved to Yamaichi Bank.
Briscoe, in his early thirties, moved to Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged - now
the gilts arm of Midland - from the Treasury where he worked for six years.
Much of his time at the Treasury was spent as an economic adviser, focusing
specifically on the public sector borrowing requirement.
In the six years that he has been at Greenwell's, Briscoe, a keen socialite
and football lover, has become one of the City's best-known commentators on
UK government bonds.
So close is the rivalry between Greenwell Montagu and Warburg's that
Greenwell's has asked Briscoe to clear his desk at the earliest possible
moment. He will take up his post towards the end of August, plugging the
hole created by the departure of Shepperd and his junior Nigel Richardson to
Yamaichi Bank.
Briscoe's move is just the latest in a general reshuffling of economic
commentators in the gilts market. It now falls on Roger Bootle, chief
economist at Greenwell's to replace Briscoe.

FT  08 JUN 93 / People: Horne enters his third age with relish
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Horne, who stepped down as chairman of Lloyds Merchant Bank in
December, is looking forward to 'the great third period of one's life' as he
picks up a clutch of non-executive directorships.
Horne, 61, is joining the board of Serif, the security and specialist
commercial printer which once distributed the board game Trivial Pursuits,
and office furniture and leasing group Black Arrow. 'I am more interested in
smaller companies where I might have something to add' he remarks. He is a
director of consulting engineer Waterman Partnership, and thinks he has time
for a fourth position.
During his time at Lloyds, Horne was involved in three high-profile ventures
 -advising the unsuccessful European consortium during the Westland affair,
as well as Lloyds' failed bids for Standard Chartered and Midland.
He also became acquainted with Serif, which the bank advised during its
reversal into Cowells.
Alongside Horne, Serif is adding another non-executive director to advise on
its expanding security printing operations. He is Richard Harrison, 56, who
is vice chairman of PIRA International, a research organisation for the
printing, publishing and packaging industries.
It is also a corporate finance connection that binds Horne to Black Arrow;
when at Williams &amp; Glyn's earlier in his career, he advised the company
which reversed into Blanes in 1974. He joins as the third non-executive, and
the first to be appointed in twenty years.
Horne will on familiar territory. Not only is Derek Moore, one of the other
non-executives, a former Williams &amp; Glyn's man himself, but the board also
shares a strong interest in golf. Horne has captained St George's Hill,
deputy chairman Maurice Edward Coombe Hill and Moore, The Dyke in Sussex.

</HEADLINE>

T-shirt printing and car valeting services should be avoided by young people
starting their own business, according to a survey by the Prince's Youth
Business Trust in the West Midlands.
Jewellery making, floristry and horticulture are more rewarding sectors,
according to the trust, which helps disadvantaged 18-25-year-olds into
business. Only 17 per cent of T-shirt printers and 20 per cent of car
valeting businesses backed by the trust have survived. But all the florists
and horticulturists it backed and 78 per cent of jewellery makers are still
in business.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): In search of funding - FT
writers look at local finance schemes providing small amounts of money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, JAMES BUXTON and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A long-standing wish of many small business lobbyists is the creation of a
government-backed fund to provide low-cost, long-term loans to small
businesses, writes Charles Batchelor.
But cheap-rate finance may not be in such short supply in the UK as is often
supposed, according to a survey* by Kingston University's Small Business
Research Centre. It has identified no fewer than 63 loan schemes in England,
some national but most of them operating locally or regionally.
These schemes offer as little as Pounds 500 rising to Pounds 1m, though most
cater for businesses seeking up to Pounds 10,000 to finance start-up or
further growth. Most have repayment 'holidays', often of six months, and
many offer training and other support alongside hard cash.
The most common characteristic of these schemes is that they usually back
businesses which would have difficulties obtaining finance from conventional
sources. Many owners do not have track records or cannot offer security.
The schemes often have a social purpose as well, helping unemployed people
in inner cities or businesses in areas of industrial decline. Most involve a
public sector or non-profit organisation linking up with a private sector
source.
Backers include the banks, notably Midland, large private sector businesses
such as Shell, local authorities, enterprise agencies, City livery companies
such as the Mercers and organisations such as the Royal British Legion,
which helps ex-service people.
Some organisations run a number of schemes for different target companies,
such as Northern Enterprise in Newcastle upon Tyne which has two, London
Enterprise Agency which has four and Enterprise Lewisham, in south-east
London, which has two.
What the directory does not show is how effective soft loans are as a way of
helping small firms start or expand, though the researchers have identified
weaknesses in the marketing of the loan schemes. Nor, in cases where there
are several sponsors for a fund, do they always work smoothly together.
These and other issues are to be the subject of further research. If this
demonstrates that soft loan funds are a way of promoting small enterprise
then the government may have to rethink its policies, the researchers say.

Innovative approach
Spider Systems, an Edinburgh company which manufactures computer networking
equipment, is using an unusual type of grant to develop a new
telecommunications product range, writes James Buxton.
It is receiving Pounds 250,000 from Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd
(LEEL), the local enterprise company, and will repay it over three years
through royalties on products sold. LEEL says the funding instrument, which
it calls a participatory grant, is innovative but does not claim it is
unique. It is disbursing a total of Pounds 750,000 in participatory grants
this year, mainly to high-tech companies for product development.
'We believe product development is crucial to the future of the area,' says
Geoff Strachan of LEEL, 'but companies usually fund it out of profits which
have been hit by recession.' He says that LEEL has to have close links with
the companies to which it provides participatory grants.
LEEL expects to make a rate of return on the grants which is midway between
that on a loan (10-15 per cent) and an equity stake (40 per cent).
A cap applies on the value of products sold, above which Spider will not
have to make royalty payments. In the event that Spider does not sell any of
the products to which the participatory grant applies, it will not have to
repay LEEL. Spider will enter the funding in its books as grant, not a loan,
Spider, a 10-year-old company, now has sales of almost Pounds 20m and is
using the participatory grant to help fund a Pounds 1m programme to develop
a new range of telecommunications products. It says it is the only European
company of its kind in a market dominated by US concerns.
Spider, which employs 250 people in Scotland, Berkshire and abroad, is also
receiving a Pounds 150,000 grant from the Department of Trade and Industry
and will fund the rest of the Pounds 1m project from its resources.
Alternative loans
The range of local financing initiatives for small businesses is set to grow
if activity in the West Midlands is any guide to a national pattern. Across
the region, plans for funds, trusts and banks proliferate, writes Paul
Cheeseright.
The emphasis is the provision of loan finance for the business which cannot
obtain funds from either its bank or a venture capital company. This is an
area where Pounds 5,000, not Pounds 50,000, may be the bridge between
success and failure.
In the Black Country, Walsall Enterprise Agency is close to finalising the
details of a Pounds 400,000 revolving loan fund, while in central
Birmingham, the Aston Commission has produced a business plan for an
investment trust based on two companies. One would lend, while the other
would guarantee the loans; the longer term hope is the development of a
community bank.
In Coventry, the city council is examining the feasibility of an investment
trust. In Worcester, David Hallmark, a solicitor and Philip Paxton,
divisional manager of Midlands Electricity and a director of the local
training and enterprise council, hope to create a local funding partnership
to finance a city project. The aim of these initiatives is to foster local
economic development rather than to provide handsome returns to
shareholders.
There is little desire to vie with established financial institutions. 'Our
particular initiative,' says Pat Conaty, development director of Aston
Commission, 'is not to compete with the banks but to cope with a funding gap
where bank branches have closed.' Indeed, the new funds look to the
institutions for financial backing. The Aston Commission devised its
proposals in co-operation with Co-operative Bank. The Walsall Enterprise
Agency's basic funding will come from an unnamed finance house.
The ability to offer loans to companies which do not have the security which
the clearing banks demand as a matter of course, is only possible if the
scheme organisers have a backing which goes beyond the initial capital
funding. Aston Commission studies show that the risk of a small business
loan failure is 40 per cent against a six per cent chance of failure on
housing loans. Thus the Aston plan depends in part on winning large company
support for loan guarantees. And the Walsall scheme, which aims to offer
loans at two percentage points under the base rate, hopes to win the backing
of City Challenge funds, aimed at urban regeneration.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Easing the reporting
burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The small company audit has been the focus of a great deal of attention in
recent months. The government's drive against red tape has given urgency to
a long-running discussion of the merits of the small firms audit and the
government has proposed exempting businesses with turnover of less than
Pounds 37,600.
This concentration on the audit has overshadowed the introduction of changes
in the reporting requirements for small and medium-sized companies which
could also reduce the bureaucratic burden.
A statutory instrument which came into force last November permits for the
first time a reduction in the amount of information which has to be
presented to shareholders and the outside world.
Statutory instrument (SI) 2452 - full title The Companies Act 1985 (Accounts
of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Publication of Accounts in Ecus)
Regulations 1992 - came into force seven months ago. Few companies have been
aware of it as a reporting option but it is becoming more widely known.
Small and medium-sized companies have been able to file abbreviated accounts
(initially called modified accounts) with Companies House since 1981 but
they have still been required to provide full accounts to shareholders.
Abbreviated accounts had benefits in terms of confidentiality but increased
the accounting burden because they were in addition to the full accounts and
not a replacement for them.
By contrast, accounts prepared under SI 2452 may replace full accounts and,
while the reduction in the reporting requirement is only modest, may
represent an attractive option to some companies. So says Ray Mayes, a
partner at accountants Buzzacott and author of a new guidebook* to small and
medium-sized company accounts.
Accounts prepared under the SI 2452 rules - they have yet to acquire a more
convenient label though 'exempt accounts' has been suggested - comprise
simplified versions of the full directors' report, balance sheet and notes
to the accounts.
The directors' report may dispense with about a dozen clauses including
those requiring 'a fair review of the development of the business', details
of changes of asset values and of important post-balance sheet events.
The balance sheet may group items which must be reported separately in the
full accounts. Exempt accounts require only that goodwill and 'other
intangible assets' be reported while full accounts require development
costs, patents and other similar rights and goodwill to be reported
separately.
Companies making use of the exemptions may also omit notes to the accounts
covering taxation provisions, a detailed product and geographical breakdown
of turnover and information on directors' earnings.
In addition to easing reporting requirements SI 2452 also raised the
thresholds for companies qualifying as small or medium-sized. It increased
the turnover limit for 'small' from Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.8m and for
'medium' from Pounds 8m to Pounds 11.2m, letting a further 13,000 companies
through the net. Reflecting its origins in a European directive, the new
rules also allow accounts to be drawn up in ecus.
Some accountants fear the new rules will merely complicate matters by adding
a new reporting level to the existing full and abbreviated accounts. 'They
will bed down over time but at first sight they only pay lip service to
easier reporting,' says Alistair Rose, a partner at accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand. 'They will represent a fairly minimal saving in cost and time.'
But others welcome them as a first, if modest, reduction in the reporting
burden on smaller firms. 'A well-managed company would have the information
in its management accounts anyway,' says Mayes. 'But this saves the need to
convert them into a form suitable for statutory disclosure.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Technology: Slowly acquiring a thicker skin - Four years
after the Exxon Valdez disaster, the route to safer tankers is not all plain
sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standing on the vast deck of a 300,000-tonne supertanker and peering into
one of its cavernous, 27m-deep cargo holds, you quickly form a chilling
impression of the enormous quantity of crude oil that can be spilled into
the sea when such a large ship is ruptured.
As accidents such as the foundering of the Braer off the Shetland Islands in
January this year and the running aground of the Exxon Valdez off Alaska in
1989 showed, the results can be calamitous for the local environment.
Next month, however, a significant step will be taken in the quest for safe,
or at least safer, oil tankers. Under new rules made by the International
Maritime Organisation (a UN-backed body that sets safety standards for world
shipping), all supertankers commissioned from that date will have to be
double-hulled - that is, have a two-layer outer skin that will make the oil
carriers more resistant to collision or grounding.
The rule seems to make sense. A Very Large Crude Carrier, or VLCC, is a
gigantic, internally sectioned, flat-bottomed steel barrel with a large
engine at the stern and a relatively small superstructure to house the
computers and the handful of humans required to load, sail, manoeuvre and
discharge it. Doubling the outer casing of the barrel should significantly
increase its ability to withstand puncture.
But the move to develop 'environmentally-friendly' oil tankers is not all
plain sailing. First, some shipowners say double-hulled tankers may not
reduce spillages in big supertanker accidents. Second, they are more
expensive to build and operate than traditional single-hulled, or even
double-bottomed tankers, which has made many oil companies and shippers
reluctant to charter them.
The Odense Steel Shipyard, owned by the big Danish group A P Moller, this
year delivered the world's first two double-hulled VLCCs, out of six it is
building for Maersk Tankers, another A P Moller company. The 300,000-tonne
Eleo Maersk and Elizabeth Maersk carry their ballast in the minimum 3m-wide
space that runs between outer and inner hulls.
The builders say the 344m-long ships are designed to have levels of
resistance to breaches and to 'raking damage' - the opening of the bottom of
the ship - up to 25 per cent greater than IMO specifications. But no-one is
arguing that the advent of the double-hulled tanker will mean an end to
supertanker disasters. In fact, says Ola Lorentzon, chief executive of
Sweden's ICB Shipping, it is doubtful that oil spills would have been
avoided in any of the world's most notorious tanker accidents if the ships
had been equipped with double hulls.
'In the case of the Exxon Valdez, it wouldn't have made any difference if it
had been double-hulled, according to what I understand from the experts,' he
says. His point, not denied by shipbuilders, is that even a double-hulled
ship could not withstand the force involved in driving fully laden onto
rocks.
Lorentzon sees the new regulations on double-hulled ships as deriving mainly
from political demands for action after spectacular accidents. He wonders
whether the extra money to be spent on building double-hulled tankers -
which are 15 to 20 per cent more expensive than a standard single hull
tanker, costing around Dollars 85m (Pounds 56.3m) - could be better spent on
other anti-pollution measures.
According to A P Moller, tanker accidents account for only 5 per cent of all
oil pollution at sea. Tanker operations account for 7 per cent, while 14 per
cent comes from other shipping and 61 per cent from industrial waste. At
present, only 14 of the 51 VLCCs under construction worldwide are
double-hulled, but the new regulations mean that soon any replacements for
the world's 450-strong VLCC fleet will have to be to the new specification.
This brings up another complaint that unites shipbuilders and operators  -
that double-hulled tankers are, in effect, discriminated against. Many
charges, such as port fees, are levied on the volume of a ship. A
double-hulled tanker inevitably has greater volume than a single-hulled
vessel and can cost up to 20 per cent more in port fees.
The complaint extends to single-hulled tankers with segregated ballast
tanks. Segregated ballast tanks were made compulsory on all tankers built
after 1980 to cut down on pollution from the flushing of oil-contaminated
ballast - a leading source of oil pollution.
A growing number of old tankers is likely to be de-commissioned in the next
few years because of the difficulty of meeting increasingly stringent
standards. Nevertheless, more than half the VLCCs now at sea were built in
the 1970s and there remains a financial incentive to operate old 'dirty'
tankers rather than more modern ships.
'A major part of the oil industry is still looking for the cheapest freight,
regardless of the environmental aspects,' says Tommy Thomsen, vice-president
of A P Moller. 'So far, society has chosen not to reward
environmentally-friendly tankers.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Technology: Part of the office furniture - Microsoft is
unveiling a new partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine being able to operate all the equipment in your office from one
screen, or each entertainment product in your home from a single remote
control device.
Instead of pressing different buttons on different machines for different
functions, these could all be connected to save users' time, money and the
frustrating need to remember which machine does what and how.
Companies in the electronics, computer, office equipment and entertainment
industries have been thinking along these lines for some time. Now that
wireless communications look like replacing endless lines of cable, such
ideas have been given a new impetus.
Tomorrow, Microsoft, the dominant US software company, will take a
significant step toward the future linking of electronic equipment by
unveiling partnerships with office equipment makers to produce photocopiers,
facsimile machines and laser printers controlled by the company's software.
Microsoft's contribution will be a new office equipment 'operating system'
that will let users control this equipment by merely pointing at pictorial
representations of their functions on a built-in computer screen. The
company has been working on this technology for more than four years and it
is similar to the company's Windows software.
The software operating these new devices will, however, include the ability
to be controlled by Microsoft Windows when connected to a personal computer.
It will also be 'multi-tasking' so that it can allow the office equipment in
question to handle more than one job at once.
One of the partners in this deal - Hewlett-Packard - says it can foresee the
day when this technology will allow it to produce printers with no external
switches, buttons or controls. All of these tasks will be handled by
software and controlled by a PC running Windows. The devices, to be produced
initially under Microsoft's new office equipment partnership, however, will
be capable of operating without a PC connection, although a small, PC-style
flat screen and computer-generated 'icons' will be used to provide the
control. Other partners are Compaq, Ricoh, Minolta, and Ericsson.
These partnerships are only one element in the long-term strategy outlined
by Bill Gates, the head of Microsoft. He wants to put Microsoft technology
in almost anything that uses electricity.
His intention is to make Microsoft software an integral part of office
equipment.
Gates also foresees Microsoft's involvement in the design of specialist
software for 'broadcast' information to and from portable computers over
wireless networks, personal information management applications for use on
hand-held computers, electronic and voice mail from portable systems and the
transfer of data to and from desktop systems automatically.
Finally, he has committed Microsoft to work on designing Windows into
consumer electronic machines such as video cassette recorders, audio
systems, home telephones and information browsing systems run over cable
television networks, as well as advanced computer games, Windows-based
photography systems and multi-media education software.
Gates says many of these projects will require partnerships with companies
in different industries, but Microsoft has enough funds for such strategic
investments. He cites the company's investment last year in London
publishing house Dorling Kindersley and the subsequent development of
multi-media products based around the company's educational books.
'Partnership is the key - getting people to build these devices in an
intelligent form so that other people's machines can talk to their
machines,' says Gates. 'We don't want to dictate partners or form factors -
we are working with dozens of manufacturers to bring out systems that
contain specialised (software) code.'
Gates sees a future where more and more consumer electronics technology is
built around the PC - and that which is not will at least use a form of
Windows as an underlying control technology. He predicts that in the future
many people will have a few wall-mounted colour, flat screens in their house
for TV, video games and information management, with the controls all
condensed onto a single hand-held unit.
In the short term, Gates does not want to let video game manufacturers
maintain 'control of the television' as an interactive entertainment medium
and is investigating the role Microsoft can play here. 'It's a question of
who controls intelligence to TV - which at the moment is Nintendo and Sega,'
he says.
'But what about resolution (sharpness of the TV), what about desire to sit
far away from the device and regulatory issues. These are the kinds of
things Microsoft explores very carefully and we expect to make some bets
here - on telephone control, information browsing and the idea of the PC as
an advanced entertainment machine. This will take some time to shape up and
see exactly what will emerge - but we will be working with lots of partners
on this.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Technology: A super PC from H-P
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While many companies are talking about creating vast new markets with
pocket-sized computerised gadgets that are variously called 'personal
digital assistants' or 'information appliances', Hewlett-Packard has this
week introduced a 'super-portable' personal computer that addresses the
needs of a broad range of 'mobile professional' computer users.
The H-P Omnibook 300 is a lightweight and compact PC with a full-size
keyboard and screen and long battery life. It is bigger than a 'palmtop'
computer, but lighter than a 'notebook' PC.
It is a 386-powered PC that comes fully loaded with Microsoft Windows, Word
and Excel software, as well as some personal productivity and communications
software. Weighing in at 2.9lb and measuring roughly 11in by 6.5in and 1.5in
thick, the Omnibook runs for five to nine hours on four standard AA
batteries.
H-P is offering two models; one with a built-in 40MB hard drive with a list
price of Dollars 1,950 (Pounds 1,290) in the US and the other with solid
state data storage that will sell for Dollars 2,375. Extras include an
internal modem and a power adapter. Neither of the Omnibooks includes a
floppy disk drive, but software or data can be downloaded from a desktop PC
via a serial port or an innovative infra-red link that is expected to become
standard in desktop computers of the future.
Special features of the Omnibook include a 'pop up mouse', that springs out
of the side of the computer. It behaves like a desktop computer rodent, but
because it does not require a flat surface it can be used, for example, in
the limited confines of an aircraft 'tray table'. H-P has made some
compromises to minimise power consumption. The screen is monochrome and the
data storage capacity is lower than that of most notebook computers. This is
a briefcase-sized PC that overcomes the limitations of existing PCs.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley faces Pounds 1m legal
claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government was yesterday faced with a Pounds 1m damages claim in the
latest stage of a legal tussle over restrictive practices in British medical
accreditation.
Dr Anthony Goldstein, a London rheumatologist, issued a High Court writ
against Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, claiming damages for loss
of earnings over the past 11 years. He claims that he has suffered
financially because of government failure to implement 1975 EC medical
directives properly.
Dr Goldstein has been active in a campaign against the UK government's
approach to the directives, which were designed to establish mutual
recognition of medical qualifications within the EC. Earlier this year he
argued successfully in the High Court that UK criteria for awarding
specialist medical accreditation breached the EC regulations, but failed to
win damages.
Although Dr Goldstein holds a European specialists' certificate - intended
to achieve the mutual recognition of qualifications - he argues that the UK
medical authorities have failed to give it full effect.
'This is essentially a Pounds 1m damages claim following a deliberate breach
of EC law by Britain since 1976,' he said yesterday.
In January a working party chaired by Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's
chief medical officer, acknowledged that Britain's system of specialist
accreditation, run by the medical royal colleges, had operated in tandem
with the EC scheme.

Christchurch by-election.
The choice of Mrs Diana Maddock, the party's candidate for Southampton Test

FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs approve panel for child
asylum-seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS last night approved a government proposal to establish a
non-statutory advisory panel to assist children who, unaccompanied by an
adult, flee to Britain to seek asylum.
Mr Charles Wardle, Home Office junior minister, said the new body, to be
funded by the government for one year in the first instance, would be
established and administered by the Refugee Council.
A Lords amendment to the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill which sought to
establish a statutory advisory panel - strongly supported from the
opposition benches - was defeated by a government majority of 48 (274-226).
A Refugee Council spokesman, commenting later on the government's preference
for a non-statutory advisory panel, said: 'We would have preferred it to be
statutory. From our experience we know the vital need for this sort of help
to minors.
'Our job now is to make it work.'
Mr Michael Howard, on his first appearance on the government front bench as
home secretary, ignored opposition demands to repudiate the recent speech by
Mr Winston Churchill (C Davyhulme) calling for a halt to the 'relentless
flow of immigrants' into Britain.
Replying, Mr Wardle said he had taken issue with Mr Churchill in the media
over his remarks.
Mr Wardle later said the government was accepting another Lords amendment
that children asylum-seekers could be fingerprinted only in the presence of
someone independent of the immigration authorities or police, and whose role
it was to look after the interests of the child.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Chamber crackles as Who's Who
debates Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAS at 3.33pm precisely that yesterday's keenly awaited Lords debate on
Maastricht began to crackle.
That was the moment when Lord Jenkins of Hillhead - in vintage form - took
his life in his hands and trained the full force of his inimitably caustic
wit on the Lady whom everyone had come to see.
Poking fun at the 'unusual assurance' with which the 'deadly' nature of her
speech had been trailed, the former Labour chancellor and SDP founder did
not mince words in describing her opposition to Maastricht as 'mystifying'.
Not only was she responsible for Britain's adherence to the invasion of
sovereignty known as the Single European Act, he ventured. But she had
pushed it through the Commons with 'the strongest of whips'.
In the hothouse atmosphere of the Commons, Lady Thatcher (for it was she)
would probably have intervened there and then. As it was, we had to wait a
few minutes for her inevitable riposte.
She was, she said, 'somehow under the impression' that things were less
lively, more courteous and much less robust in the Lords. 'I find it is not
so. And I'm delighted.'
That was what the crammed spectators' galleries, the peers squatting
inelegantly on the steps leading up to the linen-sheathed throne and the
groups of MPs including Mr Michael Forsyth, a junior minister, had come to
hear.
The former prime minister's speech - beginning just before 4pm and lasting a
densely-packed 25 minutes - was just the fifth contribution in a highly
charged debate expected to stretch deep into the small hours of Wednesday
morning.
With a record 130 or so requests to speak, the speakers resembled a
distinguished Who's Who of prominent figures in the Commons and beyond from
the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s: Lord Thorneycroft, a former Tory party chairman,
was followed by Lord Jay, a former Labour Treasury minister. Former
Conservative cabinet minister Lord Parkinson, and former deputy prime
minister Lord Howe were followed by Lords Pym and Gilmour, themselves former
members of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet.
With no vote expected until the committee stage later this month, the focus
was, unusually for a Maastricht debate, on what people said and not the
behind-the-scenes manoeuvring in the whips' offices.
It is during this committee stage that the acid-test for the government
posed by a Lords vote on a Maastricht referendum is expected to come.
If their lordships supported such a move, then the government - already at a
low ebb - would be forced into the highly embarrassing exercise of getting
MPs to vote the proposal back out again before departing for their summer
holidays.
The Commons has already voted against a referendum once during the more than
200 hours MPs devoted to scrutinising the Maastricht bill.
After her galvanising start, Lady Thatcher's speech was regarded by many as
less deadly than billed. Though by no means devoid of the usual martial and
pugilistic imagery, it was long on detail and short on soundbites - at least
prior to her concluding and passionate demand for a referendum.
'I think she lost the House at times,' said one Euro-sceptic peer, joining
the stampede out of the chamber that greeted Lord Boston of Faversham - the
unfortunate sixth speaker in the debate.
But Sir Teddy Taylor, the Conservative MP for Southend East, was on hand to
fly the Euro-sceptic flag. 'She outlined clearly and precisely that
democracy was dead if (Maastricht) goes through,' he said. For sheer
emotion, it was impossible to beat the succinct eight-minute contribution by
the 84-year-old Lord Tonypandy, the former Speaker.
'Britain wants a referendum and she deserves it,' he proclaimed, his arms
flailing. 'I believe the sovereignty of our country is at stake.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine denies wrongdoing over
Nadir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday insisted
that he had done nothing wrong in raising the handling of the case of Mr
Asil Nadir, the bankrupt former chairman of Polly Peck, with Sir Nicholas
Lyell, the attorney-general.
His statement explaining how he had come to approach Sir Nicholas failed,
however, to prevent Labour stepping up its attack on the involvement of
ministers with the case of Mr Nadir, who jumped bail last month and fled to
northern Cyprus.
Opposition backbenchers demanded a Commons statement on the the actions of
Mr Michael Mates, a middle-ranking minister, who separately raised the
matter with Sir Nicholas, and gave Mr Nadir a 'light-hearted' gift of a
watch.
Downing Street said that in raising the matter as a constituency MP, Mr
Mates had acted 'in line with the guidance issued to ministers'. His
resignation had been neither offered nor sought.
Mr Heseltine said that after a lunch early this year with a personal friend,
Mr Christopher Morgan, one of Mr Nadir's public relations advisers, he had
mentioned his conversation to Sir Nicholas.
Sir Nicholas had advised him that any concerns should be put in writing so
that they could be properly considered. Mr Heseltine had passed this message
back to Mr Morgan, and had heard nothing more. 'My own view is absolutely
clear that what I did was right, and if I had done anything less it would
have been wrong,' Mr Heseltine said.
Although he had earlier been quoted as denying involvement in any approach
Mr Heseltine might have made, Mr Morgan said yesterday that he 'drew the
attention' of Mr Heseltine to Mr Nadir's position.
Mr Morgan said he had had an 'informal and confidential' meeting with Mr
Heseltine to express Mr Nadir's concerns at how his case was being pursued
by the Serious Fraud Office and the belief that he was being denied the
opportunity to prepare his defence properly.
Some Tory backbenchers remained uneasy about Mr Mates' judgment, and the
issue could be brought up at this Thursday's meeting of the 1922 committee
of Conservative MPs. But, unless further embarrasing revelations emerge, he
is expected to survive.
Labour intends to use the case to build up pressure on Sir Norman Fowler,
the Tory party chairman, who is due to appear next week at a cross-party
committee investigation into the funding of political parties.
Mr Mark Rogerson, Mr Morgan's partner and the constituent of Mr Mates, who
alerted him to Mr Nadir's position, said his public relations firm had not
yet been paid by Mr Nadir. He said he was aware that Mr Nadir was bankrupt.
'We worked for him on the basis that, when he had the ability to pay, he
would.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mellor believes Lamont will not
rock PM's boat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Mr Norman Lamont's close political friends yesterday offered a firm
prediction that the chancellor would not take revenge for his dismissal by
seeking to destabilise Mr John Major's government.
The forecast by Mr David Mellor - who himself resigned from the cabinet last
autumn - that Mr Lamont would be circumspect in his public statements was
echoed by other friends of the former chancellor.
Mr Lamont, still shocked by Mr Major's decision 10 days ago to reshuffle the
cabinet, consulted several friends at the weekend on the approach he should
adopt in his first public statement on his departure from the government.
He has indicated that he sees no reason why he should be made a scapegoat
for the depths of the recession, for the explosion in public borrowing or
for the debacle of sterling's retreat from the exchange rate mechanism.
But Mr Mellor said that he doubted that Mr Lamont would speak in tomorrow's
Commons debate on the government's economic policies called by the Labour
party. That debate, which will be opened by Mr John Smith and Mr John Major,
will see Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Commons appearance as chancellor.
Writing in the Evening Standard, Mr Mellor said his contacts with the former
chancellor indicated that Mr Lamont intended to keep back for his memoirs
his account of his two-and-a-half years at the Treasury.
That would set out 'without rancour and without any desire for revenge' his
defence of his chancellorship.
Mr Lamont was aware that any attempt to destroy Mr Major's government would
take with it his own political reputation. The former chancellor's appetite
for politics was 'undiminished' and at 51 he might well contemplate a return
to high office.
Mr Mellor's assessment coincides with informal messages to the prime
minister's office since the reshuffle. Other friends of the former
chancellor have also stressed that he has hopes of a senior appointment in
the City while he remains on the backbenches.
That prospect would be diminished by an outright attack on Mr Major.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith faces uphill struggle to
reform union links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 50 per cent of the total votes at the Labour party's annual conference
are now pitted against the plan by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to
modernise his party's links with trade unions.
Yesterday three of the largest unions, the GMB general union, Nupe, the
public-service union, and the NCU telecommunications union, all voted at
their annual conferences against Mr Smith's plans for one-member-one-vote in
the selection of parliamentary candidates.
Other big unions, holding their congresses in the next few weeks, are
expected to take similar stances in what is emerging as a bitter battle
between the big unions and the 'modernisers' in the Labour party.
Several options for reform have been suggested by the unions and there is
likely to be a tense negotiation within the movement for a compromise.
Mr John Edmonds, general-secretary of the GMB, said: 'The party faces two
very unattractive options. The first is that the issue goes to the
conference in the autumn, and the way that the votes seem to be going
indicates the party leader's proposals will go down. The second is we have
an unseemly public row that rattles on for weeks.'
Previously seen as a staunch supporter of Mr Smith, who is sponsored by the
GMB, Mr Edmonds has started a bandwagon which is set to roll until the
party's annual conference in the autumn. A leading moderate who has been
happy to portray the GMB as a 'loyalist' union, this is the first time he
has fallen out so strongly with Labour in public.
Mr Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of Nupe, meeting in Scarborough,
said his union's proposal was not one-member-one-vote and not the block
vote, but something that could be a bridge between the two through a
register of Labour party supporters.
The GMB's proposal is similar. It recommended yesterday that a reformed
electoral college be set up for the next round of elections of parliamentary
candidates as a transition towards the use of a register of people who paid
the political levy to the party.
A vote against one-member-one-vote will mean that there is no procedure for
the next round of candidate selections, which is due to start in January -
hence Mr Smith's desire to persuade the party conference to back his plans.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, later issued a statement saying
that yesterday's vote by the GMB 'exposes the sham of John Smith's Labour
party.
'The next few months will show that the Labour party is still a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the trade union movement.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Paisley obstacle to Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS TO re-start the political dialogue in Ulster received a blow
yesterday when the Rev Ian Paisley said he would not meet Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary.
Sir Patrick invited the leaders of the four main constitutional parties to
meet him for separate talks over the next two weeks to discuss ways of
getting the inter-party discussions going again.
But the Democratic Unionist party leader told the Northern Ireland Office he
was not interested in discussion until the Irish Republic removed its
territorial claim over Ulster. He also said he would not talk until Mr John
Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, ended discussions with Mr Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein.
Rev Paisley said he had told the Northern Ireland Office he wanted Sir
Patrick 'to tell us why he wants to see us, what documents he is going to
place before us and then we would consider what we would do'.
Mr Hume is to meet Sir Patrick tomorrow and the Ulster Unionist party has
indicated Mr James Molyneaux, the party leader, will meet him next week.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley condemns benefits 'scares'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH in expenditure on the social security system had to be consistent
with what the country could afford, Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary, told MPs yesterday.
He again attacked Labour MPs for 'scaremongering' over the government's
spending review and said they were causing needless anxiety among vulnerable
groups by suggesting that various benefits were at risk.
Emphasising the need to ensure that the benefit system was affordable, Mr
Lilley said: 'It cannot indefinitely outstrip the economic means the country
has to pay for it.
'If it did so, it would become unsustainable and that would be the greatest
betrayal for those in need and would damage the economy,' he said.
Mr Lilley said the long-term review now in progress was seeking to ensure
'we have a better but sustainable system which is growing in line with what
we can finance'.
Opposition MPs demanded to know where cuts were going to be made and Mr
Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, suggested that comments
made by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, had fuelled
anxiety about 'mean-minded changes' affecting housing benefit and other
payments. He called on Mr Lilley to slam the door on schemes that would
'spell disaster for some of the most vulnerable in our community'.
Mr Lilley assured the House that none of the changes resulting from the
long-term review would make vulnerable people worse off.

voting reform
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to modernise his party's links
with trade unions were snubbed yesterday as two of the largest unions voted
against them.
The GMB general union and Nupe, the public-service union, both voted at
their annual conferences against Mr Smith's plans for one-member-one-vote in
the selection of parliamentary candidates.
The NCU telecommunications union, holding its conference in Blackpool, is
also expected to vote against the plan which Mr Smith is determined to push
through.
About 50 per cent of the total votes at the Labour party's annual conference
are now already pitted against the reforming plan. Other big unions, holding
their congresses in the next few weeks, are expected to take similar stances
in what is emerging as a bitter battle between the big unions and the
'modernisers' in the Labour party.
Several options for reform have been suggested by the unions and there is

indicates the party leader's proposals will go down. The second is we have
an unseemly public row that rattles on for a large number of weeks.'
He said the best possibility was that the review group, which examined the
relationship between the Labour party and trade unions, be recalled and that
it try to make a unanimous recommendation to the party's ruling national
executive committee in advance of the party conference.
Mr Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of NUPE, meeting in Scarborough,
said his union's proposal was not one-member-one-vote and not the block vote
 -but a register of Labour party supporters.
The GMB's proposal is similar. It recommended yesterday that a reformed

FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Former teacher will fight seat for
Lib Dems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrat campaign for the Christchurch by-election began
yesterday with the selection of a 48-year-old Southampton councillor as the
party's candidate to overturn the Conservatives' 23,000 majority.
The choice of Mrs Diana Maddock, a former teacher and the Liberal Democrat
candidate for Southampton Test at the last general election, followed a
weekend opinion poll suggesting that the government is heading for a
humiliating defeat in what traditionally has been one of its safest seats in
England.
Tory party officials said that no date had yet been agreed for the poll  -
made necessary by the death of Mr Robert Adley - in spite of suggestions
that Mr John Major favours July 8 or July 15.
With the mood of the Conservative party at Westminster distinctly fragile,
some ministers believe that the by-election should be delayed until
September.
A defeat in Chistchurch might be the occasion for another crisis of
confidence comparable with that after the loss of Newbury last month.
Right-wing opponents of the prime minister on the Tory back benches believe
it might provide the trigger for an autumn challenge to Mr Major's
leadership.
In spite of the weekend NOP poll which predicted that the Tories' general
election majority would be replaced by a comfortable 7,000-vote margin for
the Liberal Democrats, the general view is that the government will opt for
next month.
Speaking after her selection, Mrs Maddock said the Liberal Democrats
intended to turn the by-election into a 'referendum' on the recent record of
the government.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Buy-out bid for Midlands airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT and empl-oyees yesterday submitted a bid to buy East Midlands
International Airport at Castle Donington, Leicestershire.
There are now four bidders for the airport, whose future ownership has been
in doubt since Derbyshire County Council signalled in 1991 it would dispose
of its 44 per cent stake.
KPMG Peat Marwick, accountants, whose Nottingham office is handling the
sale, refused to namethe other bidders. But Regional Airports has publicly
disclosed its interest and it is thought that Lockheed, the US group, and
National Express, the UK coach company, may have made bids.
Once Derbyshire had decided to sell, a series of reports was commissioned by
the owners, leading to a decision to place the airport on the market. The
deadline for bids was yesterday, and the successful bidder should be known
by the end of the month.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Postal staff morale 'at record low'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORALE among Royal Mail employees has reached its lowest level, with nearly
70 per cent of the workforce reporting that they are unhappy at work,
according to the findings of an internal employee opinion survey.
Uncertainty about jobs and concern about the future of Royal Mail, the
letters arm of the Post Office, were given by employees as the principal
reasons for poor morale.
The government has yet to announce whether it will sell the Post Office as
one business or split it into its constituent parts - Royal Mail,
Parcelforce and Post Office Counters. Whichever course is picked,
privatisation is to be delayed at least until the 1994-95 parliamentary
session.
Mr Jerry Cope, Royal Mail personnel director, said the main results of the
survey had 'held up surprisingly well in light of the turbulence Royal Mail
has been going through'. He said that, whatever the future held, the
organisation 'would strive to avoid compulsory redundancies'.
The Union of Communication Workers, the main Post Office union, said poor
pay was the root cause of dissatisfaction. In common with other
public-sector groups, this year's pay increase for Royal Mail workers will
be restricted to 1.5 per cent.
The survey, one of the largest of its kind, was sent out to 90,000 employees
in March; a further 90,000 questionnaires to the remainder of Royal Mail's
staff will be sent out in September. Some 66 per cent of managers and 39 per
cent of non-managers responded.
While morale declined, satisfaction with Royal Mail as an employer rose 7
percentage points among managers over the past year to 78 per cent. The
figure for non-managers remained the same at 70 per cent.
Both groups said they thought the first-class letter service had declined in
the past year. Management said the result was surprising because 'quality of
service is at an all-time high'.
A separate internal survey of 5,000 Post Office head office staff found that
more than half were dissatisfied with appraisal and promotion systems. A
quarter of women questioned said they experienced sexist comments,
patronising behaviour and unwanted physical contact.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Faster growth sought at Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the airports operator, yesterday warned that London's Heathrow airport
risked losing out to its main European competitors including Paris,
Frankfurt and Amsterdam, unless a proposed Pounds 900m fifth terminal was
built earlier than planned.
Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, said he hoped the terminal would be
completed about six months early to avoid a capacity crunch.
Although the new terminal is not due to be completed until late 2001, Sir
John said the pace of passenger growth at Heathrow could start outstripping
current terminal capacity by 1998.
Passenger volumes at Heathrow have grown 8 per cent to 45.5m during the past
12 months. Sir John said there might be more congestion unless the new
terminal was built ahead of schedule. 'The inevitable result will be that
many airlines and passengers will choose to fly not to or through London,
but to our European competitors,' he warned.
BAA would like to see the public inquiry into the building of the new
terminal brought forward. This is expected to start at the end of next year.
Sir John also announced plans for a new Pounds 20m flight-connection centre
at Heathrow designed to make it easier for passengers to change aircraft and
terminals by providing smooth connections between flights and streamlined
check-in, security and immigration.
The centre will be built between Terminals 1 and 2 and will include a range
of shopping and eating facilities as well as a fitness centre, beauty
clinic, business facilities and a video games centre.
The Pounds 20m facility is expected to open in October 1994.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Lending higher than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER borrowing was higher than expected in April, and pointed towards a
gently recovering economy.
The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that net lending to
consumers was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 194m in April. This follows a
revised Pounds 196m for March.
The figure points towards steady consumer confidence.
The seasonally adjusted figures - which do not include mortgages and account
for about 15 per cent of total private-sector debt - also show that new
credit advanced to consumers in April totalled Pounds 4.42bn, down from
Pounds 4.74bn in March.
In the three months to April, new credit advanced rose to Pounds 13.57bn
from Pounds 12.63bn in the previous three months.
According to the CSO, the demand for credit was spread across a broad range
of credit options.
A small rise in net lending by finance houses was offset by lower net
lending on bank credit cards.
Consumers borrowed a net Pounds 65m on bank credit cards compared with
Pounds 84m in March. Net lending by finance houses rose to Pounds 129m,
compared with Pounds 117m in March. Building society loans excluding
mortgages were flat.
Consumers have borrowed more than they repaid in every month since August,
when they repaid a net Pounds 25m of debt. Since then, consumer credit has
shown modest strength.
In the latest three months, net lending to consumers rose to Pounds 444m,
the highest quarterly figure for two years. It compares with net lending of
Pounds 304m in the previous three-month period.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Airline dispute talks to continue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between British Airways management and white-collar members of the GMB
general union working at London's Gatwick airport were postponed yesterday
and are now due to continue today. The union has warned that travellers
might face another strike this week if talks on pay and conditions break
down.
A similar dispute with the TGWU transport union led to a 24-hour stoppage
last week and disruption of most of BA's flights from Gatwick and Heathrow.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Unions protest over Ford imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS protested to Ford, the car producer, yesterday over the import of
2,000 Fiestas from a plant in Spain, Diane Summers writes.
The AEEU engineering union said it was 'shocked' by the imports, which
followed the shedding of 4,000 Ford jobs in the UK last year. The TGWU
transport union said the company had 'let too many people go' at the plant
in Dagenham, London, at which Fiestas are made. The unions added that they
had been assured by the company that no cars would be imported.
Ford said yesterday it was importing the cars because the assembly line at
Dagenham was being updated. The work coincided with a projected increase in
demand for Fiestas this summer.
The company said: 'Even if we had twice as many workers at Dagenham they
could not make enough vehicles because of the equipment constraint.'
The Dagenham factory employs about 9,000 workers and produces 900 cars a
day.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Hard realities behind the worries of Britain's top managers:
Executives' fear of redundancy is growing even though the economy is
recovering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is not going to return, this side of the year 2000, to the sort of
job market conditions that professional and managerial people took for
granted in the 1980s, headhunter Mr Nigel Humphreys claims.
Mr Humphreys, managing director of Tyzack Accord, is trying to find an
explanation for the latest dive in confidence over job prospects among the
highest levels of British management.
About 100,000 people may have lost their jobs in the City of London alone
since the recession began and, by the end of last year, nearly 300,000
professional and managerial people were registered as out of work.
Now the worst is supposed to be over, with recession giving way to a slow
and hesitant recovery.
April saw the third consecutive fall in the number of jobless, while many
companies have started to sound more optimistic about business prospects for
the year ahead.
Yet, in the past few weeks, fears of redundancy have been rising again among
many top-rank corporate managers and other professionals, according to a
Mori survey published last week by the Financial Times. The survey reported
a sudden and marked loss in confidence over job security among social groups
A and B, which include solicitors, senior civil servants, business
executives, bank managers, middle managers and heads of local-government
departments.
Mr Humphreys, like many others in his profession, finds the most recent loss
of confidence initially puzzling, because the executive shake-out is largely
finished.
'There has been a quite definite surge in recruitment activity at management
level and it is not just people already in jobs moving to new ones.
Previously unemployed executives are again in work.'
The key to the puzzle may be what Mr Humphreys sees as an important change
in companies' attitudes, with businesses adapting to what he calls the 'new
normality'. New ground rules may mean that many of those managers still in
work have good cause to worry about their future.
Mr Humphreys adds: 'Managers in highly competitive markets will need skills
and abilities different from those which sufficed in the boom years of the
1980s. If they cannot adapt, they will not easily fit in.
'It is no good believing that when companies, this time, emerge from
recession, they will explode like corks out of a champagne bottle. There is
going to be a great deal of care and caution when hiring - and retaining -
at all levels.' Neither are managers likely to be required in the same
numbers. A survey by Reed Personnel Services suggests that managers will be
in least demand as business conditions improve, thanks to fundamental
corporate restructuring already undertaken. The outlook is for a surplus of
middle and senior managers over the next five years.
'An awful lot of job losses are simply not directly linked to the
recession', says Mr Paul Charlesworth, development director of Coutts Career
Consultants. 'There has been plenty of de-layering and restructuring,
leaving behind a core of people who are promised continuing job security but
who do not necessarily believe it.'
Companies, he reports, are also increasingly moving towards a pattern of
short-term, interim management for filling posts. The tendency to contract
out important elements of the business also raises the prospect of fewer
internal jobs.
Prospects in the public sector are unlikely to inspire much confidence, with
local authorities, health authorities and the armed services all undergoing
restructuring that involves job shedding at the highest levels.
'When you see surgeons seeking outplacement services, you appreciate the
extent of the revolution under way,' Mr Charlesworth says.
The government's enthusiasm for market-testing many of its core functions
provides another cause for uncertainty.
Mr Charlesworth adds: 'There is no longer any such thing as a job for life.
People will have to be more mobile and employers may take a more cavalier
attitude to staff, becoming less reluctant to offload them.'
However, some outplacement specialists believe that the new wave of
pessimism may be overdone. Mr Ian Bell, a senior consultant at Sanders &amp;
Sidney, the outplacement consultancy, says: 'It would be misleading to say
employment prospects for higher and middle management are improving. The
situation has without doubt stabilised after one hell of a shake-out,
although a general nervousness and uncertainty remains.'
Mr Peter Trigg, managing director of Drake Beam Morrin, another outplacement
specialist, believes the immediate jobs outlook for managers has
significantly improved in recent months.
DBM has some good news for executives searching for jobs. A survey of its
own clients showed that most found another suitable post within seven
months.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Slash public spending, urges IoD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC RECOVERY could be crushed unless the government acts urgently to
eliminate up to Pounds 30bn of public sector debt, the Institute of
Directors said yesterday.
Calling for a 'revolutionary approach' to government spending, Mr Peter
Morgan, the institute's director-general, said the Pounds 50bn deficit was
so huge that 'no tax increases of acceptable proportions could come near to
dealing with it'.
He told Sussex businessmen that the scale and rate of growth of public
spending constituted the economy's most serious problem.
'If the chancellor allows the government to continue to spend around half of
the national income, and increases the tax burden to pay for it, then
enterprise, the process of wealth creation and economic growth will be
crushed,' he added.
He emphasised that raising taxes to cut the budget deficit would 'simply
guarantee that the ratchet of public expenditure would continue its upward
thrust'.
Mr Morgan claimed that Britain had been living beyond its means for years, a
fact disguised only by the proceeds of privatisation and the high level of
tax receipts during the 1980s.
Without reform, the welfare state would increasingly fail to meet the
demands and expectations that had been fostered by four decades of digging
more deeply into the public purse.
He urged the government to conduct a fundamental review of the public
service, encompassing its purpose, efficiency and staffing levels.
'Since the middle class at present both pay (for) and benefit from the
welfare state, any changes the government makes will affect them directly.
'It will be essential to win their support and convince them that their
interests will be better serviced by making personal provision and
exercising individual choice - and this means not increasing their taxes,'
Mr Morgan added.
He said the IoD would press the new chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, to
encourage those capable of making private provision by allowing tax relief
on the cost of premiums and fees for welfare and health.
The belief that the recovery may be slowing down has been fuelled by the
first fall for a year in the Central Statistical Office's longer leading
index, which tracks the economy.
The index, which highlights turning points in economic activity about 11
months in advance, fell from 109.3 in March to 108.9 in April after several
months of upward movements. That confirms other indications that any upturn
is likely to be patchy.

<TEXT>
CARMEN Electronics, the South Korean car radio manufacturer, is to create
257 jobs at a new factory in Northern Ireland.
The company said yesterday that it was investing Pounds 9.5m at a site being
developed by the Industrial Development Board at Dungannon, Co Tyrone, an
unemployment blackspot.
Carmen, whose equipment is sold in the UK under the Goodmans name, will be
making car stereos at the plant and expects to complete its local
recruitment by 1996.
The IDB said it had secured the project in the face of stiff competition
from several other European countries.
Mr Robert Atkins, Ulster's economy minister, said the investment would
create significant employment and skills opportunities in the area. He said
Carmen had been attracted to Dungannon partly because of the successful
power-sharing arrangement on the local authority.
Unionist and Nationalist councillors introduced a power-sharing arrangement
several years ago whereby the mayor's post is rotated every six months.
Mr KH Choy, Carmen's president, said the company had decided to locate to
Northern Ireland because the province provided a cost-effective base to
expand into the European Community and develop sales in eastern Europe. 'We
selected Northern Ireland as our European manufacturing centre because it
provides an ideal springboard from which to expand our already substantial
field base throughout the EC,' he said.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Bid to buy out Midlands airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT and employees yesterday submitted a bid to buy East Midlands
International Airport at Castle Donington, Leicestershire.
There are now four bidders for the airport, whose future ownership has been
in doubt since Derbyshire County Council signalled it would dispose of its
44 per cent stake in early 1991.
KPMG Peat Marwick, accountants, whose Nottingham office is handling the
sale, refused to namethe other bidders. But Regional Airports has publicly
disclosed its interest and it is thought that Lockheed, the US group, and
National Express, the UK coach company, may have made bids.
The value of the airport is not clear. Land surplus to future operational
requirements has been transferred to a separate company and is not included
in the sale. But when the Derbyshire County Council first indicated it would
sell its stake, the value placed on it was up to Pounds 15m.
The other equity owners are Nottinghamshire County Council, with 33 per
cent, and Nottingham City Council and Leicestershire County Council with 11
per cent each.
Once Derbyshire had indicated its desire to sell, a series of consultants'
reports was commissioned by the owners, leading to a formal decision to
place the airport on the market. The deadline for bids was yesterday. Mr
Chris Gilliatt of Peat Marwick said he had told the bidders a decision would
be made on the successful offer by the end of the month.
The local authorities' decision to sell the airport reflects an assessment
that investment will soon be needed to cope with the expected increase in
passenger traffic, and a realisation that duty-free shopping may decline as
a contribution to revenue as European Community economies become more
closely integrated.
The airport's capacity is 2m passengers a year. In the year to last March it
handled 1.26m people, an increase of 9 per cent over 1991-92. Although the
airport is the base of British Midland Airways, the greater part of its
passenger traffic comes from charter operations.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Thefts cost life company Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INVESTMENTS salesman was jailed for three years yesterday for a fraud
that cost his employers about Pounds 1m.
Mr Douglas Peet, who earned Pounds 70,000 a year with Confederation Life
Assurance Company, admitted 25 theft charges totalling Pounds 350,000.
His downfall came when he started using some clients' money to pay off
others whose investments were not as profitable as he had promised, Swansea
Crown Court heard. Mr Peet of Bryncoch, Neath, West Glamorgan, then began
taking money for himself.
By secretly juggling accounts, the salesman paid out about Pounds 250,000 -
but Pounds 100,000 remains unaccounted for and has not been traced.
Mr John Rogers QC, defending, said: 'He stole from one client to pay
another. In 1987 when the stock market crashed matters were compounded. He
found investments he made were worth much less than he had anticipated.'
Sentencing, Judge David Williams told Mr Peet: 'You put clients' investments
in jeopardy and Confederation Life has been put to considerable outlay to
make matters good - in the region of Pounds 1m.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Critics round on English tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL curriculum test papers in English reading and writing for
14-year-olds, published by the Department for Education yesterday, received
a critical reaction from teachers and educationalists.
Ms Ann Barnes, of the National Association for the Teaching of English,
said: 'They do not provide opportunities for the most able pupils to show
what they can do, and they do not provide any opportunities for any sort of
proper reflection on the passage they are asked to read and I think they
probably present very specific hurdles for the lesser pupils.'
Three tests were available, aimed at pupils of differing abilities. Most
children were entered for tier 5-7, aimed at those of average ability, while
about one third were put in for the lower tier and 4 per cent for the higher
tier.
The middle-ability tests offered 15 marks for questions on a passage about a
voyage around the coast of Britain, and then 10 marks each for summarising a
job description for flight attendants, filling in gaps in a passage using
multiple choice options, and paraphrasing the transcript of an interview.
Pupils were then required to write a letter of 120-150 words, requesting
information for a school project.
The National Union of Teachers described the lower-tier tests as 'demeaning'
because they were printed in a larger typeface. It also objected to a
multiple-choice section, saying that all the options offered could in some
cases be technically correct.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, predicted that 'most people will look
at the papers and wonder what all the the fuss was about and wonder why
their children have not been asked to take them'.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Brewers criticised for weakening beers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL brewers came under fire yesterday for reducing the alcoholic
strength of many of their beer brands to ease the impact of a new duty
system.
Of the five national brewers, only Whitbread does not intend to make any
changes to its beer strengths. The tax effects on its portfolio would be
roughly neutral, it said.
The Brewers' Society said the new system - which replaces the 113-year-old
method of charging duty at the pre-fermentation stage with a tax on the
alcoholic strength of the finished product - would increase overall duty by
Pounds 64m a year, or 3 per cent.
Customs and Excise insisted that the new system would not raise the overall
revenue burden on the industry. Officials are examining the Brewers' Society
calculations and said that any necessary adjustments would be made in the
next Budget.
Bass, the country's leading brewer, which estimates that the changes will
increase taxes on its beers by more than Pounds 20m a year, is to reduce the
alcohol by volume (abv) percentage of many of its brands.
Though the abv of its leading lager brands, Carling Black Label and
Tennent's, will not be altered, Tennent's Pilsner will be reduced from 3.8
per cent to 3.4 per cent. Worthington bitter and Stone's bitter will also be
reduced.
The original gravity of most of the affected brands will be raised to
preserve taste and flavour, the company said.
Courage is reducing the alcohol content of nine of its brands, including
Webster's Yorkshire bitter, Holsten Export and Pils, and Hofmeister. Its
best-selling bitters, John Smith's, Courage Best and Directors', are not
being changed. 'The changes have been made in an effort to minimise the need
to pass on the extra cost to our trade customers and ultimately the
consumer,' the company said.
Carlsberg-Tetley intends to make reductions in the abv of Skol and only two
other beers among its 80 brands.
Consumer groups attacked the moves, which come at a time when beer prices
are again being raised above the rate of inflation.
Bass has announced its wholesale beer prices will be increased by an average
Pounds 6.62 for a 36-gallon barrel, a rise of 3.58 per cent.
Carlsberg-Tetley is expected to increase prices by an average 3 per cent.
Mr Andy Sangster, research officer for the Campaign for Real Ale, condemned
the reduction in the strengths of some beer brands as a cover for higher
prices. He said: 'Ford does not alter the specifications of its cars when
taxes go up, and we see no reason why brewers should start fiddling the
strength of their beers. It shows a lack of respect for their products.'
Ms Ruth Evans, director of the National Consumer Council, said: 'If brewers
are cutting the alcohol content of their beers, they should be advertising
this fact widely, not trying to slip weaker beer past their customers
without telling them. We are not against weaker beers in principle - but
consumers who prefer the stronger variety will feel that they are being
charged the same price as before, for less.'
National brewers had been expected to bear a relatively higher burden of
duty after the introduction of the new system on June 1 because of the
higher-strength lagers and ales in their portfolios.
Though the new scheme was planned to raise the same amount of revenue from
the industry, it was clear from the outset that these beers would attract
more duty and others would be less heavily taxed.
The national brewers are also suffering the loss of benefits they have drawn
in recent years from the old system which gave a 6 per cent duty-free
production allowance for wastage. Wastage in many of the larger brewery
operations is less than 2 per cent because of improvements in brewing
technology and efficiency.
Complaints from smaller brewers about the advantages the old system gave the
nationals were among the reasons for the change.
But the switch to end-product duty was also encouraged by the creation of
the European single market. Other EC countries charge duty on the finished
product.
Customs and Excise officials say that they have held close consultations
with the Brewers' Society throughout the planning of the new system. 'The
society was informed of the approximate figure for the new rate in June
1992, and it was confirmed in early March this year,' the department said.
'The society did not challenge the rate until some three weeks ago and did
not produce any data to support its challenge until May 28.'
Brewers reply that it was only in the past few weeks that they have been
able to calculate the full impact of the changes.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Lloyd's plan may win extra Pounds 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London could attract up to Pounds 500m in fresh 'incorporated'
capital by the beginning of next year, according to an official working on a
rulebook for corporate investors at the insurance market.
At the end of April Lloyd's announced that it was seeking to attract new
corporate investment to compensate for the recent fall in the number of
Names, the individuals whose assets traditionally provided the market's
capital base.
A draft of the rulebook, which sets out the legal, accounting, regulatory
and tax implications for 'incorporated Names', should be sent to Lloyd's
agencies by the end of this month, with a definitive version set to be
completed by mid-summer.
'It's a tough timetable,' said the official, who added that the need to
obtain the approval of the tax authorities could delay matters.
Lloyd's has already decided to modify its scheme to auction capacity for
incorporated Names, which was part of its business plan published last
April. In a letter to market practitioners last week Mr David Rowland,
chairman, said it was 'inappropriate' to continue with these plans, although
the market's governing council would continue to monitor demand carefully.
Mr Rowland said he was also proposing to offer 'pre-emption' rights to Names
wishing to increase their capacity at some future stage. Lloyd's now expects
most of the incorporated to come from institutions and investment funds,
rather than from existing Names choosing to form new limited liability
companies.
Failure to finalise the rules would lead agencies to make greater use of
reinsurance and consortium arrangements (in which outside insurance
companies support syndicates).
In a separate development, Lloyd's said yesterday that it is to hold an
extraordinary general meeting on July 5 following requests from two groups
of Names. Names will be asked to vote on three motions.
The first and second motions were submitted by supporters of Mr Claud
Gurney, a Lloyd's Name critical of the market's administrators. The motions
say that Lloyd's owes a fiduciary duty of care to its members and call on
Lloyd's to insist that new corporate Names compensate existing Names for
past losses in return for a share of the assets and goodwill of the
Corporation.
The third motion is understood to be linked to the Association of Lloyd's
Members, the biggest organisation of Lloyd's Names. It expresses support for
the Lloyd's council and its recent business plan.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Why Belfast-style precautions may be adopted in City:
Richard Evans on a local authority's rapid response to the threat of bombs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS and the business community have given a largely favourable response
to a proposal by the Corporation of London - the local authority for the
City - to bar non-essential traffic from the core of the City as an
anti-terrorist measure.
The plan, the most radical element in a security package now being drafted,
is still at the blueprint stage and will be subject to public consultation
later this month. If accepted, it could be in operation by the end of the
year.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy and resources
committee, said yesterday that two large terrorist bombs in 14 months had
not undermined the City as Europe's leading financial centre. But companies
had to be reassured.
'Pedestrianisation would help security significantly in that it would
restrict vehicle access to key areas. We take the threat of terrorism
seriously, and we have a clear message from a group of foreign banks that if
we did not act, the consequences could be severe,' Mr Cassidy said.
Corporation officials led by Sir Francis McWilliams, the Lord Mayor, have
held meetings with more than 400 City institutions and companies to discuss
improved security.
Most have supported a vehicle ban, although some have argued it would create
too much disruption and would give too great a propaganda coup to the IRA.
Mr Cassidy argued that, as more than 90 per cent of City workers commuted by
train and walked to offices, there was a lot of support for a car ban,
provided that public transport could be improved.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, has given
pedestrianisation qualified backing, provided access for vehicles could be
maintained for normal business purposes.
The restrictions planned by the corporation are likely to apply only to a
few hundred square yards at the heart of the City, covering the area around
the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange, Mansion House and the NatWest
Tower, although some bankers want them to cover the whole of the square
mile. Access would be limited to buses, taxis and a few specially licensed
vehicles, but temporary licences could be granted for anyone giving a good
reason for driving through the City. Any vehicles without a licence would be
stopped at one of about six check points.
The corporation began its detailed examination of security after the
Bishopsgate bomb in April, which was placed in an abandoned tipper truck. A
year ago 100lbs of explosives packed into a car wrecked the Baltic Exchange.
Both bombs caused millions of pounds of damage.
Anti-terrorist measures already in hand are the removal of all litter bins
in the City until they can be made bombproof, the recruitment of 57 extra
police to step up patrols, and an increase in the number of police
surveillance cameras.
However, it is the prospect of a City traffic ban that is certain to create
the most controversy, particularly in surrounding areas that may have to
cope with increased traffic congestion.
The Association of London Authorities said it was concerned at the impact a
traffic ban in the City would have on other parts of London, particularly
neighbouring boroughs such as Camden, Islington, Tower Hamlets and Hackney.
'It needs to be done on a London-wide basis and after consultation,' an ALA
official said.
Mr Cassidy said there would be widespread consultation before any scheme was
introduced, and details were being fed into computers over the next week to
see what the traffic impact might be on surrounding areas.
Tighter security measures of the type being considered by the corporation
have been applied for years in Belfast, but in the past year three big bombs
have struck the Ulster capital's business centre.
However, London's position as a major international financial centre is
putting heavy pressure on the authorities and police to devise a policy
based on deterrence a deterrent rather than containment. A third big bomb
attack could make some foreign companies think about relocating elsewhere in
Europe.

FT  08 JUN 93 / TV advert joint ventures explored
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Television is talking to Granada Television and Meridian
Broadcasting, the new south of England ITV company, about possible joint
ventures in television airtime sales.
TVMM, the Scottish company's joint venture with HTV, the ITV company for
Wales and the West, also sells advertising for its northern neighbour
Grampian Television and for Westcountry.
Granada is also talking to Meridian, which decided to sell its own airtime
when it began broadcasting in January rather than join an existing sales
house.
A Granada link with TVMM or Meridian would take both up to a 25 per cent
share of ITV advertising - the maximum allowed under existing legislation.
It would also create a powerful sales force which could command television
advertising sales of about Pounds 400m a year.
The talks are taking place against growing tension in the commercial
television industry. Last month London Weekend Television paid Pounds 14m
for a 14 per cent stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television.
The deal was accompanied by a five-year advertising sales contract under
which LWT will receive a fixed annual fee plus commission for selling the
Yorkshire group's advertising.
Granada was interested in the Yorkshire stake and was upset to be pipped to
the deal.
Mr Tim Wootton, managing director of TSMS, the largest sales house, pointed
out last night that in 1989 there were 14 separate sales points for ITV
advertising. There are now seven.

FT  08 JUN 93 / DTI investigates pub-lease rents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is investigating complaints about the
pub-leasing scheme operated by Inntrepreneur, the joint venture between
Grand Metropolitan and Courage.
Many licensees have protested that increased rents charged under the 20-year
Inntrepreneur leases are forcing them out of business.
The DTI said yesterday that details of the complaints - taken up by MPs and
ministers - were being examined. It promised 'substantive' replies as soon
as possible.
The move was welcomed by Mrs Tricia Boyes, organiser of the National
Association of Inntrepreneur Lessees, which was set up to fight the rent
increases being imposed in the conversion of old tenancy agreements.
Licensees began their campaign against the terms of the leases by picketing
GrandMet's annual meeting in February, and later took their protests to the
Commons agriculture committee.
GrandMet began to introduce the long-term leases into its pub estate in
1988, and has since been extending them into Inntrepreneur's 6,800 pubs.
More than 70 per cent of landlords have signed new agreements, according to
the company, but the failure rate of the joint venture pubs has been about 9
per cent a year.
GrandMet announced a change of policy last month, indicating that some
hard-pressed tenants would now be offered three-year leases.
Inntrepreneur's bankers, it said, had dropped their original requirement
that 90 per cent of the estate should be converted to 20-year leases by next
March.
GrandMet and Courage shared operating losses of Pounds 12m on the joint
venture in the six months to March.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Insurers warn of coastal property risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY owners in some coastal areas could find it more difficult to obtain
insurance following the landslip near the Holbeck Hall Hotel at Scarborough
at the weekend, insurers claimed yesterday.
A spokesman for Cigna, the US company which insures Holbeck Hall, said:
'This will definitely make it harder for some people to get insurance. A
slip of this magnitude is bound to make people think.'
Sections of the four-star North Yorkshire hotel toppled into Scarborough's
South Bay after the landslip, leaving the building - in insurance jargon -
'a constructive total loss'.
Holbeck Hall was insured for Pounds 3m and Cigna, which as lead insurer
covers 60 per cent of the risk, stands to pay Pounds 1.8m (before collecting
on its own reinsurances).
Cigna said it would be looking closely at its other exposures in clifftop
areas over the next few weeks and expected other insurers to be doing the
same.
The company stressed, however, that it is not active in the UK homeowner
market, simply insuring commercial properties.
Cigna said it had insured Holbeck Hall for the last four years, but when it
last carried out a survey the property was 300 yards from the sea and was
not regarded as a particularly serious risk and carried no extra premium.
'It hadn't rung the alarm bells it should have done. It was a property we
were happy to have on the books,' said Cigna, which renewed the hotel's
annual policy in November last year.
'You wouldn't expect something of that magnitude to happen,' according to
the company. Cigna has two investigators on the scene in Scarborough.
At present insurers apply no special rules for covering clifftop properties,
tending to treat them in much the same way as those which might be
vulnerable to subsidence damage.
Cover would be dependent on a survey and an engineer's report, with rating
varying according to the degree of risk.

FT  08 JUN 93 / English tests gain mixed reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL curriculum test papers in English reading and writing for
14-year-olds, published by the Department for Education yesterday, received
a mixed reaction from teachers and educationalists.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, predicted that 'most people will
look at the papers and wonder what all the the fuss was about and wonder why
their children have not been asked to take them'.
However, Ms Ann Barnes of the National Association for the Teaching of
English criticised the tests. She said: 'They are very narrow in their
approach. They do not provide opportunities for the most able pupils to show
what they can do, and they do not provide any opportunities for any sort of
proper reflection on the passage they are asked to read and I think they
probably present very specific hurdles for the lesser pupils.'
She added that the tests in literature, including Shakespeare and a
prescribed anthology, had aroused much more controversy. They are due to be
published tomorrow.
Three tests were available, aimed at pupils of differing abilities. Most
children were entered by their teachers for tier 5-7, aimed at 14-year-olds
of average ability, while about one third were put in for the lower tier and
4 per cent for the higher tier.
The middle-ability tests offered 15 marks for questions on a passage about a
voyage around the coast of Britain, and then 10 marks each for summarising a
job description for flight attendants, filling in gaps in a passage using
multiple choice options, and paraphrasing the transcript of an interview.
Pupils were then required to write a letter of 120-150 words, requesting
information for a school project.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Boycott by teachers holds firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS' unions in England and Wales yesterday thwarted any chance of
drawing useful conclusions from this year's national curriculum tests in
English reading and writing.
Their boycott of the test, the first of six papers due to be taken by 14
year-olds over the next two weeks - with another two papers in Welsh for
children in Wales - appeared to have been almost totally successful, with
only a handful of exceptions across the country.
In the Conservative-controlled London borough of Wandsworth, where schools
were offered extra staff to invigilate the tests, preparation had been so
inadequate that only one school actually asked its pupils to sit them. The
council said that more schools would implement tests in other subjects,
which require less specialised preparation.
Neighbouring Westminster reported that none of its eight secondary schools
had implemented the tests, despite well-publicised threats to dock teachers'
pay if they went through with the boycott.
City Technology Colleges, such as Hatcham CTC in New Cross, south London,
which are directly funded by the government, provided the only broad
exceptions to the norm. They reported that their pupils had done the tests
as planned.
In Buckinghamshire only one school, Leon comprehensive in Milton Keynes,
attempted to implement the tests. However, the test papers were delivered
hours late, causing what the headteacher described as 'serious
inconvenience'.
Elsewhere some schools used the tests but do not intend to publish the
results, except to parents, pupils and staff.
Audenshaw High in Manchester, a grant-maintained school, was one of the few
known to be carrying them out. Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield
all reported that none of their schools had implemented the tests.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers which was the first union to boycott
the tests, described the boycott as '99.9 per cent effective'. He listed 18
counties where no schools had carried out tests, although he admitted that
some had been done in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Lincolnshire,
Northamptonshire, Stockport and Surrey.
The National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers
also claimed success for their industrial action.
The National Association for the Teaching of English said there was no need
for pupils to take the tests 'if the intention was only to find out how
deeply flawed they are', and said that schools had spent Pounds 3.75 per
pupil in trying to implement them.
But the Campaign for Real Education launched a spirited defence, persuading
128 MPs, educationalists and industrialists to sign an advertisement calling
for children to be tested. Signatories included Lord Hanson, Sir Simon
Hornby, chairman of WH Smith, and Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons.
The Department for Education said: 'We firmly believe that there will be
more schools doing the test than are indicating they will. Those children
who do not take these tests today will have been denied the benefits of a
test for which they have worked for three years, and that can only be sad
for the children.'

total could have fallen to three.
At the end of this year the Independent Television Commission is expected to
review the 25 per cent rule. There will be lobbying to get the rule changed
so that the 25 per cent limit is in effect increased by applying it to all
television advertising including breakfast, Channel 4 and satellite
television.

<TEXT>
THE THAI government has formed a high-level committee, headed by deputy
prime minister Amnuay Viranvan, to try to settle a dispute over the contract
terms of an almost completed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m) elevated motorway,
writes William Barnes in Bangkok.
The second stage of a toll road running through Bangkok remains closed
despite government demands that it open immediately because of 'a national
crisis' in the city's traffic system.
Bangkok Expressway - the consortium, led by Kumagai Gumi, which is building
the road - says it will open the road toll-free for 90 days if the
government agrees to settle the dispute within that time. It insists it will
terminate the contract if there is no agreement by then.
The state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority responsible for the
project has now effectively been cut out of negotiations and its governor
has offered to resign.
Meanwhile, Japan's Obayashi group has pulled out of building Bangkok's third
stage expressway.

FT  08 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US Nafta plan draws fire - Administration
warned over side agreements on labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLINTON administration proposals designed to attract labour support for the
North American Free Trade Agreement are instead drawing Republican and
Democratic fire and a Mexican refusal to cede sovereignty over labour
rights.
House Republicans told Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, they would
oppose Nafta if he negotiated strong side agreements on labour and the
environment. They object to the setting up of tri-national bodies with power
to investigate abuses and recommend trade sanctions as a last resort.
The Republicans accuse the administration of having lost the 'vision' of a
pact which would boost trade and investment, and warn that the side
agreements would channel 'disproportional resources' into the creation of
multilateral environmental and labour bureaucracies 'with little
accountability and sweeping mandates'.
Last week several Democrat groups, members of the Alliance for Responsible
Trade, listed objections to the US proposals as they apply to labour. The
proposed standard allowing national enforcement of federal laws, they said,
would not prevent a government lowering the standards of its laws to avoid
being challenged for non-enforcement.
The alliance wants an independent secretariat, perhaps with members from
non-Nafta countries, overseeing labour complaints. Unlike the
administration's proposal, it would accept complaints from citizen groups,
rather than having to get government to bring a case.
The administration's proposal that a 2/3 vote be required before a complaint
is submitted to a panel 'certainly ensures that the panels will never be
used. . .' the alliance said.
But a Mexican official said: 'An independent commission with enforcement
powers will never be acceptable to us.' He said labour was making impossible
demands in an attempt 'to scuttle the whole thing'.
However, Dr Robert Cohen, a fellow at the Washington-based Economic Strategy
Institute who has close ties to labour, insists that some unions would
support Nafta if the side agreements were clearer. 'They don't have to give
labour absolutely everything that's been raised,' he said. 'But if there was
attention paid to them, they could win some formidable support.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Guangdong set to put fire in 'little
dragon' - Simon Holberton on province's growth in electricity capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE Deng Xiaoping, China's pre-eminent leader, visited Guangdong 17 months
ago the Communist party leadership of the province that borders Hong Kong
has set itself the task of catching up with Asia's 'four little dragons' -
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea - in 20 years.
To do that, Guangdong will need a great deal more electric power: even
today, demand exceeds supply by at least 30 per cent and blackouts are a
feature of daily life.
The growth in installed electrical generation capacity in Guangdong has been
rapid. In 1981, the province had just 2,800MW of installed capacity; by the
end of 1992 it was 11,000MW.
Over the next 17 years the province hopes to increase capacity by a further
69,000MW to 80,000MW. By then it may have achieved installed capacity of 1KW
hour per person, up from its current installed capacity of 0.16KW per
person. Hong Kong has installed capacity per person of 1.42KW, Taiwan
0.85KW, and the US about 2.8KW.
Guangdong's spending on power plants has grown from USDollars 679m (Pounds
441m) in 1989 to Dollars 795m in 1991. Within that total, the share of
imports has risen from Dollars 220m in 1989 to Dollars 430m in 1991. Larger
expenditures are expected in the coming years, making the market for
electrical generation equipment, transmission lines and computer systems to
operate modern power plants one of the biggest in the world.
Western analysts in Guangzhou estimate the province's expenditure on power
generation and related equipment will grow at an annual rate of nearly 40
per cent over the three years 1992-1995, and imports by more than 50 per
cent.
Mr Michael Greene, a securities analyst with Warburg Securities in Hong
Kong, says: 'The place is crawling with people trying to sell them
electrical generation equipment. China has got to be the world's largest
market for power generation equipment . . . ever.'
Unlike many markets in China for imports, restrictive trade barriers for
power generation equipment are few. China's domestic manufacturers, located
mainly in the north-east of the country, are unable to supply Guangdong,
making it dependent on foreign suppliers.
The province has the autonomy to use foreign exchange for imports of power
equipment. According to one analyst in Guangdong: 'Because of Guangdong's
urgent need to import large amounts of electrical generating equipment,
import procedures are not a serious impediment.'
Neither is ownership. Although electricity generation is technically a state
monopoly in Guangdong, the local government has been prepared to allow
significant foreign ownership of power plants. Shajiao B power station in
Dongguan is owned and operated by Hopewell, a Hong Kong property company,
and the Zhujiang power station, under construction in Guangzhou, is 50 per
cent owned by New World Development, another Hong Kong property developer.
The province has also entered into inter-regional agreements with
neighbouring provinces to develop hydro-electric power. For example, it has
joined with Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan to develop hydro-electric
facilities on rivers running through their territory.
Guangdong also has plans to increase the amount of electricity generated by
nuclear power, on current plans more than 20,000MW by 2010.
Mr Chen Wen Hu, deputy chief of section in the planning department of
Guangdong's Electric Power Bureau, says: 'By 1995 Daya Bay should be
producing 1,800MW, but 70 per cent will go to Hong Kong and only 600MW to
Guangdong. We have hopes to build three more nuclear power plants. We have
finished the preparatory work for the second nuclear plant and in 2000 the
first phase - 1,000MW - should begin.'
This would still leave nuclear fuels producing less than 30 per cent of the
province's needs by 2010. From now until then, the local authorities have
thermal power stations planned, or under construction, which will add more
than 50,000MW of installed capacity to Guangdong's grid.
However, the quality of coal received from northern China and the time it
takes to reach power stations are problems.

FT  08 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Russia stalls over EC partnership pact

RUSSIA is refusing to sign a partnership agreement with the European
Community over the western satellite market as it wants better access to
other EC markets, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for trade, announced yesterday that he and
the Russian government had clinched an agreement allowing Russia to conduct
12 commercial satellite launches between 1995 and the year 2000. He said,
however, that a partnership and co-operation agreement would not be
initialled as expected during President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with EC
leaders in Copenhagen later this month.
'The progress that remains to complete that task is still substantial,' Sir
Leon said, citing as examples artificially low domestic energy prices and
the fact that Russian enterprises did not know what their costs were.
The deal offered by the EC provides for regular political dialogue between
the Community and the Russian leadership, provisions for inward investment,
and most favoured nation status with regard to services, including finance,
computer technology, and telecommunications. Existing curbs on Russian
imports include quantitative restrictions on textiles and steel.
As part of its attempt to re-join the international trading community,
Russia has decided to apply for membership of Gatt, the free trade group
whose secretary-general, Mr Arthur Dunkel, is due to visit Moscow this week.
Denmark, which holds the presidency of the EC, hoped an EC-Russia deal could
be initialled by President Boris Yeltsin at the Copenhagen summit in two
weeks, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels.
But the Commission believes it would be unwise to rush into an agreement for
political reasons before important problems of substance have been resolved.

<TEXT>
THE THAI government has formed a high-level committee, headed by deputy
prime minister Amnuay Viranvan, to try to settle a dispute over the contract
terms of an almost completed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m) elevated motorway.
The second stage of a toll road running through Bangkok remains closed
despite government demands that it open immediately because of 'a national
crisis' in the city's traffic system.
Bangkok Expressway, the consortium building the road, says it will open the
road toll free for 90 days if the government agrees to settle its dispute
within that time. It insists it will terminate the contract if there is no
agreement by then.
The state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority responsible for the
project has now effectively been cut out of negotiations and its governor
has offered to resign.
Bangkok Expressway, led by the Japanese company Kumagai Gumi, has complained
that the government has reneged on contract terms by cutting the toll by a
third, not allowing the consortium to operate the road for the agreed 30
years, and disputing revenue sharing arrangements.
Last week Mr Tarrin Nimmanhaiminda, minister of finance, assured
representatives of 31 international and 11 Thai banks that they 'won't
suffer'. But a banker said it was worrying that even at this late stage the
government had not addressed complaints head on. The lenders, which have
committed the equivalent of Bt20bn (Pounds 517m), suspended loan
disbursements to BECL in March.
Meanwhile, Japan's Obayashi group has pulled out of building Bangkok's third
stage expressway. Bankers close to the company say it was disheartened by
frequent contract changes and the authorities' inability to agree on land
compensation or fix a route.

THE international recorded music market grew 9.3 per cent to Dollars 28.7bn
(Pounds 18.6bn) last year, according to figures released by the
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.
Compact disc unit sales rose 18 per cent to 1.15bn. While the cassette
market grew by only 2.8 per cent, tapes remained the most popular music
format with 1.55bn sold.
The cassette is a particularly popular format in eastern Europe. The number
of cassettes sold in Poland rose to 18m last year from 3m in 1991 while in
Russia, where the federation gathered data for the first time, 100m
cassettes were sold in 1992.
Despite the continued popularity of vinyl in South Korea and China,
worldwide sales of long-playing records fell 19.5 per cent to 130m.
Recorded music sales in the US showed the biggest growth last year with
sales climbing 14.9 per cent to Dollars 8.9bn. In the UK, sales fell 1.6 per
cent to just under Dollars 2bn.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Babbitt emerges as court front-runner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE secretary of the interior, Mr Bruce Babbitt, appears to have emerged as
President Bill Clinton's favourite candidate for the vacancy on the US
Supreme Court.
Several administration officials, confirming Mr Babbitt's status as
front-runner, were quoted yesterday as saying an announcement was imminent.
Mr Clinton said yesterday afternoon he was still 'working on' his selection.
The White House has been considering candidates since Justice Byron White
announced in March his intention to retire, and now needs to move speedily
to get the justice confirmed by the Senate before the summer recess.
Mr Clinton is the first Democratic president to be given the opportunity to
name a justice to the court since President Lyndon Johnson appointed the
late Mr Thurgood Marshall in 1967. Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, of whom
Mr Clinton had spoken favourably, withdrew his name from consideration
several weeks ago.
Mr Babbitt, a Harvard law school graduate, was Arizona's attorney-general
before serving 10 years as state governor from 1977-1987. He ran a
creditable campaign for the Democratic party's presidential nomination in
1988.
Nevertheless, his selection would raise some eyebrows in Washington, on the
grounds that the administration is in enough difficulty without the removal
of one of its most effective Cabinet members so early in Mr Clinton's term.
Mr Clinton's preference for the court is for someone politically adept and
middle-of-the-road, whom he knows personally and whose nomination would
present few problems. Mr Babbitt, having passed scrutiny by the Senate this
year for his present job, fits this bill, as would Mr Richard Riley, now the
secretary of education, and reported to have declined recently a
presidential approach to serve on the court.
Judicial appointments have been a minefield for the president, which is
ironical given that he and his wife are both lawyers. There were two botched
nominations for the attorney-general's position at the beginning of his term
and, last week, he withdrew the selection of Ms Lani Guinier to run the
Justice Department's civil rights division.
Although the federal bench, on which judges may sit for life, contains far
more Republican appointees than Democratic, there had appeared no shortage
of qualified candidates.
After the Guinier fiasco, Mr Clinton badly needs someone whose confirmation
would not be in doubt.
AP reports: Mr Mark Gearan, a veteran Democratic campaigner who managed
then-Senator Al Gore's successful vice-presidential campaign last year, was
yesterday expected to be named as White House communications director,
Now a deputy chief of staff, Mr Gearan would succeed Mr George
Stephanopoulos.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Mines owner set to be president: Unofficial results in
Bolivian poll give Sanchez de Lozada clear lead

<TEXT>
MR Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, a US-raised mine company owner, looks set to
be the new president of Bolivia, after the most peaceful elections in the
country's history, held on Sunday.
Unofficial results gave him a clear lead of almost 14 percentage points. His
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) won 35 per cent of the vote,
against 21.1 per cent for the ruling Patriotic Accord (AP) led by a former
military dictator, ex-General Hugo Banzer.
Claiming victory yesterday, Mr Sanchez said: 'The people have voted for
change.'
However, the final outcome will emerge from a secret vote by Congress on
August 6. Projections of the results of the congressional elections, also
held on Sunday but not to be confirmed for 20 days, gave Mr Sanchez's party
69 of the 79 seats required for a majority. He will need a deal with one of
the 12 smaller parties.
Despite administrative problems, which have delayed voting in some areas
until next Sunday, the election proceeded smoothly under the supervision of
a new and independent electoral court.
The results confounded pollsters, all of whom had predicted a very close
contest. Mr Jose Gramunt, head of FIDES, the Bolivian news service,
described it as 'the best possible outcome'. He attributed the success of Mr
Sanchez to disillusion with the government, as well as to his choice of Mr
Vctor Hugo Cardenas, an indigenous politician, as his vice-presidential
running-mate. This made a contrast with the European-descended minority,
which provides most of Bolivia's politicians, and attracted many rural
voters.
Mr Sanchez is well-respected abroad as the author of a stabilisation plan in
1985 which reduced inflation from more than 24,000 per cent a year to 15 per
cent.
Bolivia now has one of the lowest inflation rates in South America, at 9 per
cent, but is also the continent's poorest country and has considerable
fiscal and balance-of-payment problems.
Mr Sanchez being pledged to continue the country's free market policies and
austerity programme, his victory was welcomed by the business community.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the World Bank's executive board want to travel first class, in
spite of mounting criticism of the bank staff's lavish benefits, AP-DJ
writes from Washington.
The bank's board is poised to exempt itself from an air travel policy
designed to curb first-class bookings, which it adopted last year, bank
officials say.
The board also recently backed a proposal to spend Dollars 4.7m (Pounds 3m)
on a special air-conditioning system that would let directors smoke in their
offices once the bank had introduced a smoke-free policy.
With the World Bank's headquarters reconstruction project already Dollars
43m over budget, those close to the board say the special air-conditioner is
unlikely to win approval, but the travel exemption, due to be considered
next month, could.
Such action could cause a fiscal backlash in the US Congress, where members
are questioning spending by the World Bank and other institutions.
Senator Jesse Helms, ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, is delaying Senate confirmation of US alternate governors of the
World Bank and four other development banks, while waiting for an air travel
report from the US Treasury.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, has requested reports on travel
policies from the US executive directors at the institutions. The Treasury's
report, expected shortly, is likely to reveal some stark contrasts among the
various development banks, Clinton administration officials say.
A House of Representatives sub-committee has already trimmed by Dollars 200m
the administration's request for funding the US share of a capital
replenishment for the World Bank's concessional loan arm.
The sub-committee sent a stronger signal over its displeasure with the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for lavish spending.

MR Ramiro de Leon Carpio, Guatemala's new president, yesterday dismissed
General Jose Garca Samayoa, the powerful defence minister, and shook up the
military high command, Reuter reports from Guatemala City.
A day after taking office, Mr de Leon named as defence minister General
Roberto Perussina, known as a hard-liner, to succeed Gen Garca.
'I made the decision, not because he (Gen Garca) participated in a coup
d'etat but because of some confusing events that took place,' Mr de Leon
told a news conference.
Gen Garca helped engineer the ouster of President Jorge Serrano last week,
the president having dissolved Congress and the Supreme Court on May 25.
Then the general supported Vice-President Gustavo Espina as head of state.
Gen Garca said initially that Mr Espina had resigned, but later he changed
his story.
Mr Serrano was given asylum in Panama yesterday.

In contrast, Mr Riordan appeals to more affluent suburban voters. He made
one of his last campaign stops, over the weekend, in a San Fernando Valley
park where a two-year-old was shot to death during a gang-related incident
on Easter Sunday in April.
Mr Riordan - who says the top three campaign themes are 'safety, safety,
safety' - has pledged to put 3,000 more police officers on the streets with
a plan financed, in part, by leasing the city-owned Los Angeles
International Airport to a private group.
Mr Woo has won the endorsement of the Los Angeles Times, the city's leading
newspaper.
It said of him: 'In a city with a hundred different voices straining to be
heard - in a city with a lot of conflict and much too much bad feeling - he
is the better listener, and so the better conciliator. And in this
fragmented city, it is the better conciliator who'll get results.'

ARAB delegations edged closer yesterday to announcing their participation in
the tenth round of Middle East peace negotiations, in Washington on June 15.
But Mr Abdul-Salem al-Majali, Jordan's new prime minister, strongly denied
his country was close to signing a treaty with Israel.
Earlier, Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, had claimed the two
countries had essentially reached an accord. 'We just have to take out the
pen and sign,' he told Israel radio.
However, Mr Majali said that what was being worked on with Israel was an
agenda and the terms of reference for negotiations. 'It has substance, but
it is just an agenda, not a peace agreement', he said.
Radio reports that a peace treaty was ready to be signed were 'absolutely
and completely untrue,' he said.
A meeting of foreign ministers in Amman at the weekend had re-stated the
Arab commitment to the peace process but, at Palestinian insistence, stopped
short of formally accepting the joint US-Russian invitation to resume in
Washington on June 15.
The Palestinians are looking for firmer assurances that the US will become
more directly involved in the negotiations, and that Israel will take more
measures to ease conditions in the occupied territories.
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was due
in Amman last night for talks on these issues with King Hussein of Jordan.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Nasa streamlines US space station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE National Aeronautics and Space Administration yesterday concluded a
three-month effort to redesign the US space station at half the cost of the
original Freedom project.
A Nasa team was yesterday due to present three options with costs ranging
from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 9bn (Pounds 3.2bn to Pounds 5.8bn) to a White
House review panel. The panel will report to President Bill Clinton, who is
expected to make his final decision next week on which of the options to
select or whether to cancel the project.
The design team has looked for ways to incorporate into the space station
ready-made equipment from US companies or from the Russian space programme,
while at the same time placating the European and Canadian space agencies
who are supposed to be partners in the venture.
One option would be a type of floating power station, with living and
working quarters largely accommodated in the space shuttle which would hook
up to the station for periodic missions.
The most complete reworking of the design, and the cheapest, would involve a
92-foot cylinder which could be set in orbit in a single launch. It would,
however, shadow its own solar panels much of the time, so reducing the power
available for scientific work.
While a radically new design might offer the best prospects for cutting the
station's costs, it might also alienate traditional supporters in Congress,
who must vote the money for the project and who in many cases are committed
to the original design.
At the same time the space station could become a victim of the impasse over
Mr Clinton's budget plan. Conservative critics of the budget want to
increase spending cuts and raise taxes less, but more liberal congressmen
are fiercely opposed to deeper cuts in social programmes.
Sacrificing the space station could yield some compromise savings, though
not enough to offset the substantial reductions now being sought in Mr
Clinton's proposed energy tax, or in a Senate plan to postpone higher income
tax rates by six months to July 1.
Democratic leaders were to meet Mr Clinton yesterday afternoon on the budget
package, but predicted it would pass the Senate.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Kenyan economic outlook seems bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S economy grew by a meagre 0.4 per cent in 1992, its worst performance
since independence 30 years ago, according to official figures. Inflation
rose to 27.2 per cent from 19.6 per cent in 1991, and the country is now
over Dollars 500m in arrears to its foreign creditors.
The outlook for this year is bleak too. The rains have failed, and the
government will have to import food it can barely afford to avert famine.
The balance of payments crisis is expected to deepen. Since November 1991,
Kenya's donors have withheld about Dollars 400m (Pounds 260m) of aid
intended to shore up the country's external accounts because of alleged
corruption and mismanagement. Donors insist President Daniel arap Moi's
government establishes a track record of economic reform before another
donors' meeting at the end of the year. Meanwhile the balance of payments
deficit,after allowing for debt arrears, is expected by private sector
economists to reach Dollars 1bn.
Mounting arrears on Kenya's Dollars 7bn foreign debt may force the
government to seek a rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club of creditor
nations. Kenya prides itself in being one of the few African countries which
has not renegotiated its foreign obligations.
The accumulation of problems has led the government cap in hand to the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank. After a very public row in
March, in which Mr Moi reintroduced foreign exchange controls and lambasted
the Fund and the Bank for imposing 'suicidal' policies, the president
recanted.
Import licences have been scrapped, the Kenya shilling has been devalued and
the foreign exchange market freed again. Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance
minister, has promised to streamline the financial sector, which is weighed
down by insolvent banks with dubious ties to leading politicians in the
ruling Kanu party.
The central bank's efforts to prop up these 'political banks', as they are
known in Kenya, were responsible for the runaway money supply and rise in
inflation last year. Mr Mudavadi has promised to close the financial
loopholes that allowed these banks to operate, and conduct an external audit
of the worst offenders. The audit has yet to take place.
Economists outside government doubt whether Mr Mudavadi will be able to
deliver on his promises. 'Closing down insolvent banks strikes at the nerve
centre of corruption in the ruling Kanu party,' says Mr Robert Shaw, an
economic adviser to the opposition Ford-Kenya party. 'Mudavadi has good
intentions but he is surrounded by a very powerful mafia.'
The World Bank has, however, released Dollars 85m in withheld funds, and
will shortly disburse another Dollars 85m tied to export promotion.
Mr Shaw and Mr Peter Anyang, a Ford-Kenya member of parliament, yesterday
cast doubt on the government's economic figures. They believe the economy
contracted by between 1 and 4 per cent last year, and inflation was closer
to 40 per cent than 27 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE WORLD Health Organisation yesterday appealed for Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds
1.6bn) to be spent each year in developing countries for the prevention of
the transmission of HIV, the virus that causes Aids.
The organisation argued the programme could cut the number of new adult
infections during the rest of the decade in half - from nearly 20m to 10m.
'It would be an investment on which the returns could be huge,' said Dr
Michael Merson, director of WHO's global programme on Aids. 'WHO estimates
it could save nearly Dollars 90m in direct and indirect costs by the turn of
the century.'
He said the biggest increase over the last 12 months has been in Latin
America, south Asia, and south-east Asia. In each region there are at least
1.5m infections.
The growth of infection in south Asia and south-east Asia has been
explosive, said Dr Merson. In Thailand, for example, the number of infected
people has increased from little more than 50,000 in 1990 to 450,000 by late
last year.
The programme would prevent more than 4m infections in Africa, the same
number in Asia and about 1m in Latin America.
'The world can find this money if it wants to. It would hardly buy a single
can of Coke for every person in the world,' said Dr Merson. He argued that
funds could come not only from the first world but also developing nations.
'I appeal to world leaders to help mobilise resources from national budgets,
non-governmental organisations and the private sector. We can afford Aids
prevention. We cannot afford to neglect it,' he said.
The programme of basic measures would include the promotion and distribution
of condoms in the general population; the treatment of sexually transmitted
diseases because of their role in the spread of HIV; Aids information and
education; promotion of condoms among prostitutes and clients; maintenance
of a safe blood supply for transfusions; and needle-exchange programmes.
Meanwhile Dr Anthony Fauci of the US-based National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases said new data demonstrated the need for early
pharmaceutical intervention in HIV-positive patients who have not yet
developed symptoms.
There is now evidence the HIV virus remains highly active even during its
so-called latent phase, when it appears to have low concentrations in the
blood. During this phase the virus actually replicates extremely rapidly in
the lymph system, he said.
One possible route would provide medicines to support the immune system.
Such drugs could be used in combination with other treatments such as AZT,
Wellcome's treatment, he said.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Keidanren chief rejects optimism: Japanese economy still
weak, with depressed consumer and capital spending
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE economy is still weak after a prolonged downturn, Japan's most
powerful business leader warned yesterday. He was trying to counter mounting
optimism among politicians about the economic outlook.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the country's federation of
economic organisations, said consumer spending and capital expenditure were
still depressed. The downturn was deepening in provincial cities and
manufacturers were being hit by the yen's recent rapid appreciation.
His caution about the economy was echoed by a senior civil servant at the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry and Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank
of Japan's governor.
Mr Hiraiwa's comments are a mild rebuke for government ministers who have
been talking up prospects for the economy in the past few days. Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister, last week said he believed the downturn had
reached its trough, and Mr Hajime Funada, minister responsible for the
Economic Planning Agency, yesterday said the economy was bottoming out.
The debate over the economy comes at the start of a week in which several
closely watched economic reports will be published. On Thursday the EPA is
due to release its monthly report which has been widely trailed as
forecasting an imminent recovery. The following day sees the Bank of Japan's
quarterly 'Tankan', one of the most comprehensive economic surveys.
Mr Mieno, in evidence to the upper house of the Japanese parliament, said
the economy's performance would be uneven in the next few months before a
modest recovery in the second half of the financial year which began in
April.
He warned it was too early to say whether a pick-up in industrial production
and sales of some products towards the end of the last financial year was
the start of a sustainable recovery.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, Miti vice minister, said of Thursday's report: 'I do not
think it will support the notion that the economy has bottomed out.'

FT  08 JUN 93 / Iran 'close to pact' on debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN claimed yesterday that it was close to agreement with foreign banks on
rescheduling some Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 3bn of short-term debt.
Mr Mohammed Hossein Adeli, governor of the central bank, told a news
conference in Tehran that a settlement would be reached 'very shortly' but
he offered few other details.
Central bank officials have been wrestling for nearly a year with Iran's
worsening short-term payments problem, caused initially by a flood of
imports financed through letters of credit. Mr Adeli yesterday put the
figure of total short-term indebtedness at Dollars 6bn, higher than had been
officially admitted but still substantially below estimates by some of
Iran's main supplier governments.
Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department and other international
agencies have already suspended cover for Iran because of the payments
delays. However, Mr Adeli dismissed reports that Iran's total foreign debts
were anywhere near the Dollars 30bn level which had been cited, and said
this could only refer to the total of all contracts signed.
Several German banks were believed in April to have to have agreed to
restructure repayments due on letters of credit, and French banks are now
undertaking a similar exercise.
At the end of last year, Iran announced that sharp cuts were planned in
imports, although there was scepticism about the extent to which cuts would
be implemented before the presidential election scheduled for Friday.

The Supreme Court yesterday kept open a loophole allowing some banks to sell
insurance, dealing a setback to insurance agents who have sought to block
banks from encroaching on their markets, writes George Graham. The nine
justices unanimously ruled that nationally chartered banks could continue to
sell insurance from branches in towns with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-AWAITED talks between South Africa's two rival black leaders, Mr Nelson
Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, appeared likely to go ahead soon
after Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the two had agreed to meet at
his residence in Cape Town.
He said he hoped to announce a date for the meeting later this week. If the
talks go ahead - plans for similar meetings have fallen through in the past
 -it would be the first time the two men had met for negotiations in more
than two years.
The African National Congress is understood to have agreed last month that
Mr Mandela, their leader, should meet Chief Buthelezi in an attempt to
strike a deal with him on a post-apartheid constitution. Agreement between
the ANC and Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party on the key issue of
devolution of power to regions would remove one of the most important
obstacles to multi-party agreement on a new constitution.
The ANC has made substantial concessions recently, agreeing that regional
governments should have powers entrenched in the constitution which could
not be amended by the central government without substantial support from
deputies elected to a national house of assembly based on regions.
No deal has yet been struck on the powers to be devolved to regional level,
with the ANC proposing far less devolution than Inkatha. But Inkatha
officials said they believed the ANC position would eventually form the
basis for a deal between the two sides.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Attali to fight his corner on reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Attali, the beleaguered president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, yesterday demonstrated his continued
determination to fight for his position by announcing that the bank's board
of directors would meet in the next few days to discuss plans for a
structural reorganisation.
Speaking to the American Chamber of Commerce in London, in his first public
speech since the bank held its annual meeting in April, Mr Attali refused to
give any details about his proposals for the reform, or confirm reports that
the reorganisation would leave him in overall charge of the bank, insisting
that 'there will be no announcement until the board has discussed and
decided'.
He did concede that 'the bank is growing and needs a better structure' and
indicated that restructuring of the organisation, which has grown to 600
people, was imminent.
The bank yesterday confirmed that Mr Attali had called the meeting for this
week, but denied that this had been in response to reports of an imminent
reshuffle or growing pressure on Mr Attali to resign in the wake of
controversy over the bank's spending on entertainment and travel.
The announcement of the reorganisation comes at a critical time for Mr
Attali, with an audit report on the EBRD's spending practices imminent and
the US congress nearing a final decision on whether to keep up the US's
contributions to the bank's capital.
But G7 officials, who have been pushing for the appointment of a new chief
executive officer - possibly Mr Ernest Stern, one of the three managing
directors of the World Bank - to take over management responsibilities from
Mr Attali, seem unlikely to be placated by the impending reorganisation.
Mr Attali yesterday refused to confirm reports that Mr Stern, was being
considered for a senior role - though he joked that non-Europeans like Mr
Stern were unlikely to be ever appointed president, since 'the president of
the bank has to be a citizen of one of the countries of the community'.
One aspect of any change might be to appoint a new person to act as the
bank's chief operating officer, leaving Mr Attali in charge of overall
strategy, but divorced from day-to-day administration.
In his speech, the French bank chief launched a vigorous defence of the
EBRD's record, which, he said, had had a '300 per cent' growth since it was
founded two years ago.
Since the beginning of the year it had approved Ecu735m (Pounds 580m) in
bank loans and equity investments for eastern Europe.
Mr Attali yesterday gave no indication of how his proposals for structural
changes at the bank would dovetail with the report of the audit committee,
which was appointed last month by the EBRD's directors to look into the
bank's affairs.
At the meeting of the board of governors in April, in the wake of the
disclosures of the bank's high spending on entertainment and decorations, Mr
Attali promised changes in the role of the budget director, temporarily
separating the responsibilities of the budget director from the central
board.

THE Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, yesterday assured Mr Les Aspin,
the US defence secretary, that the Ukrainian parliament would approve two
critical arms treaties by the end of the month, despite opposition from MPs.
It will, however, be the parliamentarians and not the president who will
determine the fate of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which covers 130
of the 146 inter-continental ballistic missiles on Ukrainian territory, and
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would entrench Ukraine's status
as a non-nuclear nation.
Since January, when the US administration began to intensify the pressure on
Ukraine to fulfil its non-nuclear pledges, Mr Kravchuk has offered
Washington repeated assurances that parliamentary ratification of the two
key arms pacts is imminent. However, as Mr Kravchuk's self-appointed
deadlines have expired one after the other without any action from the
legislature, the gap between the mood of parliament and the official
government line has become increasingly apparent.
Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, the influential chairman of the parliamentary
commission on foreign affairs, told Mr Aspin that the Ukrainian parliament
was leaning toward ratification of Start 1 but a postponement of accession
to the NPT ' thus leaving Ukraine with 46 ICBMs and a number of nuclear
missiles associated with its strategic bombers.
'They (the US group) asked me when Ukraine would be ready to accede,' Mr
Pavlychko said.
'I told them we could give up our last nuclear missile when Ukraine's
security was no longer in jeopardy,' he added.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's constitutional convention is more likely to
produce temporary legislation for early elections and a new division of
powers rather than a new constitution.
'It's realistic, I think, and it could be the greatest success the meeting
could achieve,' said Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, one of the leaders of the
Civic Union alliance, which has the support of many managers of state-owned
factories.
The same conclusion emerged from remarks by other delegates as the
convention, which is attempting to resolve Russia's power struggle,
yesterday began discussing Mr Yeltsin's draft constitution in five separate
working groups at the Kremlin.
Delegates opposed to Mr Yeltsin signed statements of protest after the
president refused to let his chief rival, the parliamentary chairman, Mr
Ruslan Khasbulatov, address the opening session on Saturday. Mr Khasbulatov
stormed out amid chaotic scenes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of people have been killed in fighting between Moslem and Croat
forces over the central Bosnian town of Travnik, United Nations military
sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Travnik.
'I believe the number of dead is a matter of hundreds,' one western UN
officer said. 'We don't know the precise figure because we still can't get
in to all the villages.'
The UN military sources said the Moslems had driven the Croats out of
Travnik in fighting over the weekend, and had followed this yesterday by
pushing out some 3,000 Croat civilians.
The Croat military commander in central Bosnia said he had surrendered his
troops to Serb forces to save them and thousands of civilians after a rout
by the Moslems. 'We had no choice but to turn to the Bosnian Serb Republic
and its army to enable us to save the necks of our children, women and
elderly,' Commander Darko Kolenda told Reuter on nearby Mount Vlasic, which
is held by the Serbs. The Croats' homes had been burnt or destroyed and they
were now camped out in the open on a hillside.
The Bosnian Serb army on Mount Vlasic said 1,000 Croat fighters surrendered
to it rather than to the Moslems. The Bosnian Serb defence minister, Mr
Dusan Kovacevic, said the Croat soldiers were accompanied by several
thousand civilians.
Bosnia's Moslem-led government said yesterday it would co-operate with a UN
plan to set up 'safe areas' in Bosnia - but only if these havens were linked
by protected corridors. In a statement issued by the presidency, and
critical of the international attitude towards Bosnia, the government
attached several strings to its co-operation, including the provision of an
'economic environment' around the towns.
It was the ex-Yugoslav republic's first official comment on last Friday's UN
Security Council resolution authorising the use of heavily armed troops and
air power to defend six 'safe areas' - Sarajevo, Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica,
Tuzla and Bihac.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Budget test in Hungary after party purge: Nicholas Denton
reports on Prime Minister Antall's political options as ousted far-right MPs
move to form a new party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S far right has made its long-awaited appearance in the open
political arena.
'National-Christian' MPs yesterday began to turn their Hungarian Justice
grouping into a parliamentary party after Mr Istvan Csurka and three other
right-wing leaders were stripped of membership of the Hungarian Democratic
Forum, the leading party in the ruling coalition, at the weekend.
Mr Csurka claimed yesterday that 17 MPs had signed up to the new party.
Their defection from the Forum would reduce to single figures the
parliamentary majority of Mr Jozsef Antall, the moderate conservative prime
minister. The populist leader warned Mr Antall he was 'playing with
failure'.
The first round of the game will come with the vote on emergency austerity
measures to reduce the public sector deficit to 6.8 per cent of gross
domestic product this year and put it on course for 5.6 per cent in 1994.
The measures, part of a supplementary budget and essential if Hungary is to
secure a credit agreement with the International Monetary Fund, were placed
on the parliamentary agenda yesterday.
In the budget vote Mr Antall has also to contend with the restlessness of
the party's two coalition partners. The Smallholders party is riven
internally, and the Christian Democrats have taken to calling themselves the
'internal opposition'.
The government is reduced to banking on supporters' reluctance to force
early elections at a time when opinion polls say the Forum would lose with a
meagre 10 per cent of the vote. The prime minister has played on these fears
by appearing to rule out a minority government and Mr Ivan Szabo, the
finance minister, says that a defeat on the budget would lead to a
government crisis, bringing forward elections due in May 1994.
That, however, for the time being remains something to concentrate minds. Mr
Antall wants a full term to back his proudest boast: that his is eastern
Europe's longest lasting and most stable administration.
But even if parliament acquiesces the public may not. The imposition of
value-added tax on food provoked hunger strikes last year and the new budget
plan proposes an increase in the rate to 10 per cent from 6 per cent.
Nor does it appear that economic recovery could sweeten the pill. Recession
in western Europe has depressed exports and the finance ministry recently
announced that GDP, far from growing by up to 3 per cent as forecast, may in
fact drop by that amount.
But Mr Csurka's support may turn out to have been more imagined than real.
An unexpectedly large majority of the Forum's national delegates meeting at
the weekend voted to expel Mr Csurka, and some of his 29-strong Hungarian
Justice grouping have slipped back into the moderates' fold.
Turnout was also poor at a nationalist demonstration last week against the
Trianon treaty, the 1920 peace settlement which cost Hungary two-thirds of
its territory and left 3m Hungarians in neighbouring countries.
The jettisoning of the far right allows the Forum to 'open a broad gate to
society and public opinion', in Mr Antall's words. An aide believes that the
appearance of a party on the right at least defines the Forum as the
political centre.
Political virtue may therefore earn its reward but officials hope that
fiscal virtue, may also bring electoral compensations. Mr Szabo believes
Hungarians will not go down the way of 'demagogues who build a broad and
comfortable road that leads to hell'.

REBEL troops in Azerbaijan have taken control of the oil-producing former
Soviet republic's second-biggest town after intense fighting, seizing four
top government officials, Azeri and Russian reports said, Reuter reports
from Moscow.
The troops, led by rebel commander Suret Guseinov, captured Gyandzha in the
west at the weekend and hoisted the red flag of the former Soviet Union over
several buildings, according to the Azeri news agency, Turan.
Reports said Mr Guseinov, a former army general sacked after defeats in
fighting with neighbouring Armenia, had captured four top government
officials, including the prosecutor-general and first deputy ministers of
security and the interior. Russian TV said Mr Guseinov forced the prosecutor
to sign an arrest warrant for President Abulfaz Elchibey.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said 60 people had been killed in Gyandzha in
weekend clashes. It said the rebels had also taken over the southern town of
Lenkoran, near the border with Iran. Government troops and special security
ministry troops had been sent to Gyandzha to crush the rebellion, it added.
A defence ministry spokesman in the capital Baku, contacted by telephone,
declined to confirm the reports.
The rebels distributed leaflets in the nearby towns of Yevlakh and
Mingechaur calling on citizens to start a campaign of civil disobedience,
the agency added.
The Transcaucasian republic has been volatile since it became independent
after the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. Fighting with Armenian
forces over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh has killed at least
2,500 people since 1988.
In neighbouring Georgia, a Russian-mediated ceasefire between government
troops and rebels in the Black Sea region of Abkhazia appeared to have
collapsed at the weekend.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Abkhazia since last August when
Georgian troops moved into the region to counter claims for more
independence.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's constitutional convention is more likely to
produce temporary legislation for early elections and a new division of
powers rather than a new constitution.
'It's realistic, I think, and it could be the greatest success the meeting
could achieve,' said Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, one of the leaders of the
Civic Union alliance, which has the support of many managers of state-owned
factories. The same conclusion emerged from remarks by other delegates as
the convention, which is attempting to resolve Russia's power struggle,
yesterday began discussing Mr Yeltsin's draft constitution in five separate
working groups at the Kremlin.
Delegates opposed to Mr Yeltsin signed statements of protest after the
president refused to let his chief rival, the parliamentary chairman, Mr
Ruslan Khasbulatov, address the opening session on Saturday. Mr Khasbulatov
stormed out amid chaotic scenes.
Parliamentary leaders were huddled in the office of Mr Khasbulatov yesterday
for talks on what to do next. In a growing rebellion, eight senior members
of the 32-member ruling praesidium have complained about his dictatorial
style and his failure to draw the right conclusions from Mr Yeltsin's
referendum victory last month.
The problem is the Congress of People's Deputies, the only legitimate
vehicle for adopting a new constitution, which would see itself abolished.
Early elections, however, not foreseen by the present constitution, would
fill a new assembly which could legitimately adopt a constitution.
An alliance of moderate nationalists claimed yesterday to have won the most
votes in Latvia's first parliamentary elections since the Baltic republic
regained its independence less than two years ago. However, many of its
large Russian-speaking minority were excluded from the vote.

<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, yesterday assured Mr Les Aspin,
the US defence secretary, that the Ukrainian parliament would approve two
critical arms treaties by the end of the month, despite opposition from MPs.
It will, however, be the parliamentarians and not the president who will
determine the fate of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which covers 130
of the 146 inter-continental ballistic missiles on Ukrainian territory, and
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would entrench Ukraine's status
as a non-nuclear nation.
Since January, when the US administration began to intensify the pressure on
Ukraine to fulfil its non-nuclear pledges, Mr Kravchuk has offered
Washington repeated assurances that parliamentary ratification of the two
key arms pacts is imminent.
However, as Mr Kravchuk's self-appointed deadlines have expired one after
the other without any action from the legislature, the gap between the mood
of parliament and the official government line has become increasingly
apparent.
Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, the influential chairman of the parliamentary
commission on foreign affairs, told Mr Aspin that the Ukrainian parliament
ws leaning toward ratification of Start 1 but a postponement of accession to
the NPT ' thus leaving Ukraine with 46 ICBMs and a number of nuclear
missiles associated with its strategic bombers. 'They (the US group) asked
me when Ukraine would be ready to accede,' Mr Pavlychko said. 'I told them
we could give up our last nuclear missile when Ukraine's security was no
longer in jeopardy.'
Mr Pavlychko also suggested that, contrary to appearances, the call last
week by the Ukrainian prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, for the country to
temporarily retain some of its nuclear missiles had actually strengthened
President Kravchuk's position.
Mr Pavlychko said that the speech by Mr Kuchma, who has been locked in a
bitter domestic power struggle with Mr Kravchuk, 'has reinforced the
president's image as a centrist'.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday threw his political weight behind a plan to
create a new arm of the German social welfare system, just as negotiations
to curb the rest of social spending get under way.
He declared his determination to see a scheme for residential nursing care
for the old and handicapped made law by the autumn, in spite of fierce
business and union opposition.
A campaign to sell the scheme, financed by increased insurance contributions
from workers and employers, was launched yesterday by the federal Labour
Ministry.
The main business lobbies say it makes no sense to introduce a new pillar of
the social welfare system in the depths of recession.
The campaign is part of an effort by Mr Kohl and his Christian Democratic
Union to preserve its caring image for next year's election campaign, in
spite of the overwhelming need to cut back on social welfare spending in
other fields.
It also fits with Mr Kohl's determination not to reduce spending affecting
the elderly, when unemployment benefits and child allowances are likely to
be reduced under a DM20bn (Pounds 8bn) package of cuts proposed by Mr Theo
Waigel, finance minister, to control the deficit.
But in order to gain the support of the Free Democratic party, the junior
partner in the ruling coalition, Mr Kohl has agreed that the financial
burden on industry should be offset by making the first two days of sick
leave unpaid.
That has infuriated the unions and the opposition SPD, whose social affairs
spokesman, Mr Rudolf Dressler, says any care scheme financed by cancelled
sick pay will be rejected by his party outright.
The DGB trade union federation yesterday described the plan as 'politically
and legally crazy' and warned of a 'long, hot summer' of protests.

FT  08 JUN 93 / BIS appeal over exposure of banks to derivatives

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKING and accountancy regulators were yesterday urged to draw up common
international standards on banks' disclosure of their exposure to
derivatives and other complex financial products.
Speaking on the first day of the International Monetary Conference, an
annual gathering of bank chairmen and central bankers, Mr Alexandre
Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, said
that banks' participation in derivative markets has 'reduced the
transparency of (their) balance sheets.'
He said effects on the banking system of any 'disturbances' had therefore
become harder to predict. He was concerned about possible build-up of
'systemic problems'.
The BIS, based in Basle, Switzerland, is owned by central banks and serves
their needs. It has been the forum for the establishment of common
international standards of banks' capital requirments.
He urged accounting and bank supervisory authorities across the world to
agree common standards for measuring the risk of banks' exposures to
derivatives and common standards for disclosing these risks in their balance
sheets.
He also believes that worldwide statistics on banks' exposure to these
products should be collected and published, modelled on the BIS's
publication of cross-border bank lending.
The two main themes of discussions on the first day of the IMC meeting were
how to measure risk and how to reduce staff numbers without damaging a
bank's culture and prospects.

FT  08 JUN 93 / EC poll concludes lack of unified currency obstacle to

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Lack of harmonisation in tax and business law is the chief obstacle to the
working of the single market, according to a poll of senior EC company
executives, writes Tony Jackson, Industry Editor. The next biggest obstacle
is the lack of a single currency.
In a survey of European chairmen and managing directors by Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, 87 per cent thought it important the Maastricht Treaty should be
ratified. The treaty's most beneficial aspect was seen as the move to
economic and monetary union. The biggest drawback was seen as the risk of
extended EC powers.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Twelve divided on the future of energy tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC FINANCE ministers last night dealt a severe blow to prospects for an
EC-wide energy tax to fight global warming, which they refused to endorse
after rows about how to share the burden of the levy.
The failure leaves in doubt the EC's ability to fulfil its commitments under
the Rio climate change convention, and marks a reverse for Germany, Denmark,
Italy and the Benelux countries.
They had all but signed up to the tax plan and based their national
programmes for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions on the assumption
it would become EC law. In March they warned their partners that the
year-end deadline for ratifying the Rio convention could not be met unless
the tax was in place.
They contend that the EC commitment to stabilise CO emissions at 1990 levels
by 2000 is not possible without the EC-wide tax, necessary, moreover, to
avoid distortions in Europe's single market if member states go ahead with
their own eco-taxes.
In the draft endorsement of the tax the current Danish EC presidency failed
to get agreed, it had stressed the competition distortions which would
follow a failure to agree a Community emissions strategy. The UK made clear
yesterday it is still not convinced of the need for a Euro-energy tax and,
along with France, queried the 'burden-sharing' formula which all but the UK
agreed to in April.
In order to win the support of poorer member states, that formula agreed to
take into account levels of economic development and different levels of CO
emissions in distributing the energy tax burden.
Ms Marianne Jelved, the Danish economy minister who chaired yesterday's
meeting, insisted the tax 'is certainly not a project which is dead',
arguing that public pressure and the need to preserve the integrity of the
single market would see it through in the end. The Belgian presidency, which
takes office in July, is planning a joint meeting of finance and environment
ministers for the autumn.
Separately, the ministers agreed in principle yesterday on an Ecu1bn (Pounds
790m) loan for eastern European nations and former Soviet republics to
upgrade safety at their nuclear plants. The loan, to be provided under the
aegis of Euratom, the EC nuclear energy agency, is on top of already
committed EC aid for nuclear safety in the east of Ecu330m, about 60 per
cent of total assistance from the Group of 24 industrialised nations.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Italian polls boost reform drive: Municipal elections
confirm political shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE outcome of municipal elections in Italy over the weekend places renewed
pressure on parliament to reach a quick agreement on new electoral laws for
early fresh elections. And it puts the five-week-old government of Prime
Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in an even more anomalous position regarding
its parliamentary support.
The election results confirmed the dramatic shake-up in the country's
political geography as a result of the corruption scandals and the
discrediting of the traditional parties.
The populist Lombard League of Mr Umberto Bossi established itself as the
dominant force in the rich industrial north of the country. Everywhere
voters shied away both from the ruling parties and from what has been the
centre ground.
The only groups, apart from the League, to increase their vote over that of
general elections in April 1992 were those with more radical and aggressive
messages such as the Network (La Rete), the Sicily-based clean government
movement, and the hardline members of the former Communist party,
Reconstructed Communism.
However, the bulk of the former communists, recycled in the Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS), managed to hold their vote well, despite being
tainted by corruption, and remain in control of the old 'red belt' in
central Italy.
The four-party coalition on whom Mr Ciampi's predominantly technocratic
government relies still provides a majority in both houses. But if the
results of the election on Sunday are projected in a national vote the
collapse in support for the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social
Democrats and Liberals is such that between them they would muster less than
20 per cent.
The Socialists in the previous municipal elections of 1990 obtained more
than 17 per cent of the vote but their support has slipped to virtual
annihilation with only 2 per cent. The two minor coalition partners are
close to oblivion; while the Christian Democrats have slipped back to 17 per
cent in the centre and north of the country.
This still leaves them the largest voted-for party, with a bigger share of
the vote in the south. But there is no evidence the Christian Democrats'
decline has halted.
The elections involved a representative cross-section of the country
covering nearly one in four of the electorate with almost 11m voters in
1,092 towns, six provinces and the region of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia. Laws
approved in March introduced a direct vote for the mayor in towns of more
than 15,000 and allowed the leading parties or coalitions a dominant say in
forming new municipal administrations. To ensure a clear-cut result, the
laws allowed for a second round run-off between the two leading candidates
in the mayoral race.
Since only two mayors achieved the necessary majority on Sunday, the final
picture of the new political map will not emerge until after the second
round on June 20. But with separate votes cast for the mayors and party
municipal lists, the League's triumph is clear.
It has become the first party to obtain 40 per cent of the vote in Milan and
rally 37 per cent for its mayoral candidate Mr Marco Formentini. Mr Bossi
had staked out the hard-working electorate of Milan as the symbol of League
power, and with the city at the epi-centre of the corruption scandals, his
and the party's credibility depended upon victory.
A striking new element has been the way in which electoral alliances were
formed for these polls. The alliances were often across traditional
ideological barriers. But the most successful ones were those where the
'left' parties plus the Greens and The Network banded together. Even where
they formed two separate camps, as in Catania and Turin, their mayoral
candidates did best.
The way in which the second round alliances in the mayoral elections are
formed and their outcome will influence the debate on whether general
elections have a similar run-off. This is the most divisive issue in
formulating the new electoral laws.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL media magnate Silvio Berlusconi is under rising pressure to
scale down his broadcasting activities in Italy, as reform of the country's
crowded television and broadcasting frequencies has unexpectedly moved up
the political agenda.
The government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, prime minister, is planning to
re-examine the Mammi law, named after a former posts and telecommunications
minister, which is increasingly seen as excessively favouring Mr
Berlusconi's Fininvest company.
Ministers recognise the complex and controversial nature of broadcasting
reform means any new rules will have to be pushed through well before the
general election expected this year. The sense of urgency has been
heightened by the belief that likely electoral reform may loosen party
discipline, further complicating efforts to rewrite the braodcasting rules.
The electoral success yesterday of the autonomist Lega Nord (Northern
Leagues) in local elections is also likely to add to calls for greater
regional devolution of some of the state-controlled broadcasting media.
Although a recent parliamentary attempt by the Lega to transfer one of the
three state television channels to Milan from Rome was overturned, it
received considerable support from MPs.
Fininvest controls three television channels and accounts for about 45 per
cent of the total audience. Three other channels are held by the RAI public
sector broadcasting group, while the remaining six national channels are
divided among various private broadcasters.
The Mammi law has also been attacked by hostile newspaper proprietors, who
claim it gives Fininvest a dominant position in broadcasting and unfairly
distorts the advertising market in favour of television. Demands for change
have gathered steam as the recession has hit advertising revenues, which
have fallen particularly sharply for printed media.
Fininvest denies that the Mammi law is biased in its favour. It argues that
Mr Berlusconi was obliged to give up control of Italy's three pay-TV
channels, in which Fininvest now has only a minority stake, and of a
national newspaper to meet its requirements.
However, the group has come under growing fire after the arrest of Mr Davide
Giacalone, an adviser to the erstwhile minister, in connection with
political corruption investigations. Mr Giacalone negotiated a lucrative
L420m (Pounds 184,000) contract as a consultant to Fininvest, after leaving
the posts ministry. Fininvest spokesmen argue the contract was entirely
above board.

SWEDEN yesterday made a plea to the chairmen of the world's biggest banks to
consider purchasing a Swedish bank. Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance
minister, told a bankers' meeting: 'If you wish to buy a bank or part of
one, don't hesitate to do so.'
She was speaking at the International Monetary Conference, an annual
gathering of the chairmen of the world's hundred biggest banks.
None of Sweden's big banks is currently owned or controlled by overseas
institutions. Prior to the election of the centre-right government, there
was an effective ban on foreign ownership of them. But Swedish banks have
been suffering huge loan losses over the past couple of years. Two of the
big banks are already controlled by the government and a further three,
including Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, have applied for government
support.
Mrs Wibble said yesterday that a decision on the scope and form of any
public support for SE Banken, the country's biggest, would probably not be
taken until the autumn. The government said early this year it agreed in
principle to aid the bank, which had losses in 1992 of SKr5.6bn (Pounds
509m) and has non-performing loans totalling almost SKr25bn. SE Banken wants
to conclude a deal with the government by the end of this month, but Mrs
Wibble said it would take beyond that date to conclude a study of the bank's
needs.
The government is apparently adopting a tough stance, anxious not to be
accused of giving SE Banken soft terms.
The first privatisation candidate is set to be Gotabank which has consumed
most of a state guarantee worth SKr10bn following losses of SKr2.4bn last
year. Its healthy assets carry a value of around SKr50bn, but it has
non-performing loans of SKr40bn, most of which the government is likely to
dump into a separate 'bad bank' before privatisation set for early next
year.

FT  08 JUN 93 / EC warns of poor recovery outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday delivered a grim warning that economic
recovery in the EC is unlikely before the second half of 1994.
The poor outlook for growth means that unemployment will top 18m this year
and could rise to more than 20m in 1994, Mr Henning Christophersen,
economics commissioner, told EC finance ministers in Luxembourg.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new UK chancellor of the exchequer, acknowledged that
the weakness in the European economy was taking the edge off UK recovery and
called for a 'spirit of co-operation' among his EC partners.
On his debut in the Ecofin council, Mr Clarke, said Europe remained the most
important export market for British goods. 'Getting the European economy
going again is very important for us all.'
Mr Clarke afterwards voiced concern about the depth of the German recession,
and said the German and UK economies were 'so far out of line that the
conditions are not remotely there' for Britain to rejoin the exchange rate
mechanism of the European monetary system.
The Commission forecasts that the UK economy will grow by 1.7 per cent in
1993, compared with an earlier estimate of 1.3 per cent. This is faster than
its main EC competitors, but not one EC economy is likely to register an
impressive performance, said Mr Christophersen.
During the meeting, Mr Christophersen confirmed that the Commission's new
internal forecasts estimate the EC economy in general will contract by 0.3
per cent, compared to 0.8 per cent growth forecast earlier this year.
The commissioner said that next year the EC is likely to grow between 1 and
2 per cent - far less than the 3 per cent seen as necessary to stop job
losses and create employment.
Mr Christophersen called on member states to consider measures to stimulate
growth, citing the recent tax reform and job-creating measures adopted by
the Danish and French governments respectively.
But he acknowledged that members states' public deficits - which could reach
an EC average of 6 per cent of GNP this year - were too high to leave much
room for budgetary manoeuvre.
Mr Padraig Flynn, EC Social Affairs Commissioner, insisted that the struggle
against growing structural unemployment would make headway only if it was
tackled with the vigour seen in Europe's efforts to set up the single
market.
'The single market was a success because it had an agenda and a timetable,'
he said. Mr Flynn was disappointed with the inconclusive debate on the
Commission's framework plan to tackle the jobs crisis when employment
ministers met last week, and are still pushing for it to be considered at
the Copenhagen summit on June 21 and 22.

FT  08 JUN 93 / UK blocks VAT deal on works of art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to reach agreement on a new EC-wide tax on imports of works of art
collapsed last night after Britain argued that the tax posed a threat to the
main London auction houses led by Sotheby's and Christie's.
British opposition cut hopes of ending the long-running dispute over
harmonising VAT rates on second-hand goods in the EC, though ministers vowed
to continue negotiating.
The European Commission's seventh VAT directive covers all second-hand
goods, but Britain has a special interest because of the London art market
which faces stiff competition from New York and is not matched by any
European operation.
After several hours of tense negotiation at yesterday's meeting of EC
finance ministers in Luxembourg, the Danes presented a compromise which
briefly raised hopes of a deal.
Sir John Cope, UK paymaster general, said Britain intended to back the
Danish plan which proposed allowing it to maintain a reduced VAT rate of 2.5
per cent on imported works of art until the end of 1996.
This would be lower than for the rest of the Community where member states
would have paid an average 5 per cent, under the proposal.
UK officials hoped they could extend the lower rate indefinitely beyond
1996, the year when the present transitional regime for VAT rates in the EC
is due to end and new negotiations are due to begin. Sir John noted that
Britain was determined to protect its market beyond two or three years.
But several EC partners objected on the grounds that it was necessary to fix
a date for harmonised rates across the EC sometime before the end of the
century.
Disagreements also arose about the treatment of works of art dating after
1973. Some member states felt that these 'modern' works should receive more
favourable treatment.
Another unresolved issue concerned German desire for more flexibility in the
VAT treatment of used cars.

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday asked employers to
increase the number of young trainees from 450,000 to 650,000 within a year,
to help fight near-record unemployment.
This was his most concrete demand at a meeting with the 24 senior
representatives of the Patronat employers' federation, which he called
chiefly to show workers he is trying everything to prevent unemployment
rising in the recession.
Patronat executives said that the real problem was not training young people
but taking them on full-time, under French minimum wage law.
Mr Francois Perigot, the Patronat president, had earlier yesterday stressed
that he had no power to order his members to do anything, and that in
general employers could only follow the market.
Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, a Patronat vice-president, described the
meeting as highly positive and said it was natural that 'having incorporated
much of what the employers wanted in his programme, Mr Balladur should want
to distance himself a bit from them'.

MR KLAUS ZWICKEL was yesterday nominated to succeed Mr Franz Steinkuhler as
president of IG Metall, the German engineering union.
His selection, made by the union's directorate, was widely expected and
followed Mr Steinkuhler's resignation two weeks ago after allegations of
insider share trading.
Mr Zwickel, formerly deputy president, is acknowledged as a tough negotiator
but said to lack the political skills of his predecessor.
He takes over Germany's biggest and most influential union at a time of
mounting tension. Mr Hans Peter Stihl, head of the federal chamber of trade
and industry, last weekend demanded a pay freeze lasting several years.
Other challenges facing the union include employers' demands for an end to
the steady reduction in working hours and a return to weekend working.
Mr Zwickel's nomination and that of Mr Walter Riester, the Stuttgart
regional leader, as his deputy, are expected to be confirmed at a union
assembly in October.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Some comfort for defeated party in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE conservative People's Party in Spain is nursing its defeat but should
take comfort from the results of the general election on Sunday. It has
demonstrably shaken off the image of being only a right-wing party, having
captured a sizeable proportion of the centrist vote.
Nor is the PP a backwoods conservative party. It was the socialist party
(PSOE) of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, that won the vote in the
pueblos (small towns). The PP opposition, led by Mr Jose Mara Aznar, made
strong gains in the big cities and the dormitory towns.
Nor is the PP a nostalgic party of elderly traditionalists. The returns
indicate that large numbers of first-time voters voters opted for the
centre-right. The PSOE, by contrast, was strongly endorsed by pensioners.
But, if the PP's appeal was so successful among moderate, middle-class
voters, among urbanites and suburbanites, and among the young, why didn't it
win?
Part of the answer is the cushion of support that Andalucia, Mr Gonzalez's
home region, delivers to the PSOE. With more than 5m voters - more than any
other region - this southern swathe of Spain returns 61 members to the
350-seat Congress and 37 of those elected on Sunday from Andalucia were
members of the PSOE. The PP returned 20.
The other explanation is the competition that the PP faces from
regionally-based parties that share the same middle-of-the-road policies. In
Catalonia, the second biggest region after Andalucia, the PP won just eight
seats out of a possible 47. The Catalan nationalists, CiU, returned 18
members and the PSOE 17.
The PP was penalised by competing regional parties in the Canary Islands, in
Aragon and in Valencia, as well as in the Basque Country where a strong
nationalist party, much like Catalonia's CiU, is the second biggest. The
absence of the regional parties, and a lowered Basque nationalist vote,
would have meant as many as 10 more seats for the PP, perhaps 10 fewer for
the PSOE, and could have put Mr Aznar's party ahead.
With strong gains across the board, the PP gained 8.1m votes, 2.8m more than
in 1989. Perhaps as many as 1m of the extra votes came from the CDS, the
small centrist party that on Sunday failed to return one the 14 it had in
the outgoing parliament. The rest of the PP's votes came from the 3m-plus
new voters.
Swings towards the PP were very marked in the big cities. In Madrid, it
gained an extra 220,000 votes against a 70,000 increase for the PSOE and
returned 16 members to the 13 elected by Mr Gonzalez's party. The PP also,
in one of the bigger upsets, captured Valencia.
Although the PSOE captured all eight of Andalucia's provinces, with about
half the votes in each, the PP gained the largest number of votes in three
of the region's provincial capitals.
To gain power, Mr Aznar has to strike deals with regionalists and
nationalists. In all other respects, as Spaniards move to the cities and up
the social ladder, and as more young people register to vote, the PP has
time on its side.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Belgium apology in Gulf war row

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM has formally apologised to the UK for refusing to supply it with
ammunition in the build-up to the Gulf war two years ago.
Mr Leo Delcroix, the Belgian defence minister, apologised to his British
counterpart, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, when they met in London last month - the
first official opportunity since the Belgian minister took over the
portfolio in March last year.
'If Mr Delcroix had been minister of defence then (in 1991), he would have
said yes, and if the British asked now for similar things, he would say
yes,' a spokesman for the minister said yesterday.
The January 1991 decision was seized upon at the time by British politicians
as a prime example of EC members' failure to co-operate on foreign and
defence policy in the Gulf.
Belgium said it refused because it did not want to undermine a diplomatic
solution to the crisis, but the decision soured relations with the UK within
Nato. Belgium claims it was one of the reasons why Britain decided not to
back a bid by its chief-of-staff to take over one of the top Nato positions
last year.

THE European Investment Bank may need as many as 200 new staff in order to
cope with its rapidly expanding loan portfolio in the EC, eastern Europe,
Latin America and Asia.
Sir Brian Unwin, the new president, told its board of governors' annual
meeting in Luxembourg that the EIB was now bigger than the World Bank in
lending and borrowing. Staff were 'very thinly stretched' as a result of new
lending beyond its traditional base inside the Community.
The EIB, which enjoys a Triple A credit rating, lent a record Ecu17bn
(Pounds 13.4bn) inside and outside the EC last year. It has taken a leading
role in the EC's 'growth initiative' and also plans to finance projects for
30 Asian and Latin American countries amounting over three years to Ecu750m.
The bank has also been asked to extend lending in Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania for a total of Ecu200m over three years.
Sir Brian yesterday avoided a direct appeal for more staff, but pointed out
that about a third of staff resources were being devoted to less than 10 per
cent of total lending.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Unions deal blow to Smith plans for party reform: Setback
for Labour move on block vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH'S attempts to reform the Labour party ahead of the next
general election received a potentially fatal blow yesterday when three
trade unions rejected his plans to introduce a one member, one vote system
for selecting parliamentary candidates.
The GMB general union, leading the campaign against attempts to remove
direct union influence from the local selections; Nupe, which represents
public-service workers; and NCU, the telecommunications union, voted
overwhelmingly against.
That leaves Mr Smith, who has recently come under criticism for a lacklustre
performance as party leader, with only about 35 per cent of votes behind the
proposals at the Labour party conference in September.
Senior shadow cabinet members said they were confident that in the end
enough union leaders would support Mr Smith's plans, in spite of yesterday's
setback, which highlights the continuing divide between the trade unions and
the leadership over the issue.
Labour officials pointed out that, in contrast to the GMB, which has adopted
a tightly worded motion, other unions had left room for manoeuvre.
Mr Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of Nupe, said it was possible to
find a solution that was neither one member, one vote nor the block vote at
local level. The most popular compromise, with both Nupe and the GMB,
centres on a register of Labour supporters within affiliated unions who
would retain a different status from ordinary party members and vote for
Labour candidates through their unions.
Mr John Edmonds, the GMB leader, said the best option now was that the
review group examining the link between the party and the unions should be
recalled and make a unanimous recommendation to the national executive
before the party conference.
Mr Edmonds said unions were not to blame for the Tory victory at the last
general election. He hit out at Labour 'professionals' who overplayed the
health service and underplayed union policies for full employment in the
election campaign.
There was anger within Labour ranks at Mr Edmonds in particular for
providing such a distraction from the Tory party disarray. Mr Neil Kinnock,
former party leader, attacked union leaders for causing a 'distressing and
totally unnecessary' diversion, and warned that a defeat for Mr Smith on the
issue would cause serious difficulty for Labour.
The party now faces the prospect of having no system for the next round of
candidate selections. But a compromise involving the register of supporters
is unlikely to appeal to Mr Smith.
Mr Smith said yesterday: 'No one was under any illusion that this was an
easy matter to solve. What we have got to do is the right thing for our
party and for our democracy - and that is one member, one vote.'
He has suggested arranging for union members who pay the political levy to
take part in Labour elections as individual party members.
Mr Gavin Laird, leader of the engineering union, reiterated his support for
Mr Smith.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Customers first as BT plans longer working day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAT GREAT British tradition of taking half a day off work to wait for a
telephone engineer or the gasman to visit could be nearing its end.
British Telecommunications intends to introduce new working hours for its
engineers, including routine weekend working, which fit in with other
people's working hours rather than the other way round.
BT, which is under severe competitive and regulatory pressure, wants to
introduce a daily working span of 6am to 10pm and Saturday and Sunday
working.
In the longer run BT hopes to introduce a proper appointment system, within
quite narrow time bands, so that customers no longer have to rearrange their
lives to fit in with the engineer's visit.
Currently, most utilities can offer nothing more precise than morning or
afternoon visits, although most of the regional electricity companies now
claim to be down to a two-hour time band.
Many of the utilities have offered some increase in the services provided
outside normal office hours in recent years. British Gas, for example, has
extended to 8pm on weekdays the time at which it is possible to query bills
and make appointments.
But meter reading and non-emergency service work remain stubbornly fixed
within normal office hours.
BT is trying to sell the flexible working and anti-social hours package to
employees by offering a four-day week in exchange for the longer daily
working hours.
Sunday attendance would also attract a premium payment, although not the
full overtime rate as at present.
The main BT union, the National Communications Union, is not enthusiastic
about the changes but is ready, in principle, to fit workers' shifts to
customer needs.
As a quid pro quo, the NCU has been asking BT for a general reduction in
working time.
The company has rejected that, but said that it would consider a reduction
in working time for those employees in the Personal Communications
department who are directly affected by the changes.

FT  08 JUN 93 / Mediation fails in BA-Virgin 'dirty tricks' row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE acrimonious 'dirty tricks' dispute between Virgin Atlantic and British
Airways looked set last night to be decided in court after the collapse of a
mediation attempt by the Civil Aviation Authority.
BA said the main obstacle to a settlement was Virgin's insistence on a
payment of not less than Pounds 9m in compensation. It suggested that the
matter should be settled by impartial arbitration.
Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, said it now seemed inevitable that
the matter could be decided only in court: 'Once again, at the last moment,
BA have decided to move the goalposts.'
The collapse of talks ends three weeks of meetings held by Mr Christopher
Chataway, chairman of the CAA, with both airlines to try to resolve the
dispute. The CAA said it was disappointed that a deal had proved impossible
in a dispute it considered to be 'potentially harmful to British aviation'.
BA denied reports that it was ready to pay Pounds 9m to settle the claims by
Virgin. It said it had made clear at the start of the discussions initiated
by the CAA that the proposed settlement was worth nothing like that figure
and that BA's board had reaffirmed its stance on Friday.
BA suggested that all Virgin's claims should be submitted to an arbitrator,
except for Pounds 5m involved in a long-running aircraft maintenance dispute
which is already in arbitration.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, said the airline had always
declared its willingness to pay any legitimate claims that Virgin might
have. 'We hope Virgin will accept this simple, direct and obviously fair way
of determining the legitimacy and worth, if any, of its claims.'
In response, Mr Branson said Virgin had expressly entered negotiations on
the basis that BA pay Pounds 9m compensation for the 'dirty tricks' campaign
to lure passengers away by using Virgin's computer data. 'Much hard work and
effort has been expended by the CAA and Virgin in attempting to agree the
outstanding issues. Just at the point of agreeing those issues, BA, without
any reason whatsoever, have once again withdrawn their offer of settlement.'
Last night, Virgin said that it had originally asked for Pounds 13m, but had
agreed on Pounds 9m as a basis for negotiations if BA dropped a 'gagging
clause' that would have stopped Virgin from raising the matter again.
BA says Pounds 9m offer was off agenda, Page 7

FT  08 JUN 93 / Train builder set to shed 900 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABB TRANSPORTATION, the UK's biggest train builder, said yesterday it is
making nearly 900 of its 6,134 employees redundant across its operations at
York, Derby and Crewe because of a severe reduction in UK orders.
The announcement underlines the plight of the UK's railway equipment
industry, which is running out of orders because of the uncertainty created
by rail privatisation plans, and what it sees as underinvestment in the UK
railway network.
The Railway Industry Association, the equipment suppliers' trade body, said
yesterday that the cuts 'could be the beginning of a process about which we
have been warning the Government for the best part of a year'.
The association has said that privatisation puts about half the equipment
industry's 30,000 jobs at risk immediately, and all of them in the long
term.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said the cuts were 'directly
due to the bumbling incompetence of a government which has failed to throw
the railway engineering industry the financial lifeline it has in its
grasp'.
The brunt of yesterday's job cuts at ABB Transportation - formerly known as
Brel - falls on York, where 532 of the 1,600 jobs are to go. Derby will
suffer 273 job cuts, while 91 workers will be made redundant at the Crewe
heavy overhaul works.
The immediate cause was the news late last month that ABB Transportation had
lost the battle for a Pounds 36m order from Strathclyde Council for 21
commuter trains. Mr Bo Sodersten, ABB Transportation's managing director,
warned that the company would be assessing its manpower and workload
requirements.
Brel, the old workshop arm of British Rail, was privatised in 1989 and since
last year has been 85 per cent owned by Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish
engineering group. ABB said yesterday it had transformed the subsidiary into
a 'first-class company'.
But the York plant, on which Pounds 50m has been spent since privatisation,
is due to run out of work next May when it finishes a Pounds 140m order for
Networker trains from Network SouthEast.
Mr Sodersten has warned that the plant could close if it does not win
significant orders this year. Its future could depend on winning a Pounds
150m order from BR for more commuter trains which may be awarded in August.
In Derby, the 273 redund-ancies came as a shock. 'We didn't think things had
got to that stage,' said Mr John Jennings, chairman of the
Conservative-controlled City Council's economic development commit tee.
Over the last three years the ABB Derby workforce has been cut to just over
3,000 from 4,000. Unemployment in Derby has been running at 12.6 per cent
and the retrenchment at ABB coincides with reductions at Rolls-Royce, the
city's other major manufacturing employer.
Mr Sodersten said yesterday: 'We see great long-term possibilities for our
products and services, both here in the UK and overseas, but it is essential
that our domestic customers are in a position now to continue a programme of
steady order placement if Britain's railway industry is to survive.'

FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hawtal Whiting losses at Pounds
2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Hawtal Whiting, which provides design and engineering services to
the motor industry, continued to mount in the second six months and for the
full 1992 year reached Pounds 2.18m pre-tax.
The deficit, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 197,000, was
struck after taking account of exceptional provisions amounting to Pounds
1.5m.
Provision made against amounts owed by Leyland-Daf, which went into
receivership in February, was Pounds 805,000.
Balance of the overall provision was made up as to Pounds 333,000 for other
identified doubtful debts and Pounds 365,000 for restructuring, including
redundancies and facility rationalisations.
Turnover for the year slipped to Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 62.4m).
Pre-exceptionals, the group made an operating profit of Pounds 513,000
(Pounds 1.74m) after taking account of a first half loss of Pounds 368,000.
Losses per share worked through at 39.6p (0.9p). The dividend for the year
is being passed - last time a nominal 0.1p was paid.
The directors said that a deterioration in shareholders' funds to Pounds
3.6m against Pounds 6.37m, brought about by poor trading conditions in 1992,
together with the failure of Leyland-Daf, would result in the company
breaching the existing borrowing powers laid down in its articles of
association when the audited accounts for the year were published.
Shareholders will be asked to consider a resolution to authorise a temporary
increase in Hawtal's borrowing powers.
The directors pointed out that the group was not in breach of any loan or
facility covenants and continued to have the support of its banks.
Net debt at year-end had risen to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 10.22m).

HALL &amp; TAWSE, the construction division of Raine, has won contracts in the
education sector worth over Pounds 10m.
A three and a half storey business school is to be built at a cost of Pounds
3.2m for the University of Derby, including two new lecture theatres with
seating for 400 students.
One of the theatres will feature a mock courtroom to help students on law
degree courses familiarise themselves with judiciary surroundings. (This
contract follows the construction of a new Pounds 3m science and technology
building at the university last September.)
Hall &amp; Tawse has also commenced work on a Pounds 2.2m contract to build a
music wing at the University of Nottingham's Art Centre.
The 57-week building programme will see the development of a recital hall,
14 practice rooms, a music library, and a separate seminar room.
In Worcestershire, a Pounds 1.8m order has been won to design and build a
library and resource centre at Bromsgrove School.
It will have a capacity for 30,000 books, and provide 100 study spaces.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST three arson attacks on Turkish homes in Germany were reported at
the weekend, in spite of protests against racism organised in many towns
across the country.
The main demonstration, in the town of Solingen, near Cologne, where two
Turkish women and three girls died in a fire last weekend, ended in violent
clashes between rival Turkish groups and the police on Saturday night.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was greeted with jeers when he attended the
re-opening of the restored cathedral in Berlin, and cries of 'Where were you
in Solingen?'
The wave of protests since the latest killings have refuelled the political
debate on the status of foreigners in Germany, with growing demands for dual
nationality status to be granted to long-term residents.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, and Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the leader of his
Free Democratic party, have both lent their support for change in the
nationality law, in spite of strong resistance from the Christian Democratic
Union and the Christian Social Union, the other two parties in the governing
coalition.
The latest attacks took place in Hattingen on the Ruhr, only 30km from
Solingen, and in Konstanz on the southern border with Switzerland, where
both a Turkish restaurant and a private home shared by Turks and Germans
were attacked.
There was some disappointment at the weekend turnout of demonstrators
against the latest racist incidents. Some 12,000 people marched through the
centre of Solingen, in a peaceful weekend protest which only turned violent
at the end of the day, when rival Turkish groups began fighting. The police
barricaded some 200 Turkish youths into the city centre for eight hours,
before arresting more than 30 in the early hours of the morning.
Mr Alexander von Stahl, the federal prosecutor, confirmed on Saturday that
four suspects were being being held for the Solingen killings. The four are
said to have carried out the arson attack in a fit of drunken rage, after
being thrown out of a local bar, and are not known to have any links to
extreme right-wing political groups.
The head of Germany's internal security service, Mr Eckart Werthebach,
warned at the weekend that the latest incidents could see an upsurge in
violence between extreme Turkish and German nationalist groups.

FT  07 JUN 93 / European debut for Clarke: New UK chancellor arouses
curiosity in Brussels
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE makes his European debut as UK chancellor of the exchequer
at a meeting of EC finance ministers in Luxembourg today. The meeting is
expected to focus on rising unemployment and the bleak outlook for Europe's
economic growth.
Latest Commission forecasts indicate the EC's gross national product will
shrink slightly in 1993, with only a moderate rebound next year.
This is not enough to stop unemployment in the EC rising to more than 17.5m
this year and has reinforced UK scepticism about another item on today's
agenda: an EC-wide energy tax. Britain, however, remains virtually isolated
in its opposition.
Mr Clarke's appointment has aroused interest in Brussels, where diplomats
and officials are curious about his pro-European credentials and his
reported ambition to become UK prime minister.
The Danish presidency of the EC has promised to make growth and employment a
priority at the Copenhagen summit on June 21-22, but today's meeting is
likely to show that most member states have little budgetary room for new
stimulus packages.
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, will urge ministers to
build on the Community's 'growth package' agreed at last December's summit
in Edinburgh. He is due to release official EC growth forecasts on June 16.
The latest internal estimates suggest that the EC economy may contract by
about 0.3 per cent, compared with an original forecast earlier this year of
0.8 per cent growth.
Recognising the tightness in member states' budgets, the Commission is
looking at ways to inject new life into the Community's labour market. Among
the main ideas are increasing flexibility, creating more part-time jobs and
changing tax regimes.
Today's meeting will study other tax issues, including the harmonisation of
VAT rates on works of art. Germany and Spain appear to have eased their
opposition to Commission proposals, 'but the real question is whether the
British are prepared to play ball', said an EC official.
Finance ministers were originally due to discuss the UK's 'convergence
programme' - the plan for each member state to meet targets for budgetary
discipline and non-inflationary growth in preparation for monetary union.
The UK submits these plans even though it is not in the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Mr Clarke has successfully requested that the UK plan is withdrawn so he can
study the document. EC officials said last week that this would allow him,
technically, to make amendments before re-submitting the proposal at the
next meeting of economic and finance ministers.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a long queue of elderly people lining up against the police
barrier outside Madrid's swanky Palace Hotel, across the street from the
parliament building, where despite the close exit polls, the Socialist party
was beginning to celebrate an electoral victory.
'Only eight seats ahead?' said Mercedes Garcia, 78, who lives in a
retirement home on the outskirts of the city. She had been bussed to the
PSOE's end-of-election rally on Friday but took a metro to see the final
celebration, if only from a distance.
'Eight seats, that's enough,' said her companion Rosario, white-haired and
also wrinkled. 'We've won, we've won, we've beaten the right.'
Were they worried that the Partido Popular, PP, would take their pensions
away? 'Yes,' they said together. 'The PSOE is our party, it's progress, it's
the future.'
But last night their concerns were focused elsewhere. 'When is (prime
minister) Felipe Gonzalez coming?' Mercedes wanted to know as she crowded
against the barrier. 'I'll be here all night waiting to cheer him as he
arrives.'
But inside the hotel Carmen Garcia Bloise, a veteran member of the PSOE's
executive committee and an early arrival to the party, predicted: 'Felipe
won't come here for a few hours.'
The old ladies' optimism was not matched by party activists inside the
hotel, although most expressed relief that there was no immediate outright
defeat.
'Yes, of course I am satisfied with the result. The right threw everything
at us in the campaign and a fourth term in power, after 11 years in
government, is something of a record, isn't it?' said Ms Garcia Bloise, who
spent the Franco years working as an accountant for the Peugeot car company
in France.
Mr Manuel Garanacho, a veteran socialist and a leader of the national
woodworkers' union was more cautious. 'Happy? So, so. The PSOE has not got a
majority for the working man. It is going to have to team up with the
Catalan nationalists and they don't like the strike law that we agreed with
the socialist party in the last parliament.'
Mr Jose Maria Benegas, the Socialist party's organiser was cautiously
confident. 'The results are pretty satisfactory.
'The important thing is that we have won the election,' he concluded.

FT  07 JUN 93 / A judgment call for the Fed

<TEXT>
At some stage in every economic recovery, a responsible central bank has to
start pushing up interest rates. Friday's unexpectedly strong employment
report will have helped convince many economists that the US is now at this
critical juncture.
The significance of the jobs figures should not be underrated. Government
statisticians have pulled the rug from under forecasters by rewriting
economic history. The new figures show that non-farm payroll employment grew
by more than 200,000 in both April and May, the largest consecutive monthly
increases for three years. Figures for the year to March were revised up to
show an average monthly gain of about 80,000 jobs, nearly double the
previous estimate. Far fewer jobs were lost in the recession than previously
thought. After two years of expansion, employment is standing at a record
high of 109.99m, having finally surpassed the pre-recession peak reached in
June 1990.
Robust job growth and high levels of factory overtime strongly suggest
economic growth is accelerating after the depressed first quarter, when
output grew at an annual rate of only 0.9 per cent. Indeed, extrapolating
from the number of hours worked in April and May, the economy could be
growing at an annual rate of nearer 4 per cent than the 2 per cent projected
by many forecasters.
Speculation that the Fed wanted to raise rates began in earnest last month
after the release of April inflation figures, the third bad set since
January. These showed producer and consumer prices rising at an annualised
rate for the year to date of 3.4 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively, a
big increase from last year. A few days later press leaks indicated that the
Federal Open Market Committee voted at its May 18 meeting to shift from a
neutral posture on interest rates to a bias towards increasing them. At the
same time, official minutes of the previous FOMC meeting revealed that two
Fed governors - Mr Wayne Angell and Mr Lawrence Lindsey - were pushing for
an increase in rates as long ago as March.
In the light of the employment report, an early increase in rates may now
appear unavoidable. Hawks argue that the Fed must move swiftly to nip
inflation expectations before they get out of control. A small increase in
rates now - maybe only a quarter or half point, would demonstrate that the
Fed was serious about preventing higher inflation and perhaps head off the
need for bigger and more disruptive increases next year. By reducing
inflation expectations, an increase in short rates could actually bring down
long-term rates, thus improving the outlook for growth.
These arguments are powerful: if the Fed were the Bundesbank, it would
already have acted. Yet Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, may still be
hesitating. The reported shift to a bias towards higher rates is less
significant than it sounds. The Fed has previously issued such directives
without raising rates. Indeed, some Fed-watchers argue that, had the FOMC
intended to move in the near future, it would not have leaked the news of a
shift in its stance. On this view, the bias towards tightening was a sop to
the hawks and a substitute for action: a way of letting markets know that
the Fed was serious about controlling inflation without pushing up rates
prematurely.
After the disappointment of the first quarter, the argument runs, it would
be foolish to rule out further economic setbacks. The economic data are not
all encouraging. Factory orders have fallen for two months running. The
index of leading indicators has stagnated. Consumer and business confidence
remains fragile, partly because of uncertainty about Clinton's economic
plan.
Even the employment gains are not all they could be: the increases are
skewed towards temporary and part-time positions in service industries and
construction. Manufacturing is still shedding labour. At 6.9 per cent the
jobless rate is still well above the levels historically associated with
rising inflation.
And while most forecasters agree that last year marked the low point for
inflation in this business cycle, many believe price figures in the first
four months were biased upwards. It is hard to believe that the underlying
inflation rate could have risen from 3 per cent to 4 per cent or more so
quickly, especially when the recovery was sluggish. Several distortions,
such as erratic increases in food, tobacco and airline fare prices, appear
about to unwind.
If the Fed tightens now, it will be accused in Washington of wanting to push
unemployment back above 7 per cent. Mr Greenspan would much rather justify a
rate increase on the grounds that he has to rein back an unsustainably rapid
economic expansion. If May producer and consumer price figures, due this
week and next, are bad, the Fed will have no room for manoeuvre: it will
have to push up rates in order to retain credibility as an inflation
fighter. Bad probably means an increase in the consumer price index of
0.3-0.4 per cent.
But if, as many forecasters (including some Fed economists) predict,
inflation figures this summer are quite subdued, the Fed's decision will be
far more difficult. Given his reputation for gradualism, there is a good
chance that Mr Greenspan will choose not to act until the autumn.
