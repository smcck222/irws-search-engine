FT  07 JUN 93 / Community in trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With any luck, the Treaty of Maastricht should soon be ratified in all 12
member states. But the European Community is now in deep political and
economic trouble, and it will not be resolved by getting the treaty on to
the statute books.
The political problem is that the member states have not yet taken on board
the full consequences, and therefore have not accepted the full
responsibilities, of the post-cold war era. The economic problem is that the
process of economic integration, which should be carried a great stride
forward by the single market and Maastricht, is in fact in jeopardy from the
recession and the growing anxiety over Europe's competitive weaknesses.
France and Germany last week called for a special European summit later this
year to revitalise the Community, and their proposal was immediately
endorsed by five Christian Democrat governments. What we don't yet have is
evidence that the member states have remedies for the Community's problems.
The tell-tale of the post-cold war era, is the comprehensive muddle over the
war in Bosnia. After weeks of feverish transatlantic diplomacy, five UN
Security Council members last month drafted a 12-point action plan for
containing the conflict. But that ambiguous document was really a cloak for
continued disagreement between the US and Europe; and the disagreement has
not been ended by Friday's Security Council vote to protect 'safe areas' in
Bosnia.
Sanctions have not stopped the Serbs from killing Moslems nor from
conquering more and more Bosnian territory; above all, they have not
persuaded the Serbs to submit to the Vance-Owen plan. If that plan is to be
brought back from the dead, and then implemented, much more forceful
military compulsion would be needed. But troops on the ground, in sufficient
numbers credibly to threaten the use of force, would require a substantial
US contribution. That is what we shall not get.
The US is determined not to get involved in the war. On the campaign trail
Bill Clinton criticised President George Bush for the limpness of his Bosnia
policy and promised he would be more vigorous. But now, after much
reflection, he has evidently concluded that the Bush policy was not so bad
after all. He does not say that Bosnia is Europe's problem, but that is what
he means.
The fiasco of the Washington 'agreement' was underscored by an
off-the-record briefing by a senior state department official, who told
journalists the new administration would be adopting a lower international
profile, and would be 'setting limits on the amount of American engagement
in Bosnia and around the world'. His words were immediately repudiated by
the White House, and secretary of state Warren Christopher assured the world
that America would continue to lead 'because the need for American
leadership is undiminished'.
But these were just the gesticulations of national vanity: the state
department official was merely telling us what we already knew. If America
was the uncontested leader of the west for the past 50 years, it was
primarily because of the cold war: Europe and America needed each other
desperately, and only America could lead. But leadership is a heavy burden.
Now that the Soviet threat has vanished, America has much less incentive
(and fewer resources) systematically to bear the burden of leadership seven
days a week. In the new loose world after the cold war, Europe may find that
sometimes America has quite different strategic objectives, and sometimes
simply does not want to get involved at all.
The implications of this for Europe are profound. First, Europe can no
longer take America for granted. We share many values, and many common
interests; but we may not necessarily have the same strategic objectives.
Therefore, the Community needs to decide whether it is serious about the
Maastricht objective of a common foreign policy; if it is, it must go much
further than anything in the treaty. If the Community is to be more
self-reliant, the tasks of a full-gamut foreign policy can no longer be left
to France and Britain: the Germans must recognise that their posture of
atonement may be a critical obstacle to the European integration they say
they want.
Europe's economic problems are, if anything, even more intractable. When
Maastricht was being negotiated, the centrepiece was regarded as the
programme for economic and monetary union. But today's most pressing
economic problem is high and rising unemployment, and it is not being
helped, and may be made worse, by the Emu programme.
Europe's economic downturn has been aggravated both by the costs of German
unification, and by Germany's tight money policy. But the high rate of
unemployment may also be due to the relocating of European jobs to low-cost
countries elsewhere. A report to the French senate calculates that France
has lost 450,000 jobs in clothing, footwear and electronics in the past 15
years; and it estimates that another 2.7m French industrial jobs are
vulnerable to the same threat.
Last week an official at the OECD warned privately that rising unemployment
could trigger a 'social explosion'.
The prescription of the French senate report is that 'Europe must be
protectionist'. Free-traders will regard this as outrageous, and typically
French. But we should note that it would be all of a piece with the human
protectionism that Europe is already practising on a massive scale. We are
not ready to do anything to stop the war in ex-Yugoslavia; but we have no
shame in merely excluding the hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war,
death and destruction.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Monday Interview: Artful wooer gets his way: Ferdinand
Piech, chairman of the Volkswagen management board, speaks to Kevin Done
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferdinand Piech has learnt how to smile for much of the time, but under
pressure his piercing blue eyes turn icy cold. The unblinking stare
intimidates.
His technique for ending discussion of items that do not please is
singularly effective. The chairman of the Volkswagen management board makes
his point, turns on the stare and falls silent. The pause can be
interminable.
On the subject, for example, of his new effective number two, Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, who faces allegations of industrial espionage from
former employer General Motors, he says: 'We have said quite clearly that
allegations that come from the state prosecutor are to be dealt with, in
accordance with German law, before the courts and not, not through the mass
media. Those are the rules of the game in Germany. So, a statement from Mr
Lopez, a statement from me. And not one word more. Ja?'
Until the discussion moves on to more acceptable terrain, he waits. Piech
has a reputation for not giving up, for getting exactly what he wants.
Running Audi, the Volkswagen group's executive car division, for four years
was not enough for him. He wanted to become chief executive of the group,
Europe's biggest carmaker, which includes Seat and Skoda alongside VW and
Audi. For a long time, the Vienna-born Piech, an automotive engineer and a
scion of the Porsche family, was seen as only an outside candidate to
succeed the urbane and worldly Carl Hahn, who had led VW for a decade.
But in January it was Piech who took over, his reputation for ruthless
restructuring preferred to the engaging philosophising of Daniel Goeudevert,
currently VW deputy chairman.
Piech wanted Lopez, General Motors' global head of purchasing, at his side.
He hoped Lopez, the man who acquired an almost legendary reputation for
cutting GM's purchasing costs, would help him push through a revolution in
the sclerotic Volkswagen bureaucracy.
GM tried desperately to hold on to the services of the mercurial Basque, but
Piech was not to be denied.
Lopez resigned from GM. Then he re-signed for GM, apparently brought back
into the fold by an offer from Jack Smith, GM chief executive, to take
control of the entire North American operations of the world's biggest
vehicle maker.
Lopez prepared a statement explaining why he was staying at GM. It began:
'Why did I change my mind? I changed because of the GM people. When I saw
the reaction of the people, I said it cannot be. I cannot leave.' It ended:
'I am very happy to be here, today, at General Motors, the company I love.'
The statement was never delivered. A couple of hours before the scheduled GM
press conference, Lopez was on his way to Wolfsburg, VW's headquarters.
As Piech tells it, the move had been planned for several months. The first
meeting took place before Christmas and it was a meeting of minds.
'I did not woo him. He got in touch with me. We got to know each other and
established that we think alike. For Lopez and me it is not a question of
money. It's about maintaining Europe as a centre for manufacturing industry,
to defend it and to make it number one in the world again.
'For that you need a combination of skills, someone that comes out of the
production discipline - that is him - and someone who comes from engineering
and development and its capacity for making quantum leaps - and that's me.'
He adds: 'We are very different. With this combination we are in the
position to make quantum leaps both in the development of new products and
in cutting costs. This team only exists in one place in the world. And it
had to be two engineers.'
Piech's determination to bring Lopez to VW proved irresistible, but at a
cost. Volkswagen has been pitched into a storm of retaliatory legal action
from General Motors, which is diverting VW top management's attention from
the central issue of rescuing their company from its uncomfortable postion
as probably the highest-cost volume carmaker in Europe.
In the final quarter of last year the VW group suffered a loss of DM563m
(Pounds 229m). In the first quarter of this year it followed up with a loss
of DM1.25bn. As the former head of the Audi division, who crucially did not
have a position on the VW group executive management board, Piech blames the
company's fall into loss firmly on the old management, mentioning the onset
of recession only in passing.
'The VW group's current difficulties can only be blamed in small part on the
weakness of new car sales - and the same is true for other German
manufacturers. The real cause is much more the structural problems of the
entire sector, which are now being openly exposed by the recession.
'We have to accept that in the eight years of booming sales we did not do
our homework. As soon as sales fall, we are in the red. Our task for the
coming years is to come to grips with this structural transformation.'
He has started by cutting a large part of the old VW management, including
the former finance and production directors. The former head of research and
development has been demoted to the divisional board for the VW brand; the
former human resources director is now responsible for Asia-Pacific. Many
other senior managers just below the executive board have been replaced.
The restructuring measures announced so far include job cuts, fierce pruning
of capital investments, and pressure put on components suppliers to cut
costs and prices. More economical production methods are being introduced,
more parts are to be made common across model ranges. The VW group does not
need 12 different designs of cigarette lighters, he says.
Piech has to move faster and more rigorously than his rivals, because VW has
embarked late on restructuring. He says VW must rationalise all of its
operations, from raw material purchases to final sales to the customer.
'In eight years of boom we concentrated on expansion and we did not prepare
for bad times. We should break even with our plants working at 70 per cent
or less of capacity. We came into this crisis with a break-even level of
around 100 per cent of capacity.
'From 1989 our sales volumes grew every year and our profits shrank every
year. We introduced continuous improvement, or kaizen as the Japanese call
it, but not with great urgency. The Japanese have been doing it for 15
years. If we do it at the same pace, we will never catch up. With our
western culture and western thinking we must make quantum leaps in
continuous improvement.'
Piech says that Volkswagen still needs 30-32 hours to build a Golf at its
giant Wolfsburg works in Germany; the best Japanese companies take 12 hours
to build a car. Within the VW group, however, it has some plants, such as
its Polo small car production facility at Pamplona in Spain, that are
reaching Japanese efficiency levels.
'Before me, the big plants worked like independent companies . . . If we had
a quality problem at one plant, the other did not know how the problem was
solved.'
Since January VW has taken 'drastic measures', but he accepts that it will
take five to six years before VW has reached the target of a 70 per cent
break-even level.
Even the French, the most effective European carmakers, have had a 20 per
cent cost advantage over Volkswagen, says Piech, and the best Japanese have
a 25-30 per cent lead.
He insists that the competitive gap within Europe can be closed in two to
three years, however, and he looks to the transformation of the Swiss watch
industry for a model to show that the west can also match the Japanese.
'This gives me confidence that with European creativity - it does not just
have to be European - with western creativity we are absolutely in the
position to face the Japanese and to win.'

FT  07 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on vulnerable
post-election peseta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attention in financial markets will focus on Spain this week with analysts
anxious to see how the beleaguered peseta reacts to the outcome of
yesterday's general election and whether the authorities will be able to cut
interest rates further, writes Gillian Tett.
There are fears that the peseta, which has undergone a cumulative 20 per
cent devaluation over the last 10 months, could come under renewed pressure.
'Whoever wins the election, the peseta will be very vulnerable to
speculative attack,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, economist at UBS in London.
With Spanish unemployment running at 21.7 per cent during the first quarter
of this year, the new government 'will face enormous pressure for a swift
reduction in interest rates', said Mr Persaud. Some analysts fear that any
strife for the peseta could undermine the lira in Italy, which has regional
elections this week.
After the dollar's 3-pfennig rise against the D-Mark in Friday's trading,
the markets will be watching both currencies closely this week, to see
whether their faith in the US economic recovery - and their fears about the
slowdown in Germany - are justified.
The US producer price index figures for May, due on Friday and expected to
show a 0.2 per cent increase on the month, should give reassurance that
inflationary pressures are under control after last week's strong US
employment data.
Meanwhile, in spite of the recent softening of the D-Mark, and the refusal
of the Bundesbank to reduce rates last week, there is growing expectation
that the Bundesbank might finally cut its repurchase rate this week.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Survey of Uruguay (6): A market in the making / Interview
with President Luis Alberto Lacalle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUESTION: The Mercosur common market (bringing together Uruguay with Brazil,
Argentina and Paraguay) seems to be hitting some problems,does it not?
Answer: It's the old-as-history difference between what you want and what
you can do, which is the great mystery and attraction of politics.
You can say that we set a very short calendar of five years but that's one
of the virtues of the treaty of Asuncion (which established Mercosur). The
deadline has provoked inside our countries a movement towards change. That's
especially necessary in our country. Perhaps, we won't have a complete
perfect 100 per cent common market at the deadline at the end of December
1994. But we have agreed that we will have an external tariff, which is an
important goal. It will be around 20 per cent - of course with exceptions.
We are very keen in Uruguay that it must be lowish to prevent a closed
market that can't be touched.
Q: What about the accession of other members?
A: The treaty is a shortish treaty with 35 or something articles. One very
specific article says all countries are invited, but they cannot be part of
other pacts or treaties to become members of Mercosur. So at the moment no
country can enter if it's a member of Andean Pact, for instance, or the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
We are trying to provide the possibility of Bolivia becoming a member
because it is very keen. Bolivia has her own way to the ocean through the
rivers and the river Plate and our port in Palmira and the ports in
Argentina: so Bolivia, like the rest of us, is leaning towards the Atlantic.
Q: What about the possibility, raised by the US administration, that
Argentina, along with Chile and Venezuela, might have accession to Nafta?
A: Well, I do think that we should approach this step by step. Nafta is not
a reality yet, so that's a big if. The integration movement in Latin America
must be modular and step by step. When you think of Mercosur, it is made
real by geography. You look at the rivers, at the Parana, Paraguay and
Uruguay: it's a tree of rivers whose trunk is the River Plate and whose
roots are in the Atlantic: that's why Mercosur makes sense and that's why
the accession of Bolivia is reasonable.
It's the same for Mexico, Canada and the United States. So I think the
integration movement mustn't go to the top from the beginning - let's say
all America, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. No, nonsense. It's very
difficult to do what we're trying to do. So the idea for this generation and
perhaps another one is to try and make these things work.
Q: Enthusiasm in Uruguay for Mercosur appears to be waning.
A: It's like marriage: it seems ideal before, but it's not that ideal. There
are certain words that have a good press: integration is one of them. But
then when you say to people in business that you must restructure, when you
tell workers that some jobs may be lost, when you tell young people that
they must prepare themselves better in education, then people realise
integration provides opportunities not certainties.
It means you must change, and change is difficult in a country like mine, as
was shown when the private enterprise law - the very timid privatisation we
proposed - was beaten in referendum so the signals are mixed.
Q: The modernisation of the state that we have seen in other Latin American
countries appears to be progressing slowly here.
A: Some things have gone ahead. Congress has approved the port reform law.
Now, we are lowering our tariffs at the port and cutting by half the waiting
time for ships. One other thing was the possibility of the utility company
to buy energy from private companies.
The general law on enterprises, which included a special chapter on the
telephone company, had 32 articles, of which only five were contested by the
referendum (in 1992). Of course, those contested were the most important but
the rest are on the books. I think are mixed feelings in the country about
privatisation but the vote in the referendum was in one sense a vote against
the government. All the propaganda was around 'vote against the government,
vote against the government vote against the government'. Of course, the
state enterprise sector was never as extended here as it was in Argentina.
We have in broad figures about 260,000 public employees, of which about
60,000 work for the public companies.
Q: One problem you have is the dependence of a large number of people on the
state.
A: An enormous number people depend on the state. We have about 450,000
pensioners more or less. They draw 600,000 pensions because some people get
two. With public employees that makes a total of 700,000, and we have a
workforce of 1.1m. The system allows people to retire very early: women at
55 after 30 years of work and men at 60. We had intended to go deep into
reform. In the end, a smallish reform was made.
Q: Why do you think that in contrast to the rest of Latin America, the left
continues to make gains.?
A: I think it's very difficult to explain. Here we had one of the the oldest
two-party systems, going back to 1836. The country was built on the
assumption that there would be two parties: the whites and the reds. The
left begun to unite itself in 1971, and now they account for 30-something
per cent. The two traditional parties are what the Americans would call
catch-all parties; they are vertical cross sections of the entire society.
This is something which the coalition of the left has a shield against: they
are more class-minded.
Q: Does this mean political reform is necessary?
A: Well it's a very peculiar system. In each election, there is a built-in
primary. It's built on the assumption that before anything voters want their
party to win; then inside the party they prefer candidate A against
candidate B. The problem starts after the election, the morning after,
because you need to build a coalition inside the party and when you are a
minority in government to go to other parties. That is why it is so complex
and difficult to organise.
Q: So is constitutional reform likely?
A: It's a legal possibility but not a real possibility. The constitution is
very rigid when it comes to changing itself. You need very big majorities.
Q: Your party is in a minority in Congress and you can't even rely on all
your party to support you. Would it be fair to describe you as a lame duck?
A: We still have executive power and we do what we can. For example we were
able to renegotiate the external debt. As soon as it requires a change in
the law, then it is more difficult. And of course we secured passage of the
enterprise law, then we were defeated in the referendum.
Q: What are the priorities for the remainder of your term?
A: We are fighting for a bill on the de-monopolisation of insurance and of
alcohol production, which is a state monopoly. We will keep on trying; it's
always difficult because it's difficult to get consensus among members of
parliament. Then there is always the menace of a plebiscite. You only need
10,000 people to sign a petition.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Survey of Uruguay (7): Pensioners have powerful political
muscles - The welfare state must break with the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLD people may not be a majority in Uruguay, but they they have enough
political muscle to prevent any threat to their interests.
However, unless Uruguay changes the way it cares for the aged, the
pensioners will eventually bankrupt the state.
The grey panthers are powerful because they are numerous and well organised.
Uruguay has a small population of 3.1m people and a stagnant birth rate,
with the result that there are now only two working people for every
pensioner.
About 500,000 people draw a government pension and, unsurprisingly, the
state-run pension fund is bust.
Mr Carlos Cat, the planning and budget minister, says that last year the
treasury had to pump Dollars 200m - about 2 per cent of GDP - into the
pension fund. Social security spending, which is mainly pensions, accounts
for an astonishing 17 per cent of GDP, Mr Cat says.
The deficit was made worse by a 1989 plebiscite; almost 85 per cent of
voters agreed with the pensioners' associations that the government should
index pensions. Now, as inflation falls, pensioners are getting real rises,
because indexation reflects past increases in the cost of living.
The fund's deficit has risen inexorably every year since 1989, and Mr Cat
now says the deficit could hit Dollars 500m within a few years. However,
nobody is saying that state pensions are generous: they are capped at seven
times the minimum wage, giving a maximum Dollars 550m monthly pension.
But government efforts to modify the pension and social security have
suffered the same fate in Congress as its attempts to privatise state
companies.
Politicians are not only unwilling to confront the powerful grey lobby, but
also they reflect a typically Uruguayan conservatism. Mr Cat says the
opposition once rejected the government's alarming financial calculations.
After hours of debate, he convinced the politicians to accept his data. But
they still refused to act.
The welfare state was born in Uruguay in 1903 (and not in postwar Britain)
when Jose Batlle y Ordonez was elected president and used the country's
enormous wealth, earned from beef exports, to provide a range of public
social and educational services. Although Uruguay is no longer wealthy and
governments have run down the welfare state over the years through
underfunding, conservative Uruguayans are still loath to make a break with
the past.
However, Professor Adela Pellegrino, a specialist in demographics at
Montevideo's Universidad de la Republica, disagrees with the doomsters. She
says Uruguay's demographic pyramid is not as lopsided as is widely believed.
In fact, Uruguay's demographics are better than west European countries,
where over one quarter of the population is aged over 65.
She points out that 11 per cent of the population in Uruguay is over 65, and
one quarter is under 15. This means that people of working age, between
16-64, make up two-thirds of the population. Women make up a larger part of
the working population of about 1.2m people than elsewhere in Latin America.
The pension issue is therefore something of a red herring. It is undoubtedly
in need of radical reform and evasion of social security contributions needs
to be stamped out, but Uruguay hardly risks collapsing under the weight of
its pensioners.
Dr Pellegrino argues that the aged use their political muscle to win a
disproportionate share of national income, to the detriment of the poor, or
education.
As well as unfair, this has serious long term macroeconomic implications:
the country is investing too little in improving the quality of its future
working population.
Over one quarter of Uruguay's population is poor and 40 per cent of children
are born in poverty. Furthermore, the poor are the fastest-growing sector of
the population. In Montevideo, a poor woman will have an average of 3.6
children; a university-educated woman will have fewer than two.
While pensions account for about 17 per cent of gross domestic product,
education gets 3 per cent of GDP; a low figure even by regional standards -
and half the level in developed countries.
Dr Pellegrino suggests that reforms, such as unifying the retirement age,
would free money for spending on children, on the poor and on young mothers.
Not only would this be fairer, but also it would increase the birth rate and
reduce social inequalities. In addition, the more educated and skilled
people are, the likelier they are to enter the formal economy and contribute
to the pension fund.
However, Dr Pellegrino says that emigration - not ageing - is probably
Uruguay's most serious demographic problem.
In the politically troubled 1970s about 11 per cent of the population
emigrated, although emigration has since fallen. There is no precise data on
current migration flows, but one third of youths in Montevideo say they
would rather live elsewhere.
Emigration is bad because it accentuates the proportion of the aged in the
population and reduces potential economic growth, because emigrants usually
have above average skills. It is also costly, because Uruguay invests in
emigrants' education but does not benefit from their labour.
The brain drain is particularly damaging for a small country like Uruguay:
the emigration of 50 scientists is a significant loss.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Survey of Uruguay (3): Lacalle's dream is shattered - John
Barham notes the unpopularity of free market policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URUGUAY is riven by a vicious factionalism that contrasts strangely with the
placid, somewhat complacent, conservatism of its national character.
Political backstabbing, squabbling and divisiveness have shattered President
Luis Alberto Lacalle's ambition of turning the country into a free market
paradise.
Mr Lacalle's determination to pursue unpopular economic policies has been
stymied by his lack of charisma and political savoir faire. The opposition
has successfully blocked his efforts to reform the state, privatise
companies and revamp the bankrupt state pension fund. Coalition allies and
even members of his National party (usually known as the Blanco party)
deserted him in the first years of his government.
Uruguay's electoral system militates against disciplined political parties
which could provide governments with majorities in Congress. It combines
primary elections with presidential elections. Voters select rival
candidates from each party and the candidate with the most votes wins. This
has led to the emergence of factions which are often as hostile to each
other as they are to opposing parties.
At the November 1989 election, the Blancos won less than 50 per cent of the
vote and although Mr Lacalle had more votes than any other candidate, he was
elected by only 22 per cent of the population. As president, he has never
managed to build additional support and his positive ratings in the opinion
polls rarely exceed 20 per cent.
He is unable to command a solid majority in Congress to push through his
reform programme. In the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, he can count
on 27 out of 99 members. In the Senate only between four and seven of its 31
members back the government. Every item of legislation has to be negotiated
with the opposition Colorado and Frente Amplio parties and rival Blanco
factions.
However, Mr Lacalle can draw comfort from the fact that the opposition is
equally divided. Its attempt last month to sack Mr Ignacio de Posadas, the
finance minister, failed by 36 votes to 59 - although two independent Blanco
deputies voted against Mr de Posadas.
Even if Mr Lacalle can negotiate in the smoke-filled rooms of Congress, he
must still contend with the unyielding conservatism of the Uruguayan people.
Suspicion, even resentment, of his free market policies runs deep.
Uruguayans who have lived under a welfare state for almost a century are
unwilling to change. Slogans like 'solidarity' and 'unity' still carry real
weight. There is also a widely-felt perception that Uruguay's state
companies are working reasonably well and therefore do not justify
privatisation.
Even a sympathetic former Blanco cabinet minister comments that Mr Lacalle
has made a mistake in pursuing so fundamentalist an economic policy:
'Gradually people are recognising that things need to change, but the people
do not accept radical solutions.'
All this became brutally clear in last December's referendum: the electorate
overwhelmingly rejected a government plan to privatise five state companies.
The opposition took 72 per cent of the vote.
The government has still not fully recovered from its defeat. It says the
opposition campaigned for a No vote for purely political reasons, rather
than on the issues at stake. Mr Lacalle said: 'All the propaganda was around
'vote against the government, vote against the government vote against the
government.''
Government supporters criticise the Colorados for openly attacking Mr
Lacalle, while discreetly supporting him. This is because they do not wish
to be identified with his policies, but realise they are necessary. The
former minister says: 'They want Lacalle to do all the dirty work.'
Another important reason for the rejection of reform is that about one in
four Uruguayans depends on the state in one way or another. About 450,000
people draw state pensions and a further 270,000 work for the government or
for state companies. Politicians have traditionally used government jobs as
a source of political patronage or to disguise unemployment. Some estimates
put the number of surplus public employees as high as 80,000.
Organised labour, led by bank workers and public sector unions including the
police, teachers and civil servants, has called eight general strikes
against Mr Lacalle's government. These strikes - the last held in May - have
further damaged the president's image. Efforts to reform the pension fund
are foundering in the face of determined opposition by Uruguay's pensioners'
associations.
Mr Lacalle's perseverance with deeply unpopular policies is remarkable. It
is hardly surprising that ministers often sound frustrated and resigned. Mr
Carlos Cat, the planning and budget minister and head of the Blanco party
committee, comments: 'We have failed to get important structural reforms
that are fundamental to modernise the country, stabilise the economy and get
reasonable inflation. We are frustrated, but we are not resigned. We are not
going to lower our arms. We are like Don Quixote tilting at windmills. We
will go on.'
The next elections are scheduled for November 1994 and Mr Lacalle is due to
hand over power in March 1995. The presidential campaign is already
beginning to warm up. There are two leading candidates. The Colorado's Mr
Julio Maria Sanguinetti, Mr Lacalle's immediate predecessor, is a strong
(though undeclared) candidate. Mr Tabare Vazquez, the charismatic socialist
mayor of Montevideo, has yet formally to toss his hat into the ring for the
left-wing Frente Amplio.
The neatly groomed Mr Vazquez, a practising oncologist, is clearly moving to
the right to broaden his appeal. He says the left has adopted conservative
ideas such as the importance of low inflation, strong public finances, an
efficient civil service and acceptance of private enterprise. He argues that
telecommunications and other strategic state companies should never be
privatised and that the state should retain a strong regulatory role to
guide the market.
He says the Blancos are 'also seeking this but with a dehumanised concept
that says 'we have to adjust employment, the balance of trade and debt and
discusses numbers,' without looking at what is happening with the people. If
the government can get a Dollars 300m Inter-American Development Bank loan
to set up a financial system, why can't it get a Dollars 30-40m loan for
emergency housing?'

FT  07 JUN 93 / Survey of Uruguay (2): Time bomb of dependents / Assessing
the prospects for the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS little doubt that the Uruguayan economy looks in significantly
better shape than when the government of President Luis Alberto Lacalle took
office in March 1991. Real growth rose to about 7 per cent last year from
just under 2 per cent in 1991 and less than 1 per cent in 1990.
Inflation has been more than halved from 1990's 129 per cent - though it has
not fallen as fast as the International Monetary Fund would have liked. The
government's fiscal deficit has also been cut dramatically from 7.4 per cent
of gross domestic product in 1989 to less than 1 per cent last year. This
has been helped mainly by higher tax revenues, thanks in part to tax
measures agreed soon after the government took office, and a reduction in
servicing charges on foreign debt - because of lower US interest rates and a
negotiated debt reduction deal completed by the government in 1991.
The question is whether the improving trend can last. According to the New
York bank JP Morgan, the economic achievements of bringing down the budget
deficit, reducing inflation and spurring growth 'have owed much to policies
of doubtful sustainability along with external events of fortuitous and
transitory benefit'.
Morgan argues that growth will slow as the boom in neighbouring Argentina
peters out, while the government's fiscal position will be hurt as tax
increases - including a 1990 increase in value-added tax - are scaled back
at the end of this year.
The government's ability to find a long-term balance in its accounts
received a setback with its failure - in a referendum in December - to
secure important parts of its privatisation programme. This not only
deprived it of revenues from the sale of, for example, the telephone company
 -but also of wage savings and future tax revenues.
Furthermore, a policy of suppressing wage increases in the public sector -
which has seen its standard of living fall compared with the private sector
 -may not be durable.
On top of that, the strong exchange rate - an appreciation of the real
exchange rate has helped to bring down inflation - is hitting the country's
trade position and beginning to cause strains in industry. Uruguay's first
quarter trade deficit of Dollars 181m this year was close to half that for
the whole of 1992 as consumer goods imports appeared to be continuing to
rise.
Yet the government - like many others in Latin America - is having to deal
with significant inflows of capital. If it allowed the exchange rate to
float, it would be higher than it is now. Currency market intervention to
reduce the appreciation has led reserves to increase - at around Dollars 1bn
they cover seven to eight months of imports - but has added to the money
supply, keeping inflationary pressures high.
Mr Ignacio de Posadas, Uruguay's finance minister, sees a cup at least half
full. Growth this year is going to be above expectations, though perhaps
down on last year; both investment and consumption is up, while unemployment
has fallen. Inflation is also down - wholesale prices are rising at around 1
per cent a month, the lowest level for many years.
This has been achieved amid the poor external environment for some of
Uruguay's main agricultural exports - the country suffers both from Europe's
relatively closed market and the effect on third markets of the dumping of
European produce - and the drought three years ago which severely depleted
stocks of beef cattle. The economy is no longer dependent on agriculture as
it was half-a-century ago and is much more reliant on services, including
tourism which has benefited from Argentina's growth and its strong currency.
There is evidence that growth in Argentina may this year be stronger than
most forecasts have been suggesting, while Brazil - whose economy contracted
1 per cent last year - is likely to enjoy positive, if modest, growth this
year.
Nonetheless, Mr de Posadas implicitly acknowledges the economy may be
overheating. 'The government's policy hasn't been as strongly
counter-cyclical as it needed to be,' he said in an interview. The
government in March pushed through a series of cost-cutting measures that
did not require congressional approval.
Whatever the short-term outlook, however, there is little doubt that the
fundamental challenges facing the Uruguayan economy have not been
successfully addressed by the Lacalle government, in part because it has
been unable to secure the necessary support in Congress for reform.
The key to the problem is the high dependency of many people on the state:
social security - pensions, health subsidies and unemployment payments -
gobble up 17 per cent of gross domestic product and more than half of the
government's budget - a massive burden for a relatively poor country.
Long-term, government and opposition politicians admit that this time bomb -
the growing burden on the social security system - will have to be
addressed. Yet it is a problem that - because of the voting power of
pensioners - is one that politicians are unwilling to raise.
With perhaps 450,000 people claiming 600,000 pensions - and a further
260,000 people working for the state out of a total workforce of 1.1m, the
dependence on the government is high. 'We have a ratio of passive to active
population of 1.4 or 1.5. No social security system in the world can work on
a ratio of below three,' says Mr de Posadas.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Survey of Uruguay (4): Caught in the crossfire - Farming
suffers from subsidised competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is a familiar story. Efficient, unsubsidised farmers, most of them in the
developing world, are slowly being forced out of business by less efficient
but heavily subsidised competitors in the US and the EC.
Uruguay, which depends on agricultural exports for about 70 per cent of its
hard currency revenues, is caught in the crossfire of the subsidies war.
There is little the government can do except protest at this injustice and
call for a rapid conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT trade
liberalisation talks.
As if this was not bad enough, farmers complain that an increasingly
overvalued currency is further corroding their incomes - nearly all tied to
dollar-denominated export prices. The Rural Association of Uruguay says the
exchange rate is overvalued by about 30-35 per cent.
Farming is still the cornerstone of the economy. Agriculture may only
account for about 10-12 per cent of GDP, but it is the main earner of
foreign currency. Falling export revenues inevitably affect the rest of the
economy.
Uruguay, which is blessed with some of the world's finest soil, grew rich on
its beef and wool exports to Britain in the early years of this century. It
generated the wealth which enabled Uruguay to begin setting up in 1903 what
would become the world's first welfare state.
The greatest victims of adverse international conditions are sheep farmers.
Wool prices have collapsed in the last four years - hitting their lowest
point in real terms this century. A kilo of wool today fetches o more than
Dollars 1.50 against Dollars 4 in 1989.
The crash in prices is the result of a failure of attempts to control the
international market through buffer stocks and interventions, compounded by
the drop in demand from big markets in China and the former Soviet Union.
The result is a steady drop in production: last year Uruguay produced 82.8m
kgs of wool, compared with 96.7m kgs two year earlier.
But farmers can do little to escape the pressures of falling prices. Mr
Pedro Saravia, agriculture minister, says the adverse international scene
hits the small and undercapitalised farmers. Larger and wealthier farms are
better able to cope.
The social impact on the countryside is grim. About 70 per cent of Uruguay's
farms are made up of small (by Uruguayan standards) properties of less than
1,000 hectares. Mr Saravia says: 'People are always leaving the land for the
city the world over, and at times of crisis this worsens.'
He is quick to point out that the government is not standing idly by: 'We
are improving farmers' profits by liberalising the market more and reducing
the incidence of the state, lowering costs by reducing taxes and
inefficiency.'
For example, he says the government has helped farmers by cutting taxes on
fuel to 15 per cent from over 50 per cent. He hopes to eliminate the tax
altogether by the end of the year.
The government also wants to do away with remaining export taxes. At
present, exporters must hand over 5-10 per cent of revenues to the tax
authorities. For instance, exports of boned beef are taxed at 5 per cent;
before, all beef products were taxed. All taxes on wool have been removed.
There are limits to liberalisation, though. Congress and the electorate have
both rejected government proposals to privatise utilities and infrastructure
(although the port of Montevideo is undergoing some limited restructuring).
Farmers, of course, see things differently. Mr Urioste, president of the
Rural Association, says taxes are still too high: 'Farmers contribute more
than other sectors. An average-sized wool or cattle farm of 1,000 hectares
pays 38 per cent of its gross output in taxes.' Fuel taxes may have fallen,
he concedes, but farmers must still pay heavy land and sales taxes, which he
estimates at Dollars 270m a year.
The outlook is not entirely grim. Agriculture grew by 7 per cent, in line
with the expansion of the economy last year, thanks mainly to increased
production of non-traditional crops such as rice and fruit and vegetables.
Price are now beginning to show some improvement. In May, wholesale farm
prices - led mainly by beef and dairy products - rose 6.3 per cent, almost
double the rise in the wholesale price index.
Mr Urioste says that Uruguay has become the first country to eradicate foot
and mouth disease through mass cattle vaccination. This should help open new
markets for Uruguay's beef exports.
Despite these encouraging signs, there is little chance that the
international context will improve dramatically in the foreseeable future.
Falling prices are powering a vicious circle in which declining revenues
lead to a fall in investments and yields.
Uruguay needs to find an alternative use for its huge fertile prairies.
Imitating Chile's widely-praised development of export markets for
sophisticated fruit and vegetables is not entirely appropriate for a country
with land ideal for extensive farming.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Survey of Uruguay (1): Reforming the welfare state -
Uruguay's quality of life is close to the levels of some western European
countries.  Uruguay also has the oldest welfare state in the world - a heavy
burden on the economy. But how long can it be sustained?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and JOHN BARHAM

<TEXT>
URUGUAYANS have long enjoyed a higher quality of life than the rest of Latin
America. According to the United Nations Development Programme, they still
do.
The programme's Human Development Index - which brings together of economic
and social indicators such as life expectancy, adult literacy and income -
rates Uruguay's quality of life higher than any other Latin American country
and close to the levels of some western European countries.
Not surprisingly, Uruguayans are keen to preserve this. They see as the key
to their living standards the privileges they enjoy under their welfare
state - the oldest in the world, dating back to 1903 and the administration
of President Jose Batlle y Ordonez.
As a result, they have proved deeply resistant to the forces of economic
reform and modernisation which have swept the rest of Latin America.
Uruguayans' deeply embedded conservatism has conspired against change.
Attempts to join the regional reform movement by the government of President
Luis Alberto Lacalle, which took office in March 1990, have, by and large,
failed.
Yet the current social welfare system represents an increasingly heavy
burden on the state which sooner or later will become unsustainable. The
question is not whether the welfare state can survive in its current form,
but when and how will it be changed.
The central problem is the high ratio of those who depend on or work for the
state compared with the rest of the active population.
The country has a workforce of about 1.1m, of which about 270,000 work for
the state, including 60,000 who work for state enterprises. A further
450,000 people are drawing an estimated 600,000 pensions.
'We have a ratio of passive to active population of 1.4 or 1.5. No social
security system in the world can work on a ratio of below three,' says Mr
Ignacio de Posadas, Uruguay's minister of finance.
The pension fund is bankrupt and relies on continual injections from the
treasury. The civil service and state companies are overstaffed, suffer low
productivity and are in general poorly managed.
Mr Michele Santo, a columnist for the weekly Busqueda newspaper, says that
80,000 of the 270,000 public employees are surplus to requirements  - this
is a hidden unemployment subsidy which has led to the 'hypocrisy that they
pretend to work and we pretend to pay them'.
But, although politicians from all parts of the political spectrum admit
that the reform of the state and the welfare system are serious problems
which will have to be confronted, they prefer that they should be confronted
in the future.
Efforts to reform the pensions system are foundering in the face of
determined opposition by pensioners, who in Uruguay are highly organised.
But the inability to move ahead with reform is not only a result of grey
power, but also of a deeply factionalised political system that makes strong
policy action difficult.
This vicious factionalism - President Lacalle's Partido Nacional is split
into four factions which are as often as hostile to each other as to
opposing parties - is in part a result of an electoral system which combines
primary and presidential elections.
The Partido Nacional won less than 50 per cent of the vote in the November
1989 election and the Herreristas (the faction supporting Mr Lacalle) got
half his party's vote. The result was that Mr Lacalle - the second civilian
president after 12 years of military rule which ended in 1985 - was elected
by 22 per cent of the population. Mr Lacalle has therefore been unable to
count on a solid majority in Congress. Only the 24 Herreristas and a handful
of deputies from another faction support him.
ALTHOUGH Mr Lacalle managed to squeeze through Congress a proposal aimed at
a modest privatisation of some state enterprises, including selling a stake
in the telephone monoply, he suffered a crushing defeat in a privatisation
referendum in December.
The December referendum - plebiscites are another feature of Uruguay's
political system which makes decisive policy action difficult (only 10,000
signatures are needed to call one) - damaged Mr Lacalle's standing, possibly
irreversibly. His popularity is also low - his approval rating in some cases
has fallen to 20 oer cents.
Mr Lacalle's critics say he lacks the political skills to negotiate and has
needlessly alienated Congress. His opponents, led by former president Mr
Mario Sanguinetti, have withdrawn support for measures they would probably
have to adopt if in office.
The government has been described as a lame duck, although elections are
only due in November 1994 and Mr Lacalle hands over power in March 1995.
Mr Lacalle says: 'We still have executive power and we do what we can. For
example we were able to renegotiate the external debt. As soon as it
requires a change in the law, then it is more difficult.'
Mr Carlos Cat, the planning and budget minister and president of the Blanco
party committee, comments: 'We failed by not getting important structural
reforms that were fundamental to modernise the country, stabilise the
economy and get reasonable inflation.'
Unlike Argentina, the Uruguayan head of state can do little by decree - 'we
have to do it all by law,' says Mr Cat.
He is deeply frustrated by the silliness of Congress: he recalls that a
government plan to close a finance ministry office and sending its 200-plus
employees home on full pay was vetoed in congress, which ordered the
goverment to reinstate the bureacrats.
A former cabinet minister argues that, slowly but surely, economic reality
is pressing in on Uruguay.
He adds that the economy's performance is sound: although still low, the
investment rate has increased 20 per cent a year every year. The growth in
employment (150,000 new jobs since 1983) has come exclusively from the
private sector.
He says Lacalle's opposition is acting tactically: it opposes his policies
virulently as a vote-catching gimmick, but shrinks from halting them - as
illustrated in the failure of the vote of censure last month against Mr de
Posadas.
In other words, the opposition wants President Lacalle to do the dirty work
 -'gradually people are recognising that things need to change, but the
people do not accept radical solutions.' A sign of changing attitudes is
that 'breadwinners no longer want to work in the public sector.'
An example of the convergence of political attitudes is Mr Tabare Vazquez,
the charismatic left wing mayor of Montevideo, elected in 1989 on the left
wing coalition ticket of Frente Amplio. Initially raising wages and
subsidising public transport, he is now adopting more conventional policies.
Mr Vazquez has ideas of political decentralisation and equity in social
policies that would fit into - for example - the mainstream of the British
Labour Party or even the Tories' wet fringe. He is likely to become the
Frente Amplio's candidate in next year's elections, although he denies he's
interested in the presidency. However, he is clearly moving to the right and
trying to broaden his appeal:
'I believe in a model state that gives the possibility of participation to
all, without distinction, including private investment and even foreign
investment and that the right to profit will condition that investment.'
The labour unions however remain a power in the land - a series of general
strikes against the government have not helped Mr Lacalle's popularity - and
are still dominated by largely unreconstructed leftists with few new ideas.
Mr Jose D'Elia, head of the PIT-CNT labour confederation, says President
Lacalle's policies are being 'dictated from the financial and political
centres of power,' threatening democracy and employment.
That does not mean change is not taking place. The Lacalle government has
taken the country into Mercosur, the southern cone customs union which also
groups Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay and is scheduled to come into force at
the start of 1995.
The country is less dependent on agriculture than it was half a century ago,
but it is still a trading nation. Trade accounts for nearly two-fifths of
gross domestic product, meaning it is remains highly susceptible to
protectionist policies in Europe and elsewhere and to low commodities
prices.
Despite the relatively high standard of living in Uruguay, the country's
20th century economic history has been one of gentle decline. It remains
apart from most of the rest of Latin America. Its problems of an ageing
population are more akin to those of Europe or Japan than most of the
countries around it.

FT  07 JUN 93 / The Week Ahead: BAA flies in on upgraded forecasts - Results
due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the airport operator, has enjoyed upgraded forecasts in recent weeks
ahead of its full-year results today.
Traffic growth has meant more revenues from landing fees and retail trade.
Pre-tax profits could approach Pounds 300m against Pounds 192m. A Pounds 30m
gain on the sale of its electrical distribution network will be offset by
provisions on property.
Northern Foods is expected to report on Wednesday pre-tax profits for the
full year a shade above Pounds 150m, up from Pounds 126.2m a year earlier.
The forecast increase reflects a strong performance by short shelf-life
foods, notably the convenience meals supplied to Marks &amp; Spencer, and
continued gains from post-acquisition rationalisation of the Express milk
operations.
However, biscuits and other grocery products are expected to show the impact
of recession, while high beef and pork prices have offset the benefits of
efficiency improvements in the processed meat businesses.
Unigate, the food and distribution group, is expected tomorrow to announce
profits almost unchanged at Pounds 93m for the year to March 31.
Analysts will be watching to see whether the company has recovered from a
disappointing first half, and also at Unigate's gearing levels.
Last month the company postponed an initial public offering of its US
restaurant business, which had been designed to reduce net borrowings.
Pilkington, the glass group which announces results on Thursday, is expected
to announce a sharp fall in profits from Pounds 77m to Pounds 37m for the
year to March 31.
But attention is likely to focus on Pilkington's cash flow and the dividend,
which the company maintained by raiding reserves at the interim stage.
Analysts will also be keen to hear more about Pilkington's plan to make a
joint bid to acquire Societa Italiana Vetro from the Italian authorities.
Vodafone, the cellular telephone network spun off from Racal, has benefited
from a sharp increase in new subscribers. Pre-tax profits for the year to
March, to be announced tomorrow, are forecast at about Pounds 320m against
Pounds 272m a year earlier.
PowerGen, the smaller of the two main electricity generators, has seen a
small erosion of its market share during the year but cost cutting will have
helped it life pre-tax profits to about Pounds 415m from Pounds 359m.
Christian Salvesen, the distribution group, is expected to report pre-tax
profits for the year to March of around Pounds 75m.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Economics: US inflation fears may ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS in the US that inflation is about to pick up should be allayed this
week if economists' expectations for May producer price inflation prove
correct.
The median forecast is for a rise of 0.2 per cent on the month, following an
unusual 0.6 per cent jump in April.
A sharp 0.4 per cent rise in the so-called core measure of producer price
inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, added to concerns
in April. The core measure for May is forecast to have risen by 0.2 per
cent.
Many analysts believe that the April figures should prove to be an exception
rather than the start of a new trend. In April, price increases for new cars
and tobacco products contributed half of the price rise in the total. Last
month, by contrast, food and energy prices probably declined slightly after
a few months of volatile, but mainly large increases.
Retail sales figures are also out in the US this week. They are expected to
have risen more moderately last month than they did in April. Car sales were
again strong in May following a 3 per cent rise in April.
According to analysts at Midland Global Markets, cars have been the
strongest sales component since the recovery began. Building materials are
also expected to have grown robustly in May.
In the UK, April consumer credit figures are out today. They are expected to
be slightly less robust than in March, reflecting the weakness of retail
sales activity during the month. On Thursday the Central Statistical Office
releases the 1993 edition of Regional Trends, which brings together a wide
range of statistical information on the regions of the UK.
The following are some of the week's other economic highlights. Figures in
brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International, the
financial information company.
Today: UK, April consumer credit (up Pounds 150m). Spain, May official
reserves (Dollars 44.4bn). Sweden, International Monetary Conference - lasts
until Wednesday. US, April consumer credit (up Dollars 3.3bn). Australia,
May ANZ job ads; April retail trade (up 1 per cent on month); Foundation Day
 -Western Australian markets.
Tomorrow: Sweden, Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, addresses
International Monetary Conference. US, April wholesale trade; Johnson
Redbook, week ended June 5. Australia, Q1 housing starts; Council of
Australia government meeting.
Wednesday: US, chairman of National Economic Council addresses Amex
conference in Washington. Sweden, Greenspan and Schlesinger scheduled to
take part in discussion at International Monetary Conference. Japan, Royal
Wedding - all markets closed.
Thursday: Sweden, May consumer prices index (up 0.1 per cent on month, up
5.1 per cent on year). Norway, May CPI (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 2.6 per
cent on year). Germany, holiday in most parts, Frankfurt markets closed. US,
initial claims (339,000), state benefits; 1992 capital spending; money
supply data for week ended May 31; May monthly money supply, M1 (up Dollars
22bn), M2 (up Dollars 27bn), M3 (up Dollars 28bn). Australia, May employment
(up 48,000 on year), May unemployment rate (10.8 per cent).
Friday: France, May CPI (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 2.2 per cent on year),
US, May retail sales (up 0.8 per cent), excluding autos (up 0.5 per cent),
May PPI (up 0.2 per cent on month), excluding food and drink (up 0.2 per
cent on month). Japan, Bank of Japan releases May Tankan Survey.
During the week: Germany, May cost of living, April retail sales (down 1.7
per cent on year). Netherlands, May CPI (up 0.1 per cent on month, up 2.2
per cent on year). Switzerland, Geneva and Zurich CPIs for May, Federal CPI

FT  07 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Cemex issue paves way for Latin
American groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Cementos Mexicanos, Mexico's large cement company, issued Dollars 1bn
of bonds in the Euromarket last month, several records were set.
Cemex became the first fully Latin American company to offer Dollars 1bn of
bonds in a single bite, and the first to obtain investment grade status for
its bonds from a rating agency, albeit from the relatively low-profile Duff
&amp; Phelps.
The transaction, which was priced at 370 basis points over the comparable US
Treasury yield and met heavy demand, represents a new acceptance of Latin
American companies in international markets and paves the way for more
issues.
Last week, the Chilean company Celulosa Arauco y Constitucion issued
Mexico's first straight bond, for Dollars 150m, at just 210 basis points
over US Treasury - the tightest yield spread to date for a Latin American
company.
Both these deals raised the question of the risk of buying foreign-currency
bonds from Latin American companies that in the past have suffered from
steep currency devaluations. While Latin American names are broadly viewed
as improving credits, there is a danger that the tightening of spreads and
the supply of paper could run ahead of their growing credit strength.
Both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two main US rating agencies,
continue to grade Mexican foreign currency sovereign bonds as speculative
(unlike Chilean bonds). Under rating agencies' rules, the grade on a
country's sovereign bond acts as an effective ceiling for that of its
corporate bonds.
Since Duff &amp; Phelps had given Mexican sovereign bonds investment grade last
month, Cemex approached the agency for investment grade status. Some US
institutions, prohibited from buying speculative grade bonds, were therefore
able to take up the Cemex bonds, said JP Morgan, who jointly managed the
offering. For many US investors, this issue was the first Mexican offering
they had bought.
However, Mr Philip Bates, managing director at S&amp;P, emphasised that
obtaining investment grade from Duff &amp; Phelps is not the same as from S&amp;P or
Moody's, both of which are widely used by investors internationally. He said
it was reasonable to assume that Mexico's sovereign rating from S&amp;P would
remain speculative this year.
'Some people would like to pretend the 1980s did not exist, but they did,'
said Mr William Chambers, director of S&amp;P, noting that not long ago Mexico's
economic policy was in disarray and the country defaulted on its foreign
bank debt. While current economic policy is viewed positively, uncertainty
over passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the succession to
President Carlos Salinas, and a weak US economy could yet cause problems,
the agency argues.
S&amp;P, and more so Moody's, remains worried about Mexico's current account
deficit which, at 7 per cent of GDP last year, is 'pushing the limit of
sustainability'. The short maturity of capital that finances the deficit,
much of which is in 28-day government paper, also remains a concern.
Such conservatism draws fire from the Wall Street banks, such as Salomon
Brothers, that are keen to push Mexican bonds. In a recent report Salomon
concluded that Mexico was virtually investment grade, having proved its
determination and skill in handling a variety of political and economic
challenges during 1992.
Salomon is particularly scornful of Moody's claim that Mexico's political
institutions may be unable to manage the process of economic change, or that
social inequalities could threaten political stability.
'The inequality in Mexico, while serious, can be compared structurally with
that in the US,' concluded Salomon Brothers.
JP Morgan said the sovereign ceiling for corporate bonds 'creates an
inefficiency', since a company such as Cemex might be investment grade were
it resident in an investment grade country.
'You have to compare Cemex against other multinationals and not against
other Mexican companies,' said JP Morgan. 'It is a company with margins,
cash flow, and is diversified (geographically).'
S&amp;P is more conservative, pointing out, in a recent report, the dangers of
buying Latin American corporate bonds, aside from country risk and
devaluation concerns.
Given the rapid opening to international markets, many Latin American
companies face a more competitive environment than they did a few years ago,
on which credit history is often based. Reporting requirements and
accounting standards are also more lax in Latin America than in the US, with
companies often not breaking down costs and revenues by division.
Ownership of companies is generally much more concentrated than in the US,
making sudden shifts in strategy more possible.
About 18 months ago, a few controlling shareholders in Grupo Visa, which
controls the Mexican beverage company Femsa, financed their Dollars 2.55bn
purchase of Bancomer by increasing debt in Femsa. In a company with more
diversified ownership, it is unlikely that Femsa would have been used to
finance the purchase of a bank.
While recognising such risks, some Wall Street bankers argue that the
returns more than justify the extra risks of buying these bonds.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Risk and Reward: Chicago looks to rolling contracts to
gather investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rapid growth in global currency trading has been fuelled by the way
corporate money managers use forwards, swaps, and options to manage the
foreign exchange risks of their overseas operations.
One of the early arrivals on the currency derivatives scene was the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. It introduced currency futures in 1972, and later added
options on all of its futures contracts. Though first out of the blocks, the
contracts never really moved into the mainstream of foreign exchange
trading. They proved too small to serve the largest bank and corporate
traders cost-effectively and they lacked the flexibility of the tailored
transactions available in the interbank market.
As over-the-counter derivatives exploded, the CME's share of the Dollars
1,000bn-a-day forex market shrank. Traders estimate daily turnover in CME
futures and options comprises only 1 per cent of the world foreign exchange
market, compared with 5 per cent a few years ago.
Distressed at being bypassed, the exchange developed a product that
simulates spot-market forward trading, and companion short-dated currency
options. The exchange was careful to market the integrity of its clearing
house and the new products, playing on concerns that pricing formulas for
over-the-counter currency options leave some dealing banks overexposed
should volatility rates in foreign exchange markets rise unexpectedly.
CME clearing house guarantees will likely attract second- and third-tier
banks that do not want to over-extend their credit lines at the larger
banks, and who want to avoid counterparty risk, said Mr David DeRose, a
trader with Swiss Bank Corporation.
The CME's rolling spot contracts, as they are called, address some defects
in existing products. They will be offered in larger denominations than the
CME's current futures and will not require the daily settlement, and
associated costs, of spot market rollovers.
The first of the new products, rolling spot futures and options on sterling,
will be launched on June 15. The contracts, denominated in 250,000 units,
are sized for institutional trades. Rolling spot futures in other
currencies, including D-Marks, will follow later this year.
They will be offered on Globex, the overnight electronic trading system, as
well as on the trading floor. Most foreign exchange traders do not want to
take delivery of the actual currency, so they customarily roll the postions,
netting the applicable cash flow. While often highly customised, these
rollovers can incur significant operational and transactional expense.
The CME product will automatically roll over each day until the trader
offsets the transaction or accepts delivery. The exchange will calculate the
roll rate each day at approximately 5.30 pm London time, leaving the
remainder of the Chicago session for decisions on whether to roll or exit a
position. The roll rate is based on a survey of spot market prices.
The contract will be netted or debited in cash each day according to the
published rate. Traders who wish to take delivery before a contract expires
can arrange an 'exchange for physical', or EFP, which swaps the futures
position for a cash position.
While the exchange is marketing the products as a 'better mousetrap,' no one
expects them to overwhelm the spot market. As with any product, liquidity is
crucial to trading, and the bank-traded foreign exchange markets are the
most liquid in the world. Diverting trades to the new Chicago arena will be
difficult, at best.
Because it is an exchange, the CME cannot customise products. Rolling spot
futures will replace only the most generic or 'plain vanilla' spot
transactions. And, because the CME is a licensed exchange and subject to
tight federal oversight, the paperwork required to track trades could
discourage participation.
Exchange officials recognise this, and have taken the unusual step of
applying for exemption from Commodity Futures Trading Commission supervision
for the rolling spot futures and options. It is the first time a US exchange
has sought such an exemption since the new US futures oversight law became
effective this year.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Japanese Bonds: Lean times as investors discount the
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese bond market has been going through a lean time as investors
begin to discount economic recovery.
Compared with a low of 3.8 per cent in February, the yield on the No 145
10-year benchmark has been forced up by positive economic data to around 4.6
per cent in recent weeks.
The rise in the Tokyo stock market this year, partly due to the government's
price support operation, has undermined hopes of further monetary easing by
the Bank of Japan.
The Nikkei index of leading share prices rose 24 per cent over the first
four months of this year, prompting a shift of funds from the bond market to
stocks.
Inflationary figures in the US, accompanied by a rise in Treasury bond
yields, exacerbated jitters among investors. The ascent in the long-term
bond yield triggered a rise in the five-year debenture yield, leading to a
jump in the long-term prime rate, the leading benchmark for long-term
lending, by 30 basis points to 5.4 per cent earlier this month.
Investor doubts were reflected in volume levels. Bond turnover in May was
Y29,296.7bn, a fall of 26 per cent from the previous month.
However, with the overall wholesale price index for April falling 2.8 per
cent after a 2.3 per cent fall in March, and the Nikkei's domestic commodity
index down 16 per cent from last summer, worries over inflation are almost
non-existent.
Optimism over an imminent economic recovery, helped by a return of money
supply growth and some consumption indicators, may have been overdone.
Bank lending for April rose by a marginal 1.1 per cent from the previous
year, the smallest gain ever, and industrial output for April fell 2.2 per
cent from the month before, after two consecutive months of strong gains.
Housing starts showed signs of topping out, rising a mere 1.1 per cent from
a year earlier in April.
Stories of middle-managers at large Japanese companies being discreetly
ousted from their posts in leading business magazines suggest that a revival
in consumer sentiment could still be far away.
Poor news for the Japanese economy is good news for interest rates. Euroyen
futures market last week saw a jump in activity, with the September three
month contract closing the week at 96.79 from 96.66 at the start of the
week.
Meanwhile, the bond market still faces an over-supply problem as investors
are bracing themselves for a new supply of government bonds and corporate
issues.
Corporate bonds issued last month rose to Y195bn, up sharply from Y11bn in
April. More companies are expected to dip into the corporate bond market
this month due to the rise in long-term bank lending rates, and according to
the Bond Underwriters Association of Japan, at least Y400bn of domestic
straight bonds are expected to be issued.
Investors are willing to buy short-term issues, as seen in the Tokyo
Electric Power's Y150bn three-year issue, the largest to be floated in the
domestic bond market. However, many remain wary of long-term bonds after the
recent plunge.
The fall in yields may be limited due to investors wanting to take profits
on positions taken earlier in the year, with a floor around the 4.5 per cent
level. But with renewed speculation of a cut in the official discount rate,
and the rise in the yen against the dollar, yields may have more room to
fall.
Mr Marshall Gittler, bond market analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, expects
the yield on the No 145 benchmark to fall to 4 per cent during the third
quarter of this year.

FT  07 JUN 93 / UK Gilts: Market unmoved during Clarke's first week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke's first week as chancellor of the exchequer contained
little to move the UK government bond market. But expectations for an
eventual - if not early - cut in interest rates continued to underpin prices
at the short end of the yield curve.
A strong view in the market is that there will be no easing of monetary
policy until Mr Clarke has mastered his brief and won the respect of the
foreign exchange markets. He is also likely to wait for more bad news on the
economy before acting.
While it is apparent that the pace of economic recovery has slackened since
the beginning of the year, evidence that the recovery is faltering is not
yet overwhelming.
Possibly because of this sentiment, last week's release of poor narrow money
supply figures for May caused only a frisson in the market.
Narrow money - mainly notes and coins in circulation - rose by a seasonally
adjusted 3.3 per cent in the year to May, compared with growth of 4.8 per
cent in the year to April. Such a sharp drop in the year-on-year rate, even
allowing for special factors, pointed to a slowdown in consumer spending and
prompted speculation of another rate cut. But while the foreign exchanges
took fright and the pound fell to below DM2.47, yields at the short end of
the curve fell only 4 basis points.
Although the narrow money figure was bad, it was not enough to convince some
analysts. Many said it was too early to judge the full extent of the
slowdown in the rate of growth of M0. The figure was probably distorted
downwards by the timing of the Whitsun bank holiday. In addition, the latest
figure for notes in circulation - which forms 95 per cent of M0 - painted a
more buoyant picture of monetary growth in the first week of June.
The figures, published on Thursday, showed that the increase in notes in
circulation in the year to last Wednesday had rebounded to 6.8 per cent.
This figure was not seasonally adjusted, and was inflated by the bank
holiday two days earlier.
However, Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, argues that
allowance for the distortion can be made by looking at the year-on-year
growth in the latest four week moving average.
'This calculation shows the growth rate moving up to 4.5 per cent from 3.3
per cent the previous week, suggesting that the May M0 figure will prove to
be an anomaly,' he says.
The long end of the yield curve continued to prevaricate over inflation last
week. There has been little movement recently, with the market stuck between
two opposing camps on the future path of UK inflation.
A number of analysts are optimistic about inflation, and believe it is
unlikely to take off again, mainly because labour market reform and
competition from the rest of the world will hold down wage infla-tion.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets - which has an
optimistic view on inflation - believes it will take a few more good
earnings figures to convince the market that inflation is no longer a
problem.
'When that happens there will be a bull-run on long-dated gilts,' he says.
'There will come a point where, with both the RPI and the RPI excluding
mortgage interest payments well under control, long yields of 8.6 per cent
will look crazy and will have to come down.'
Opposing this view are those who think a sharp pick-up in inflation is
likely in the autumn.
Mr Chris Dillow at Nomura Research believes the RPI excluding mortgage
interest payments will have breached the government's 4 per cent target
ceiling by the end of the year.
Inflation will be driven upwards as price falls of last year start to drop
out of the annual comparison, he says. This will be most evident in three
areas; seasonal food, clothing and footwear, and cars, says Mr Dillow.
'From a starting point of 3 per cent this means that inflation will reach
the top of its target range even before we consider actual price increases,'
he adds.
Both camps have their advocates, but with few economic statistics due over
the next few days, this week is unlikely to provide extra clues to tip the
balance either one way or the other.

FT  07 JUN 93 / US Money and Credit: Little wiser after a wealth of data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEALTH of economic data last week left the US bond market little wiser
about the strength of the domestic recovery and the direction of interest
rates.
For most of the abbreviated four-day week, the bond market gazed anxiously
at the impending May jobs figures, due to be released on Friday morning.
Along the way, it took just a little heart from the personal income data and
the latest purchasing managers' report. Both sets of statistics were
unveiled on Tuesday and reinforced the notion that the economy is growing at
a sluggish pace. The yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond, which had
ended the previous week at 6.98 per cent, slipped to 6.86 per cent by
Thursday.
This relaxed mood proved to be shortlived. On Friday morning, the US Labor
Department announced that non-farm payrolls jumped by 209,000 last month,
following a revised 216,000 increase in April. Meanwhile, the unemployment
rate fell to 6.9 per cent during the month, from 7 per cent previously. Both
sets of figures were significantly stronger than analysts had predicted: the
consensus had been for a 155,000 increase in May non-farm payrolls and a
static unemployment rate. This, moreover, was the first time in 18 months
that the latter figure had fallen below the 7 per cent mark.
Admittedly, closer inspection of the figures suggested that the picture
might not be quite as bright as the overall numbers suggested. For example,
the manufacturing sector continued to post a decline in job numbers - a
trend which has lasted for three months. A large part of the increase came
in the construction sector, and was probably due to the better weather.
Health services and local government expanded employment.
Still, the bond market was not inclined to view the figures in the most
favourable light. Bond prices gave up all the ground they had gained earlier
in the week - and then a little more. By the end of trading on Friday, the
long bond yield had risen to 6.91 per cent.
However, the real testing points for the market will come next Friday, when
the May producer price figures are released, and then again on the following
Tuesday, when consumer price data for the same month are released.
In light of the unexpectedly strong labour market trends, some economists
believe that if these numbers show any hint of inflationary pressure,
movement on the interest rate front is inevitable. As one pundit commented
on Friday: 'The Federal Reserve is just one bad inflation report away from a
tightening.' A bad report, runs the market consensus, would be anything that
showed any significant rise in the producer price index.
Many analysts are predicting that the non-core index (that is, inclusive of
food and energy prices) will be unchanged, while the core index might rise
by 0.2 per cent.
For the consumer price index, expectations centre on a 0.2 per cent advance
last month, and possibly a shade higher once the food and energy components
are excluded.
The more optimistic analysts believe that there are good grounds for
expecting the data will meet these targets: they point out that food prices
stabilised last month, and energy quotes were generally softer.
The inflation figures next Friday will be accompanied by the latest retail
sales report. Most of the big retailers - publishing their individual store
sales reports - have indicated that May produced better business than the
preceding months, although this was partly attributed to the improved
weather conditions and the results were scarcely brilliant.
So most economists are predicting an uptick in the overall retail sales
numbers, anything from a 0.6 per cent - 1.0 per cent increase.

<TEXT>
CANADA POST, a federal crown corporation, has moved aggressively into the
private sector, buying 75 per cent of Purolator Courier for CDollars 55m
(USDollars 43.3m) to become Canada's biggest courier operator.
Mr Georges Clermont, president, has said CP can now offer a full range of
services as standard letter mail demand declines in the electronics age.
The move prevents CP from being a carrier of last resort and allows it to
compete against US courier companies.
Control of Purolator was sold by Onex, a Toronto holding company, and a big
Ontario pension fund.
In the first quarter it became profitable for the first time in four years.
Other courier companies have complained CP will have more than 50 per cent
of the market for overnight letter and small parcel delivery, estimated to
be worth between CDollars 1.5bn and CDollars 2bn annually, and will be in a
position to control pricing.
However, the federal government said the alternative was the sale of
Purolator to a US company.
Onex bought Purolator from its US parent in 1987 for CDollars 234m. It will
retain a 20 per cent interest.

reports from Hong Kong.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China will buy 9 per cent of Taikoo
(Xiamen) Aircraft Maintenance, according to Haeco.
Haeco did not say how much the aviation supervisor will pay for the stake,
but said that total investment plans remained unchanged at USDollars 63m.
Haeco said that it held 61 per cent, adding in a statement that when the
deal was announced in March, it expected to own just 41 per cent.
Haeco added that it would sell up to 20 per cent of its holding to other
interested parties.
The company indicated that the 9 per cent portion for the Civil Aviation
Administration has been carved out of this 20 per cent.
Haeco is about 44 per cent owned by Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong

FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: New Torras management claims
group made losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO TORRAS, the Spanish industrial holding company owned by the Kuwait
Investment Office (KIO), ran up total losses of Pta197bn (Dollars 1.7bn) in
1991 and 1992, according to accounts filed with the Spanish securities
commission by the new Torras management.
The figures vary widely from the small Pta3bn profit reported by the former
Torras management for 1991, and reflect the conviction held by the new
management of the KIO, which took control of Torras mid-way through last
year, that their predecessors mismanaged the Spanish companies.
Torras, which is in receivership, said that Pta44.4bn had been lost in 1991
and Pta153.1bn last year.
The 1992 figure includes, according to Torras, Pta55bn in bad debt
provisions for loans which it claims were made to companies directly or
indirectly controlled by former Torras managers.
The figures appear to include large portfolio losses on companies controlled
by Torras.
Torras said that of the Pta500bn invested in Spain by the KIO, only
Pta73.3bn remained. It blamed the former management.
In the past, the old management has claimed that the value of the KIO's
investment only began to fall once the new management decided to cease
supporting Torras companies and to pull out of Spain.
The publication of the figures by Torras comes shortly after a court agreed
to freeze KIO assets in two bank accounts in Switzerland after a Torras
creditor claimed it had not been paid for assets sold to Torras when it was
under its former management.
In London, the KIO management insists that it is merely a shareholder in
Torras, and is therefore not liable for its debts. The accounts presented to
the Spanish authorities claim that Torras owes the KIO nearly Pta180bn. Peat
Marwick, KIO's auditors, have advised the Kuwaitis to treat this debt as
equity.

by about 97 to 100 times, according to Schroders Asia, which is managing the
offer, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
Schroders Asia says that the flotation appears to have drawn more than
HKDollars 70bn (USDollars 9bn) out of Hong Kong's money markets.
The flotation is poised to raise HKDollars 735m for the company, the hotel
arm of the Kuok Group of Malaysia. Trading in the shares is expected to
begin on June 17.
In February, a flotation by Denway Investments, whose main asset is a stake
in a south China car factory, attracted HKDollars 240bn in applications -
equivalent to more than one-third of Hong Kong's annual gross domestic
product - when it was oversubscribed a record 658 times.
That issue prompted the colony's monetary authority to study ways to avoid
strains on the banking system. Mr Joseph Yam, head of the authority, said
banks had followed guidelines to curb borrowing for the Shangri-la issue.
'We wanted to ensure that the flow of this substantial amount of money was
smooth and that there was no disruption to the financial system,' Mr Yam
said.
The Kuok Group will hold 59 per cent of Shangri-la after the listing, and
Beijing-controlled China Resources (Holdings) 8 per cent. Shangri-la holds
hotels in Hong Kong and China, and commercial, residential and office
complexes on the mainland.
The Hong Kong stock exchange said Chinese and Hong Kong securities
authorities will sign a memorandum of regulatory co-operation in Beijing on
June 19, Reuter adds. It paves the way for nine Chinese companies to list
shares in the colony within the month. Signatories will include the stock
exchanges of Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen as well as China's Securities
Regulatory Commission and Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission.

FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Spanish electricity utilities
reach agreement to reduce nuclear debt
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EMPRESA Nacional de Electricidad and Iberdrola, two Spanish electricity
utilities, have reached agreement to collaborate, involving steps to reduce
the costs of their debts in the nuclear sector, Reuter reports from Madrid.
'The two chairmen have agreed to take measures to guarantee financial
stability in the sector,' a statement said.
It said the agreement involved proposals to reduce the nuclear debt burden
and to study exchanges of assets to rationalise the energy market. The two
companies also agreed to collaborate in nuclear power management, research
and development, primary energy and marketing.
Mr Inigo de Oriola, Iberdrola chairman, said last week the two companies had
agreed to transfer their nuclear assets to a new company.
The government imposed a moratorium on new nuclear construction in 1984,
leaving companies with large debts and unfinished projects. Under the
proposal, the transfer of nuclear assets to a new company would reduce their
financial costs considerably.
He said Iberdrola's financial debt could be reduced by Pta530bn (Dollars
4.7bn) from the present Pta1,700bn as a result.
Mr Oriola also said that Iberdrola and Endesa would exchange other assets,
mainly allowing Endesa to consolidate its presence in Catalonia.
Banco Exterior de Espana, the Spanish commercial bank, has won approval to
open a subsidiary in Morocco, which would be the first wholly-owned foreign
bank in the North African country since independence, Mark Nicholson adds.
The bank, Banco Exterior Maroc, would be capitalised at Dollars 11m and
based in Casablanca, BEE executives said.

FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: MAS hits financial turbulence -
Malaysian carrier's latest results are seen as dismal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING seems to be going wrong in the cockpit at Malaysian Airline System
(MAS).
In recent years, the carrier has gained a reputation as one of the world's
more ambitious airlines. At a time when many airlines are pruning services
and rescheduling aircraft deliveries, MAS is in the middle of a full
throttle expansion programme.
New routes have been opened and capacity has been expanded. In the course of
its present five-year plan to 1996-97, MAS has orders for 72 aircraft
costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn (Dollars 4.13bn).
However, the airline's latest results - for the year ended March and
released at the weekend - suggest that MAS has flown into some nasty
financial turbulence.
Pre-tax profit was MDollars 157m, up 32 per cent on 1991-92. But the result
is well under half the MDollars 372m pre-tax return forecast by MAS at the
end of last year when the airline raised Dollars 700m via Malaysia's biggest
rights issue.
The year's profit includes a MDollars 337.1m profit from the sale of two
Boeing 737-200s and five McDonnell Douglas DC10-30s. If these are stripped
out, MAS falls into a pre-tax loss of MDollars 180m.
All the aircraft involved in the sale were disposed of on a lease-back
basis: MAS has to pay substantial amounts in lease payments to continue
operating the aircraft.
'The sale of the aircraft might have brought the figures into the black,'
said one analyst. 'But there's no getting away from it - these are dismal
results.'
Mr Zain Azraai, MAS chairman, said there had been a sharp drop in passenger
and cargo traffic due to the continuing recession in the main industrialised
countries. Intense competition and over-capacity on many international
routes had affected performance.
With about 55 per cent of MAS's revenue denominated in foreign currencies,
Mr Zain said the appreciation of the ringgit, the Malaysian dollar, had
caused problems.
Two fires at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, one of which caused flight
disruptions for nearly a month, had added to the woes of MAS.
Analysts say MAS has expanded capacity too fast: the carrier's overall load
factor - seen as an important performance indicator in the aviation industry
 -has dropped to 62.9 per cent from the 65.9 per cent of 1991-92.
MAS is more than 50 per cent controlled by the Malaysian government.
Observers say that some recently opened international routes - to Mexico
City and Johannesburg, for example - are more a reflection of the
government's wish to project the country on the world stage than
straightforward airline economics.
MAS's extensive domestic network is a continuing drain on funds. The airline
says it is mystified by a recent sharp drop in domestic passenger growth -
down to 3.7 per cent in the second half of 1992-93 from 18 per cent in the
first half. Domestic fare increases of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent
during the year could be one factor behind the sudden drop in internal
passenger traffic.
The decline in passenger growth could also reflect a general slowing down in
Malaysia's economy, which has been growing at a rate of more than 8 per cent
in each of the past five years.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, recently proposed setting up
a second airline, mainly to handle domestic routes. Prospective operators
are likely to be cautious in light of these MAS results.
MAS says it is examining ways to slow planned additions to capacity,
including deferring delivery of some new aircraft and early termination of
some aircraft leases.
There are rumours that the airline will be forced into another cash call,
probably next year. MAS remains locked into an expansion programme which
will see its fleet increase from the present 80 aircraft to more than 100 in
the next four years. Leased and ageing aircraft are being phased out to form
what will be one of the world's most modern fleets.
In 1992-93, MAS took delivery of 21 aircraft. In 1993-94 a further 28
airliners are scheduled to join the MAS fleet.
'Financing this expansion is a tremendous strain on MAS,' said an analyst.
'The next two years are going to be critical - finance costs will be peaking
and it is vital that operating performance is improved. Proper utilisation
of capacity is the main factor.'
MAS defends its expansion as part of a long-term strategy. It says that in
the years ahead the benefits will flow through, particularly as regional
passenger traffic expands.
Most other airlines are facing financial problems. But MAS's high-flying
ambitions have received a bad jolt. Financial seat belts are likely to
remain firmly fastened for some time to come.

FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Alpine may have already been
sold, bidders told
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALPINE (Double Glazing) may already have been sold according to parties who
have tried to make offers for one of the oldest names in the UK double
glazing industry.
Creditors are not due to meet until June 15, to vote on whether to liquidate
the company. The meeting was called on the order of directors on May 28.
Some bidders have been told the assets and business of Alpine have already
been sold. However, calls remain unanswered from Mr Graham Wilson, the
insolvency practitioner who has arranged the creditors meeting to discuss
liquidation, and who is also representing Mr Clive Smith in his bid to avoid
bankruptcy today.
It also emerged yesterday that almost three weeks before Alpine stopped
trading regional sales directors were verbally instructed to send all
customer payments by special delivery to the company's head office in
London, and not deposit them in the local banks as previously.
In a memo dated May 11 sales staff were told to have customers make cheques
payable to Alpine (Double Glazing), 'omitting the Co Ltd'.

FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Carr's Milling exceeds Pounds
600,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-HALF profits from Carr's Milling Industries outstripped the whole of
the previous year. Although there will be a slowdown in the second period,
the directors said the figure should comfortably exceed that of 1991-92.
In the six months ended February 27 1993 sales slipped Pounds 138,000 to
almost Pounds 35m, but pre-tax profit surged from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds
610,000. The second term of last year produced Pounds 152,000. Adjustment
has been made for sales of the discontinued egg activities.
The agriculture side increased sales and profits significantly with all
sectors trading ahead of last year.
Flour milling started well with price increases offsetting rising costs. But
effective devaluation of sterling and the CAP agrimonetary system had a
detrimental impact on raw material prices and will continue so in the second
half.
Intense competition on prices in the bread baking industry continued,
although cost cutting helped mitigate the effect. The engineering and
restaurant businesses produced satisfactory results.
Earnings per share came to 6.1p (1.2p), while the interim dividend is
unchanged at 1p.

FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Gardner to sell training
division for nearly Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DC GARDNER has agreed to sell its banking and management training division
in order to cut costs and concentrate on its outplacement and conference
businesses.
The company, which has been substantially restructured in the last 18
months, has agreed to the disposal of its training division to Euromoney
Publications for Pounds 3.7m, which includes Pounds 1.8m of inter-group
debt.
As a condition of the sale, the division will retain the DC Gardner name.
The company will seek shareholder approval to change its name to Coutts
Consulting Group, derived from the name of its personnel business.
The company has also agreed to terminate a long term lease on a property in
London's Docklands where the training division was based. Although the
termination will cost Pounds 5m, it will lead to longer term cost savings.
Mr Stephen Johnson, chief executive, said these were designed to be the
company's last set of changes. Last November the company issued a profits
warning, replaced its chief executive of less than a year, Mr Barry Topple,
and appointed Sir Kit McMahon, former chairman of Midland Bank, as
non-executive chairman.
Mr Johnson said the changes would save nearly Pounds 1m a year in reduced
costs. 'We will have the cash to devote to the other businesses,' he said.
The training division, which employs nearly 70 people, has been affected by
recession and made a pre-tax loss last year. At the operating level, the
company returned to profits. At December 31, the division's net assets
totalled some Pounds 690,000.
Gardner will use the proceeds of the sale towards the termination costs on
the Docklands property. The balance of the costs will be provided from new
loan facilities.
Mr Johnson said gearing, which stood at 30 per cent in December, would not
go beyond 100 per cent this year and would fall below 70 per cent by the
year end.
The company also intends to seek approval from shareholders and the courts
to reduce its share premium account. Once the company has restored
distributable reserves, it intends to pay the arrears of Pounds 480,000 on
its convertible preference shares. Ordinary dividends would follow,
depending on earnings and cash resources.

FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Smith creditors to meet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Mr Clive Smith, the 1980s oil entrepreneur who will today seek
to avoid bankruptcy, are expected to raise questions over the statement of
his affairs showing assets of Pounds 1.7m and debt claims of more than
Pounds 20m.
The statement of affairs provides scanty information. In it, Mr Smith
proposes to repay creditors, who will vote in proportion to their debt, by
realising interests, including property, an outstanding debt, and
contributions from his income as a financial consultant over the next three
years.
The two companies in which he has been most active according to associates
are Alpine (Double Glazing), which ceased trading last month, and Cellular
Telecom, the mobile communications group. The companies have some directors
in common and have shared office space and trading links.
Cellular Telecom retails airtime on the Vodafone and Cellnet networks. It
signs up subscribers, bills them for equipment and airtime use, and then
pays the networks. 'Being a service provider is being a bank,' said
Vodafone. CT is one of three UK companies seeking to act as a service
provider on Vodafone's new Greek cellular network.
Mr Smith's connection to CT dates back to 1990, when it was sold to the then
publicly-quoted Image Store Holdings, as part of a reverse takeover.
The vendors of CT, whose directors included Sir David McNee, the former
commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, were Mr Smith's two daughters, Mr
Robert Pollock, a CT director, and Mr Edward Clucas, a financial adviser to
Mr Smith. The financial adviser to the deal was Corporate Broking Services,
a London stockbroker which went into liquidation in 1991 and in which Mr
Smith held a substantial stake.
At the time, the prospectus stated that neither Mr Smith nor trustees of his
daughters' trusts would seek board representation.
He has, however, retained an active role throughout and was at the company's
Maidenhead offices last week in meetings with CT directors including Mr
Pollock and Mr James Berry. Both men are also on the board of Alpine (Double
Glazing), the windows company, which ceased trading at the end of May. Mr
Smith personally guaranteed the purchase of Alpine from administrators in
February 1992.
Mr Pollock yesterday refused to comment on Mr Smith's precise link with
Cellular Telecom. Mr Pollock, a discharged bankrupt, secured his Pounds
500,000 mortgage from the Bermuda-based Bank of Butterfield by a guarantee
from Finchley Investments, an Isle of Man company which Mr Smith has often
used to handle some of his investments.
Finchley put up 500,000 shares in Western &amp; Pacific, a North American
natural resources company as collateral for the loan. Western &amp; Pacific is
also partly owned by Newsham Investment, another vehicle for the Smith
family interests.
Finchley Investments' name came up last year in connection a financing deal
for Belling, the cooker manufacturer which subsequently went into
receivership. Belling had tried to arrange a Dollars 50m capital injection
through Global Prospect Funding. It agreed to pay Global Pounds 2.1m,
borrowed from the pension fund, before the deal as the first year's
interest. When the Dollars 50m loan was not forthcoming, Finchley
Investments put up Western &amp; Pacific shares as Belling's security for the
interest payment.
It is not clear what Mr Smith's current offshore interests are. They are not
mentioned specifically in the statement of his affairs supplied to creditors
for today's meeting.
Mr Smith's creditors include the Inland Revenue and Societe Bancaire de
Paris. The largest creditor by far, however, is Richard Pearce and Son, a
Hong Kong registered company with the same Irish address as Mr Kelvin Myles,
who managed many of Mr Smith's offshore interests.
Some creditors have been unable to secure satisfactory answers to questions
over Mr Smith's affairs when they approached Mr Graham Wilson, the
insolvency practitioner who called today's meeting on Mr Smith's behalf.
Mr Wilson, who has also called a creditors' meeting for Alpine (Double
Glazing) later this month, was arrested last year on suspicion of defrauding
creditors in an insolvency procedure and is on police bail awaiting possible
charges. The DTI is believed to be taking an interest in his affairs.
At the meeting in Southall this afternoon, creditors will vote on Mr Smith's
proposals for an individual voluntary arrangement. Mr Smith is offering to
repay 8.13p in the pound if creditors accept his proposals, against 0.1p in
bankruptcy.

A CALIFORNIA appeals court has dealt a serious blow to Advanced Micro
Devices by overturning an arbitrator's decision that gave the semiconductor
manufacturer the right to use Intel microprocessor technology.
The ruling stems from a bitter six-year legal battle between the two Silicon
Valley chip makers. Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer,
dominates the world market for microprocessors used in personal computers.
AMD, once an Intel partner, now competes with Intel by selling its own
versions of Intel's chips.
The court decision places a legal cloud over AMD's most profitable and
promising products: its version of the Intel 386 microprocessor and its
recently introduced 486 microprocessor.
AMD claims the right to Intel's technology under prior agreements between
the two companies. Last year, after almost five years of hearings, an
arbitrator ruled that Intel had breached its technology-sharing agreements
with AMD and awarded AMD the right to use Intel 386 technology.
In a decision released late on Friday, however, the appeals court ruled that
the arbitrator had 'exceeded his powers' in awarding technology rights to
AMD.
AMD said it would immediately ask the appeals court to reconsider its
decision and, if necessary, would take the matter to the California Supreme
Court.
'This reversal will not deter AMD from continuing to compete in the 386
microprocessor market,' said Mr Jerry Sanders, chairman and chief executive
officer of AMD. 'Despite this setback, competition will continue and we will
support our customers.' Intel will now seek damages of more than Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) from AMD.
Last month, in another related Intel-AMD dispute, a jury's verdict that AMD
does not hold a licence to use Intel microcode was set aside by the judge
because Intel withheld evidence.
Thus, although Intel has won an important ruling from the California appeals
court, it still faces significant challenges to its intellectual property
rights. The legal battles between Intel and AMD appear likely to drag on,
perhaps for several more years and almost certainly beyond the lifetime of
the products currently at issue.

FT  07 JUN 93 / BA and Virgin 'dirty tricks' row nears end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS and Virgin Atlantic are moving towards a settlement of the
'dirty tricks' dispute which has soured relations between the two airlines,
but Virgin says BA still has to make a firm offer.
The impetus for the latest initiative to end the embarrassing public row
between the UK companies has come from Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of
the Civil Aviation Authority.
If a deal is agreed, compensation would be paid by BA to Virgin.
This could, however, be less than the Pounds 9m suggested earlier this year,
though neither would comment on the likely final sum. In return, Virgin
would drop its court proceedings for compensation and end threats of legal
action in the US.
Virgin, which wants to expand its international services, said it had not
heard from the CAA or BA about new terms to end the dispute. But it said Mr
Chataway had made a useful approach, meeting Virgin several times. 'He
helpfully intervened to try and avoid the two sides ending up in court
again.'
BA, which also confirmed contacts with the CAA, said it was keen to bring
the affair to a close.
As well as dropping legal action, Virgin would also accept a 'gentleman's
agreement' not to exploit the details of the 'dirty tricks' - which involved
the poaching of Virgin customers by using the airline's computer data - for
its own further publicity.
Virgin said that the original settlement proposed would have required Virgin
and Mr Branson to refrain from making any statements, or using past evidence
of BA's actions, to defend the company even if the matter was raised again
or further such events occurred.
BA apologised publicly to Virgin in January for claiming that Mr Branson had
made up the 'dirty tricks' claims and paid Pounds 610,000 in libel damages,
as well as high legal costs, after the revelations of the secret operations
to lure away customers.
But talks on a final settlement foundered in March on the 'gagging clause'
issue, with BA seeking to get Virgin 'to agree not to rake over the events
of the past'.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Head of US arm of O&amp;Y threatens to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle over control of the US subsidiary of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian
property company, has intensified following a threat by Mr John Zuccotti,
head of the US operation, to resign unless the subsidiary gets an
'independent' board and corporate governance issues are clarified.
In an affidavit filed with the US bankruptcy court, Mr Zuccotti said that
'without that clarity, I cannot function as a chief executive officer and
exercise my fiduciary responsibilities to all the creditors and the equity
(holders).'
'Nor,' he continued, 'do I believe that anyone else can'.
Mr Zuccotti added that the current situation made it impossible to continue
negotiating with creditors to restructure the US subsidiary's debt.
Mr Zuccotti's declaration turns up the heat in a rumbling dispute between
administrators of the distressed Canadian parent company's assets, and
creditors of the US subsidiary, which has so far avoided bankruptcy. These
creditors are a mixture of US and foreign banks, who have Dollars 5.3bn
(Pounds 3.44bn) of loans outstanding to O&amp;Y USA.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand was appointed to act as administrator of the assets of the
Toronto-based property colossus, Olympia &amp; York Developments, which include
a majority stake in the US subsidiary.
Since then, Coopers has been seeking the right to hire and fire members of a
governing board, which is to advise Mr Zuccotti on the running of O&amp;Y USA.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Economics Notebook: World trade talks drink in the last
chance saloon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT are we to make of world trade developments?
Last week's annual ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development ended with upbeat noises about progress in the
long stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
But the talk in the corridors was more about managed trade and rising
protectionist pressures.
The reasons were not hard to find. Over the past three years unemployment in
the world's 24 leading industrial economies has exceeded its 1983 record
level of 30m and is projected to increase to nearly 36m by the end of this
year. Nor do these figures tell the whole story of wasted labour resources.
As the OECD noted last week in a special report on unemployment, many
workers have withdrawn from the job market because they consider it futile
to look for jobs or because they have generous income support. Many people
are doing part-time work and there are many low-wage jobs being held by
people overqualified for them.
At the same time, competition among industrial countries and from the newly
industrialising economies of Asia and the recently rehabilitated countries
of Latin America has become remorseless.
Little wonder the European Commission wants Japan to revise an agreement
signed only in April and cut still further its exports of cars and vans to
the European Community. Or that in even such a bastion of free trade as the
OECD itself, people are beginning to think aloud about whether protection
might not be a lesser evil than social unrest caused by mass unemployment.
Just before the OECD meeting, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the organisation's
secretary general, told the German newspaper Die Zeit he would 'not rule out
protectionism as a policy of last resort'. He readily acknowledged
protectionism was stupid and the worst solution to the problem caused by the
loss of jobs to the newly industrialising countries. But he said if other
policies did not work governments would not be able to avoid 'stepping on
the brakes a little'. It would be better, he said, to do 'stupid things,
fully realising that they are stupid, than to accept a social explosion'.
But while Mr Paye has been developing his vision of apocalypse now,
officials from the OECD's member countries have actually begun preparing the
trade agenda to follow the present Uruguay Round.
The world has moved on since the countries of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade launched the Uruguay Round in 1986. The environment has
become a preoccupation in most industrialised countries with the result that
environmental policies have begun to impinge on trade. The globalisation of
business through trade and investment has meant that a country's competitive
conditions and domestic competition policies can affect trade and the access
companies have to markets.
The Netherlands provides a good example of how environmental concerns and
trade can conflict. By tradition and history it is one of the world's free
traders. Yet the government has proposed to ban imports of tropical timber
taken from forests where there is no scheme for replanting.
Elsewhere, measures to restrict imports have been urged or introduced after
protests by environmentalists who want action against such perceived abuses
as the clubbing of baby seals or experimenting on animals to produce
cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
Globalisation has made the dividing line between trade and competition
policies increasingly fuzzy. Trade barriers may fall between countries only
for companies to find their activities constrained by subsidies to
competitors or rules on standards or local content. Government rules on
zoning, licensing or pricing can keep new competitors out of distribution
systems.
Some actions by the private sector can also lead to trade discrimination.
The OECD is also concerned that international agreements between companies
may result in managed trade.
At a less sophisticated level, violence, intimidation and harassment have
been used to block competition. In South Korea, for example, there have been
cases of cinemas showing locally-made films releasing snakes in rival
cinemas showing foreign-made films in an attempt to prevent foreign film
makers from increasing their market share.
Issues such as these are as good a justification as any for the OECD, where
officials from its member countries who are steeped in the differing
cultures of trade, environment and competition policy can meet and begin to
understand each others' problems.
Achieving better communications is half the battle. Trade officials recall
that when the Montreal Protocol phasing out production of chemicals that
damage the ozone layer was agreed in 1987, it had been negotiated by
environmental officials and was 'totally inconsistent' with Gatt rules.
This galvanised governments into action with the result the OECD was last
week able to produce some procedural guidelines on how to improve the
relationship between trade and environmental policies.
But this small step can only partially offset the force of protectionist
pressures bearing down on - and in some cases being encouraged by - policy
makers.
Mr Michael Wilson, the Canadian trade minister, won support when he warned
against any move to add the emerging trade agenda to the unfinished business
of the Uruguay Round. This would make the already difficult task of
completing the round daunting, he said.
The Uruguay Round therefore remains the ultimate test of the industrialised
countries' commitment to the multilateral trading system that has served
them well since the second world war.
The round is in the last chance saloon. After so many missed deadlines,
negotiators risk losing all credibility if they miss the latest target date
of December 15. But for all the talk of progress and momentum at last week's
OECD meeting, it is too early to bet on a successful outcome against a
background of slow growth and rising unemployment in the industrialised
world.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Hands-off approach to the creation of drugs: A joining of
European capital and US science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN AND CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Art Levinson and his fellow scientists have their way at Genentech, the
Californian biotechnology company, a range of futuristic drugs could find
their way to market towards the end of this decade.
Dr Levinson, a man who sketches molecular structures on a blackboard as
easily as most people sign their names, is the head of a research team of
320 cloners, cell biologists and other scientists.
Genentech's candidate drugs - including genetically engineered treatments
for the Aids virus and breast cancer, and an almost science-fiction drug
that could regenerate a cirrhosis-decayed liver - are being developed thanks
to an unusual marriage of European capital and American science and
technology.
The European partner is Roche, the Swiss drugs giant which three years ago
paid Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.36bn) to acquire 60 per cent control of the
15-year-old Genentech. Roche has adopted a hands-off approach to Genentech's
scientists. Mr Fritz Gerber, chairman of Roche, has pledged to maintain
Genentech's autonomy, including independent control of its research agenda.
Of Roche's original investment, there remains a Dollars 650m cash balance at
Genentech. The company has the leeway to spend more than 50 per cent of its
annual revenues on research and development.
Genentech's pipeline of potential drugs probably now matches that of its
Californian rival Amgen, the biotechnology industry's greatest success story
so far.
Mr Levinson's scientists are encouraged to spend 20 per cent of their time
on their own research - rather than strictly company business. A more
typical proportion would be 10 per cent.
The 75-acre leafy park that serves as Genentech's headquarters on the bay in
south San Francisco includes a recently opened Dollars 80m research centre
and some of the best childcare facilities in the US.
But the academic atmosphere of the headquarters does not conceal the
entrepreneurial energy of the workers. Mr Kirk Raab, the crusty 57-year-old
Genentech chairman, is, by his own admission, crazy about making money.
'Every employee in this company is a shareholder. There is a passion here
for stock options, for ownership. Our future is to make a lot of money and
to do that by providing lots of new products,' he says.
'One of the main reasons why we did the deal with Roche was to make sure
that we could continue making R&amp;D investments. Without Roche's money we
would not have been able to.'
Mr Raab bristles at the mere mention of the Swiss company's majority
control, although he acknowledges that Genentech has been left to its own
devices. Roche has the option to buy out the rest of Genentech's stock by
mid-1995. 'You don't see the Swiss flag flying out front,' Mr Raab says.
'Roche has only two members of our 13-strong board. I only talk to their
chairman twice a year. They have no rights to our products or our science.
They allow us to function independently. They don't want us to be Roche's
West Coast arm.'
The view from Roche's US headquarters in New Jersey is subtly different. Dr
Jurgen Drews, the research director, agrees that Genentech must maintain a
separate identity, to avoid stifling its entrepreneurial spirit - but he
emphasises the extent to which the two companies are working together.
'We made it clear to Genentech that we wanted to collaborate with them but
we didn't want to manipulate them,' he says. 'We've had to prove our
abilities a couple of times but that has led to a relationship of trust.'
Mr Raab, a former pharmaceuticals industry salesman, admits he is impatient
at the time it takes for drugs to come to market. When they get there, the
risks are far from over.
Activase, a heart attack drug that dissolves blood clots within seconds,
represents about 35 per cent of Genentech's annual revenues of more than
Dollars 500m. In 1991 an Oxford University study, Isis-3, called its
effectiveness into question.
The study found that an older unpatented drug - streptokinase - saved as
many lives as Activase, and at a tenth of its Dollars 2,000-per-dose cost.
The study caused Activase's share of the US market in such clot-buster drugs
to slump from nearly 70 per cent to 50 per cent.
Mr Raab fought back. He pushed for a Dollars 55m study, funded largely by
Genentech, that would test Activase against streptokinase. The study, called
Gusto, was completed on April 30. Mr David Molowa, a drugs analyst at Bear
Stearns in New York, noted the high risk: 'If it had gone against Activase,
Genentech would be dead.'
But Gusto showed that Activase had better results in preventing heart attack
deaths than streptokinase. Although the difference was small - Activase
saved about one extra life for every 100 patients treated - it was enough to
boost Genentech's share price by Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 38 in less than a
day. Mr Molowa reckons the annual Activase sales of Dollars 180m should soon
rise to Dollars 250m.
Wall Street's analysts have begun to revise upwards their net profit
forecasts for Genentech this year, which already projected a rise of more
than 50 per cent to Dollars 32m, reversing a two-year decline.
Meanwhile Roche appears content to watch its investment and to acquire more
shares - it now has 63 per cent. One of its Swiss competitors, Sandoz, is
following in its footsteps. Last year Sandoz paid Dollars 392m for a 60 per
cent stake in SyStemix, another Californian biotech company.
But other observers in the pharmaceuticals industry believe the Swiss
approach will fail. One is Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive of UK-based
Glaxo. His company has set up R&amp;D partnerships on a limited scale with
several US biotech companies, avoiding large equity investments which, he
says, eventually 'kill a company's spirit'.
The scientific spirit is still very much alive in Mr Levinson's labs. But
Roche would have to think carefully before making a full takeover.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Clinton puts pressure on California in unitary tax row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration is quietly pressing California to change its
company tax laws in a way that may settle the long-running dispute over its
worldwide unitary tax system while raising more money for the financially
strapped state treasury.
If the change were to be made soon enough, it might also head off
retaliation threatened by the British government against US companies and
spare the Clinton administration from having to take sides in the lawsuit
between California and Barclays Bank, which is the test case for the unitary
tax system.
But some big California companies are beginning to move against the proposed
change, which might cost them money, and state legislature officials say it
will be hard to bring together the Democratic and Republican support it
would need.
US Treasury officials are encouraging California to move to a mandatory
'water's edge' system of corporate taxation, which state officials calculate
could raise between Dollars 155m (Pounds 101m) and Dollars 175m a year of
additional revenue.
Under that system, companies are taxed only on income from operations within
the borders of the US, whereas the worldwide unitary method calculates their
global income and then taxes it in proportion to their payroll, property and
sales within the state.
California has already introduced water's edge reporting as an option,
bowing to arguments from Washington that compulsory unitary assessments were
inconsistent with the international tax system.
Foreign companies, though, complain that they have to pay a fee to select
that option, and that California reserves the right to overrule their choice
and impose a unitary tax assessment.
Moving to compulsory water's edge taxation would make California conform
with the other 49 states and with most countries, and ought to settle the
issues raised in the Barclays case, on which the Supreme Court has asked for
the federal government's views.
But 20 to 30 per cent of companies operating in California, including
Caterpillar and British Petroleum, benefit from the unitary system, and have
in the past lobbied against a move to mandatory water's edge report-ing.
The administration does not want the risk of California losing before the
Supreme Court; the state, still in recession and needing to fill another
Dollars 8.6bn budget deficit by June 30, may stand to lose as much as
Dollars 4bn on Barclays and other related cases.

FT  07 JUN 93 / UN acts after Somalia killings: Call for arrest of warlord
after ambush of Pakistani troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS at the UN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council last night decided to take action
against a Somali warlord, after at least 22 Pakistani peacekeeping troops
were killed in an ambush on the outskirts of Mogadishu.
It also called on member states to bring the peacekeeping force in Somalia
up to full strength and to send heavy weaponry, including tanks and attack
helicopters.
US helicopters were already reported to have responded to the ambush by
bombarding three arms dumps belonging to the warlord, General Mohammed Farah
Aideed.
Without naming the warlord, the 15-nation Security Council decided that
after an investigation, those responsible for the killings - and for
inciting them - should be arrested, put on trial and punished.
Gen Aideed's faction is blamed for the ambush, the bloodiest single calamity
to befall UN peacekeepers since the Congo conflict in 1961.
The UN said the Pakistani units were caught in a carefully prepared ambush
on Saturday. Casualties included at least 50 wounded and up to 10 missing,
assumed captured.
The clash came in a chaotic day of shootings and demonstrations sparked off
by UN inspection of Somali arms dumps. At least 23 Somalis died in the
fighting. Italian troops sent a column of tanks and armoured cars with
helicopter cover to rescue 80 Pakistanis and 10 Americans trapped in a
disused factory.
Outraged diplomats at the UN held day-long consultations, before authorising
'all necessary measures' to arrest the killers and those inciting them,
though it was not clear how this could be achieved.
They also called for the 'rapid and accelerated deployment' of military
contingents to bring the UN force in Somalia up to its authorised strength
of 28,000 troops. At present there are 16,700 UN troops in Somalia as well
as a 1,000-strong UN rapid-deployment force.
A US-led multinational force arrived in Mogadishu last December to ensure
relief supplies got through to victims of civil war and famine. But the US
handed control of the operation to the UN last month and has withdrawn most
of its troops.
A report to the Security Council by a senior UN official said it appeared
that Gen Aideed had sought confrontation with the UN 'in order to take
control of the political reconciliation and judicial processes'.
An obstacle in bringing him to trial is the lack of any effective judicial
system in Somalia.
The Security Council resolution re-emphasised the need to disarm all feuding
Somali factions and to neutralise radio broadcasting that contributed to
violence and attacks on the UN force.
The council resolution called on member states 'to contribute, on an
emergency basis, military support and transportation, including armoured
personnel carriers, tanks and attack helicopters' to give the force a
capability to confront and deter future armed attacks.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Two-thirds of workforce show improved skill level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN HAS experienced a training revolution during the past five years.
Nearly two thirds of workers have increased the level of skill they use in
their jobs, and now as many as 56 per cent of employees use computers or
automated equipment.
That is one of the most important findings of a joint
government/industry-commissioned survey of British employment, published
today by the Policy Studies Institute.
It discovered that 54 per cent of employees received training during the
past three years, compared with only a third who had in 1986. The increase
in skills was particularly sharp among technicians and supervisors.
The survey confounds some of the conventional views of industrial skill
levels in Britain. It found that 65 per cent of employees wanted training,
although only 54 per cent thought they were very or fairly likely to receive
it.
Other key findings in the study, the first of its kind in Britain:
Workers feel their jobs are more stressful than they were five years ago,
with 54 per cent saying stress levels had increased since 1988 and 31 per
cent reporting significant levels of stress as a result of their work.
As many as 67.6 per cent of employees claim they are putting a lot more
effort than formally required into their tasks.
Job insecurity is more widespread than before, particularly among
professional management and skilled manual workers. Men feel more insecure
than women. Frustration and dissatisfaction are considerable among many
workers at the lack of responsibility they feel they are given by their
employers. Just over half the sample believe they should have more say in
decisions relating to changes in the organisation of their work.
The proportion who believe they have a principal say over the amount and
pace of their work has risen from 67 per cent in 1984 to 77 per cent last
year.
Trade unionism has not yet been marginalised in the workplace. While 43 per
cent of employees still belong to unions, 59 per cent said unions were
present in the places in which they worked. Only 9 per cent felt their
employers were trying to discourage union membership.
Most workers feel committed to, rather than alienated from, the enterprises
they work for, but only 29 per cent of them would turn down another job that
offered more pay. Just over a quarter of employees receive incentive pay and
53 per cent have formal appraisals of their work annually.
The survey was conducted between May and September of last year based on a
random sample of 3,855 people in work aged between 20 and 60 with a 72 per
cent overall response rate.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Fingerprint system tenders sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOME OFFICE is within weeks of seeking tenders for the UK's first
comprehensive national automated fingerprint recognition system.
It has chosen Computer Management Group, the privately held computing
services company, to help translate the requirements of the 43 police forces
in England and Wales that will use the system into a technical specification
and to provide quality assurance.
Mr Jonathan Duke-Evans, who is responsible for the project at the Home
Office, said he hoped the specification would be complete by the end of the
summer.
A number of police forces are already making use of an automated fingerprint
recognition service provided by International Business Machines. But the
intention is that the new system, known as Nafis, will for the first time
combine both scene-of-crime matching, which means identifying fingerprints
discovered at the scene of a crime, and personal identification - comparing
a suspect's prints with those held on the database.
Nafis is expected to cost up to Pounds 45m by the time it is ready to go
into service in 1996-97. Mr Duke-Evans said the Home Office had an open mind
on the technology to be employed. It could involve large mainframes or
supercomputers, or a new and advanced technology called neural networking,
based on what scientists know of the working of the human mind.
Nafis is expected to become part of a nationwide criminal identification
system that will include the National Criminal Record System, the
Fingerprint Image System and the Police National Network. The Home Office
has been working with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to develop
technology for fingerprint recognition.
CMG is one of the largest private computer services companies in Europe,
making pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 9.5m on sales of Pounds 116m.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Clinton searches for compromise in unitary tax row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration is quietly pressing California to change its
company tax laws in a way that could settle the long-running dispute over
its worldwide unitary tax system while raising more money for the
financially-strapped state treasury.
If the change were to be made soon enough, it could also head off
retaliation threatened by the British government against US companies and
spare the Clinton administration from having to take sides in the lawsuit
between California and Barclays Bank, which is the test case for the unitary
tax system.
But some big California companies are beginning to move against the proposed
change, which could cost them money, and state legislature officials say it
will be hard to bring together the Democratic and Republican support it
would need.
US Treasury officials are encouraging California to move to a mandatory
'water's edge' system of corporate taxation, which state officials calculate
could raise between Dollars 155m and Dollars 175m a year of additional
revenue.
Under this system companies are taxed only on income from operations within
the borders of the US, whereas the worldwide unitary method calculates their
global income, and then taxes it in proportion to their payroll, property
and sales within the state.
California has already introduced water's edge reporting as an option,
bowing to arguments from Washington that compulsory unitary assessments were
out of line with the international tax system.
But foreign companies complain that they have to pay a fee to select this
option, and that California reserves the right to overrule their choice and
impose a unitary tax assessment.
Moving to compulsory water's edge taxation would bring California in line
with the other 49 states and with most countries, and ought to settle the
issues raised in the Barclays case, on which the Supreme Court has asked for
the federal government's views.
But 20 to 30 per cent of companies operating in California, including
Caterpillar and British Petroleum, benefit from the unitary system, and have
in the past lobbied against a move to mandatory water's edge reporting.
The administration does not want the risk of California losing before the
Supreme Court; the state, still in recession and needing to fill another
Dollars 8.6bn budget deficit by June 30, could stand to lose as much as
Dollars 4bn on Barclays and other related cases.
Mr Brad Sherman, chairman of the California's State Board of Equalization
and a member of the state's Franchise Tax Board, is leading the effort to
switch to water's edge. He argues it would raise revenue, prevent damage to
international investment in California and reduce the risk of British
retaliation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Life grows no easier for British Airways, despite moves towards a settlement
with Virgin. That would remove any lingering fears that the company might be
shaken by further embarrassing revelations resulting from litigation in the
US. But BA has now also flown into some fractious disputes with its own
employees. One disagreement with its cabin staff over pay levels appeared
settled last week. But an outstanding quarrel with its pilots could result
in further disruption.
Any more strikes would be punitively expensive. Not only would they have an
immediate financial impact but they could also sap BA's reputation for
quality and service. Trading figures for May already showed a small, but
worrying, drop in higher yielding premium traffic. Fears of lightning
strikes seemingly encouraged business passengers to switch to alternative
flights. Such concerns are unsettling for shareholders considering whether
to take up BA's Pounds 442m rights issue.
Whatever the short term fall-out, though, shareholders may prefer BA to hang
tough. City estimates suggest the airline could lose Pounds 50m at Gatwick
this year. The elimination of such losses would greatly help BA's
profitability. This cause will have been damaged if the fine print reveals
that last week's settlement has hampered its chances of creating a low cost
base for European short-haul flights.

Of the two 'deals of the century' BT did with MCI last week, only one makes
a great deal of sense. The joint venture in international private networks
and value-added services is a reasonable, if limited, initiative to capture
the business of large multinationals. Even here, however, the rush towards
setting up alliances seems well in advance of a real market opportunity, and
is reminiscent of the banks' charge into the securities business. BT's
purchase of a 20 per cent stake in MCI is the really worrying part of the
transaction. It is a little odd that the deal comes after the bullish swirl
surrounding MCI has pushed the share price from around Dollars 35 to over
Dollars 50 this year. BT's defence is that it needs the stake to cement its
relationship with MCI, but Dollars 4.3bn seems a high price for security.
Attention has also focused on AT&amp;T's possible response. Short of the
unlikely and petulant course of pulling out of the deal to buy McCaw, AT&amp;T
is somewhat hamstrung. There has been speculation that AT&amp;T might buy
Vodafone or Mercury from Cable &amp; Wireless. With Bell Canada a partner in
Mercury, a deal there looks improbable. Buying Vodafone would be expensive,
even for AT&amp;T, and its gearing would be stretched even further.
Indeed, as US telecoms companies have average gearing of 85 per cent, it is
notable that BT will still only have gearing of 30 per cent after the MCI
deal is completed. That leaves open the prospect of continuing good dividend
growth or further acquisitions of minority stakes in other telecoms
companies at premium prices. Since BT has not yet shaken off the latter
habit, it may expect scepticism until it makes one of these deals really
work.

The more optimistic tone of the UK property market is good news for the
clearing banks. For once, there is a chance that their bad debt provisions
may be a pleasant surprise. Touche Ross had more good news last week on
receiverships which fell nearly 30 per cent in the first five months of the
year. Queens Moat apart, there has been a remarkable dearth of large
corporate problems. Perhaps, despite Speyhawk, banks are learning not to
call in their loans as soon as collateral values start to rise. Small
companies certainly seem less squeezed than usual for this stage of the
cycle. The unexpected fall in unemployment also promises fewer defaults on
personal loans.
The largest beneficiary should be Barclays whose results last year included
an abnormally large Pounds 226m increase in its general provision. There
should be little need for that to be repeated this year. Indeed, talk may
even turn eventually to the possibility of a release from general provisions
if loan growth remains weak.
Better pre-tax profits may not, though, have much immediate impact on
dividends. Having flagged 6 per cent as its target ratio for tier one
capital, Barclays will need to concentrate on retaining earnings. National
Westminster also needs to build up its 5.2 per cent capital ratio. Apart
from mortgage lending, on which they enjoy high margins at present, many
banks are still heavily dependent on cost cutting for gains in operating
income. After outperforming by 15 per cent so far this year, the sector
needed good news on provisions to justify its advance.

Mr Donald Gordon does not have the popular appeal of Mr George Soros but,
within the narrow world of insurance, his investment decisions are
influential. The stake in Sun Alliance unveiled last week by Transatlantic,
his investment vehicle, was enough to lift the insurance sector against the
trend of a falling market. Since Mr Gordon is also a notable investor in
commercial property, and Sun Alliance's investment portfolio is heavily
weighted in that direction, the comparison with Mr Soros's investment in
British Land might not be too far fetched.
Anticipation of a bid for Sun Alliance certainly looks premature.
Transatlantic took control of Sun Life in 1991, but only after more than a
decade slowly building its stake. Since Transatlantic is capitalised at one
third the size of Sun Alliance, an outright bid would be difficult anyway.
UAP of France, a partner in Transatlantic, is large enough to swallow such
prey. But dire conditions in its domestic market and the prospect of
privatisation leave it occupied closer to home. Even so, Transatlantic's
visible presence on the share register must be discomforting for Sun
Alliance's management, not least while litigation between the two sides is
outstanding.
The market's reaction in marking up insurance shares across the board is
strange. If Mr Gordon's investment really is a play on rising asset prices,
composite and life insurers might be expected to benefit. But with most
already trading at a premium to net assets, it is difficult to argue that
the sector is undervalued.

THE CLINTON administration is, it occasionally seems, the only government in
the world that believes in a planned economy. The planned economy it
believes in is Japan's.
It believes planning helped make Japan the world's most successful economy.
It believes also that the problems Japan poses to its trading partners can
best be dealt with by more planning. If, as seems certain, the US acts on
those beliefs, completion of the Uruguay round, allegedly in sight, may mean
far less than is hoped.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, argued at the ministerial
meeting of the OECD last week that 'in vital areas, Japan's economy is not
open'. The US is, accordingly, to present Japan with tough demands for
market opening. Those demands will embrace computers and supercomputers,
cars and car parts, and financial services, for all of which targets for
import shares are likely to be proposed. In addition, the US is, apparently,
to call on Japan to halve its current account surplus, from the present
level of 3 per cent of gross national product to 1 1/2 per cent.
For its part, the European Commission will ask the Japanese to tighten their
probably illegal export cartel against EC consumers of cars and light
commercial trucks, on the principle that they should share equally in a
downturn, irrespective of the demand for their products. No less a figure
than the OECD's Mr Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general of an organisation
whose raison d'etre was trade liberalisation, legitimised this policy with
his statement that he would 'not rule out protectionism as a policy of last
resort'.
Important relationship
Nevertheless, voluntary export restraints like those on Japanese car exports
to the European Community are an old story and Mr Paye, despite his
prominent position, is not president of the US. What makes the US proposals
to Japan important is that they come from the country that created the
postwar trading system. Yet it now apparently believes that the norms and
rules of the Gatt are largely inapplicable to its most important trading
relationship.
Why it does so is not self-evident. Does the US administration believe that
the Japanese government can manage the external account to within half a
percentage point? Does it expect changes in sectoral trade balances to have
a one-for-one effect on Japan's overall trade balance? Does it recognise
that sectoral import targets imply the cartelisation of targeted Japanese
industries? Does it acknowledge that trade surpluses are a more or less
inevitable outcome of a world with freedom for capital flows?
Greater opportunities
Yet while all this is going on, the OECD ministerial communique states that
ministers will 'do their utmost . . . to ensure the rapid achievement of a
substantial, comprehensive and balanced outcome of the round'. Efforts are,
it appears, being made to complete a comprehensive market access package.
Greater opportunities to sell goods and services in foreign markets are the
hard coin of trade negotiations. If the agreed liberalisation were to be
radical, the Uruguay round might not only be close to completion, but would
also be worth com-pleting.
Unfortunately, any multilateral agreement is only as good as the credibility
of the commitments that underlie it. This is why it is so destructive for
the US to claim that the world is on the brink of a great liberalising
agreement, but that it reserves the right to act outside it. If such
agreements are to endure, as they must, participants must believe that the
agreement is balanced, is in their own interests and will be effectively
implemented.
There cannot be both an effective multilateral trading system and the right
to act unilaterally, as and when one pleases. Instead of pursuing its
narrowly bilateral course with Japan, the US should try to establish clear
rules and multilateral procedures applicable to all countries that are
alleged to violate their commitments. Mr Clinton must be told to choose
between the rule of trade law and the law of the trade policy gun. He will
not be able to have both.

He's been wowing New York bankers with a variation on the old tale about the
heart transplant patient who was offered a choice of donors: an 18-year-old
athlete or a 70-year-old central banker. The preferred Leigh-Pemberton
version involves a brain transplant and a senior Treasury official, although
the punchline's the same. The patient chooses the Treasury official's brain
 -because the organ had never been used.
But when it comes to recycling old chestnuts, who is Observer to complain?

Proof that the day of the entrepreneur is not yet over comes in the dashing

Systems, based in a depressed part of north-east England.
Bradbury heard a few weeks ago that electronics giants Hewlett-Packard of
the US and Japan's Oki were closing their state-of-the-art Dollars 40m
factory in Puerto Rico after internal disagreements. He jumped on a plane
and secured a deal which is bringing some 25 container loads of barely used,
high-quality manufacturing equipment back to South Shields for the
knock-down price of just over Pounds 1m, a fraction of how much it cost when
the plant started operations a year or so ago. The deal will boost
Bradbury's output significantly.
Let's hope he doesn't slip up because he is one of the few star turns on the
Treasury's industrial prospects committee.

Lord Nuffield, the wealthy car tycoon who founded Nuffield College, would be
proud of today's Employment in Britain survey. Nuffield was never happy with
the idea of his college being regarded as a citadel of the social sciences
at the expense of his beloved engineering industry.
So the news that the bulk of the research for the survey was carried out by
Dr Duncan Gallie, a Nuffield fellow, and funded jointly by the Department of
Employment and the Leverhulme Trust, plus private companies such as British
Steel, BT, Sainsbury, and NatWest, would be music to the late tycoon's ears.
A first sign from Britain's industrial heartland, perhaps, that social
research into the workplace may be an assistance and not a threat to
industrial progress?

Virtually everyone agrees that Peter Sutherland, the EC's nominee and former

the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. So what is to be made of the
last-minute shenanigans in the run-up to Wednesday's election of Gatt's new

Some Latin American trade ambassadors have been miffed by the general
assumption that with European and American backing he is a shoe-in for the
job, leaving the two Latin American nominees, Juan Fernando Jaramillo of
Colombia and Julio Lacarte-Muro of Uruguay as also-rans. But experienced
Gatt hands suspect a sub-plot. What is really at stake is the distribution
of deputy posts.
One is earmarked for an American. The second has up to now gone to India,
and Latin America desperately wants the new one likely to be created.

consolidates the hold of Old Etonians on positions of power in the Foreign

Observer cannot remember the last time that four out of six FO ministers all

appearances on the international stage, but it is hard to imagine Lady
Thatcher permitting Britain's international relations to fall into the hands
of a similar cabal when she was running the show.
However, all is not lost. Old Etonian Douglas Hurd has long been rumoured to
want to step down as foreign secretary before the end of this parliament
which should give John Major a chance to promote a grammar school boy to
chief flag-waver.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Observer: Stern choice at the EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The row over who should take over the tiller of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development if poor old Jacques Attali is forced to walk
the plank, is starting to get out of hand.
Whatever one thinks of Attali's time at the helm - and don't forget that the
first president of the EBRD's World Bank grand-daddy was booted out after
only six months - he is a European, at least. True, the US is the biggest
shareholder, but the Europeans have majority control. Just as the Americans
like to have one of their own running the World Bank, it is hard to imagine
the Europeans hiring a yank to head their bank.
Of course, it would be a tremendous coup for the EBRD if it could recruit
someone of the calibre of the World Bank's Ernie Stern. But why should
German-born Stern, 59, want to move from being number two at the World Bank
to being number two at a much smaller and less influential institution,
unless he was pushed out?
However, there is another Stern who has just found a safe berth in the EBRD.
Professor Nicholas Stern, a 47-year-old development economist at the London
School of Economics, has agreed to step into the chief economist's slot at
the EBRD, following the sudden withdrawal of Michael Bruno, former head of
Israel's central bank.
The EBRD job had always looked a rather odd move for a politically
well-connected sort like Bruno. Perhaps he does have his eye on the chief
economist's job at the World Bank after all.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Morsels from a groaning table: EC countries are reluctant to
give eastern Europe freer access to their markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, LIONEL BARBER CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI, PATRICK BLUM and
NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former communist countries of central and eastern Europe have come in
from the cold. Yet their exports are still frequently being frozen out of
western markets.
In the past few years, the principles and practices of western capitalism
have streamed into eastern Europe. The European Community's exports to the
region are booming. But the goods produced there are a long way from flowing
westwards with the same momentum.
The EC has decided on a partial liberalisation of trade with Poland, the
Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria under association
agreements concluded during the last 18 months. So far, however, the
Community appears to have received the better part of the bargain. The EC's
trade surplus with the five core countries in the region (now six following
the break-up of Czechoslovakia) rose to Ecu2.5bn last year from Ecu1.4bn in
1991. During previous years, up to 1990, the EC ran a deficit with the
region.
The association agreements, while setting down a 10-year timetable for
dismantling trade barriers for industrial products, still contain a
significant element of protectionism. In particular, limits remain in force
on eastern exports of so-called 'sensitive' goods such as iron and steel,
farm products, chemicals, textiles, clothing and footwear.
In all these products, the west is suffering from overcapacity. These are,
however, precisely the sectors - making up 35 to 45 per cent of eastern
Europe's exports to the EC - where, on grounds of price and quality, the
east has the greatest export potential. The barriers highlight the EC's
apparent desire to keep out imports in any area where eastern Europe is
competitive.
Aware that freer trade has, up to now, mainly benefited the west, the EC
Commission has launched an initiative to improve the terms of the
liberalisation timetable.
Combined with plans for greater political dialogue with eastern European
countries, the trade proposals will be high on the agenda at the EC summit
in Copenhagen on June 21-22.
Under the proposals, pushed through by Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Hans Van den
Broek, the EC's two external affairs commissioners, customs duties on
industrial goods such as cars would be lifted by the end of 1994 - a
two-year advance on the initial plan. Additionally, the Commission wants to
shift from a quota-based system for imports to less restrictive ceilings, so
that the east Europeans would not automatically face higher tariffs if they
breached import targets.
Although bolder than forecast, the plan, if implemented, would be relatively
modest. Fundamental restrictions on agriculture and textiles would remain.
The Community would also reserve the right to impose 'contingent protection'
 -for instance, anti-dumping duties - against sudden surges in low-price
imports of industrial goods.
The Commission believes the proposed softening of trade terms represents the
maximum that can be agreed by EC governments in view of recession-induced
protectionist pressures. Last week, Mr Van den Broek pointed to 'reserve'
among member states about the economic implications. Longer-term logic,
however, points to the need for further liberalisation.
Opening the door to eastern exports provides one of the best ways of
stimulating the region's prosperity - and hence of securing its political
stability.
Many EC states, above all Germany, want to see more economic growth in the
east as a means of stemming migration of dissatisfied easterners. Lower
barriers would provide a means of satisfying western companies investing in
the region that their output will find export outlets.
Mr Jim Rollo, a trade policy expert from Britain's Royal Institute of
International Affairs, who believes the Commission's latest proposals do not
go far enough, highlights the potential benefits of more vigorous measures.
High growth in the area could increase overall imports into eastern and
central Europe by as much as Dollars 400bn a year (at 1990 prices) by 2010,
he estimates. At least half of this would represent purchases from the EC,
increasing demand for EC goods by Dollars 200bn a year - twice as much as
the Community currently sells to the US. 'It would be like having two new US
markets on your doorstep,' Mr Rollo says.
For all the longer-term arguments in favour of liberalisation measures, the
problems faced by specific EC industries greatly increase the political
difficulty of pushing them through.
Tomorrow, EC foreign ministers will discuss the Commission's package in
Luxembourg. Most countries have voiced some objections. But the Danish
presidency of the EC remains confident, declaring that package is 'the bare
minimum for the Community to remain credible with these (eastern)
countries'.
Portugal remains the most obdurate. Although less than 0.5 per cent of its
total imports come from eastern Europe, Lisbon argues that more
liberalisation would squeeze its exports, particularly textiles, out of EC
markets - a fear broadly shared by France and Belgium.
Germany is now signalling unreserved support, increasing the likelihood of a
successful outcome. Last year, Germany last year accounted for 56 per cent
of EC trade with the five core eastern countries - twice as much as the
combined eastern trade of France, Italy and the UK. Despite the severe
economic downturn in Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's emphasis on the
political stakes has tipped the balance in Bonn.
Doubts among industrialists remain, however. Mr Ludolf von Wartenberg,
general manager of the Federation of German Industry, says his organisation
welcomes the proposals 'in principle'. But he points out that, for the first
time in the industrial era, Germany now faces the risk that jobs will
migrate to low-wage countries on its doorstep. Hourly wages in the Czech and
Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland are between one-tenth and one-twentieth
of levels in western Germany. One Bonn government official says: 'It is as
if we had Hong Kong just 80km from Berlin.'
An EC compromise on steel imports from the Czech and Slovak republics,
agreed in April, highlighted the importance of German views. Mr Martin
Bangemann, the EC's industry commissioner, went to Germany to explain the
agreement to steel executives.
The volume of Czech and Slovak steel imported into the EC will be allowed to
rise about 36 per cent this year compared with 1991 figures. But even this
increase will still lead to a sharp cut in imports compared with 1992, when
imports from the east were much higher than the year before.
EC industrialists and farmers regularly underline the threat posed by
eastern imports. Qualms about eastern competition were illustrated by EC
anti-dumping action against eastern steel exporters last year.
In April, the EC imposed a one-month ban on imports of live animals, meat,
milk and dairy products from the east. Although the EC claimed this was
aimed at stopping spread of foot-and-mouth disease, eastern Europe saw it as
blatant protectionism. The measure was quickly rescinded after outraged
eastern European countries took counter-measures.
For specific products such as fertilisers and steel, relatively small extra
volumes of eastern imports can squeeze loss-making western producers by
causing large reductions in marginal prices. In overall foreign trade terms,
however, opening of trade to the east has clearly brought net advantages to
the west.
In 1991 and 1992 the Community's exports to central and eastern Europe rose
faster than its imports. Compared with 1988, the EC's exports to the region
last year were up 130 per cent, while imports were up 82 per cent.
An unpublished report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development shows that, even in some of the so-called 'sensitive' goods, the
industrialised west has registered benefits in trade with the east. Based on
a breakdown of 1991 figures (full product details for 1992 are not yet
available), OECD countries that year improved their eastern trade balances
in several areas of trade in this category.
The report points out that exports of 'sensitive' products often represent
the sole means for eastern countries to compensate for sharp falls in
formerly staple exports to the old Soviet bloc.
The EC's trade surplus has probably increased further this year. Exports
from the east have been curtailed by the recession in Germany, as well as by
overvaluation of eastern European currencies.
The Czech Republic increased exports to the EC by only 1.9 per cent in the
first quarter compared with the same period last year. Czech imports from
the EC, by contrast, rose 40 per cent against the year-earlier period.
Hungarian exports to the EC in the first quarter this year are reckoned to
have fallen about 25 per cent compared with the same period in 1992.
The growing trade gap in the EC's favour demonstrates one reason why the EC
can afford more generosity. Another more fundamental argument in favour of
liberalisation focuses on the large imbalance in the relative importance of
trade between the two halves of Europe.
'A billion dollars of extra trade is trivial for us (the west), but it is
highly significant for them,' says Mr John Flemming, chief economist at the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Further
liberalisation would have only a small impact on the west, he says, but
could bring 'colossal' benefits for the east.
The combined value of the EC's trade with central and eastern Europe last
year made up only about 1.7 per cent of the Community's total exports and
imports - less than the EC's trade with either Austria or Sweden.
Central and eastern Europe is the source of only a tiny proportion of EC
countries' overall imports of 'sensitive' goods. In 1991, according to OECD
figures, the percentages ranged from 1.7 per cent for chemicals and 2.3 per
cent for agricultural products to 2.7 per cent for iron and steel and 2.8
per cent for textiles. Following a sharp reduction in sales to the former
Comecon area, central and eastern European countries, by contrast, now carry
out about 50 per cent of their trade with the EC, compared with roughly 25
per cent in 1989.
Eager to seize opportunities for western sales, east European trade
representatives in Brussels have reacted favourably to the latest Commission
proposals. The reception from governments at home, however, has been more
grudging. Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech industry and trade minister,
highlights 'serious obstacles' in export access to the EC.
In Warsaw, however, one senior Polish official takes a more moderate line.
The EC plan represents 'not five steps forward but half a step forward,' the
official says. At least, the proposals show 'the EC is starting to speak the
same language as we have been using'.
Beyond the question of trade, the main preoccupation for central and eastern
Europe is the question of joining the EC. As a fundamental part of the
association agreements, these states have committed themselves to adapting
their political and economic structures to the demands of eventual
membership.
Mindful of the cost of absorbing much poorer countries, the EC is, however,
avoiding giving the easterners a firm date. Even the Commission's relatively
vague plans for greater political dialogue with the east have caused concern
among traditionalist member states such as Belgium, wary of opening the
membership door.
'It doesn't make sense to speculate about any (membership) date,' Mr Van den
Broek said last week. One senior EC official says pointedly 2000 is the year
not when these countries can join, but when they can have free trade.
The Community is implicitly making membership conditional on a reduction of
the economic gulf dividing the EC and the eastern applicants. At present,
GDP per capita in Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics is
probably between one-fifth and one-tenth of the EC average.
Without adequate eastern access to western markets, the gap in economic
performance cannot narrow significantly - condemning the east to an
indefinite wait. If, on the other hand, the Community can decisively
accelerate trade liberalisation, the period in the EC ante-room would be
shorter and less arduous. And the eventual rewards would be much greater -
for both east and west.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Maxwell - keeping the issue in sight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST THREE of the 55 charges for which Invesco MIM was fined last week by
its regulator, the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, related to
the scandal of the Mirror Group Pension Scheme. Imro gave no details of
these breaches of regulations. Nor did it say how seriously it viewed these
lapses compared with, say, pricing errors in unit trusts or defective
record-keeping. Meanwhile, it appears that the Securities and Investments
Board intends never to publish its own report into the failure of Imro to
prevent the Maxwell disaster.
Somehow, the main issue - the failure of law and regulation to stop the
multi-million pound Maxwell thefts - seems to have slipped from sight.
Maxwell pensioners might well view this with dismay. Millions of others are
left to worry about the security of their own pensions.
Imro can argue that it has performed its latest regulatory task with
diligence, and that its ability to complete disciplinary proceedings within
a morning shows up the wastefulness of formal legal proceedings through the
courts.
But Imro has been acting here in conjunction with the Securities and
Investments Board, and it is SIB's responsibilities which raise the more
interesting issues. Only two weeks ago, after all, SIB chairman Mr Andrew
Large published his formal review of the regulatory system for the financial
services industry, a review stimulated precisely by the Maxwell affair.
Vigorous enforcement
Mr Large concluded that, in general, standards of regulation had to be laid
down and enforced more vigorously by SIB. In particular, the board ought to
be more prepared to use its own powers, including the banning of individuals
from the financial services industry under Section 59 of the Financial
Services Act, and its ability publicly to criticise authorised persons under
Section 60. Neither of these sections has been used before. There is also
Section 61 which covers restitution on behalf of investors.
Whether immediate action under these headings is likely is not clear. On
Section 59, for instance, it is understood that SIB will seek to publish a
policy paper before selecting its first victim. In his review Mr Large said
that Section 59 had previously been thought impractical to use, but a way of
implementing it had recently been worked out. He expected SIB to be seen to
make use of Section 59 in future.
With the disciplinary process by Imro over Invesco MIM complete, the
opportunity for SIB action is now available. Indeed, Mr Large's brave words
could be viewed as empty if SIB were to fail to respond to by far its
biggest disciplinary case so far.
Broader canvas
SIB has to work, however, on a broader canvas. Legal actions by the Mirror
Pension Scheme Trustees against Invesco MIM for the recovery of lost assets
are under way. Criminal charges are pending against Mr Robert Maxwell's
sons. These legal cases make matters more complicated. Clearly, however, SIB
cannot afford to wait for years until the courts have finished their job.
There are also problems of jurisdiction. For instance, pension fund trustees
and, in some cases, even custodians do not fall within the boundaries of the
Financial Services Act. The hope is that the Goode Committee on pension law
will come up with some answers, but it will not now report until the end of
September, with legislation further off.
In the meantime the welfare of the Maxwell pensioners becomes pressing. The
question is whether Section 61 would be the best way of claiming
compensation from companies and advisers connected with Maxwell, or whether
SIB should use that potential weapon to encourage a general voluntary
settlement.
SIB appears to be using its influence to encourage a settlement through the
charitable trust headed by Sir John Cuckney. Perhaps this is the only way to
ensure that reasonable sums are raised soon enough to help old-age
pensioners. Such a solution would, however, serve to emphasise the frailty
and pragmatism of the system. What is really needed is a demonstration that
investors, and certainly the vulnerable members of pension schemes, can look
for powerful and reliable protection.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Clan hatreds divide Left from Right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tory party's break-up into warring factions is reminiscent of the Labour
party of years gone by - not of the struggle against Militant, but of the
much older battles of the Bevanites against the party's mainstream. These
battles were accompanied by anti-heresy drives, witch-hunting and slogans
such as a 'party within a party'.
The Conservative struggles are reminiscent of these battles in another way
too: there was little intrinsic link between the policies which were
supposed to unite the members of various factions. Personalities and clan
loyalties were more important.
There is a virtuoso description by Matthew Parris of the links - or lack of
links - between the various kinds of latter-day Thatcherite in last week's
Spectator. According to Parris, the former prime minister is emerging as a
cult leader. 'Just as a messiah starts his life as a real man with a real
plan who does things, measurable things, in the real world, and ends his
life as the idealisation of a man, an abstraction almost, whose claimed
works are unnumbered and ill-defined and whose function is to inspire, so
does this woman now move from the part of her life when she did things to
the part of her life where she just is: a visible beacon.'
But it is very unclear to what practical path this beacon points. The
important element is betrayal - 'that strange alloying of supremacy with
martyrdom' - whether by her own cabinet or in the way the Europeans
interpreted the Single Market Act.
The days when Thatcherites had to defend unpopular actions like tax
increases to bring down the budget deficit, leaving ailing firms to find
their own salvation, pricing people into jobs, and so on, are long since
past.
Present-day Thatcherism overlaps another faction: anti-Majorism for its own
sake. Of course the latter contains a large element of snobbery; but it is
more complex than that. At one time the Tory grandees were just as scathing
about Margaret Thatcher. I can always get an easy laugh on the Continent by
citing Harold Macmillan's view that her government had 'too many Estonians
and too few Etonians'.
Perhaps the simple truth is that to be anti-Major is simply fashionable
among some of the politically minded young as it once was to be anti-Selwyn
Lloyd, or anti-Harold Wilson - whose cosy-glow electric fires were the
victims of such superior mockery by Private Eye.
Not that the so-called Tory Left, which surrounds the present prime
minister, is much pleasanter. Some of its more ruthless tactics - such as
putting the squeeze on members via their constituency parties, or uttering
dire threats to those who are cool on Maastricht - recall the last time this
wing of the Tories was close to the throne, in the days of Ted Heath in
1970-74. Both wings suffer from gangster-like obsession with the question:
'Is he or she one of us?'
A weird aspect of the present polarisation is the assumption by nearly all
political commentators that interest in European monetary union or even in
the exchange rate mechanism is a prerogative of the Tory Left and that no
one on the Right would touch them with a barge pole.
Alas I must spoil the game with some economic distinctions: even the concept
of an Economic Right as a simplification. At one time the Right consisted of
protectionists, including Alan Clark when he was not writing his diary. But
even the more market-oriented Economic Right has been split between those
who insist on a framework of fiscal as well as monetary restraint, and the
mislabelled supply-siders who want to cut taxes in virtually all
circumstances. 'Old time religion' and 'Snake oil merchants' are the terms
of endearment that fly around. This split has been especially evident in the
US, but has its echoes in Britain too. To ask which of these attitudes is
more Right or more Left, is to put more strain on these terms than they can
bear.
The more ambitious goals of European union indeed appeal more to the Tory
Left than to the Right. But the idea of some kind of exchange rate link, as
a deterrent to inflationary policies, as well as an aid to trade, has
nothing left-wing about it. Indeed in the closing years of the Bretton Woods
system, the desire to leap to exchange rate freedom was a radical one,
strongly opposed by financial conservatives. In the 1980s, the ERM was quite
consciously embraced by many sound-money supporters as a way of imposing
monetary constraints, which would appeal to a broader constituency than
domestic monetarism. Left-of-centre economists who criticise the
'straitjacket' of the ERM and the Maastricht treaty are quite right from
their own point of view.
There was a time when the Tory Economic Right took the greatest delight in
quoting James Callaghan (scripted by Peter Jay, who was in turn paraphrasing
Milton Friedman), to the effect that governments could not spend their way
to prosperity. Now an alliance which I have called the Black-Red Coalition,
ranging from journalists such as William Rees-Mogg to Anatole Kaletsky, has
sprung up which believes than they can, so long as they use the monetary and
not the fiscal route; and that they are stopped from doing so mainly by the
lingering desire of some around John Major to rejoin the ERM.
Would that economic policy was so easy. Intellectual short cuts are
required; but the Left-Right dichotomy is a hopeless method of finding one's
way around these minefields.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Letter: Banana producers need support while diversification
takes place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms HARRIET LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In last year's much fought-over deal, the EC has not 'Gone bananas'
(Editorial, June 3). The livelihoods of farmers, communities and, in some
cases, whole nations rest on the EC standing by those promises of assured
access to bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
Europe has historical obligations to countries where it created and
maintained a dependency on bananas. The EC also has legally binding
obligations under the Lome Convention to maintain protection of ACP bananas
until the year 2000.
Without that shelter, the fairer wages and better working conditions of
small-scale farmers in ACP countries will be sacrificed for cheaper fruit
grown by US multinationals on huge Latin American plantations. In the
Windward Islands, for example, unemployment could quickly double to
two-thirds of the workforce.
Responding to predictions of sharp price rises, agriculture commissioner
Steichen points out that prices are higher in Germany, where no import
duties are imposed, than in the Benelux countries, which already apply the
20 per cent import duty now being extended EC-wide.
EC banana imports have risen substantially in recent years, with Latin
American producers increasing their share from 50 per cent to 67 per cent
over three years. They will be the beneficiaries of future growth in
consumption, notably in eastern Europe. Moreover, the Community has said
that quotas may be increased to meet future demand. The current agreement
simply maintains ACP producers' present import levels, giving them time to
adjust their economies.
Everyone agrees on the need to encourage growers of Eurobananas to
diversify, but that cannot be done overnight. Instead the EC should support
long-term diversification programmes in ACP countries, while continuing
preferential access until 2000.

FT  07 JUN 93 / The land of the rising surplus: The dilemma posed by Japan's
trade imbalance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Japanese officials had any hopes that they could avoid a confrontation
with the US over the two countries' strained trade relations, last week's
Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development talks in Paris must
have dispelled them.
At the OECD ministerial talks, the US subjected Japan to unrelenting
criticism over its trade surplus. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury
secretary, said the surplus was a drag on world growth and warned: 'That
must change.' Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, reiterated the US demand
that trade agreements with Japan deliver measurable results in reducing the
surplus.
This week, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, is expected to
outline proposals to halve the Japanese trade surplus to 1.5 per cent of
gross domestic product, partly by demanding that Japan agree on targets to
deliver shares of its domestic markets to foreign exporters.
US business is also delivering to Tokyo a stream of demands for market
access. After US apple growers pressed their case in Tokyo last Thursday, it
was the turn of semiconductor producers on Friday. They will be followed
next week by construction companies .
It will not be easy for Japan to satisfy US requests: its capacity to pump
up domestic demand to suck in imports has been significantly curtailed since
the mid-1980s. Japanese officials are sceptical about how quickly the
current account surplus, worth Dollars 117.6bn in 1992 and expected to reach
Dollars 140bn this year, can be reduced. The surplus with the US is worth
about Dollars 50bn. Mr Nobuyori Kodaira, director of the Americas division
at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, remarked: 'The factors
behind the US trade deficit cannot be expected to change overnight.'
The scepticism reflects the mixed success of past attempts to reduce the
surplus. The most concerted effort was during the late 1980s, after Japan's
current account surplus rose to Dollars 87bn in 1987. Largely in response to
foreign pressure, Japan cut interest rates to expand domestic demand and
boost imports. At the same time, the US and Japanese governments set up the
Structural Impediments Initiative to examine trade imbalances.
The policy was successful as far as economic growth and import demand were
concerned. The Japanese economy grew by 4 per cent a year or more between
1987 and 1991, while the current account surplus fell to Dollars 35.8bn in
1990.
However, the boom also created a damaging side-effect. It prompted an
unsustainable rise in land and stock prices amid the rampant speculation of
the late 1980s.
As economic growth has slowed over the past two years - down to 1.3 per cent
last year - demand for imports has fallen sharply. The terms of trade have
also shifted since 1990. The fall in oil prices has reduced Japan's import
bill, while the strength of the yen has inflated dollar-denominated export
prices. The result has been a relentless rise in the current account surplus
from just over 1 per cent of Japanese GDP in 1990 to 3.2 per cent last year.
As a senior US business executive in Tokyo puts it: 'The measures of the
late 1980s were a political success because they defused the tension. But
economically they failed. The US is right back where we started.'
That is only partly true. While the problem is familiar, the context for
talks about reducing Japan's trade surplus is different from that of the
mid-1980s.
The end of the cold war has shifted the basis for the relationship. The US
alliance with Japan, built on the need to contain communism in Asia,
anchored the relationship even when trade tensions threatened to drive them
apart. Economics has emerged as the dominant issue, and the Clinton
administration appears to want to take a more assertive approach than its
predecessors.
In addressing the problem of its surplus, Japanese politicians, bureaucrats
and industrialists will face tougher choices than in the 1980s. During the
past 10 months the government has announced plans to spend more than Dollars
200bn to steer the economy away from outright recession. It has succeeded,
only to find itself confronting the equally pressing task of renegotiating
its trade relationship with the US.
Macro-economic policy has been adjusted, partly to cut the surplus. Official
interest rates are at an all-time low of 2.5 per cent, and since last August
the government has announced special pump-priming measures worth Y24,000bn
to revive the economy.
Change has also been forced upon it by the appreciation of the yen. A chorus
of complaint from Tokyo has accompanied the yen's rise this year from about
Y125 to the dollar to about Y107, an increase that has made Japanese
exporters less competitive.
Senior Japanese government officials hoped the spending measures would
satisfy the US. But Mr Bentsen describes them as a 'useful first step'. He
wants the Japanese government to use higher public spending and tax cuts to
stimulate domestic demand.
There is a limit to what macro-economic policy can achieve, however. In the
late 1980s, growth of about 4 per cent a year was required to reduce Japan's
trade surplus significantly. Even the most optimistic forecasters do not
believe such growth is possible until late 1995.
The scale of stimulus required to promote such growth is opposed by the Bank
of Japan and the finance ministry. They argue that the economy would start
overheating again, while the public finances would be compromised. A senior
Bank official explained: 'We will set our policy according to our long-term
domestic needs, not international calls for higher growth.'
For the ruling Liberal Democratic party, neither of the main alternatives to
macro-economic stimulus is appetising.
The first is to forge bilateral trade agreements with the US. Mr Kantor has
identified seven sectors for talks: cars, car parts, semiconductors,
computers, supercomputers, telecommunications and construction.
The political risk for the LDP is that market share agreements would
alienate Japanese exporters already hit by the high yen. Special agreements
with the US would also antagonise Japan's other trading partners.
However, if Japan rejects such deals, negotiations will shift to issues
potentially more sensitive for the LDP. The second alternative would be
reform of the so-called structural impediments of Japanese attitudes and
business practices, which many foreign companies allege discriminate against
them.
Senior Japanese officials expect the US to renew calls for Japan to become a
more consumer-led society, which saves less and spends more. The gross
savings ratio in Japan in 1990 was 34.6 per cent of GDP, compared with 14.4
per cent in the US.
The opening of markets has supporters among Japan's younger politicians and
consumer groups, as well as Bank of Japan governor Mr Yasushi Mieno and
senior officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
But for structural reform to succeed, the LDP would risk alienating some of
its most important constituencies, by opening up relatively protected
industries such as construction, retailing and agriculture. The construction
industry is a vital source of funds for the LDP; and the party's base is in
rural constituencies.
In the late 1980s the LDP briefly squared the circle. It stimulated the
economy, cut the trade surplus, mollified Washington and still satisfied
domestic supporters because high growth avoided painful economic change. It
will not be so easy this time. In the next few months the government will
tread a tortuous path between alienating the US by resisting its demands,
loosening the finance ministry's grip on public purse strings, and forcing
its domestic business supporters to accept reform.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Letter: High cost of Czech currency exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL A ASHMORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy should look internally if Czech economic recovery is
not to be stifled by unfair trading conditions (Letters, June 2). The recent
addition of little stamps in the corner of common currency notes to
differentiate them in the Czech Republic and Slovakia has ensured that Czech
notes are not accepted in Slovakia and vice versa. Hotels will 'exchange'
notes at 83 per cent of face value, plus 2 per cent handling charge, and
banks at 88 per cent, plus 2 per cent.
Consequently, on my recent journey from Frenstat (N Moravia) to Smokovec
(Slovakia) and return to Brno (S Moravia) my Czech-Slovak currency lost 26
per cent at bank rates and 34 per cent at hotel rates. These penal exchange
rates and non-acceptance of each other's currency was not notified by Cedok,
the common tourist agency. I urge Mr Dlouhy to review this monetary policy
if the tourist trade is not to be stifled.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Letter: Manufacturers protected already - at a cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PHILIP OPPENHEIM MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Claude Imbert of Le Point suggests that we 'extend to other sectors the
system of Community preference already in place in agriculture' (the Common
Agricultural Policy); and that 'we (the EC) should not fear to bring in
quotas' to restrict imports of manufactured products ('Visions of Europe',
June 1).
I am sorry to have to disabuse Mr Imbert of his beguiling notion of a CAP
for industry, but the truth is that the Community has already been following
this policy for years. Euro-champions such as Philips and Thompson have been
granted huge subsidies while import quotas and anti-dumping duties cover a
huge swathe of manufactured products ranging from steel to CD players and
cars to machine tools. Indeed, there are very few goods which are not
covered by some kind of EC import barrier.
The result has been that Europe's industry has become steadily more
uncompetitive, and less and less able to compete outside of its high-cost,
protected European base. A bit like the CAP, really.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Letter: Power sharing in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID STEWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report that President De Klerk had 'rejected black majority rule'
created widespread confusion and concern ('De Klerk resists rule of black
majority in S Africa', May 26).
President De Klerk rejects the Westminster 'winner takes all' formula
because of his conviction that as many of South Arica's complex interest
groups as possible should feel themselves included in, rather than alienated
from, government. This can be achieved through acceptable mechanisms such as
strong regional states, the constitutional limitation of majority power,
without a minority veto, and special majorities for some types of
legislation.
Most of our parties are multi-racial, so there is no question of resisting
'Black majority rule' or of entrenching 'white' power. President De Klerk
rejects the abuse of majority power to the detriment of minorities, however
that majority is composed. He and other political leaders believe that, at
this stage, no single party can rule South Africa alone regardless of its
majority. They accordingly support the idea of a government of national
unity based on power sharing during the first five years. However, the
underlying realities will not change during that period and some inclusive
formula for the continuation of a form of power-sharing will, in all
likelihood, be necessary.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Letter: Price to pay for clearer roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I fully endorse your editorial, 'For whom the motorway tolls' (June 2).
There should be two reasons for road pricing and fuel taxes.
The first is to encourage more energy-efficient transport and a switch from
road to rail.
The second is to relieve urban congestion and pollution in Britain.
As you suggest, there may be a third reason in the government's mind, namely
to raise revenue for the massive budget deficit. This has nothing to do with
the environment, any more than the VAT on heating bills does.
To encourage more energy-efficient transport, taxes must be raised on fuel.
In fairness, Mr Lamont, the former chancellor, indicated in his last Budget
that the government would do just that over a period of time. There is
plenty of scope for tax increases. The price of petrol is around 20 per cent
cheaper in real terms than it was 10 years ago. A Pounds 3 gallon of petrol
would not be out of order.
There is no easy way of combating urban congestion. Fuel taxes will not
significantly affect it, though they will longer journeys. Road pricing or
severe restrictions on parking are the only solutions.
However, as David Howell MP suggested (Letters, June 2), it is important to
provide attractive alternatives for motorists, not just pocket the cash. I'm
glad the FT is promoting this debate.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Critics come in for quite a bashing in this year's Royal Academy Summer
Exhibition illustrated catalogue. Tom Phillips has written a brave, fighting
introduction in which he says: 'More sophisticated and more fearless than
the critics (who annually wilt before abundance to become a feeble chorus of
ritual complaint), the public enjoys the challenge of a show in which
visitors can make their own selection and back their judgments against those
of the pundits who, historically, have seldom been right.'
I rather agree with him - about the public, and I also agree with him when
he says almost every other venue of contemporary art has become a fashion
house, and, 'an austere temple of orthodoxy'.
Exactly the same things can be said when it comes to architecture. There is
nowhere else in London where Quinlan Terry can rub shoulders with Richard
Rogers, or where a visitor can have a good laugh at Peter Cook's old jokes
while enjoying the silvered elegance of Norman Foster's work. There is
nowhere else in the world which would give so much room to so much
pedestrian work - simply because it is ploddingly made by elderly
academicians all of whom have a right to be shown. But there is no doubt the
RA Summer Show (apart from its natural bias towards its own members) is
dogma-free. Which is more than can be said of most architectural schools,
most architectural critics, the Arts Council and the Architecture
Foundation.
The architecture room in Gallery Six is crowded and clearly designed to make
critics wilt at its richness. The most striking exhibit is a well selected
work of the artist Ben Johnson. He is not an architect but an artist who is
almost obsessed, in the best sense, by architecture ancient and modern. His
large painting has a long title - 'Footfalls echo in the memory down the
passage we did not take towards the door we never opened.' It is a
reconstruction of Piero della Francesca's 'Ideal City' an exercise in
architectural perspective and town planning. It is not a copy but an attempt
to understand the geometric sources of the painting which hangs in the
palace at Urbino. We know that Piero was a mathematician and scientist and
that he achieved extraordinary architectural effects in the fifteenth
century without the aid of computers. Ben Johnson has produced his pictorial
analysis by working with a group known as the Alberti Group which made a
three dimensional model of the Piero painting and used computers to see how
the remarkable perspectives were achieved. It is, apart from being pleasing
to look at, a very appropriate picture to hang above the mixed efforts of
architects in the room as an inspiration and lesson.
The recent past is also very present at the Academy. Two words crop up with
depressing regularity - 'the late'. The loss of the artists Sir Sydney
Nolan, Peter Greenham and Dame Elizabeth Frink is distressing indeed and it
is hard to believe that the energy of architect Sir James Stirling is no
longer in this world. There is a handsome tribute to him made more poignant
by the life-like bronze bust of him by Celia Scott. His drawings are a very
particular taste - strangely angled axonometrics that make his buildings
look more like angular sculpture than places of habitation or work. I was
prompted to think of Stirling as I looked at the drawing of the proposed
extension to the Academy of Fine Arts by John Partridge of HKPA Architects.
How tame it is when you think of the memorable wing that Stirling added to
the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart. Architectural originality is rare - and
Stirling certainly didn't pull it off every time. His scheme for the City of
London's Mappin and Webb site is exhibited again here and there can be no
doubt it is looking dated before it is built.
When it comes to dated buildings, how depressing it is to contemplate the
British Library, which one day is planned to open at St. Pancras. It is not
only dated looking but already a complete period piece. The architect, Colin
St. John Wilson, exhibits - in all its blushing horror - a silkscreen print
of the scarlet North elevation of the building and a model with a scarlet
person in it of the proposed King's Library. The removal of the King's
Library from the British Museum is an act of vandalism that is hard to
forgive. To house it in this six storey glass bookcase, the design of which
has clearly been based upon the rare books library at Yale University, is
sacrilege. Everyone dreads the closure of the British Museum Reading Room -
it is as bad as knocking down an irreplaceable cathedral - Mr Wilson's new
library merely adds insult to the injury.
It is good to see Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe's humane garden designs in the
architecture room. His detailed drawing repays study. I was intrigued by
Norman Foster's proposals for the Reichstag in Berlin - he puts a beautiful
umbrella over the rebuilt ruin - a simple and moving idea. His silver models
of other German projects are handsome and the one of the proposed City Hall
for Marseilles should not be missed. It lurks in gallery one.
When you have had enough of the motley collection of architects' dreams one
thing the RA is always good for is that it recognises that the tradition of
landscape painting continues to thrive in England. Michael Andrews's 'Oare,
The Vale of Pewsey' and the glorious painting by David Inshaw, 'Chestnut
Tree, Honey Street' are great paintings by any standards and calm reminders
of things more perpetual than shifting architectural values and the
confusion of the critical debate.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Arts: La Ronde - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Royal Ballet triple bill is an ungainly affair, over-long at three
hours and twenty minutes, and unbalanced in its components. The return of
Checkmate is important, and welcome as a tribute to mark the 95th birthday
of Dame Ninette de Valois. It reminds us that not only do we owe her
everything as founder of our national ballet, but that her choreographies -
the company should have brought back Rake's Progress, too, for this
celebration - are enduringly sure in the theatre. The restoration of
Prodigal Son to the repertory is valuable in that it offers Irek Mukhamedov
a role which he dances with marvellous intensity. The revival was rather
less happy, though, as an account of Balanchine's text: it lacked that Art
Deco clarity of outline which must make the piece seem rite quite as much as
drama.
Reasons to justify the arrival of Glen Tetley's La Ronde at Covent Garden
are hard to find. The piece was made for the National Ballet of Canada six
years ago. It is set to Erich Korngold's Sinfonietta, a boyhood piece - he
was fifteen when he wrote it - which at best sounds like fake Richard
Strauss, and at worst (and most often so) like Korngold. To its over-blown
and blatant measures (a boy who could write stuff like this was fore-doomed
to Hollywood), we see the sequence of linked erotic encounters - A makes
love to B who makes love to C - which bring us, after ten industriously
mimed intimacies, back to the first member of the daisy-chain. Only ten
dancers, but as many orgasms: it is a ballet of under-population but
over-copulation.
La Ronde lasts - was that all? - fifty minutes. Fifty very similar minutes,
since unless the participants were to hang from the chandelier, there is
little possible choreographic variety. Tetley's dances are sinuous but
superficial, and the characters are cyphers. There is a great deal of
scenery by John Macfarlane which whistles in and out and looks costly as a
substitute for choreographic vitality, and Alt Wien costuming which soon
lands on the ground as the wearers enjoy their few minutes of fun. Even
after the last couple has, as it were, been screwed down, there is a tedious
reprise of relationships as the remaining glutinous pages of the score have
to be used up. The cast work hard. Fiona Chadwick, playing an actress,
suggests that there might be feelings under the cardboard of her character;
and I thought an Italian newcomer, Maria Galeazzi, moved with a beautifully
open style as a young wife. La Ronde is a bore, and an odd repertory choice
when one considers the treasures by Fokine, Massine, Ashton, MacMillan,
which lie unregarded in the company's store.
Yet if these are to be restored to the stage, as they should be, they must
be respected. I do not feel that this is true of Prodigal Son which, apart
from Mukhamedov's bold incarnation of the young man, was unfocussed. The
Rouault designs were miserbly lit - no luminosity to their colours - and the
general scenes had a too-improvisatory air. Mukhamedov dug deep into the
choreography and brought out the role vivid and true. The first scene, where
the youth sets out on his journey, blazed with physical and emotional
energy. The orgy was dominated by Mukhamedov's ability to show innocence
destroyed: he needs, though, an icier Siren that Genesia Rosato proposed.(
Balanchine said she should be 'cool, strict, calculating'). The Prodigal's
return home would benefit from slight under-playing, but was nonetheless
heart-rending.
The restoration of Checkmate found its colours strong - the McKnight Kauffer
set is still magnificent - and its score, under Barry Wordsworth, more
dramatically taut than it has sounded since the golden days of Constant
Lambert. This is a good revival. Adam Cooper is a welcome new Red Knight,
the role securely on the music; Darcey Bussell's Black Queen is not as
menacing as the role demands; David Bintley is a fine Red King. We owe Dame
Ninette our gratitude for this ballet - and for everything else.
The triple bill is repeated on June 9 and 10.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Arts: Sellars' Pelleas - Holland Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt of the main novelty at this year's Holland Festival, which runs
throughout June. For good or ill, every opera production that Peter Sellars
undertakes is a news event. The latest to be subjected to scrutiny is an
intriguing choice - Pelleas et Melisande, which Sellars has directed for
Netherlands Opera; Simon Rattle is the conductor.
The programme book for the new staging is promisingly larded with literary
references - extracts from Baudelaire, Barthes, Bachmann and Pinter, as well
as the writings of Debussy and Maeterlinck. But all that proves to be
peripheral, for the result is yet another addition to Sellars' anthology of
American fables. The slice of late 20th-century life refracted through this
Pelleas is taken from the US West Coast - Malibu perhaps, or Big Sur; Golaud
and his benighted family belong to the super-rich, living on the beach in
architect-designed luxury, insulated from the real world by domestics and
security guards.
George Tsypin's monolithic set peels away the walls of the split-level dream
home like a doll's house. Arkel is seen in an upper room, confined to a
wheelchair and waited upon hand and foot by his nurses; on the floor below
lies the inert form of Pelleas's father, one of opera's great unseen
characters finally making an appearance, kept alive on a drip and visited
from time to time by the ever solicitous Genevieve. The lighting is flat and
fluorescent and scene changes are minimal, requiring Sellars to invent
business to cover Debussy's orchestral interludes; that generally involves a
trio of vagrants (the beggars from the third act) who seem to live around
the estate.
From the opening moments it is clear this is not a happy home; the curtain
rises during the prelude on Golaud with a revolver to his mouth apparently
contemplating suicide; no explanation is offered but his discovery of
Melisande, it's suggested, saves him from himself, and perhaps explains the
unreasoning jealousy that he ferments through the opera. Otherwise, though,
the dramatic treatment, like the visual one, is purely cosmetic, short on
insights and psychological elucidation.
The opera is sung in French with Dutch surtitles; the text is unimpaired
and, Sellars appears to be presuming yet again on the language barrier
providing him with the necessary suspension of disbelief to get away with
his reworkings. Yet such precise pictorial realism in an opera already
heavily charged with symbolism turns almost every utterance, every action,
into tendentious metaphor; Maeterlinck's characters never say what they mean
anyway, and adding yet another layer of inference just compounds the
problems. If Sellars genuinely set out to provide hard-edges to this elusive
story he has only succeeded in blurring them further. What redeems the show,
however, is the musical performance. Where in almost every other Sellars
production I've seen there has been a feeling that the musical parameters
had been determined as much by the director as by the conductor, the
partnership with Rattle seems much more an equal one. The main characters
are all taken by British-based singers with whom Rattle has worked regularly
and from whom he obtains beautifully moulded, if not always linguistically
fluent performances.
Willard White's smouldering, physically aggressive Golaud is the focus,
powerful and frightening in everything he does. The Pelleas is Philip
Langridge, employing a very wide range of vocal colour which incorporates an
almost toneless parlando at one extreme, the Melisande Elise Ross, who has
moments of instability but many sweetly turned phrases as well, even if they
do not make the youngest-looking pair of lovers one could imagine. There is
the familiar forthright Arkel from Robert Lloyd, a strong, compassionate
Genevieve from Felicity Palmer; Gaele Le Roi is the Yniold, singing sensibly
and without affecting childish squeaks.
Binding the cast together, though, is Rattle's command of the score; he
obtains playing of wonderful depth and security from the Netherlands
Philharmonic. Every scene is paced with extreme care, each is given a
perceptible backbone, a sense of inevitable unfolding. Without ever
resorting to rhapsodic excesses Rattle communicates a sense of numinous
wonder in the work; he catches exactly the ambiguity of an opera which can
underpin a tale of horrifying human cruelty with such ravishing music.

The story of the breakfast television company TV-am seems typically British.
Launched by the 'Famous Five' under a policy a bit like that of United
Artists, it ran into trouble when the BBC beat it onto the air with a more
popular programme.
Bickering broke out among TV-am's prima donnas, ratings were appalling, and
the sinking ship had to be saved by the famous rat: Roland. Then, when TV-am
became the most profitable company in the ITV network, the disastrous
Thatcherite auction system was introduced and the most Thatcherite company
of the lot lost its franchise. FT media correspondent Raymond Snoddy tells
the story in Storm In An Egg Cup (7.20 BBC2) a programme originally shown
during the evening called 'TV Hell'. Horizon which follows (8.00) goes for
the biggie: information technology.
Half the US workforce is now employed in the business. Do we need all this
information or is it really a matter of the computer people needing to sell
it? Panorama considers another very modern industry: genetic testing.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Arts: Inquest of Love - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jonathan Harvey's Inquest of Love, latest premiere in the English National
Opera annual series, is an arresting piece of modern music-drama. In its
conjoining of old and new, tradition and innovation, it proves to be that
rare achievement in the modern opera house, a new opera realised with equal
amounts of artistic idealism and practicality.
In its two acts a 'whole world' is created in which one spends an
unflaggingly concentrated two-and-a-half hours. Rarest achievement of all,
it is a new opera whose whole raison d'etre, and command of music-theatre,
is reposed in its music. This is possible only because Harvey - librettist
(in collaboration with David Rudkin) as well as composer - is an artist of
visionary temperament disciplined by a craftsman's precise skills.
In this case, and providing the climax to a string of concert and theatre
works of similar substance, Harvey has convoked the full resources of a
modern opera house to revive there a peculiarly English strain of mysticism.
Most of the action unfolds in the afterlife. A spiritual pilgrimage
underpins the opera's narrative - passing from violent death (the shooting
of a young couple at their moment of wedding vows) through intermediary
stages of learning and healing to the final ecstatic carollings of 'O
Love-filled Light] O healing Love]'.
All of this might suggest that Vaughan Williams's Bunyan opera, Pilgrim's
Progress, has found its successor. Or, since at the start the central
couple, Ann and John, are about to embark on their wedding ceremony (and a
Druidical ancient comes to warn of impending disaster), that Tippett's
Midsummer Marriage has been particularly well-remembered by Harvey. (In
advance libretto perusal the Tippett-ish Josh, one of three spirit
messengers, raises fears of whimsy that the full experience comprehensively
allays.)
Other influences are no less easily cited: Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, for
its tale of a soul in passage (last Saturday Andrew Clements quoted in these
columns Harvey's acknowledgement of just such an influence); Parsifal, for
the scenes of liturgical ceremony musically structured on the awesome sound
of tolling bells; Stockhausen's epic conceptions, for their awakening
through electronic-music apparatus of (in Harvey's own words) 'a new
reality, a different world'; Britten's Church Parables; medieval church
drama; Anglican chant.
And much else. This being so, it is remarkable how completely itself the new
opera feels to be. Its three functional levels are musically interlocked -
by the electronic element (breath-sounds, church-choirs, bells), keeping in
contact with the spiritual universe beyond the narrative foreground; by
infusions of a consciously archaic liturgical idiom (modal chanting and
exquisite hymnic concords for the 'otherworld' characters); and by jagged
vocal and orchestral characterisation for the three central figures - John,
Ann, the rejected, vengeful sister Elspeth - to develop on their journey.
The sense that Harvey's opera is not just a unity of all its parts but that
all those parts are expertly co-ordinated in the libretto informs the whole
experience. It is an experience welling out of the balance between light and
dark, slow and fast movement, between the disintegrative style of the first
act (with its Rashomon-like re-viewings of the murder-act from different
angles) and the regenerative forms and impulses of the second.
No criticism? Well, word-singing is unclear much of time - but that, like
the many passing mystifications of the staging, should perhaps be laid at
the door of the producer, David Pountney, With his designer, Nigel Lowery,
he treats the libretto with characteristic freedom. As always with Pountney
the staging is richly resourceful, full of energy, irony, and an individual
stamp of imagery (much of the latter provided by the dance troupe Second
Stride). The emotional and psychological charge is strong. Nevertheless,
advance reading of the libretto (published by Faber) may waken hunger for
the 'old-fashioned' numinous atmosphere that Harvey imagined and Pountney
then elected to excise.
What is surely beyond criticism is the impassioned commitment of the musical
forces under Mark Elder, who closes his period of ENO office with a
tremendous feat of sustained sympathy with a composer's vision. The
principals, alert with dramatic involvement and musical confidence, must all
be named: Peter Coleman-Wright (John), Linda McLeod (Ann), Helen Field (a
thrilling Elspeth), Richard Van Allan (the Abbot), and Ethna Nan Christie,
Ethna Robinson and Barry Banks as the three spirit-messengers.
In description Inquest of Love may sound to the general opera-goer
off-puttingly like a neo-Buddhist or New Age tract gone operatic; in the
theatre it proves anything but simple-minded, or Instant-Ecstasy-inducing in
the manner of Part or Gorecki. Of the ENO new-opera commissions this is, I
believe, the outstanding achievement so far, the one built to last.

JOHN MOWLEM CONSTRUCTION has added to its tally of stand construction work
with projects for Tottenham Hotspur and Watford Football Club together worth
Pounds 5m.
This follows Mowlem's similar work with the north stand at Twickenham for
the Rugby Football Union, completed in 1990; Twickenham east stand, which is
due for completion by the start of the next season; and stands for Notts
County Football Club and the Epsom racecourse grandstand.
The contract for Watford Football Club valued at Pounds 3m, is to design and
construct a 9,500 seater stand at the Vicarage Road end of the ground and an
extension to the lower terrace of the Rous stand. The new stand will have a
structural steel frame with a 'goal post truss' supporting the roof and
extending the full 85m of the stand. Terrace units will be pre-cast
concrete. The extension to the Rous stand will also be precast concrete and
facilities will include an executive club lounge. Work has started for
completion in 16 weeks.
The second contract, worth Pounds 2m, has been awarded by Tottenham Hotspur
for the redevelopment of the north stand at White Hart Lane. The contract
comprises the removal of the roof and the erection of a cantilevered roof
comprising 400 tons of structural steelwork. A key element of this will be
the main roof truss. This will span the entire length of the stand, which
will be fabricated at ground level and winched into position.
At the same time, the lower terrace will be reprofiled to provide seats for
2,500 spectators.
Work has started for completion prior to the start of the new season in
August.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Enterprise, the development body for Scotland outside the
Highlands, has appointed John Lord to the post of director of strategy. Lord
has, until now, been chief executive of Enterprise Ayrshire, one of 13 local
enterprise companies (LECs) for which SE is the parent. LECs are the
Scottish equivalent of the English training and enterprise councils (TECs).
Enterprise Ayrshire is regarded as one of the most imaginative LECs. Its
training programmes have been innovative, despite the straitjacket imposed
by the Training Agency.
Lord, an Englishman aged 41, is the only LEC chief executive to have come
from the Training Agency; most of his counterparts were with SE's
predecessor, the Scottish Development Agency.
Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of SE, says that Lord's 'perception of
what needs to be done and how to go about it struck a chord with the
chairman (Professor Donald MacKay) and me'.
SE has also appointed Russel Griggs to a new post, director of business
development. Griggs, 44, had headed company development at SE. His new
division will stimulate the creation of new companies, after an SE inquiry
showed slow new company formation in Scotland.

FT  07 JUN 93 / People: Reischl occupies his UK listening post
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The significance of German supermarket chain Rewe's surprise acquisition of
a minority share in Budgens was underlined at the end of last week with the
appearance of its chief executive, Hans Reischl, as a non-executive on the
board of the small UK retailing chain.
'We are very fortunate that he decided not to delegate the job, but to do it
himself,' says Budgens director Christian Williams.
Before arriving at Budgens, chief executive John von Spreckelsen, together
with Williams, had turned around a Bremen supermarket chain, KAFU-Wasmund,
which was subsequently sold to Rewe. Williams says that the two had,
however, not met Reischl at that stage. 'He was the big boss; he delegated
jobs like that.'
Rewe's 26 per cent stake in Budgens, which has just 100 stores, has
attracted considerable interest in the food industry.
Why does Reischl accord it such importance? Williams points out that it is
the first foreign investment made by the private group, which operates 8,000
stores and has a 15 per cent market share of its domestic market.
'I suppose this is one way of establishing a substantial listening post and
getting an idea of what the UK grocery market is all about. After all, the
company would find it difficult to buy a 26 per cent stake in Sainsbury's or
Marks &amp; Spencer,' comments Williams.
Williams believes that Budgens is more advanced than its continental
European competitors in certain areas - including its fully automated
warehousing and its delivery trucks, which store food at three different
temperatures.
Reischl, who speaks good English, should have no language difficulties at
Budgens. Von Spreckelsen is a German national, and Williams, whose mother
tongue is Danish, also speaks German. Both also have experience of the
German market.
Stephen Bellamy, a director of New Zealand investment company BIL
Securities, which sold its Budgens stake to Rewe, and who has sat on the
Budgens board in a non-executive capacity since the end of 1991, has so far
not stepped down.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Plymouth university development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The University of Plymouth has awarded a Pounds 10.4m contract to AMEC
BUILDING for new student accommodation and lecture theatre complex (shown
above in an architect's impression). The project, which will provide the
university with accommodation for an extra 430 students, is due for
completion next year.
As well as student accommodation, there are two-50 seater seminar rooms, a
250-seat lecture theatre, refectory and an underground car park.
The architects for the largely six-storey project in Gibbon Street,
Plymouth, are Eaton Manning Wilson and Associates.
In addition to this development, the university has spent over Pounds
400,000 extensively refurbishing a terrace of late Victorian houses, also in
Gibbon Street, opposite the new complex. These are providing 48 additional
student residential places.
Dr Michael Gillett, the university's deputy vice-chancellor (Resources),
said: 'Our upgrading of these houses, plus our recent refurbishment of the
Pitts Memorial Hall as a 180-seat lecture hall, means the university will
have spent a further half-million pounds on improvements to this area of
Plymouth.
'This is in addition to the Pounds 10.4 million cost of building what we
believe will be an attractive asset to the city.'

FT  07 JUN 93 / Management: Seduced by the customer cult
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM and DAVID PENDLETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cult of the customer has become the mantra of today's business gurus.
Their chant and their cant is: 'If we don't look after our customers, then
someone else will.' The faithful respond antiphonally: 'We must always
remember that our customers pay our salaries.' Unfortunately, in common with
all mantras, this one's strength lies more in its repetition than in its
inherent truth.
While it is usually true that successful businesses look after their
customers, it is not true that all businesses which look after their
customers are successful. Laker Airways looked after its customers with
enthusiasm, but went the way of all flesh nonetheless.
A decade ago, the chant was of profit and profitability. Cost centres became
profit centres. The high priests were the grey men of the bottom line - the
auditors who devoted themselves to beating their rewards into profit shares
and their careers into catching crooks.
A decade earlier the gospel was of job enrichment and job satisfaction. The
belief was that the contented worker would become the affluent worker.
All of these gospels had a kernel of truth but, to correct what they thought
were earlier imbalances, the business gurus successively created new
imbalances. Gurus and consultants often maintain that what has gone before
is fashion, but what they bring is truth. They usually succeed in creating
little more than a new fashion.
All businesses will fail in the long term unless they pay adequate attention
to the legitimate requirements of their three principal stakeholders - their
shareholders, staff and customers.
The shareholders own the business, have invested in it and are concerned
that it should be profitable. In this way, the business will produce for
them an adequate return on investment, by monitoring and managing their
costs and their revenues.
The staff serve the customers and are stewards of the company's resources.
The quality of a company's employees is a critical factor in creating
business success. Their morale is the indicator of their commitment. But
morale is a delicate plant which dies in some climates, thrives in others
and needs constant attention. Its condition needs to be monitored constantly
but it is unclear who should carry out the monitoring and how it should be
done.
Personnel departments in most businesses need to be involved but they
usually fail to provide adequate data to support decision-making about
personnel matters. They frequently fail to provide insight into the factors
which need to be monitored such as the staff's perception of how they are
treated and how that treatment is changing over time.
Ultimately, customers provide profits for the shareholders and salaries for
the staff. For too long customers were neglected, abused or forgotten. Their
place in determining the success of businesses has now been restored but it
would be inappropriate to concentrate on their needs at the expense of
others. Regular monitoring of customers' feelings about the company's
products or services can be carried out by market researchers but it is
vital to ensure that the data are directed towards decisions which need to
be taken, rather than meandering into empty description.
For 2000 years, the Christian church has been teaching the difficult concept
that God is a trinity - three in one. If there is a God of business, he or
she also has three manifestations: the shareholders, the customers and the
staff. They are different but equal and all demand similar attention. Those
who emphasise the worship of any one over the others are today's false
prophets.
Adrian Furnham is head of the business psychology unit at University College
London. David Pendleton is a business psychologist and a director of Kaisen
Consulting in Bristol.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Management: Calling the NHS to account - Alan Pike asks if
health authority reforms have reduced or increased the potential for
mismanagement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are no sessions entitled 'Mismanagement, Negligence and Waste' on the
agenda for this week's annual conference of the managers who run the
National Health Service. But these topics will dominate much of the informal
discussion.
When Sir Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive, addressed the Institute of
Health Services Management conference last year he warned his staff away
from introducing 'macho management' personnel styles to the service. It
would not be surprising if this time he delivered a far sterner lecture on
public-sector probity and ethics.
Sir Duncan has been compelled recently to make some uncomfortable
appearances before the Commons public accounts committee, trying to explain
the waste of at least Pounds 20m in the Wessex Regional Health Authority and
Pounds 10m in the West Midlands.
The committee has heard tales of conflicts of interest, irregularities in
the awarding of contracts and repeated failures of managerial and financial
controls.
Behind the specifics, a series of still bigger questions await answering.
These relate to the quality of accountability procedures in the NHS and
whether lay members of health authorities and trust hospital boards,
appointed to represent the public interest, are exerting sufficient check on
full-time managers.
Both the West Midlands and Wessex affairs originated before the 1991 NHS
reforms, which were designed to make the service more market-based. They
have provoked a debate over whether the new structure has reduced the
potential for undetected mismanagement, or increased it.
Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has set up a review of NHS management
structure which is due to report next month. She is under pressure to make
the service more flexible through further decentralisation. But both the
health secretary and her review group recognise that - welcome as relaxation
of central controls might be in terms of releasing managerial talent and
making the NHS more market-driven - any changes will have to stand the test
of public accountability.
District auditors' inquiries in the West Midlands and Wessex have generated
some headline-making reports, such as the expenses of management consultants
in the West Midlands - employed to recommend ways of saving public money -
which included hired aircraft and lavish entertainment. More mundanely, but
in many ways more seriously, the reports contain examples of scrutiny and
accountability procedures that did not work.
Take the West Midlands' separate, regionally managed services division and
the panel set up to form a link between its director and the health
authority board. According to the auditor: 'The board relied on the panel to
control the director. The chairman of the panel regarded its role merely as
a sounding-board for the director.
'The director ignored the panel and did not report to the regional health
authority board. The regional health authority chairman and members of the
board said they did not know what was going on in respect of the supplies
contract. The director continually asserted that his action had regional
health authority support.'
Another auditor's report describes a meeting at which the Wessex Information
Group awarded a computer systems contract to an Andersen Consulting/IBM
consortium. The meeting was inquorate - only one member of the group, plus
the then chairman of the health authority in an ex officio capacity, was
present, but it nonetheless resolved to award the contract.
Two versions of the minutes were prepared. One, distributed only to those
who had attended the meeting, recorded the decision to award the contract to
Andersen Consulting/IBM. The second version, circulated to absent members,
did not. It was the second version that formed the basis of the agenda for
the next health authority meeting: the authority was not formally informed
that the contract had been awarded until after it had been signed.
A similar failure of lay members to regulate the activities and enthusiasms
of individual senior managers also played a part in the problems leading to
the collapse of the London Ambulance Service's computerised despatch system.
An official inquiry in February concluded that, while lines of
accountability looked secure on paper, the ambulance service board 'was not
given, nor did it seek' sufficient information to exercise its
responsibilities for managing the service. After publication of the highly
critical report, board members blamed the unco-operative attitude of a
particularly determined chief executive.
The government's 1991 reforms of the NHS have made health authorities
smaller and more businesslike. Sir Robin Buchanan, the present chairman of
Wessex, has said that members of his old-style authority treated it like a
committee, while the new non-executive members felt firmly part of the
management process.
This was certainly the intention of the reforms. 'Working for Patients', the
government white paper that introduced them, set out to end a system in
which 'many members, such as those appointed directly by local authorities
or on the advice of trade unions and professional bodies, usually regard
themselves as representatives'.
Today's non-executive members of health authorities and trusts are appointed
for their skills and experience, with some regions advertising for trust
board members to attract the widest range of applicants.
Critics of the changes fear, however, that individual appointees risk
finding themselves in a weak and lonely position if they try to challenge
senior managers who are excessively secretive, domineering or idiosyncratic
in style. Although the presence of nominees from local authorities and other
bodies sometimes politicised old-style health authorities, the nominees
could at least call for the backing of their sponsoring organisations in an
argument.
New procedures are in place in the West Midlands and Wessex aimed at
preventing future problems and the Department of Health is trying to apply
stronger national guidelines. Sir Duncan has asked the Audit Commission to
give increased attention to probity issues when auditing health service
accounts; the commission has also launched its own investigation into
corruption in local government and the NHS. Accountability issues have been
included on the agenda of the review of NHS structure currently taking
place,
Both the department and the National Association of Health Authorities and
Trusts are examining ways of enhancing the development and training of
non-executive members of health authorities and trust boards. The
association has told the structure review that it supports further
decentralisation of decision-making, but accepts that more must be done to
ensure non-executive board members discharge their duties in a way that
'commands high confidence with the public'.
The association is urging all authorities to state publicly which areas of
decision-making must be taken by the full board and publish standing orders
and financial instructions. It also believes boards should have audit and
remuneration sub-committees chaired by non-executive members and is working
with Manchester University's health services management unit on the
development of a 'company secretary' role in health authorities and trusts.
'It is essential that the board as a whole, rather than just the chairman
and the chief executive, is held and seen to be held to account for the
authority or trust's activities and performance,' concludes the
association's evidence.
Getting to this point is a priority for the NHS as pressure grows to
increase the day-to-day freedoms of district health authorities and trusts.
Even the most ardent advocates of devolution know that it will not work if,
whenever there is a serious problem, the people down the line say no one
told them what was going on.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Only 4% of firms satisfy regulators: Accountants face
crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST 4 per cent of the chartered accountants registered to conduct
investment business in England and Wales and visited by regulators last year
were given a completely clean bill of health.
Some 140 - or 11 per cent - of the 1,287 reports on practices visited by
regulators during 1992 highlighted serious breaches, according to figures to
be presented on Wednesday to the council of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales.
A further 433 firms breached important regulations or a large number of
regulations, and 628 breached minor regulations. Only 55 were judged to have
shown no breaches.
The institute received 63 complaints during the year. Three firms have so
far had their authorisation suspended, while a further 49 have been told to
make improvements as a result of reports submitted during the year.
The details come in the annual report from the practice regulation
directorate of the institute, the self-regulating arm which is responsible
for accountants conducting auditing, insolvency and financial services.
Mr Cliff Bygrave, chairman of the institute's Financial Services
Authorisation Committee, said: 'We are never really happy while we have
(significant regulatory breaches). But we have asked (the regulators) to be
stricter and stronger in their visits. Next year is going to be tougher.'
He stressed that many of the breaches were on technical grounds such as
inadequate documentation as a result of 'very heavy regulation' imposed by
the 1988 Financial Services Act.
He said that most did not indicate misappropriation of money or poor
financial advice. Where they did, the institute was taking 'the necessary
action'.
At the end of last year, there were 5,556 firms authorised to undertake
investment business, down from 5,851 a year earlier.
All but 8 per cent were registered for 'Category 1' business, which is to
provide investment advice.
Just 6 per cent were registered for 'Category 2', allowing them to hold
client money. Only 2 per cent - or 111 firms - were 'Category 3', allowing
discretionary management of funds within certain limits, and a single firm
was registered as 'Category 4', with higher limits on management.
The report from the audit registration committee shows there have been 236
complaints between October 1991 and December 1992. Last year, there were 392
complaints to the insolvency licensing committee.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Consumer credit rise points to upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR consumer credit rose across a range of business sectors in April,
a study by Infolink, the credit information organisation, shows.
Today's figures suggest that consumer activity is mounting, said Dr Brian
Bailey, Infolink chairman, although it would be necessary to wait for
information on the volume of new credit over the coming months to determine
the real strength of recovery.
Loans sought for the purchase of new cars showed a year-on-year increase of
9.2 per cent in April, according to the survey. This is an improvement on
March although the April result was only half the February yearly increase.
The home-loans sector, representing specialist lenders, showed a
year-on-year increase of 1.2 per cent in April - the first rise in demand
seen by Infolink since 1991.
Demand for credit with finance houses increased 4.9 per cent in the year to
April, while credit applications to retailers rose 3.1 per cent. These are
the highest rates of annual increase this year.
Infolink predicts further increases in these sectors if greater activity in
the housing market is maintained.
Dr Bailey said: 'With increasing numbers of consumers enjoying greater
employment and financial stability, April has seen a continued improvement
when compared to the depressing levels witnessed in 1992.'

FT  07 JUN 93 / Reporting plan for charities attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTING standards proposed by the Charity Commission will prove
impractical for smaller charities, the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants warned yesterday.
Sorp 2, the statement of recommended practice for accounting in charities,
issued as a discussion document in March, introduces a number of changes
designed to represent charity finances more fairly.
It comes at a time when the Charity Commission is increasing pressure on
charities of all sizes to file accounts that are accurate and on time.
The association said that the tougher standards would exceed smaller
charities' resources or expertise and, because of the extra work involved,
threaten their ability to draw on voluntary help in preparing and auditing
accounts.
The association recommended a simplified, modified accounting regime for
charities with an annual income of less than Pounds 250,000.
The association also said that Sorp 2 meets the requirements of regulators
more than readers of accounts, and would prove hard to understand.
Sorp 2 is likely to be adopted later this year, and the draft was launched
with a very tight timetable for modification.
Although the guidelines are voluntary, it is likely to form the basis for
statutory accounting rules to be introduced by the Home Office as part of
the 1992 Charities Act this year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC board of management will this week receive a report from an internal
inquiry into alleged malpractices in the awarding of external contracts in
BBC Television.
Allegations being investigated range from suggestions of gifts and favours
from contractors eager to do business with the corporation, to conflicts of
interest in the awarding of contracts.
The role of Mr Bob Pugh, who until recently was BBC Television's general
manager of administration and facilities management, has been looked at by
the inquiry.
Mr Pugh headed a department whose responsibilities included awarding
contracts to private contractors to carry out non-programme work for the BBC
 -a recent trend at the corporation.
The BBC said it could say nothing until the inquiry was complete other than
that allegations were being 'vigorously investigated'.

FT  07 JUN 93 / BBC prepares to trim fat from Choice cuts: The corporation's
search for greater efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is soon likely to modify its controversial new Producer Choice
policy, which allows producers to buy in services from outside the
corporation.
Mr Michael Starks, who is in charge of implementing Producer Choice,
concedes that changes will have to be made. 'I think we have got too many
business units,' he says.
Under the scheme more than 400 separate business units have been set up to
trade with each other, both inside the corporation and with the outside
world. They are all expected to break even or give a good reason why money
is being lost.
The progress of the scheme, which was introduced across the BBC on April 1,
will be reviewed at the end of its first three months - the review was
always part of the original plan.
Mr Starks suggests that another area needing attention is the number of
individual transactions, and the associated paperwork, conducted between the
business units. He believes that the number of units could be reduced and
replaced by more annual service agreements between departments.
Some staff say that in trying to mimic the marketplace, one form of
bureaucracy is being replaced by another.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the broadcasting union, said yesterday
that the Producer Choice costing system was unable to cope with all the data
being generated, despite a low volume of programme-making. A number of
lighting, scaffolding and make-up contractors had not been paid since April.
'We are not waiting to see if it (Producer Choice) goes wrong. We are
waiting to see what the BBC does when it goes wrong,' Mr Lennon said.
But Mr Starks says that, overall, Producer Choice is working as expected.
Before its introduction, departments had to slim down for the expected lower
demand from BBC producers. The volume of work that has gone outside the BBC,
Mr Starks points out, has been in line with forecasts - 10 per cent to 15
per cent on average across all departments.
Mr Bob Phillis, the BBC deputy director-general who is also responsible for
bringing the back-up resource departments together into a single new
directorate, also admits that modifications to Producer Choice will be
necessary.
'It is going to take a period of settling down, of refinement, of sensible
modification in the light of experience,' he says.
But he insists that Producer Choice has heightened awareness of the need for
proper financial controls within the BBC.
Producer Choice's supporters argue that, in spite of the disruption and the
loss of several thousands jobs, the system is vital because for the first
time there is a measure of the true costs of BBC programmes and their
competitiveness.
Accountability and cost-effectiveness are central to the BBC's case to the
government for the renewal of its Royal Charter in 1996. Critics fear that
Producer Choice's complexity makes keeping track of BBC finances more
difficult. There are also complaints about bureaucracy.
The BBC earlier this year announced moves to curb bureaucracy in the future,
and detailed a number of internal reviews into areas such as programme
strategy and the creation of performance indicators.
Mr Phillis rejects criticisms that one form of bureaucracy has replaced
another: 'Nothing I am involved with is increasing bureaucracy. What I am
involved in is trying to get on with the task of effectively running this
organisation and disbanding as many task forces, work groups, project teams
as expeditiously as possible once they have completed the tasks they were
set to do.'
Much rides on increasing efficiency and devoting a higher proportion of the
Pounds 1.5bn licence-fee income to programmes.
The government plans to produce a white paper on the BBC's future at 'the
turn of the year' and one thing is clear: although it displays little of the
hostility to the BBC exhibited by the previous prime minister, and a radical
restructuring of the corporation seems unlikely, vigorous downward pressure
will almost certainly be applied to the Pounds 83-a-year licence fee.

THE GOVERNMENT is to crack down on squatting, making it a criminal offence
with possible prison sentences for offenders, the Home Office said
yesterday.
At present, unless there is a smashed window or damage to a door or other
part of the property, or drug-taking or other criminal activity, police
cannot move in. The object of new legislation will be to make occupying
someone else's home or premises without permission an offence.

Mr David Warburton, national officer of the union, said yesterday that his
300 white-collar members at Gatwick Airport, who include flight controllers
and computer staff, were still 'very much in dispute' with British Airways
even though a similar dispute with the TGWU transport union had been
resolved. The dispute centres on BA's subsidiary company at Gatwick, BA EOG.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Government widens forestry review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is today seeking the views of interested parties on financial
incentives for planting trees in Britain.
This marks the widening of its review of forestry, which has until now been
conducted behind closed doors.
The Forestry Commission, which owns Britain's public-sector forests, is
launching a rapid consultation exercise, asking for submissions by the end
of July.
It wants those interested to consider whether planting grants should be more
closely targeted, and whether incentives should be redirected to improve the
environmental value of existing forests.
In March Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary and the lead minister responsible
for forestry, said that a committee of officials was reviewing incentives
for forestry in-vestment.
The committee, he said, would also look at options for the ownership of the
Forestry Commission's 900,000 hectares of woodland. Observers believe the
options include privatis-ation.
Environmental groups are likely to urge the planting of woodlands with a
diversity of tree species, and an increase in the provision of facilities
for leisure.
Responses to the consultation should be sent to: Forestry Review Group,
Scottish Office Environment Department, New St Andrew's House, Edinburgh EH1
3TG.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Heseltine is challenged over Nadir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday called on Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, to 'clear the air' over his approach to another minister about
the prosecution of fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, urged Mr Heseltine to
restart proceedings to 'ban' Mr Nadir, founder of the Polly Peck business
empire, as a UK company director. There was no longer any purpose postponing
these pending a trial, Mr Cook said, and continued delay would only 'deepen
the doubts about Asil Nadir's relationship with this government'.
Mr Nadir, who faces 13 charges of theft and false accounting involving about
Pounds 34m, fled the UK a month ago.
Mr Cook also called on Mr Heseltine to reveal who it was who had persuaded
him to 'take up' Mr Nadir's case.
The Department of Trade and Industry said Mr Heseltine recalled somebody
approaching him about concerns over the way the Serious Fraud Office was
handling the case, and he had passed those on to Sir Nicholas Lyell,
attorney-general. To the best of his recollection, Mr Heseltine had never
met Mr Nadir.
Mr Heseltine is the third minister - after Mr Michael Mates, Northern
Ireland minister and a close political ally of Mr Heseltine, and Mr Peter
Brooke, national heritage secretary - to have been embroiled in the row over
Mr Nadir. Mr Mates has admitted having meetings on the subject with the
attorney-general.
Mr Cook said yesterday: 'It is bad enough that a junior minister like
Michael Mates should have taken up cudgels for Asil Nadir. It is
breathtaking that the very cabinet minister with responsibility for company
laws should put in a word for a man charged with comprehensively breaking
them. Michael Heseltine's job at trade is to make sure company law protects
the innocent, not to make representations to protect a private individual
charged with defrauding the public.'
Contacted in Cyprus last night, Mr Nadir refused to comment. he He hoped
everything 'would be clearer by the end of the month'.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Daf Vans reports sales recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEYLAND Daf Vans, a division of the Anglo-Dutch vehicle maker which went
into receivership in February, said yesterday its sales had recovered
strongly since a management buy-out rescued it from receivership two months
ago.
The Birmingham-based manufacturer saw half its market share disappear after
its Dutch parent sought protection from its creditors earlier this year.
Mr Allan Amey, managing director and chief executive, said yesterday that it
had now made up nearly all the lost ground.
Figures for May, the first full month's trading since the buy-out of the
vans division, showed the company's market share, which had fallen to less
than 7 per cent, had risen to 14.4 per cent.
'The increased share is a very positive trend and puts us back where we need
to be,' said Mr Amey.
'There is no doubt many of our customers have held back until the management
buy-out was completed and we are now seeing our future order book grow,' he
added.
The likely management buy-out at Leyland Daf Trucks is expected to be agreed
this week in spite of reports that Mr Ian McKinnon, a former director of the
company, is about to make a rival offer.
Receivers Arthur Andersen are understood to be close to an agreement with
the buy-out team, which is supported by Pounds 5m of equity capital from
Barclays Development Capital.
Although a bid by Mr McKinnon might feature a larger 'headline' price for
the truck division, it is unlikely to be considered viable by the receivers.
Under the terms of the proposed sale to the buy-out team - led by Mr John
Gilchrist, former managing director of the assembly plant - the Leyland site
would be acquired by the development arm of Lancashire County Council.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Salomon hopeful of retrieving Pounds 6.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON operation of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, is trying
to recover Pounds 6.7m (Dollars 10.3m) lost through what it says was a fraud
perpetrated in the back office of its gilt-edged marketmaking unit.
Salomon said that although the money had not yet been traced, the firm was
optimistic about the prospects of recovering it.
The management of the firm does not expect the alleged fraud to have any
effect on its earnings and says that no clients have suffered any loss.
The sum is believed to have been removed from the company's account in a
single transfer last month.
The alleged fraud was discovered by Salomon and reported to the Metropolitan
Police, the Bank of England and the Securities and Futures Authority, the
self-regulating organisation for wholesale financial services firms which
was formed in 1991 from a merger of the Securities Association and the
Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers.
On May 27, a 27-year old man was arrested at his home in south London and
bailed to return to London's Rochester Row police station on July 7.
A second man, aged 32, arrested a few days later at an address in Buckingham
Palace Road, will also appear at the police station on July 7.
At that stage, the men will either be charged, released on further bail, or
told that no further action will be taken.
The police declined to comment further on the progress of the investigation.
Salomon said it had issued a writ against an individual.
Because fraud is a criminal offence, the Bank of England and the Securities
and Futures Authority are not likely to take an active role in the case.
The SFA said that it would take action only if any of its registered members
were convicted, unless the case had wider implications on the way a firm is
run.
'If the firm was lax in its compliance and through that laxity endangered
clients money, (we would take action), even if no other persons were party
to the alleged fraud,' the SFA said.
The Bank of England, which is the supervisor of the gilts unit, would be
'kept fully informed,' it said.
If the alleged fraud is an isolated incident in the back office, discovered
and reported by Salomon, the firm is likely to be able to avoid any further
fall-out from the case.
Nevertheless, the episode is something of an embarrassment to Salomon, which
has been attempting to project a 'clean' image following a damaging scandal
in 1991, when it was discovered that the firm had rigged US Treasury market
auctions.
Senior executives including Mr John Gutfreund, former chairman, had failed
to inform the authorities immediately of the transgressions.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Diesel engine reaches Charterhouse Street
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DIESEL engine weighing nearly 200 tonnes reached its destination in
Charterhouse Street near the edge of the City of London yesterday after
travelling at one mile an hour under police escort from South Mimms,
Hertfordshire. At the junction of Charterhouse Street and Farringdon Road,
the engine's long transporter was driven up on to thick planks so that a
second transporter could be backed under it at right-angles. The second
transporter, designed to avoid any risk of the engine sinking into the car
park underneath Charterhouse Street, carried it to its final destination - a
listed power station nearly 100 years old in which a combined-heat-and-power
facility is being installed. The engine is shown above waiting to be removed
from the first transporter. The facility will be run by Citigen, the power
company owned by British Gas and French-controlled Utilicom. The engine was
the first of two being supplied by Wartsila Diesel of Finland, and the
second will arrive by the same route and method later this month. The two
will be linked to a network of pipes which will provide hot water,
electricity and chilled water for air conditioning to buildings in the City
and surrounding area. The Citigen project is intended to meet the full heat
and power demand of a number of buildings including Guildhall. The system
will have environmental control plant and exhaust-gas equipment aimed at
reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen by up to 95 per
cent.

FT  07 JUN 93 / More skilled, flexible and satisfied than we think we are: A
survey that highlights structural changes in the workplace and dispels a few
misconceptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRARY to popular belief, Britain's workers have adapted to change in a
positive way. They are more skilled and educated in the use of new
technology than ever before. Training provided by employers is more
intensive and longer, and most employees describe it as beneficial.
These are among the findings of the Employment in Britain survey published
today, which provides a graphic portrait of what has been happening in the
country's workplaces over the past five years.
Since 1988 Britain has gone through profound structural change in response
to the twin pressures of technological innovation and global
competitiveness. The survey argues: 'Training has emerged as a major issue
for employees ranking alongside security, pay and supervision.'
Responsive to change, Britain's workers are mostly content with their jobs.
A large majority of the survey sample are 'highly satisfied' not just with
the friendliness of their colleagues but also with the opportunity to use
their abilities. Just over half have a 'high level of satisfaction' with
their supervisors.
However, fewer than half of workers are highly satisfied with their
promotion prospects, the ability and efficiency of their management, their
job security and the number of hours they work.
Assembly-line workers had the lowest level of job satisfaction, followed by
those working with machines and monitoring equipment. Workers who deal
primarily with people scored the most job satisfaction.
Low job satisfaction combines with what the survey describes as a 'sharp
increase in the pressures at work' over the past five years. 'There has been
an intensification of work effort - employees have been required to assume
greater responsibility in their work and quality standards have become more
demanding,' it says.
The survey also reveals a growth in job insecurity since 1988, particularly
among professionals, managers and skilled manual workers. This finding
underlines how Britain's recession has made an impact across a wide range of
occupational groups. Men also feel more insecure in their jobs than women.
At the same time the commitment to work remains fairly strong in Britain.
Just over two thirds of workers would prefer to have a job even if there
were no financial necessity for them to do so.
Nor does there appear to be much antagonism between workers and their
employers. The old 'them' and 'us' divide that used to scar so much of
workplace relations seems virtually to have disappeared. Now as many as two
thirds of workers say they believe their values and those of the
organisations they work for are 'very similar', even if only 9 per cent
'agreed strongly' with that suggestion.
On the other hand, British workers are not committed to working for any
particular company. Less than a third said they would turn down a job with
more pay in order to stay with their current employer. The survey comments:
'It seems clear that British employers have still a great distance to go to
build a work force with a high level of organisational commitment.'
The survey suggests that most British workers do not like to work long hours
 -possibly indicating that the recent European Community directive on
working hours would be more welcome to British workers than it is to the UK
government. The overwhelming preference was for between 16 and 30 hours a
week. Only 2 per cent of men and 0.1 per cent of women would want to work
more than a 40-hour week.
But the pressures on women to work have increased dramatically. In 1980 less
than a quarter of women said they were worried about money but by last year
that figure had risen to 38 per cent.
In 1980 only 37 per cent of women said they worked to pay for necessities
like food, rent or a mortgage; last year that had risen to 53 per cent. 'It
is the increased importance of women's work for meeting housing costs that
explains the greater sense of financial pressure,' the survey says.
The survey finds that worker participation remains relatively low. Fifty-two
per cent of workers are in organisations where they feel that their
influence is low, 30 per cent where worker influence is medium and 18 per
cent where it is high.
Very few British workers have 'a significant say over changes in their
immediate work environment', the survey says. 'As a result a high proportion
of employees are dissatisfied with their existing level of influence.'
It is true, though, that nearly three quarters believe they have a 'great
deal of influence over the amount of work they put in and the quality of
their work', and well over half added they had a 'great deal of influence
over deciding how they were to do their task'.
In recent years workers have gained greater influence over the amount and
pace of the work they do, but the survey found that only a third of workers
in industry felt they had any substantial influence over decisions that
could result in changes in their work.
The survey suggests that workers want to increase their influence more
widely. Nearly half thought they should have more say in decisions affecting
their working lives. Dissatisfaction was pronounced among supervisors and
technicians, skilled manual workers, managers and professionals.
Further findings will be published next year from the survey which the
authors - Mr Duncan Gallie of Nuffield College, Oxford, and Mr Michael White
at the Policy Studies Institute - intend as the first of many.
The overall picture suggests that Britain's employment scene was much more
dynamic and innovative in the late 1980s than many observers believed. It
looks like profound restructuring was taking place in the labour market
among compared with earlier periods.
The trouble is that similar developments may have been going on longer and
more radically among our main competitors. But as the survey points out,
only the US and Sweden have carried out employment surveys comparable to the
British one. Until other European Community countries investigate their
labour markets in similar detail it will remain hard to make credible
international comparisons.

FT  07 JUN 93 / NHS trusts 'slow' in shifting to local pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL HEALTH Service trusts are only slowly breaking away from nationally
set pay and conditions for their staff, Industrial Relations Services, the
independent employment research company, says today.
Under NHS reforms trusts can employ new staff on locally set pay and
conditions, rather than complying with national agreements. Staff who
transferred to trusts are entitled to retain national terms.
Although three quarters of the 33 trusts surveyed by IRS employ some staff
on local pay and conditions, the proportion of staff in each trust on these
terms is low. Most are senior managers or directors.
Many trusts said a lack of management time and resources was a reason why
moves to devolve setting pay to local managers have been limited. Others
said the government's 1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector pay had played
its part. Any radical shake-up of pay by trusts was likely to cost far more
than the 1.5 per cent available for this year.
Other findings include:
More trusts have cut staff than increased numbers since gaining
self-governing status. Only two trusts claimed to have derecognised any
unions since opting out. Performance-related pay was restricted to
management in all but two of the trusts that had merit pay.
New recognition agreements with trade unions have been reached by 60 per
cent of trusts in the survey.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Senior Labour officials round on Edmonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Labour party officials yesterday moved to isolate Mr John Edmonds,
general secretary of the GMB general union, Britain's second largest union,
who has launched a co-ordinated campaign against what he believes is the
shadow cabinet's lack of vision.
Mr Edmonds, who believes that not all of the shadow cabinet are pulling
their weight, used his party's annual congress in Portsmouth, Hampshire, as
the launch pad for his attack on the Labour movement.
While Mr Edmonds did not name individuals, Labour party officials
interpreted the criticism as a damaging public attack on Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader, from one of the union leaders whose block votes ensured his
victory in last autumn's leadership election.
An official said: 'John Edmonds has overstepped the mark. There is bad blood
between him and the whole leadership. The Labour movement will not forgive
him if he provides material for John Major to use in the debate on
Conservative policies in the Commons on Wednesday.'
Mr Edmonds, delivering the keynote speech on the first day of the congress,
said that Mr Smith called for radical and popular policies and he was right.
'That is what we in the Labour movement should offer now - not a little bit
more of this or a little bit less of that.'
Mr Edmonds said that every trade unionist, every Labour councillor and every
member of the Labour party front bench should be voicing arguments against
the government's policies. He said: 'Caution and prudence have their place
in politics but we should never allow the limits of Labour's ambitions to be
set by an economic framework laid down by the Tories.'
In an article in the Sunday Mirror, Mr Edmonds was less veiled in his
criticism. He warned that unless the Labour movement started 'punching now'
it would lose the next general election.
He said that since the election the knock-out blows against the government
had not come from the Labour party.
'We seem to be holding back and waiting for the Tories to destroy
themselves. The Labour movement still seems dazed from last year's general
election defeat.'
Mr Edmonds says he has discovered widespread disillusionment and discontent
among union activists in recent months. He is also a leading opponent of
changes planned for the party's internal decision-making.
Mr Smith, speaking on BBC Radio 4, dismissed the criticism of his party and
said that the 24-point lead in opinion polls proved that the party was doing
a good job.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Patten threat to change law on school tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN yesterday threatened to legislate if necessary to ensure that
next year's national curriculum tests in secondary schools in England and
Wales go ahead.
Speaking as this year's tests - which are expected to be widely disrupted -
are due to start, the education secretary indicated that he would consider
changing the law if this year's experience was unsatisfactory.
Mr Patten said that nothing was ruled in and nothing ruled out to make sure
that next year's tests took place. School governors had a 'statutory duty'
to see that this year's tests were taken, he added.
The tests, which have sparked a long confrontation between the government
and the teachers' unions, are due to start today. The three biggest unions
predict a firm boycott.
This leaves members of the small Professional Association of Teachers alone
in implementing the tests. The PAT's constitution forbids industrial action.
Speaking on BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Patten announced that he would
begin a process of publishing the controversial test papers for 14-year-olds
as soon as the exams had been taken.
People would look at the papers and 'wonder what all the fuss was about', Mr
Patten predicted - parents would be 'rather worried' that their children
were not being asked to take them.
Mr Patten said he sympathised with teachers about the level of bureaucracy
that had sprung up in recent years, but argued that the actual papers being
sat were 'very straightforward and very practical'.
He said: 'I don't think we should ever have industrial action in our
classrooms.' It would be a 'tragedy' if - as expected - only 10 per cent of
schools carried out the tests.
Mr Eamonn O'Kane, deputy general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, which was the first to announce a
tests boycott, said: 'I would be surprised if more than a handful of schools
end up doing them. I can't imagine that the details will tell Mr Patten
anything other than that this year's tests have been a disaster.'
The National Union of Teachers, the UK's biggest teachers' union, predicted
that parts of the tests might be used for schools' own purposes, 'but
certainly not for the government's purposes'.
The issue of legislation against industrial action first arose earlier this
year when a leaked letter to Mr Patten from Mrs Gillian Shephard, then
employment secretary, suggested that the government was preparing to amend
the Employment Bill to outlaw industrial action which would flout the will
of parliament.

SIR Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is making fresh efforts to
restart talks between the province's four main constitutional parties,
officials at the Northern Ireland Office confirmed yesterday.
A series of meetings has been fixed and draft proposals which Sir Patrick
hopes might form the basis for a resumption of negotiations are to be put
before each of the party leaders at separate meetings.
The Irish government has not agreed to the formula and is working on its own
set of proposals. Mr John Major, prime minister, is expected to meet Mr
Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish Republic, this month.

FT  07 JUN 93 / 96% of accountants fail to satisfy regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST 4 per cent of the chartered accountants registered to conduct
investment business in England and Wales and visited by regulators last year
were given a completely clean bill of health.
Some 140 - or 11 per cent - of the 1,287 reports on practices visited by
regulators during 1992 highlighted serious breaches, according to figures to
be presented on Wednesday to the council of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales.
A further 433 firms breached important regulations or a large number of
regulations, and 628 breached minor regulations. Only 55 were judged to have
shown no breaches.
The institute received 63 complaints during the year. Three firms have so
far had their authorisation suspended, while another 49 have been told to
make improvements as a result of reports submitted during the year.
The details come in the annual report from the practice regulation
directorate of the institute, the self-regulating arm which is responsible
for accountants conducting auditing, insolvency and financial services.
Mr Cliff Bygrave, chairman of the institute's Financial Services
Authorisation Committee, said: 'We are never really happy while we have
(significant regulatory breaches). But we have asked (the regulators) to be
stricter and stronger in their visits. Next year is going to be tougher.'
He stressed that many of the breaches were on technical grounds such as
inadequate documentation as a result of 'very heavy regulation' imposed by
the 1988 Financial Services Act.
He said that most did not indicate misappropriation of money or poor
financial advice, but where they did the institute was taking 'the necessary
action'.
At the end of last year, there were 5,556 firms authorised to undertake
investment business, down from 5,851 a year earlier. All but 8 per cent were
registered for 'Category 1' business, which is to provide investment advice.
Just 6 per cent were registered for 'Category 2', allowing them to hold
client money. Only 2 per cent - or 111 firms - were 'Category 3', allowing
discretionary management of funds within certain limits, and a single firm
was registered as 'Category 4', with higher limits on management.
The report from the audit registration committee shows there have been 236
complaints between October 1991 and December 1992. Last year, there were 392
complaints to the insolvency licensing committee.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Rule change for charity reporting attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTING standards proposed by the Charity Commission will prove
impractical for smaller charities, the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants warned yesterday.
Sorp 2, the statement of recommended practice for accounting in charities,
issued as a discussion document in March, introduces a number of changes
designed to represent more fairly charity finances.
It comes at a time when the Charity Commission is increasing pressure on
charities of all sizes to file accounts that are accurate and on time.
The association said that the tougher standards would exceed smaller
charities'resources or expertise and, because fo the extra work involved,
threaten their ability to draw on voluntary help in preparing and auditing
accounts.
The association recommended a simplified, modified accounting regime for
charities with an annual income of less than Pounds 250,000.
The association also said that Sorp 2 meets the requirements of regulators
more than readers of accounts, and would prove hard to understand.
Sorp 2 is likely to be adopted later this year, and the draft was launched
with a very tight timetable for discussion and modification.
Although the guidelines are voluntary, it is likely to form the basis for
statutory accounting rules to be introduced by the Home Office as part of
the 1992 Charities Act this year.
The association also recommended that the requirement to show intangible
income - the donated and voluntary help a charity receives - should be
removed, as it would be difficult to measure and if quantified might
discourage these contributions.

FT  07 JUN 93 / US fears flood of China's new slaves: California's latest
immigration problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMMIGRATION officials in California fear that thousands of illegal Chinese
emigrants may be on board ships headed for the west coast of the US,
following the apprehension of about 500 Chinese landing along the coast over
the past two weeks.
Two trawlers, each carrying a human cargo of about 150 Chinese immigrants
packed into the holds, were seized earlier this week as they landed at
fishing harbours near Monterey and San Francisco. The coastal vessels are
believed to have picked up their passengers five days earlier from off-shore
'mother ships' which crossed the Pacific.
Last month, in an even more brazen attempt to smuggle people into the US,
the Pai Sheng, a Chinese freighter, sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge
right into San Francisco Bay to drop off about 270 passengers at a disused
city pier. Most were detained after a chase by police and immigration agents
through city parks and streets.
These incidents are further evidence of what US authorities say is a
large-scale smuggling operation with suspected links to Asian organised
crime rings in the US and Hong Kong.
The immigrants, most of them men in their 20s, pay fees of between Dollars
20,000 (Pounds 13,000) and Dollars 40,000 for their passage to the US,
according to investigators. They scrape together about Dollars 1,000,
typically borrowed from relatives, to board the ships, and are then indebted
for the balance of their 'fare'.
Most of the illegal immigrants set off from the coastal Chinese provinces of
Fujian and Guangdong. Many, however, come from China's hinterland where
people feel they are being left behind by the economic boom in more
prosperous areas of the country. A widening economic gap between country and
city is contributing to the desperation of many young Chinese.
Although they come to the US seeking jobs and economic prosperity, the
immigrants instead become slaves to their smugglers and many resort to crime
to pay off their debts, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
'They are selling their souls. What are these people going to do to pay off
the smugglers? ' asks Richard Held, a FBI Special Agent in San Francisco.
'Does that mean moving heroin or cocaine? That is a distinct possibility.'
The recent influx has raised suspicions in the US of complicity by the
Chinese government in the human trafficking. But in Beijing officials deny
'turning a blind eye' to illegal emigration. 'The Chinese government has all
along been opposed to illegal emigration and has adopted a series of
measures to stop it,' said Mr Wu Jianmin, the Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman.
Mr Wu insisted that Chinese security organisations had 'intensified their
efforts' to stop illegal organisations trafficking in immigrants.
However, some of the immigrants landing in San Francisco this week spoke of
paying additional fees to bribe Chinese government officials to let them
leave the country, according to US investigators.
With millions of dollars being extorted from the passengers of the Chinese
smuggling ships, it seems unlikely that the practice will end soon. So far
this year, the US Coast Guard has detained over 1,600 illegal Chinese
immigrants, more than twice the number in 1992.
The rising numbers could, however, reflect a change of route, rather than a
growing volume of illegal immigrants. US investigators speculate that the
smugglers are now cutting out 'middle men' in other countries and attempting
to maximise their profits by landing their passengers directly on US shores.
Chinese officials charge that the willingness of some countries (including
the US) to grant 'political asylum' to Chinese emigrants is encouraging
human smuggling.
Indeed, US immigration lawyers representing some of the passengers of the
Pai Sheng say that they will seek asylum and note that the judicial process
may take as long as 10 years, giving their clients time to seek legal US
residency.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST eight people died early yesterday morning after a freighter,
believed to be carrying hundreds of illegal Chinese immigrants, ran aground
close to Rockaway beaches in the Queens borough of New York City.
The grounding of the freighter, the Golden Venture, happened shortly after
2am yesterday. More than 100 Chinese passengers plunged into the chilly
waters, and swam about half a mile to the shore.
According to emergency rescue workers, who reached the scene shortly
afterwards, four passengers were known to have died on the beach, and
another two in hospital later. Two bodies were also washed ashore.
By late afternoon officials said that they had accounted for about 300
people. Many of those who swam ashore were said to be suffering from
exposure or hypothermia, and about 20 had been taken to hospital. There were
also growing fears that tuberculosis may have been prevalent on the vessel.
Initial pictures released by the US Coast Guard of the freighter's interior
suggested that conditions had been extremely cramped and squalid. However,
officials still lacked a firm indication of the number of people who had
been aboard the ship.
Interpreters who were called to the scene said that some passengers claimed
to have been aboard the freighter for more than 100 days. They also reported
that it made a number of stops in China before crossing the ocean. This
fuelled rumours that the ship was operated by an Asian 'human smuggling'
ring, which had charged passengers Dollars 20,000-Dollars 30,000 for the
journey.
Mr William Slattery, New York district director for immigration and
naturalisation, said the immigrants were mostly Chinese from Fukien
province.
The 11 crew members were still being questioned by the US authorities last
night, while their passengers were placed in the custody of the US
Immigration and Naturalisation Service. All are understood to have asked for
political asylum.
The vessel itself remained stranded on a sand-bank. However, the local Coast
Guard reported that it was up against a 'rock jetty', and expressed concern
that an oil spill might develop. The ship was carrying about five tons of
diesel fuel.
Illegal Chinese immigration has been on the rise in New York City, but this
is believed to be the first time a vessel carrying such a large number of
passengers has disgorged its load on the city's shoreline.

Mongolian People's Revolutionary party and is running for an opposition
coalition. Final results should be known by Thursday.

ARAB parties to the Middle East peace talks convened in Amman yesterday for
a co-ordination meeting before the 10th round of negotiations with Israel,
due to begin in Washington on June 15, James Whittington reports from Amman.
The meeting was opened by Jordan's new prime minister, Dr Abdul-Salam Al
Majali, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio. It was attended by
foreign ministers from Syria, Lebanon and Egypt and Palestinian
representatives.
In an upbeat inauguration statement, Dr Majali, Jordan's former chief peace
negotiator, re-affirmed the Arabs' commitment to the peace process. He said
later that Jordan and Israel were very close to agreement and was optimistic
about a comprehensive settlement soon.
In a statement at the end of the talks, the Arabs criticised Israel's human
rights in the occupied territories and called on the US to play a more
effective role as a 'full partner' to the negotiations.

China has ruled out a big devaluation of the official yuan exchange rate and
denied rumours of plans to abolish foreign exchange certificates for
foreigners, Reuter reports from Beijing.
An official with the State Administration of Exchange Control said last
week's move to lift price ceilings at forex swap centres - which led to a
sharp drop of the yuan against the dollar on those markets - did not mean
Beijing was planning further large currency adjustments.

The UN has begun flying civilian staff from Somalia to Kenya for safety,
Reuter reports from Mogadishu. A UN spokesman said three flights would be
used to evacuate some civilian staff to Nairobi.
Officials were also considering concentrating staff from isolated posts in
Mogadishu at safer centres. Some UN officials spent Saturday night in their
offices, trapped by street fighting. Foreign aid workers said fresh attacks
on UN forces were feared.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Rarefied air to Bolivian election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER military dictator, a mining tycoon, a brewing magnate and a TV talk
show host were the main candidates tussling for votes yesterday in Bolivian
presidential elections.
Expectations of a big turnout were thwarted by a series of last-minute
administrative problems such as a lack of voting slips in the city of Santa
Cruz. Voting in a substantial number of areas has been delayed until next
Sunday.
But while oxygen may have been in short supply at the 12 de Octubre polling
station in the poor El Alto township above La Paz which, at 13,000 feet,
claims to be the world's highest voting booth, enthusiasm for democracy was
not.
Swarms of people queued to vote, the women in their distinctive bowler hats,
embroidered shawls and multi-layered skirts. Most did not seem to care who
won, enjoying instead the power of voting in their third election since 1985
in a country until recently so riddled by coups that it was considered the
most unstable in Latin America.
Waiting to cast his vote, Mr Vladimir Benita, a stallholder, said: 'It's
important that we vote so that we get a good government. We're proud to be a
democracy after so many years of dictatorship.' There were some dissenting
voices. Mr Zairo Villasuelo, a carpenter, said: 'I wouldn't vote if it
wasn't compulsory. Politicians are all corrupt.'
These are the first Bolivian elections to be held under an independent
electoral court, and President Jaime Paz Zamora said yesterday that
Bolivians should be proud of the most transparent elections in the country's
history. However, there were charges of fraud due to a surge in the number
of registered voters to 2.4m against less than 2m in 1989, and the Santa
Cruz problems led some candidates to demand a new election.
Fourteen parties were fielding candidates, but the real fight was between Mr
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, 62, from the main opposition party and General
Hugo Banzer, 67, a former military dictator and now the rightist candidate
of the ruling party. US-educated Mr De Lozada owns the country's biggest
private mining company and, as planning minister from 1985 to 1989, fathered
a stabilisation plan which reduced inflation from 26,000 per cent to just 15
per cent.
There was little difference in their campaign platforms, both favouring a
continuation of the austerity programme.
The last opinion poll put Mr De Lozada slightly ahead, but no one was
expected to secure a majority. This would leave the balance with Mr Max
Fernandez, the brewing magnate, and Mr Carlos Palenque, the talk show host.
Under Bolivia's electoral system the candidate with the most votes may not
win, as Mr De Lozada learnt in 1989 when he topped the polls but was not
named president. The decision rests with Congress, which holds a secret vote
in August.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Venezuela's new president adopts a cautious line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENATOR Ramon Jose Velasquez, 76, was sworn in at the weekend as Venezuela's
interim president to complete the last eight months of the five-year
presidency of Mr Carlos Andres Perez, who was suspended from office last
month to face corruption charges.
A widely respected historian, journalist and public figure, Mr Velasquez
will serve until the troubled, oil-exporting republic elects a new president
in national elections next December.
Mr Velasquez said he would consult members of the cabinet and experts before
making decisions on government policy. It was not immediately clear if he
planned changes in the unpopular free-market policies initiated by Mr Perez
four years ago.
He said he would do everything within his power to solve problems troubling
Venezuelans, but warned that his government would not be a 'miracle
factory'.
Venezuela was passing through a difficult period of growth and
transformation, and fiscal and economic problems were 'rooted in the payment
of its external debt and a tradition of (government) wastefulness'.
Admitting that he was not an economics expert, Mr Velasquez said he would
set up permanent advisory councils on economic and financial matters, among
other things. He also asked professionals who normally shunned political
jobs and government posts to provide advice on key economic issues.
Members of the two majority political parties said they would not place
members in the new cabinet, thus giving Mr Velasquez the opportunity to seek
independent political figures. However, the two parties pledged to support
the new president in approving key economic legislation that has been mired
down in Congress.
Mr Velasquez, who worked for several years as a newspaper reporter and
editor, has made only one change in his cabinet so far. On Saturday he named
Mr Ramon Espinoza, head of a group that promotes Venezuelan nationalism,
minister of the presidential secretariat and presidential chief of staff.
The new president's victory was largely due to the support of Venezuela's
two largest political parties - Democratic Action (AD), of which Mr
Velasquez is a member, and the Christian Democrat Copei party - which
together hold about 81 per cent of the seats in the upper and lower chambers
of Congress.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Rights activist to lead Guatemala
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GUATEMALA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUATEMALANS woke up yesterday to their third president in less than a week
after the unanimous election by Congress of Mr Ramiro de Leon Carpio, the
human rights ombudsman, ended a constitutional crisis that had thrown the
country into political chaos.
Mr De Leon, 51, won an uncontested second-round of voting after the
withdrawal of Mr Arturo Herbruger, the 81-year-old president of the supreme
electoral tribunal, who trailed by 64 to 51 votes in the first round. He
will serve until January 1996 to finish the term of former president Jorge
Serrano, who fled the country after failing to hold on to the authoritarian
powers he had assumed on May 25.
The election of Mr De Leon is being seen as a bold step by Congress, who
chose the more controversial of the three candidates put forward by a broad
coalition of business leaders, political parties, unions and popular
organisations.
'Ramiro was not the candidate of the large party, the business sector, or
the military,' said Mr Gabriel Aguilera, a political analyst. 'This is
Congress responding to the street.'
Mr De Leon has been a sharp critic of the powerful Guatemalan security
forces for their widespread abuse of human rights. But on Saturday he
praised the army for its role during the last few days in returning
Guatemala to constitutional government, despite the military's initial
backing for Mr Serrano's so-called self coup, and its later support for the
illegal presidential bid of Mr Gustavo Espina, the former vice-president.
Mr De Leon will be taking power at a difficult time. The credibility of
state institutions is low and business confidence has been undermined by
months of instability. It remains unclear how a much called-for purge of
Congress will be effected.

FT  07 JUN 93 / European Commission looks for more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING is more conducive of short-term thinking than a recession. For
European governments, tormented by the cocktail of slow growth and high real
interest rates that the Bundesbank continues to serve up, it is tempting to
see a cut in German interest rates as an answer to all their ills. But the
European Commission cannot be accused of short-termism. Its new
'Community-wide Framework for Employment' should help focus members' minds.
The Commission document, essentially an agenda for future study, makes two
powerful points. First, the EC has a low rate of employment, particularly
for women, compared with other industrialised countries - less than 60 per
cent of its population of working age are in work, compared to more than 70
per cent in the US, Japan and the Efta countries.
Second, the job creation required to raise this low level of employment will
not be achieved by economic growth alone. It will require as yet unspecified
supporting policies, instead, if growth is to be more
'employment-intensive'. Europe's record of job creation has been poor not
only over the past three years but over the past two decades. Employment in
North America has nearly doubled since 1960, but has grown by a mere 10 per
cent in the EC.
Why has the EC's employment record been so bad? Some clues are to be found
in the OECD's interim report on employment and unemployment, released last
week. While weak on diagnosis and cures, the OECD report was strong on
description of trends in unemployment and employment, particularly the
comparative record of private and public sector job creation since the 1973
oil shock.
The reason for the superior employment performance of the Efta countries,
compared to the EC, is apparent from the charts. It is public sector job
creation. The number of public sector jobs created in the EC failed to
compensate for the loss of private sector employment in the years to 1985,
as the charts show. But while the Efta countries share the EC's dismal
private sector job creation, the creation of public sector employment, the
most important feature of their employment record over the past two decades,
dwarfs changes in private sector employment.
Rapid private sector job creation is, by contrast, the reason why total
employment growth in North America has outstripped EC job creation. Both the
EC and North America have created a little over 5m public sector jobs since
1974. But while the EC has created only 3.1m private jobs, the US and Canada
have created 29.8m.
This comparison, Commission officials acknowledge, provides some unpleasant
fat for EC members to chew over. First, the US achieved this private sector
employment growth, in part, because it has pursued a policy of labour market
deregulation which does not sit easily with continental Europe's social
democratic aspirations. Second, this rapid US job creation has entailed
relatively low productivity and real wage growth, compared to Europe.
The US record makes the Commission's task - to find ways of simultaneously
boosting job creation, real incomes and worker protection - look horribly
ambitious, as a senior Commission official, responsible for the EC study,
readily admits. 'More jobs mean lower growth of incomes per jobs - unless we
produce miracles.'

FT  07 JUN 93 / Steel users condemn US trade cases: 'Unfair' claims of
dumping or subsidies blamed for price rise

ALLEGED unfair trade cases, filed by the US steel industry against 19
countries, are casting 'a menacing shadow' over the American economy and
spurring inflationary price rises, according to US steel users who met in
Washington at the weekend to publicise their complaints.
Mr John Griffin, president of the American Institute for International
Steel, a group of 200 steel traders, said prices had already risen 20 per
cent this year and that another increase was expected in July.
Last year the big domestic steel producers filed 84 cases, claiming dumping
or subsidies. Duties were levied in 72 cases after the US Commerce
Department announced initial findings in January affirming the complaints.
Final Commerce Department rulings are to be announced on June 22.
The International Trade Commission, the country's fair trade watchdog, will
then have 45 days to conclude if the subsidised steel has harmed US
industry.
'American manufacturers requiring steel products with unique physical and
chemical characteristics have trouble finding them in sufficient quantities
from domestic suppliers,' Mr Griffin said. 'Infrequent users of steel are
unable to place orders.'
One of those users is Mr Roy Herman, president of the UNF Leavitt division,
UNR Industries, which makes tubing. He said high prices had made the
company's products less competitive. 'We are seeing a surge in offerings of
foreign-produced tubing, which for the most part, except for Canada, has
almost been non-existent over the last few years.'
With steel companies raising prices or reducing shipments to maximise sales
of higher-value-added products, his company is 'being played like a yo-yo in
terms of availability and delivery. . . it is nearly impossible to plan our
prod-uction in an efficient manner.'
The users say they employ 30 times more US workers than do the steel
companies.
Under attack from the users, Mr Roland McDonald, a Commerce Department
official, insisted that Congress left his department little discretion in
administering dumping and countervailing duty cases. 'The US industry is
entitled to relief from unfair trade practices,' he said.
The department has initiated 34 'suspension agreements,' paving the way for
negotiations with 10 countries on pacts providing for monitoring of higher
import prices.
Mr Joseph Papovich, a deputy US trade representative, said the 'unfair
trade' problem must be handled at its core by negotiating a Multilateral
Steel Agreement. MSA talks are expected to resume late this month or in
early July.
The US is insisting that an MSA achieve the following:
Eliminate non-tariff barriers and tariffs;
End all trade-distorting subsidies;
Discipline the use of anti-competitive practices, such as restricted
distribution systems;
Establish an effective dispute settlement mechanism;
Require individual producers to repay any illegal subsidies they receive.
David Dodwell, World Trade editor, adds: A broad-ranging inquiry into the
effect on the US economy of anti-dumping actions is 'to be reformulated and
resubmitted' to the ITC, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said in
Paris last week.
Controversy was stirred in January this year when Mr Kantor withdrew a
request to the ITC for an anti-dumping inquiry made by his predecessor, Mrs
Carla Hills, just days before she left office.
Mr Kantor insisted in Paris that the request had not been withdrawn but that
the letter requesting the inquiry had been called back 'to make the inquiry
broader and more comprehensive'.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Texas voters rebuff Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas's Republican state treasurer, won a
landslide victory in a by-election on Saturday for one of the state's
national senators. Her election will narrow President Bill Clinton's already
shaky Democratic majority in Congress and perhaps decisively mark the big
south-western state's move away from its Democratic party traditions and
into the Republican camp.
Mrs Hutchison won by a two-to-one margin over the Democrats' Bob Krueger,
who was appointed as interim senator when Mr Lloyd Bentsen left his seat to
join the Clinton administration as Treasury secretary.
Senator Robert Dole, leader of the Republicans in the Senate, said the vote
would send shock waves through Washington and warn members of Congress
against voting for higher taxes.
The Democrats now have a notional 56:44 majority in the Senate, but with
questionable friends such as Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama or Senator
David Boren of Oklahoma Mr Clinton must in fact work with a narrower margin
in seeking to win passage for his legislative agenda.
If other senators do indeed read the vote as a message against taxes, it
could make it harder to push through the Clinton budget package, including
the controversial energy tax which is stalled in the Senate.
Mr Clinton insisted after a strategy meeting with top advisers yesterday
that he would 'stick to the basic principles of the plan,' but he has given
Mr Bentsen some leeway to negotiate modifications with his former colleagues
on the Senate finance committee. The administration remains committed to the
energy tax, but officials say they are willing to reduce its impact by as
much as 30 per cent.
In one respect Mr Krueger's defeat could make it easier for the president to
meet demands for deeper cuts in government spending while demonstrating some
of the toughness that his supporters wish he would show his opponents:
Senator Daniel Moynihan, Mr Bentsen's successor as chairman of the finance
committee, said yesterday that if Texas voters wanted spending cuts rather
than tax increases it would be easy to start on two big Texas projects, the
superconducting supercollider, a costly science project under construction
at Waxahachie, and the space station, for which Nasa is due to present its
new designs this week.

FT  07 JUN 93 / World Bank official may go to EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERNIE STERN, one of the three managing directors of the World Bank, has
been sounded out about a senior position at the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development with a view to strengthening the EBRD's
management.
It emerged yesterday that the idea was floated some time ago after recent
disclosures of extravagance in the fitting out of the EBRD's London
headquarters and of cost overruns in the bank's travel budget through
frequent use of private chartered jets by Mr Jacques Attali, the EBRD
president.
It is thought that the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, which
together have a majority stake in the EBRD, would like Mr Stern to take on a
chief executive role at the bank. The EBRD was set up two years ago to help
former Communist countries introduce market economies.
Baroness Chalker, the UK overseas development aid minister, who is also
Britain's deputy governor at the EBRD, is understood to have contacted Mr
Stern on a recent trip to Washington. Officials close to the bank's
governing board said it was not yet clear whether Mr Stern would leave the
World Bank to join the EBRD in London. The idea was 'still in play', they
said.
Mr Stern's name is not the only one to have been considered by the G7, which
wants to give the international institutions and industrialised and former
Communist countries that own the EBRD better control over the bank.
The EBRD's annual meeting at the end of April decided that Mr Attali should
continue as bank president despite evidence of extravagance. But some
shareholders appear to expect that decision will be reviewed if necessary
following a special audit of the bank's spending, which is expected to be
completed in about six weeks' time.
The US, the EBRD's biggest single shareholder, is making no secret of its
wish to see Mr Attali leave and is irritated that the bank's big European
shareholders have not yet decided that he should be made to quit. Mr Attali
is said to be fighting hard for his job. One G7 official said last week he
was 'hanging on like glue'.
Mr Stern was offered a senior post as deputy to Mr Attali when the EBRD was
set up two years ago. He decided to stay in Washington, partly it was
thought for family reasons and partly because he suspected that he would not
be allowed much authority with Mr Attali as president.

FT  07 JUN 93 / EC to step up E Europe loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community plans to increase its lending to support economic
recovery in central and eastern Europe to Ecu1.7bn (Pounds 1.34bn) by the
end of the year from Ecu925m (Pounds 731m) at present.
The lending, by the European Investment Bank, the EC's long-term financing
institution, forms part of Community efforts to speed-up the integration of
eastern and western Europe. The lending details will be announced at the
EIB's annual meeting in Luxembourg today.
EC foreign ministers gather in Luxembourg tomorrow for a two-day meeting to
discuss European Commission plans to accelerate trade liberalisation with
eastern Europe.
Only Ecu180m of the Ecu925m in loans assigned for Bulgaria, the Czech
republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia have so far been disbursed,
underlining the EIB's caution in the region.
Nonetheless, the EIB's disbursement rate seems slightly higher than that
achieved by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the
east-west financial organisation. The EBRD last year disbursed Ecu126m out
of Ecu1.2bn in approved loans and equity injections for projects in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The two sets of figures are not directly comparable, however, since the EBRD
is still starting its operations and also dispensing funds across a far
wider area of the former Soviet empire than the EIB.
Of the latter's Ecu925m in signed loans, Ecu305m is destined for Hungary,
with Ecu290m earmarked for Poland, Ecu120m for Romania, Ecu115m for
Bulgaria, Ecu57m for the Czech republic and Ecu38m for Slovakia.
Additionally, the EIB plans to lend Ecu200m over three years to Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania.
The EIB, which last year lent the record total of Ecu17bn inside and outside
the Community, raises funds on international capital markets. These are lent
on with a small interest rate margin, resulting in the current lending rate
for 10-year D-Mark loans of a highly competitive 6.9 per cent.
At today's annual meeting, attended by EC finance ministers, the EIB will
announce it is well on the way to implementing the Ecu5bn lending plan to
spur EC growth decided at last December's Edinburgh summit. The EIB board
has approved Ecu2.2bn for 30 transport, infrastructure and environment
projects, with another Ecu440m worth of deals to be discussed today.
The EIB has also concluded preparations for an investment fund to guarantee
loans for transport and infrastructure ventures and for small and
medium-sized EC companies.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Hungarian nationalists to form breakaway party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARIAN nationalists led by Mr Istvan Csurka are expected to form a
breakaway far-right party after being expelled formally from the governing
Hungarian Democratic Forum at the weekend.
Within the Forum, Mr Csurka has already built up the Hungarian Justice
parliamentary platform and the Hungarian Way mass movement. Now he is
expected to fuse these into a formal political party.
The nationalist leader can hope to take about half the 29 MPs of Hungarian
Justice with him, leaving Mr Jozsef Antall, the moderate prime minister,
with a fragile parliamentary majority.
Mr Csurka, an author, is regarded as the spiritual father of the Forum. He
also commands the passionate support of many party activists. The weekend's
defections threaten to weaken the Forum's grassroots campaign to retain
power in the general to elections to be held before next spring.
Aides of the prime minister expect to limit the far-right share of the vote
to less than 10 per cent. Poor turnout at last Friday's demonstration for
the return of Hungarian territory lost after the first world war suggest
there is little support for extreme nationalism.
Government officials also believe that the support they lose on the right
can be regained in the centre and that the expulsion of Mr Csurka makes it
easier for the Forum to find new coalition allies.
The Forum government can also begin to erase the international embarrassment
suffered through association with Mr Csurka ever since last August when the
author published a controversial nationalist manifesto.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Dignity dies in Russian democratic dealings: The conference
called to draft a new constitution has begun in chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACRIMONIOUS scenes over the weekend at President Boris Yeltsin's
Constitutional Convention do not bode well for its ability to hammer out a
new democratic constitution for Russia.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, stormed out with about 70
of the 700 participants, declaring the gathering illegal. Mr Yuri Slobodkin,
author of an alternative Communist draft, was carried out kicking and
screaming by security guards.
Those leaving with the speaker included leaders of the local parliaments of
Russia's 89 regions and republics.
The scuffles have made it less likely that Mr Yeltsin will obtain
endorsement for the constitution to be enacted through constitutional means.
This provides for a final draft to be hammered out by the Constitutional
Convention by June 16, and then initialled by the regional and republican
leaders.
The latter would then ask the Congress of People's Deputies to endorse the
new constitution, which until now it has refused to do because it would be
dissolved in the process. Elections to a new bicameral parliament, which
would replace both the full and standing parliaments, would be held no later
than October. If this plan is rejected by parliamentary deputies, Mr Yeltsin
has said he will resort to other unspecified methods.
Mr Khasbulatov's behaviour was dismissed as a 'provocation' by Mr Yeltsin,
who had valiantly tried to keep the meeting dignified. He told delegates
'our descendants will not forgive us. . . if we do not reach the agreement
which is our main task'. The new constitution, providing a clearer division
of powers and a stronger executive, was essential to replace an old system
incompatible with reforms and democracy, he said.
However, while many members of the existing parliament are co-operating with
him and some are uncertain whether to back Mr Khasbulatov in a fight he is
likely to lose, the president cannot yet count on a majority of Congress.
This puts Mr Yeltsin at the mercy of republican and regional leaders, who
are seeking significant concessions diluting plans for a federal state in
return for endorsing the constitution.
Mr Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the young millionaire president of the republic of
Kalmykia, said yesterday he wanted his own draft constitution to be
discussed, adding that Moscow should no longer levy taxes directly from
subjects of the Russian Federation. This would be a first step on the road
to the country's collapse, even though Mr Ilyumzhinov's draft proclaims the
Federation to be united and indivisible.
A group of regional leaders also demanded more subsidies from central
government and that the central bank continue covering debts accumulated
between inefficient enterprises.
The undignified circus at the convention was symptomatic of the
point-scoring gripping Russian political life. On Friday, the head of the
president's control department held a news conference to report on his
investigation into corruption allegations by Vice-President Alexander
Rutskoi.
While the official, Mr Alexei Ilyushenko, did not get round to the most
serious allegations involving some of Mr Yeltsin's closest aides, he said
most of the vice-president's accusations of embezzlement by commanders of
the Russian army had been unsubstantiated.
He added that he was also trying to investigate a business alleged to have
benefited from corrupt practices.
Simultaneously, parliament voted to ask the Constitutional Court to protect
the vice-president's rights. His limousines, staff, and official functions
have been systematically whittled away by Mr Yeltsin since making those
allegations. Mr Rutskoi's post will also be abolished under the new
constitution.
An unwitting party to the chaos was Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary,
who found himself squeezed into the president's and prime minister's
timetable just as the convention was about to start. 'He (President Yeltsin)
is very confident they are going to win those reforms and that there will be
no stepping back,' said Mr Bentsen, leaving the Kremlin as the delegates
were arriving. He told Russian leaders the country had to get inflation
under control and proceed with structural reforms in order to benefit from
large-scale western aid.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Italians punish established parties at the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Christian Democrat and Socialist parties yesterday appeared the
principal victims of the political corruption scandal with a collapse in
support at partial administrative elections involving 10.5m voters.
Exit polls from Milan, Turin and Catania, the three biggest cities voting to
elect new mayors and councils, showed support for the two parties had
crumbled against an upsurge by the autonomist Lega Nord in the northern
cities and the anti-Mafia La Rete (Network) movement in Sicily.
Exit polls immediately after voting closed at 10pm gave the Lega Nord 41.7
per cent of the vote in Milan, 23.6 percentage points above its showing in
the April 1992 general election. It also performed strongly in Turin,
doubling its share of the vote to 22.1 per cent.
Support for the Christian Democrats fell to 8.5 per cent in Milan, almost 8
percentage points below their showing last year, while the Socialist vote
crashed to just 2.2 per cent, 11 percentage points down.
In Catania, La Rete almost pushed the Christian Democrats into second place,
with 17.2 per cent of the vote according to exit polls. This compared with
18.2 per cent for the Christian Democrats, whose share of the vote dropped
by almost 16 per cent since last year.
The elections, involving 1,192 towns, six provinces and the Friuli-Venezia
Giulia region, provided the first indication of the country's political
mood. Since the last general election, voters have been fed an almost daily
diet of revelations of political corruption. A new general election, based
on a reformed voting system, is expected next autumn.
Yesterday's elections have broken new constitutional as well as political
ground, with polling being held on one day, rather than carried over to
Monday. The communal elections mark the first time Italians vote directly
for their mayor, while in many parts of the country the polling system has
been altered to create more stable administrations.
The present, transitional, nature of Italian politics and breakdown in
traditional party allegiances was underlined by the quantity and variety of
candidates. Twelve contenders were competing to be mayor of Milan, while
over 1,000 candidates were contesting the 60 seats on the city council.
The mayoral battles in Milan, Turin and Catania are widely expected to go to
a second round run-off on June 20 as none of the leading contenders is
expected to obtain an absolute majority this time.
In Milan the contest will be between Mr Formentini and Mr Nando dalla
Chiesa, a left-wing sociologist and MP supported by La Rete and the
Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the former Communists.
Favourite in Turin is Mr Diego Novelli, a former mayor supported by La Rete
and the hardline Restructured Communism movement, who is likely to face Mr
Valentino Castellani, backed by a local voters' alliance and the PDS,
Republicans and Greens. The Catania poll is also expected to involve a
run-off between candidates backed by parties outside the established
spectrum, in this case the Democratic Alliance and La Rete respectively.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Swiss military carry the day: Referendums back new aircraft
and army training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS voters have given a strong vote of confidence to their militia army,
rejecting proposals to block the purchase of new fighters and to limit the
army's training space.
More than 57 per cent of those voting in yesterday's referendums rejected
the proposal to put off buying fighters until the year 2000. Some 55 per
cent threw out the proposal to limit the number of army training grounds to
the current 40 and to prevent their expansion.
In the more important figher vote, there were majorities in both French- and
German-speaking Switzerland, showing that the army is still one of the few
things that unites most Swiss. Italian-speaking Ticino voted in favour of
both propositions.
The results seem to reflect a renewed concern among Swiss about their
security, caused apparently by the war in Bosnia (about 500,000 ex-Yugoslavs
live in Switzerland) and worrying signs of instability in neighbouring
countries.
The votes mean that the government can proceed with its planned purchase of
34 McDonnell Douglas F/A18 fighter jets at an estimated cost of SFr3.5bn
(Pounds 1.6bn). The US aircraft maker welcomed the decision, which will also
be a boon for Swiss aircraft and component manufacturers. At least SFr2.5bn
of the total cost will flow back into the country, creating 20,000 jobs.
The purchase was approved by parliament a year ago but was put on hold when
the pacifist Group for a Switzerland without an Army (GSoA) gathered nearly
500,000 signatures for its fighter moratorium petition.
The government was bound to take the GSoA's initiative seriously. In
November, 1989, 35.6 per cent of voters supported its proposal to abolish
the military altogether.
The GSoA admitted that yesterday's result was a setback. The practical
consequence will be that the government will no longer feel obliged to give
priority to other GSoA petitions aimed at cutting the military's strength.
The F/A18s are to replace the army's 36 ageing Mirage III-S fighters in the
front line. The army said the radar and other avionics features of the
Mirage had been surpassed by more modern fighters used by other air forces,
and Switzerland had to match them. The first aircraft are to be operational
in 1996.
The petition to limit training grounds was mounted three years ago by a
group of citizens in northeastern Switzerland opposed to a decision to build
a huge new ground in their vicinity.
Their opposition struck a chord throughout the country in communities that
have to put up with frequent noisy and sometimes dangerous military
exercises. But the army argued that it could not be constrained if it was to
provide a credible defence.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday seemed poised to accept the EC's draft agreement with the
US limiting European oilseed output, but its ministers were maintaining
anti-American rhetoric to placate French farmers.
Mr Nicholas Sarkozy, ministerial spokesman for the government, said
yesterday there was no question of 'sacrificing French farmers' interests'.
But several ministers have said the oilseed deal, negotiated with more
controversial farm export subsidy cuts last November, is not bad for French
and EC interests. Limiting oilseed cultivation to 5.12m hectares in the
Community would not cramp French farmers, they concede. But France will ask
for a review of the restraint on industrial oilseed growth.
The main sticking point when EC ministers meet in Luxembourg tomorrow may be
France's desire to trade its acceptance of the oilseed deal for a firm EC
declaration that the export subsidy curbs be re-negotiated by Washington.

<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT by Serbs living in Croatia to unite their self-styled republic
with its Bosnian counterpart is likely to add to the difficulties of
implementing the new United Nations resolution on Bosnia.
The Krajina Serb assembly decided at the weekend to hold a referendum on
June 19-20 on linking with the Bosnian Serbs.
The assembly appeared already so confident of a 'yes' vote that it announced
that the capital of the new state would be the Bosnian Serb stronghold of
Banja Luka.
The decision appeared to mark a victory for hardliners over a more moderate
faction which has been holding talks with international mediators on
autonomy for Krajina within Croatia.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has encouraged closer
co-operation between what he calls 'the western Serbs' in reaction to
international pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to distance
himself from the Bosnian Serbs.
Mr Karazdic also said that the United Nations resolution 'will not be
harmful to the Serbs'. He promised to co-operate with the UN on setting up
safe areas for Moslems in Bosnia.
A member of the Moslem-led Bosnian government, Mr Ejub Ganic, condemned the
resolution at the weekend, saying its adoption showed that the international
community had become 'a second aggressor' against Bosnia, together with
Serbia.
A diplomatic source in Belgrade said the resolution would not help to
achieve a long-term solution in Bosnia.
'Without a political framework for a solution, the safe havens for Moslems
will become expanded refugee camps, with a danger of becoming permanent,'
the source said.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Prominent companies admit bribes and kickbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SAIPEM and Nuovo Pignone, two leading Italian engineering companies, have
admitted to paying more than Dollars 160m (Pounds 104m) in kickbacks and
bribes to win new business in the past six years.
The revelations, contained in their 1992 reports and accounts, indicate the
scale of payments the companies made to obtain big domestic and foreign
contracts and to satisfy Italian political party demands.
The revelations could begin a trend in corporate accounting, as companies
implicated in political corruption reveal to shareholders the scale and
nature of previously secret payments, formerly kept off published balance
sheets and paid via foreign subsidiaries.
Saipem, an engineering group specialising in the energy sector, and Nuovo
Pignone, which makes gas turbines and compressors, are parts of the
state-owned Eni energy and chemicals concern. Eni, whose former chairman, Mr
Gabriele Cagliari, is in prison on corruption allegations, has been deeply
implicated in the scandal.
Saipem's accounts show it paid almost Dollars 121.6m (Pounds 79m) in
kickbacks and 'commissions' to win business between 1987 and 1992, while the
smaller Nuovo Pignone says it paid L25bn (Pounds 11m).
The payments cover both kickbacks to political parties on domestic orders
from public sector companies, such as Enel, and payments to unspecified
foreign intermediaries to win foreign projects.
The accounts of Saipem, whose chairman, Mr Gianni Dell'Orto, was arrested
earlier this year, show Dollars 91.4m was paid between 1987 and 1992 to
companies controlled by Mr Pier Francesco Pacini Battaglia, a Geneva-based
Italian banker who has emerged as a key figure in undeclared payments by the
Eni group. Mr Dell'Orto is today expected to be replaced as chairman at
Saipem's annual meeting.
Almost Dollars 71m of the total is believed to have gone to foreign
intermediaries to help win contracts, while the balance of about Dollars
20.6m was presumably paid to Italian political parties. Saipem says a
further Dollars 50.8m was paid directly by a Zurich subsidiary to unnamed
foreigners. The group says it won about L12,000bn of contracts during the
period.
Although Saipem and Nuovo Pignone are breaking ground in Italian corporate
reporting, the sheer numbers of other leading groups already implicated
suggests it may not be long before others follow.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Maxwell pensions shortfall cut to less than Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS THAN Pounds 100m in assets stolen from the Maxwell pension funds
remains untraced or in disputed ownership as negotiations intensify for
out-of-court settlements to meet the shortfall.
Investigators have now identified or secured more than three-quarters of the
Pounds 440m they initially believed liquidated or illegally used as
collateral for loans by the late Robert Maxwell, reducing the total
outstanding to far less than originally feared.
The ownership of less than Pounds 100m remains in dispute, but lawyers and
accountants are nearing completion of statements of claim that may lead to
court action over handling the assets or for professional negligence.
The threat of fighting lengthy and costly court actions is intensifying
pressure on City institutions that did business with the Maxwell empire to
contribute instead to the shortfall through the Maxwell Pensioners Trust.
Sir Peter Webster, a retired high court judge and mediation consultant
appointed earlier this year to the trust, has now successfully negotiated a
settlement to a dispute that would otherwise have led to a costly legal
battle.
He hopes to to negotiate settlements in place of up to six potential legal
actions, which would substantially increase the money available to
pensioners.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, is one of several organisations and
individuals that did business with the Maxwell group, and has now paid money
into the fund without admitting any culpability.
Invesco MIM, the fund management group, is coming under increasing pressure
to contribute after its Pounds 750,000 fine and Pounds 1.6m in costs imposed
last week by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation for breaches
including three relating to Mirror Group pension assets. The Securities and
Investments Board (SIB), the City's senior regulator, is considering using
its powers under Section 61 of the 1988 Financial Services Act to sue
Invesco to seek redress for investors. That would come on top of an existing
Pounds 11.3m action launched by the Mirror Group pension trustees.
SIB could also use its powers for the first time under Section 59 of the act
to ban individuals from the financial services industry and under Section 60
to criticise authorised people.
Most of the Maxwell pension fund assets have been traced. Others - such as
shares in Teva, the Israeli pharmaceutical company, already handed back to
the pension funds - have appreciated in value.
The Maxwell trust fund continues to receive some donations, with the total
to date standing at about Pounds 6.25m. That will allow pensioners to be
paid for a further three years.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Gonzalez wins fourth term: Unexpected Spanish Socialist
success leaves People's Party stunned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S Socialist Prime Minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, unexpectedly won a
clear general election victory last night after establishing a lead of 18
seats over the conservative People's Party, with more than 90 per cent of
the vote counted by the early morning.
The socialist result stunned the PP, which had expected to beat the
socialists after one of the closest elections in the country's short
democratic history. Mr Jose Mara Aznar, the PP leader, conceded defeat just
after midnight in Madrid but, noting that the Socialists, in power since
1982, had lost their parliamentary majority, said: 'A new age has begun.
Socialist hegemony is over. Nothing will be the same again.'
Mr Gonzalez, expressing his 'infinite gratitude' for what will be his fourth
term in office, said that 'I want everyone to know that I have understood
the message' of the campaign, in which the Socialists were heavily
criticised for their indifference at public concern about a series of
financing scandals and rising unemployment.
According to an official count released by the Interior Ministry, with just
92.7 per cent of the vote counted, Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party had won
38.9 per cent of the vote and 159 seats, sharply down on the 175 it won in
1989 but well above the result being predicted by opinion polls in the last
few weeks.
The ministry's count gave the PP 141 seats, well up on the 107 the party won
in 1989. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether Mr Aznar, having failed
to fulfil the widespread conviction among PP supporters that the socialists
were ready to be felled, will survive at the head of the party.
Contrary to all expectations, the socialists appear to have attracted about
1m more votes than they won in 1989 even though the country has since sunk
into recession and in spite of an avalanche of corruption allegations
against the ruling party.
The overall left-of-centre vote may have increased slightly overall as the
communist-led United Left party won an extra seat to become the
third-biggest party in parliament, with 18 seats.
In spite of the socialist victory, the elections mark a watershed in Spanish
politics, as they break the young democracy's tradition of strong
single-party government since the first elections held under the 1978
constitution. 'The result reflects the reality of the country,' said Mr
Javier Arzallus, leader of the Basque nationalist party, the PNV. 'We have
returned to normal. The days of absolute majority are over and it is no bad
thing.'
The vote will probably lead to a coalition government of the socialists and
the conservative Catalan regional party, the CiU, and the PNV. The CiU won
17 seats, one short of its 1989 result, and the PNV held its five seats.
Mr Gonzalez has, however, also suggested in the past that if he were to win
160 or more seats he might consider trying to govern alone, with the tacit
support of the Basques and Catalans.
The strong showing by the socialists is certain to ease pressure on the
peseta when foreign exchange markets open this morning. Many analysts had
feared that a close vote would make forming a government difficult. Also,
the markets had begun to assume that a conservative government would cut
interest rates more quickly than the socialists.
Mr Gonzalez's lead is probably enough to allow him to govern for a full
four-year term, although he will need to be much more attentive to
conservatives' calls for greater fiscal restraint made during the past four
years.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Major to face Lords assault on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EMBATTLED Mr John Major was last night preparing for a fierce assault on
his European policies when the Maastricht bill is introduced into the House
of Lords.
With disenchantment at the prime minister's leadership threatening to spread
through Tory ranks, Lady Thatcher is expected today to spearhead calls for a
Maastricht referendum from a distinguished list of Euro-sceptic peers.
A record 133 peers have asked to speak in what is certain to be the most
highly-charged Lords debate in years. Lady Thatcher's contribution is
expected to be followed tomorrow by an equally trenchant attack from Lord
Tebbit, the former Tory party chairman.
Though the Lords can only delay the measure and though this week's debate is
highly unlikely to end in a vote, the publicity it will generate could not
have come at a worse time for the prime minister. The bill completed its
tortuous Commons passage last month almost exactly a year after receiving
its second Commons reading.
With pressure mounting for the prime minister to reassert his authority,
Labour is planning to take advantage of his current weakness by staging a
set-piece debate on government policies on Wednesday to follow hard on the
heels of the Maastricht exchanges.
The occasion will give Mr John Smith, Labour leader, a rare opportunity to
take the prime minister on head-to-head in a full-length Commons debate. Mr
Smith is expected to emphasise broken Conservative pledges.
As senior Tories attempted to rally round Mr Major, the party's morale was
dented further by the results of weekend opinion polls.
A survey of 52 constituency party chairmen - normally regarded as an
ultra-loyal group - found that more than a quarter of them wanted the prime
minister replaced.
The poll, conducted by the Sunday Times, showed that a clear majority of
constituency chairmen were dissatisfied with the government's performance.
Coming after last week's Gallup poll, which showed Mr Major to be the most
unpopular prime minister since polling began more than 50 years ago, the
survey will reinforce the impression that last month's cabinet reshuffle has
failed to lift the cloud hanging over the prime minister.
In a further blow, an NOP poll for the Mail on Sunday in the Christchurch
constituency showed the Conservatives could be facing a second consecutive
by-election defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats.
The survey gave the Liberal Democrats, on 53 per cent, a 15-point lead over
the Tories, with Labour, backed by just 7 per cent, in distant third place.
The result represented a 27 per cent swing from the Conservatives, who will
be defending a majority of more than 23,000, to the Liberal Democrats. In
last month's Newbury by-election, the Liberal Democrats achieved a swing of
28 per cent in winning by 22,000 votes.
Nearly three-quarters of those questioned said that the cabinet reshuffle in
which Mr Norman Lamont was replaced as chancellor by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
former home secretary, had made no difference to their voting intentions.
Though a date for the Christchurch by-election has yet to be fixed, there
are increasing expectations it will be set for mid-July.
Meanwhile, with more Lords expected to submit requests to speak in this
week's debate ahead of today's midday deadline, anti-Maastricht peers have
made representations to the government whips for it to be allowed to
continue into a third day.
The committee stage of detailed line-by-line consideration will follow later
this month.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Tories shelve plan for environmental agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO set up an environment agency have been put off by the government
because there is not enough time in the next session of parliament, which
begins in November, for the legislation to create it.
The decision means that the bill will not be passed until 1995 at the
earliest, bringing a further delay to fulfilling the Tories' election
promise in this area.
The Conservative manifesto pledged to establish an agency which combined the
functions of the National Rivers Authority, the Inspectorate of Pollution
and the waste regulation function of local councils. Postponing the bill is
a sign that ministers believe 'green' issues have fallen down the political
agenda and are well below law and order or education.
News that the plans have been shelved came as Labour prepared to enhance its
own appeal on environmental issues. Mr John Smith, the party leader, is to
use a speech today to an audience of environmentalists and party officials
to stake Labour's claim to be environmentally friendly.
The lessening priority attached by the government to green issues which is
signalled by the delay also offers Labour the chance to intensify its attack
on claims that value added tax is to be imposed on domestic fuel to help the
UK meet the commitments it accepted at the Rio summit last June.
The green bill had originally been pencilled in for the present legislative
session, but a row between the Department of the Environment and the
Ministry of Agriculture over the role of the agency put it to the back of
the queue for parliamentary time. The legislation was also expected to cover
hedgerows and national parks.
This time, the policy had been agreed, but the bill was forced out of the
programme at the last minute by the weight of Home Office measures.
Environmental campaigners have already questioned the green credentials of
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, but the government's business
managers dropped the bill while Mr Michael Howard, now the Home Secretary,
was at the DoE.
Ministers insist that in spite of the lack of legislation, the UK will be
able to maintain its leading edge on environmental issues.
'The bill would not necessarily have been the centrepiece of our
environmental policies anyway,' one said yesterday.

FT  07 JUN 93 / Knife-edge finish in Spanish poll: Exit results suggest
Gonzalez may scrape back into government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLOSEST general election in Spain since it became a democracy in 1978
ended last night with early exit polls suggesting that Mr Felipe Gonzalez
might have done just enough to secure a fourth term in spite of a dramatic
collapse in support for the socialist party.
Two polls published as soon as voting ended at 8 pm gave the Socialist
Workers' party (PSOE) of Mr Gonzalez a slightly larger share of the vote and
a handful more seats in the 350-seat Congress (lower house).
But a third poll gave the conservative People's Party a slight edge in
seats, even though it saw the PSOE winning more votes.
The PP last night said it believed it had won the elections. 'This will be a
long night,' said Mr Javier Arenas, leader of the party in Andalucia.
'I think a new stage is opening in the history of Spanish democracy,' Mr
Jose Mara Aznar told private Cope radio.
Mr Teofilo Serrano, a Socialist spokesman, said after the first polls that
the situation was 'complicated'.
'We are going to have to wait until all the votes are counted,' he said.
Voter turnout was about 75 per cent, compared with 69 per cent in the 1989
elections.
The Socialist party said its own poll showed it had won the most votes, but
some analysts were warning last night that the PP might still finish ahead
of the socialists in the number of seats won, even though it might win fewer
votes.
The inability of the polls to be precise is a measure of how close the vote
was expected to be as counting continued into the night. The PP was poised
to take a number of key marginal seats away from the government, but those
would depend on just a few hundred votes.
Because Spain's electoral system gives greater weight to rural provinces -
which tend to vote conservatively - the PP might win more seats in
parliament although it has a smaller percentage of the popular vote.
Seats are allocated according to the percentage of the vote that a party
wins in each of Spain's 52 provinces.
A minute after the polls closed, Spanish television said the socialists,
with 175 seats in the last parliament, might have won between 139 and 155
seats, with the PP taking between 134 and 148 seats. Antena 3 television
said the socialists appeared to have won up to 157 seats while the PP may
have taken up to 154.
It was clear even from last night's early results that whoever won would be
forced to seek partners among the regional parties to form a coalition or at
least to reach long-term agreements under which those regional parties,
particularly in the Basque country and Catalonia, would support a minority
government.
The campaign, in which Mr Gonzalez had fought to remain in office against a
background of economic recession and accusations of corruption, was bitter
and ill-tempered.
Last night's election brought a dramatic change to Spanish politics, which
have been dominated by single-party governments since the first democratic
election after the death of the dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975.
The victory may signal a rejection of the centre-right PP, which for some
Spaniards harks back to Franco's days.
The party's performance establishes its leader Mr Aznar as the nation's
first conservative politician for a decade to seriously challenge the
leadership of the country.

FT  05 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) Gardening: Fruitful inspiration for border
browsers - Book / Bridget Bloom on the latest in reading for gardeners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIDGET BLOOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 14th August 1993) appended to this article.
WHAT DO you expect from a gardening book? Inspiration? Practical advice and
a faultless index? The widest possible selection of plants?
Obviously, the answer must vary depending on the sort of gardener you are.
But I suspect that no gardener ever actually reads a gardening book, at
least to begin with. Browsing is what it is about, whether to dream away the
long winter evenings or decide which runner bean to plant in the spring.
Whether the problem is what to put into terracotta pots or how to design a
new water garden, a single book will rarely do.
Considerations of this sort, at least, must move publishers. Why else, in a
single spring, would you find several more volumes on gardening in
containers to add to those already on the market? Maybe container gardening
has become more fashionable but this spring also sees a number of new or
reprinted books on gardening in the shade and in dry or damp soils, subjects
which have been with us for a very long while.
The most ambitious of these new reference books bears the imprint of the
Royal Horticultural Society. Four titles open what the publishers, Conran
Octopus, bill as a 'new library . . . combining expert advice, inspirational
photographs and practical information . . . for the new and experienced
gardener.' Slimmish volumes of about 130 pages each, the four books cover
shady, flower, glasshouse and container gardening, written respectively by
Jane Taylor, Helen Dillon, John Watkins and Thomasina Tarling. Each costs
Pounds 15.99. Twelve books are promised altogether, with cottage, alpine and
landscape gardening expected next year.
The format of these new volumes is easy to follow with good pictures and
coloured drawings, a good index and in each a succinct list of 'key plants'
and key points to note for each of the seasons. Do not expect particularly
good writing or necessarily happy editing. (One chapter is headed
'Containers for Situations'). But the series should prove a useful addition
to any library shelf.
Plants For Dry Gardens, by Jane Taylor (Francis Lincoln, Pounds 18.99)
nicely complements her volume in the RHS series. Jane Taylor appears again
in a different series with a volume on Climbers and Wallplants for Year
Round Colour, alongside Peter McHoy's Containers and Baskets (Ward Lock
Pounds 14.99). I find these volumes less well produced and more pedestrian
than the RHS series but not so poor as the (admittedly, at Pounds 4.99, much
cheaper) Letts Guide To Garden Design. These hardback volumes (covering
containers again as well as Walls and Screens, The Small Garden and The Herb
and Kitchen Garden) are quite glossily produced. But for me they commit the
unforgiveable crime of failing to identify gardens singled out for praise:
each one of the four volumes carries a - different - photograph of Sybil
Spencer's herb garden at York Gate, near Leeds in Yorkshire, without once
identifying it.
From publisher J M Dent comes the classic Perennial Garden Plants by Graham
Stuart Thomas, first published in 1976 and Alan Mitchell's Gardeners Book of
Trees - the latter not for newcomers since there are very few photographs.
Roy Lancaster's Trees For Your Garden might be better there, though more
expensive at Pounds 16.99 (publisher Aidan Ellis).
For my money however, it is still very hard to beat Hillier's Manual of
Trees and Shrubs - both the longer and the 'picture' version, which started
life as a nurseryman's catalogue.
And so on to more elaborate reference books. One splendid and lavishly
illustrated volume to appear this spring is Headline's Illustrated
Encyclopaedia of Roses, edited by Mary Moody with Peter Harkness as
consultant and rather competitively priced at Pounds 19.99. This shows
however why gardeners so frequently need several volumes on a chosen
subject.
My 'bible' for roses is again a nurseryman's catalogue: and I happen to know
that David Austin's is the correct listing of Blush Noisette, for he and not
the encyclopedia mentions one of that climbing rose's chief asset, its
wonderful clove-like scent. There are several other examples where the two
diverge, not to the new book's credit.
And so to a couple of books which purport to be rather more complete
gardening guides in that both aim to take the gardener through design,
planning and planting of a range of different gardens, from cottage to
classic, and kitchen to container.
Initially, I was not sure what to make of Nigel Colborne's Short Cuts To
Great Gardens, (Conran Octopus Pounds 16.99). Like the 'crusty
professionals' he quotes, after only ten years of strictly amateur gardening
I tend to believe also that there are no real short cuts. But never mind.
The idea that there might be is a challenge in itself and as befits a
well-known television gardener and RHS show judge, his advice is sensible
and easy to follow. This would certainly be a book to have if you were
starting from scratch.
However, I am less keen on the rather pretentiously named Garden Source Book
(Pounds 25 from Mitchell Beazley) which I find less imaginative (and
considerably less tasteful) than another 'bible' of mine, John Brooke's
infinitely adaptable The Small Garden, originally published by Cavendish
House in 1977.
CORRECTION
Letts' Guide to Garden Design: In Bridget Bloom's June 5 review of four
books in the series of Letts' Guide to Garden Design, she castigated the
publishers for failing to identify photographs of gardens singled out for
praise. The publishers have asked us to say that the photographs in the
books are identified in the acknowledgements section at the beginning of
each book, and we apologise for this oversight.

A SECRET meeting was held last night in London between senior executives of
Timex and the national leaders of the AEEU engineering union to discuss how
to resolve the four-month dispute at the company's Dundee plant.
Thursday's unanimous rejection of a peace plan negotiated between the
company and the union shocked both sides and they want to see whether any
further progress is possible.
Privately, union officials are amazed at the derisive way in which the
strikers - most of whom are women - treated the offer. When the officials
arrived in Dundee they were ready to recommend the deal to the workforce,
but the shop stewards refused to accept it.
The shop stewards made clear they would settle only for a return to work for
all 340 strikers without any strings attached, such as the proposed 12-month
wage freeze and cuts in fringe benefits.
The chasm between the strikers and local union officials and the union's
national leadership has never looked wider. The union is concerned that the
strikers are living in an unreal world, buoyed by media publicity.
'The danger is that Timex will turn into a circus,' said one official. On
June 19 a demonstration is planned in Dundee against Timex, which has few
friends left in a city with a strong union tradition.
Hard-left supporters see Timex as a chance to revive their fortunes after
many years of defeat on the industrial scene, and are holding collections
all over the country.
Timex may not have realised the momentum that has built up behind the strike
it precipitated when it sacked the workforce and replaced it. One official
said: 'The women are in no mood for compromise. They feel insulted and they
won't give up.'

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Chrysalis Pounds 104,000 midterm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKING in interest receivable, the Chrysalis Group made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 104,000 in the six months ended February 28 1992.
The depressed market for amusement machines continued to seriously undermine
the trading of MAM Leisure, and results for the full year were likely to be
dominated by that subsidiary.
The directors said there would be continuing operating losses and very
substantial one-off costs associated with the restructuring of that company,
in particular from the write-down expected to stem from the review of the
depreciation policy.
Elsewhere in the group there were 'many encouraging signs' with improved
profit contributions from the music and television divisions.
For the 1991-92 comparative half year the group has complied with FRS 3. The
accounts show a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10.6m, which included an Pounds
11.6m profit on the sale of shares in the Chrysalis record companies.
Turnover in 1992-93 was Pounds 39.2m (Pounds 38m) and operating losses
Pounds 853,000 (Pounds 913,000). Earnings per share were 0.2p (38.9p).

SALOMON Brothers, the US investment bank, said last night that its UK arm
had suffered a Pounds 6.7m loss as a result of a fraud, Robert Peston
writes.
It said it had issued a writ against a clerical employee and had informed
the London Metropolitan police, the Securities and Futures Association,
regulator of the securities industry, and the Bank of England.
Salomon said the fraud had taken place in the past few days, and that none
of its clients had suffered losses. The only part of Salomon for which the
Bank acts as supervisor is its gilt-edged marketmaker, which trades in UK
government bonds and other debt instruments.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Bid for Channel 5 may be revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the world's largest media company, is believed still to be
interested in taking a stake in the proposed national Channel 5 channel.
The company, with Atlanta-based media group Cox, is waiting for publication
of a report on the future of Channel 5 by the Independent Broadcasting
Authority next month.
Time Warner was a member of Channel 5 Holdings, the only consortium to bid
for the franchise last time. The bid was rejected by the ITC in December,
partly because Time Warner was only able to confirm part of its investment.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, had also expressed an interest. But
because of cross-media ownership rules it would have been able to take only
a 5 per cent stake.
The ITC will set out three main options for Channel 5 in next month's
report:
Similar rules to those advertised last time, a channel capable of reaching
about 74 per cent of the UK population.
A narrower option based on separate city television stations.
The development of digital television.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Protest fishermen defy court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN yesterday ignored a court order to leave government fisheries
offices in Plymouth, Devon, which they began occupying earlier in the day.
About 60 fishermen locked themselves in the offices in protest at new fish
conservation laws which limit their days at sea. They said they would remain
until the government suspended and reviewed its Sea Fish Conservation Bill.
An injunction was granted to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
at Plymouth Crown Court yesterday and served on the fishermen by a bailiff.
They greeted his efforts with jeers and ringing bells, and refused to leave.
The ministry said it was up to the court to decide what action to take next.
The fishermen's leader, Plymouth Trawler Owners' Association chairman Mr
Dave Pessel, said they would only leave if implementation of the bill was
delayed 'indefinitely' while a complete review was undertaken.
Mr Pessel said: 'Our jobs and livelihoods are at stake. We are here to
embarrass the ministry.'
Office staff stood helplessly outside as the fishermen crammed into the
building which now bears a banner saying 'Plymouth Fishermen's HQ'.
The fishermen said they expected colleagues from Brixham, Looe, Padstow and
Salcombe to take over the protest in the days to come. The action is the
latest in a series of protests against the bill.
Mr Michael Jack, the junior agriculture minister, said he was disappointed
the fishermen had occupied the offices. He had asked fishermen's
organisations to meet him, and he would listen carefully to what they had to
say.
He said: 'They have made their point and I hope they will allow the office
to get on with its job.'
The region's fishing leaders, who recently gave evidence to a Commons
committee on the issue, have warned that the legislation would lead to
bankruptcies among the region's 2,400-strong fishing fleet. They are taking
legal advice about fighting the issue in the European Court.

Mr George Shiflett, president of Peabody Coal Company, ordered the dismissal
of 163 Union County Kentucky coalminers yesterday after the workers
disrupted a meeting he had called to discuss coal company issues, chanting
that they wanted a new labour contract, Laurie Morse writes from Chicago.
The incident drew loud protests from the United Mine Workers' Union, which
is in the midst of a month-long selective strike against a group of US coal
producers, including Peabody, over job security issues. Peabody, a division
of UK-based Hanson, was selected as a fresh target for the strike last
Wednesday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Transportation Department yesterday dismissed 10 applications by US
airlines to fly new routes between the US and the UK, saying the authorities
sought were not available under the present aviation agreement between the
two countries.
Some route requests stemmed from the requirement that USAir dispose of its
existing US-UK route authorities as part of its tie-up with British Airways.
United Airlines had offered to buy the USAir route authority between
Philadelphia and London if it could move the US end to Chicago and the
London end from Gatwick to Heathrow. Northwest Airlines made a similar offer
for USAir's Baltimore-London authority, seeking to switch the US end to
Detroit.
It had been suggested that, if these proposals were approved by the US and
UK authorities, it could signal a more co-operative approach toward the
liberisation of the skies between the two countries.
Other applications dismissed included Delta's request to fly between New
York and Heathrow, and New York-Manchester.
But the DoT said that it was intent on achieving a 'new, liberal bilateral
understanding with the UK' and that 'this focus on comprehensive reform
necessarily eclipses short-range goals, including the acquisition of rights
to serve a few particular routes'.

US semiconductor manu-facturers and Japanese electronics companies have
expressed new confidence about improved foreign access to the Japanese
market, in a joint statement that could mark a turning point in the
decade-long battle over semiconductor trade.
'The relationship has turned from confrontation to a new phase, which will
stress mutual prosperity and inter-dependence between foreign semiconductor
suppliers and Japanese users,' said Mr Nobuo Kanoi, executive deputy
president of Sony, following a meeting between US and Japanese industry
executives in Tokyo yesterday.
'We welcome the increased co-operation and understanding that has occurred
under the (1991 US-Japan) Semiconductor Arrangement,' Mr Gil Amelio,
president and chief executive of National Semiconductor, replied on behalf
of the US industry group. 'We also appreciate efforts by both sides which
have led to increased foreign market share.'
The US industry will continue to press for 'gradual and steady improvement
in market access', as stated in the 1991 bilateral trade pact which also
established a target of at least 20 per cent foreign market share by the end
of 1992.
Foreign semiconductor producers achieved a market share of more than 20 per
cent for the first time in the final quarter of last year.
No new market share targets were set at this week's meetings in Tokyo. But
US industry officials noted that the 1991 agreement with its 20 per cent
goal remains in effect until 1996 and that US and Japanese governments will
continue to track market share data.
US industry officials hope to see an average 20 per cent market share over
the next 12 months and are increasingly confident this can be achieved.
The Japanese side remains committed to continued improvement in market
access, but not necessarily market share. US executives insist the two are
synonymous because improved market access is meaningless unless it leads to
higher market share.
However, taking a conciliatory tone, Mr Pat Weber, president of the
components division of Texas Instruments, said that he was confident the US
and Japan would 'move beyond' their disagreements over market share goals.
'We will not rely upon it so heavily in future. We will move forward through
co-operation and trust with our Japanese partners and customers.'
Mr Weber said growing technological dependence between semiconductor makers
and the growing number of cases in which US chips have been designed into
newer products should help to support the US share of the Japanese market.
Mr Hadehiko Yoshida, senior executive vice president of Toshiba concurred:
'We need alliances because semiconductors are becoming so diverse, we need
mutual interdependence to develop them.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RACE for the leadership of Canada's ruling Conservative party has
tightened markedly, raising the possibility that the frontrunner, defence
minister Ms Kim Campbell, may be pipped at the post by Mr Jean Charest, the
youthful environment minister.
About 3,800 Conservative delegates will gather in Ottawa next weekend to
choose a successor to Mr Brian Mulroney both as party leader and prime
minister.
Their main concern will be to pick a leader with the best chance of beating
the opposition Liberals in the general election which must be held before
November.
Up to a few weeks ago, Ms Campbell was seen as virtually invincible in the
leadership race.
But several recent opinion polls indicate that 34-year-old Mr Charest would
fare better in the general election.
A poll published yesterday by Angus Reid Associates concluded that only 29
per cent of decided voters would support a Campbell-led Tory party, with 38
per cent favouring the Liberals. With Mr Charest at the helm, however, the
Tories could expect 34 per cent of the votes, only fractionally behind the
Liberals.
The policy positions of the two candidates are difficult to distinguish. But
Ms Campbell's popularity has been hurt by an unrelenting barrage of media
attention, which has portrayed her as a blunt intellectual out of touch with
the 'real' world.
Despite being a Quebecker, Mr Charest has won admirers throughout the
country with an easygoing style and perfect bilingualism. While organisers
in the Campbell camp remain confident their candidate will win the
leadership, they acknowledge that the vote will be closer than initially
expected.
Moody's Investors Services of New York has reduced its rating on Quebec
government and Hydro-Quebec bonds a notch to A1 from Aa3, or the level
ruling in 1986, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Quebec finance minister Gerard Levesque said the downgrade was not justified
in view of the government's commitment to wipe out the budget deficit by
1996-97.

MR Vuk Draskovic, Serbia's most prominent opposition leader, has been
charged in court with seeking to overthrow the state's constitutional order.
The charge, which could lead to a lengthy prison term, was the latest blow
by the regime of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in a crackdown on its
opponents.
Mr Draskovic was arrested earlier this week after leading an anti-government
demonstration in Belgrade and is reported to have been badly beaten. His
lawyers said early today that he had also been charged with assaulting a
police officer. The charges against him carry a penalty of up to 15 years'
jail.
Mr Draskovic was arrested along with his wife and about 20 members of his
Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO). Lawyers said that Mr Draskovic's wife, too,
was charged with attempting to overthrow the state and both would be kept in
custody for at least 30 days.
The Serbian authorities are already seeking a ban on the SPO. The crackdown
on the party follows the ousting of Yugoslav federal president Dobrica Cosic
through a parliamentary vote of no confidence brought by radical Serb
deputies backed by Mr Milosevic's socialists.
In the parliamentary manoeuvring, Mr Milosevic renewed his alliance with
radical nationalists, after their relations had appeared under strain
recently. Mr Vojislav Seselj, head of the Serbian Radical Party, described
the Serbian president as 'a real patriot'.
With the Serbian president asserting his grip on power, the mood in Belgrade
was apprehensive yesterday. New police checkpoints were set up on roads
around the city. For the first time since Mr Milosevic came to power in
1988, the police were an openly intimidating presence. Mr Milosevic is
clearly determined to crack down heavily on any attempt by the opposition to
exploit rising popular discontent over the economic impact of UN sanctions
against Serbia.
Police reinforcements have been brought in from as far as Kosovo in the past
three days, diplomatic sources said. Mr Milosevic has strengthened the
Serbian police force by 20,000 men in the past year, equipping special units
with armoured vehicles and helicopters as well as rocket launchers and other
weaponry.
A year of sanctions has made life in Serbia increasingly uncomfortable,
especially in Belgrade where the effects of large-scale lay-offs, soaring
prices and periodic shortages are most keenly felt.
The opposition has grown weaker since demonstrations last year, led by the
flamboyant Mr Draskovic, demanding an end to the war in Bosnia, forced Mr
Milosevic to call an early election.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Private View: The actor who reclaimed his crown - Robert
Stephens is back at the centre of the English stage. He talks about the
perils of being 'too much yourself'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT IS an actor? Someone who is not a bank manager or a hairdresser. What
else? A man like any other - a bundle of habits and attributes surrounding a
vulnerable self.
When an actor has scaled the heights of his profession, as Robert Stephens
has, the world wants to know what the man inside is like. When he has also
surveyed the depths, it turns him into the hero of his own morality play.
It is easy - too easy - to contrast the public and the private person. On
stage, Stephens has a huge presence and an exuberant confidence that borders
on the reckless. At home he is self-effacing, sweet-natured and trusting in
an almost childlike way.
In company he can be garrulous yet elusive, metaphorically diving into the
dressing-up box to put on another cloak for another character. Or he will
just switch off and drift silently away.
He talks appreciatively and at length about other people, very modestly and
awkwardly about himself. A personal question is likely to be answered with
an anecdote, no detail omitted, in which the full range of his actor's voice
 -melodious, highly-inflected, now drawling, now rushing - is exploited to
divert you.
Stephens, the ladykiller with film star looks, arrived at the Royal Court
theatre in London in the mid-1950s moved to the National Theatre in the
early 1960s and took the town by storm. Before long he was being talked
about as the man to inherit Olivier's crown, both as actor and head of the
company. It led to Olivier rejecting him. Then his marriage to another
rising star, Maggie Smith, failed and Stephens, always one for the high
life, hit the bottle.
His career sagged into minor roles and bit-parts for film and television. He
did not exactly disappear from the theatre - he had seasons at the National
in 1978 and 1983 - but his name faded from the public mind. Then two years
ago the Royal Sheakespeare Company's director Adrian Noble (who as a boy had
seen Stephens' famous performance as Atahualpa in Royal Hunt of the Sun)
asked him to play Falstaff.
The man might have gone astray but the actor was as potent as ever. His
Falstaff won him last year's best actor prize in the Olivier Awards. Two
weeks ago, the critics were back at Stratford to see his King Lear. If some
questioned the interpretation all agreed that Stephens was moving and
magnificent.
Lear resumes on Monday. I went to see the protagonist, who was hobbling
round his London flat suffering the after-effects of an infected foot.
Despite a series of medical mishaps, I found Stephens looking almost
unrecognisably young: at 61, he has become handsome again.
At first he was reluctant to call his recent success a come-back. But he
agreed eventually, saying: 'It's nice to know you can still get up there and
do it.'
After he had described all the factors that had contributed to his absence I
asked him: don't you blame yourself for being out of the picture for so
long?
'Well, I do. Because I think I got lost. I lost my ambition. I lost my . . .
because of the failure of the marriage, because of the ending of my
relationship with Olivier. I felt a bit bereft of many things. And also I
lost my direction.'
I tried to get Stephens to talk about himself. You are very modest aren't
you?
'Yes, very.'
Are you too nice for theatre politics?
'Yes. It is very difficult; I've tried to do it several times. If you're not
careful you can get let down very badly by people.'
A very trusting person?
'Very.' He described a West End venture which had collapsed. He had been
misinformed and badly advised, he said. 'I was naturally shattered by that
experience.'
A deeper blow was the ruction with Olivier, a father figure with whom he had
spent the best eight years of his acting life.
'He was my great symbol, someone I aspired to, not only as an actor, but as
a man, as a friend, as a companion, as someone to be with, to talk to, whose
company was always incredibly engaging, fascinating.
As Olivier's associate director he found he had become a pawn. 'When you
didn't agree with him you got the old cobra eye for about a week. He didn't
like the word No. He was the kind of person who would allow nobody to make
decisions but himself. I was given an office and secretary but I didn't have
anything to do.'
I asked if he was ambitious about acting but not competitive.
'I never have been. I don't understand it.' He added that he was 'very
cross' about stories that he had been jealous of Maggie Smith's success.
'That was completely untrue. I've never felt jealous of an actor or actress.
You can't be them. I was thrilled for any success she had because it was
deserved. She is a genius as a comedienne. You get cross when you see
somebody with no talent become very successful, irritated that they've got
away with it somehow.'
Do you need a lot of supporting as a person or is that true of all actors?
'I think it's very much the kind of person you are. I've always worked my
best in a company atmosphere. I think it's conducive to better work: you get
to know their little ways. Also to work with directors you trust.'
It seemed unfair to ask Stephens now to talk about his famous appetite for
women and drink when he has been living happily with the actress Patricia
Quinn for over 15 years and has stopped boozing.
'Certainly as a young actor I did abuse the drink for a time,' he said. 'I
was very unhappy and going through a bad period. But when I was young all
actors drank. Now there are vintage waters.' He scoffed. 'If you get taken
out by an American producer and order a drink they look at you as if you are
a bit odd. Faddism.'
'What happens, and it's a bad thing because it creeps up on you, is when you
become a habitual drinker. Your system becomes used to it. Then if you're
not very careful, which is what happened to me, it begins to affect your
health.'
What about women? You were very popular with the girls . . .
'I enjoy the company of women, always have done, and that can get you into
trouble. I think when I was married to Maggie - you can't blame people if
things go wrong - I was very much on a high and as the marriage seemed to be
failing you stupidly start playing the field.'
Was it the sex or the admiration . . ?
' . . and adulation. There are men who feel it is necessary to conquer every
woman who steps into their line of vision. But that's a kind of mental
problem - the Don Juan complex. I always despised people who have no respect
for the other person at all.'
Do you fall in love at the drop of a hat?
'Yes. And of course that is extremely dangerous. Any advice I would give to
a young blade is you must always be absolutely sure that you're not going to
hurt anybody.'
Stephens' has reason to feel strongly about rushing into wedlock. His
parents, a working-class couple in Bristol, married, he suspects, only
because his mother was pregnant. His childhood was very unhappy because he
felt, or was made to feel, to blame for his mother's own unhappiness.
He spent a lot of time at the pictures and it was there watching the cowboys
and Indians that the actor was born. 'I thought: Oh, I would like to do
that] I would like to be somebody else.
'It was like the desire to play games, I suppose. That's all acting is
really. It's a grown-up playing cowboys and Indians or gangsters.'
But leading actors are not born every day. What makes them?
'An aspiration to do something, an ambition to play great parts, a certain
daring, a certain courage to believe that you can go on and convince others
you are somebody else. But I think there is a lot of nonsense talked about
it . . . though of course a bank manager can't go on to the stage or screen
and kiss somebody else's wife or shoot somebody.
'I think the great thrill of it is: you stand on the stage before the play
begins and the lights go down in the auditorium - at Stratford there are
1,500 people - and you don't know any of them, where they've come from,
whether they want to be there or not been dragged by their wives, whether
they've just got divorced, whether they have just lost their father - you
know nothing about them.
'When the lights go down on them and the curtain goes up on you you have to
convince them in a split second that for the next two and a half or three
hours they're going to have a jolly good time in your company, that they're
quite safe, that nothing awful's going to happen, and they will go out
feeling a bit better than they felt when they came in.
'In fact it's a sense of power. That's why I think acting on stage is much
more interesting than acting in films.'
It's a perilous profession, I said. Can you imagine having done anything
else?
'No. I mean, I've directed a little, but you have to plan your life so well
. . .'
Outside the theatre, I mean.
He answered without hesitation. 'I would like to either have been a
hairdresser or a dentist.'
Why a hairdresser?
'I suppose because they're so garrulous. Also they have to put on some kind
of performance for all their clients . . . as so do dentists.'
What does an actor do after Lear? Stephens would dearly like to play Uncle
Vanya, or Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman.
I asked him if there was a moral in his story.
'Yes, a man once said to me there is one thing you ought to be, or try to
be, in your life. Try to be circumspect. Don't jump until you're absolutely
sure what you're jumping for. Because of your generosity, your enthusiasm
for things you can jump on the wrong bandwagon or jump with the wrong person
and carry the brunt of the mistake.'
But could you act the way you do if you were circumspect?
Robert Stephens flashed a big smile. 'I think I could be circumspect some of
the time.'

FT  05 JUN 93 / You must remember this . . .: A kiss is just a kiss, says
Lucy Kellaway, unless it's a handshake, hug, or bow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY HOST at a recent dinner party came forward to kiss me. He aimed for my
right cheek; I went for his left. We changed course at the same instant, and
for a while stood shifting our heads from side to side before he landed a
kiss on the edge of my mouth.
A fellow guest, a woman I knew slightly, put out her hand to be shaken just
as I was advancing for a kiss. Two others were introduced: one held his hand
out, one did not. The hostess called out a verbal greeting from the sofa.
We in Britain are suffering a crisis of uncertainty over how to greet each
other. No contact at all? A handshake? A kiss? Two kisses? Which cheek
first? Should you make a smacking noise with your lips as if to parody the
whole act? Should your lips touch their cheek, or should you just bump
jawbones?
Until recently, kissing was confined to lovers, family, the young or to
Europhiles. That is no longer the case: Teresa Gorman and Peter Shore, who
are none of the above, were seen not long ago giving each other a kiss in
the lobby of the House of Commons. It seems anyone can kiss anyone; the
problem is that there are no ground rules.
A good system of greeting should be a) clearly understood by everyone b) in
tune with national characteristics c) relatively quick and simple to operate
and d) stable over time. The British system fails on all counts.
Other countries fare better. Some nations are more kissy than others, but at
least all know how they are supposed to behave. In France the number of
kisses rises as you go down the social scale: the upper classes kiss twice,
the middle classes three times and the working classes four times. Upper
class men will kiss a woman's hand, but not if she is young and unmarried,
and never in a public place. Above all, their lips and the lady's hand must
not meet.
'Kissing is a tribal custom - and you always know what tribe you are in',
says Patrick de Jacquelot, London correspondent for Les Echos. In Italy it
also a tribal thing: male members of the Mafia kiss on both cheeks, other
men do so at their peril. The former prime minister Giulio Andreotti was
allegedly spotted doing just that with a well known Mafioso - a kiss which
is now being counted as evidence against him.
The Germans are compulsive hand-shakers, the Dutch kiss three times as do
the Flemish-speaking Belgians, whereas the French-speaking ones kiss twice.
The problem with these continental systems is that they are too time
consuming, as each member of a group has to exchange the required greeting
with every other member.
The Japanese method is both simpler and quicker: they do not kiss at all,
neither do they touch flesh. The polite greeting is a bow, and even this is
reserved for strangers and superiors.
The US system fails as it changes with fashion. Until recently a firm
handshake was the required greeting everywhere. Lately, the smart set on the
East Coast have started kissing each other, and New York has even developed
the famous 'Manhattan Air Kiss', in which no contact is made lest it
disturbs the make up worn by society women.
In Washington the new greeting is a hug. Since President Clinton hugged Al
Gore at the inauguration and gave an even bigger one to the poet Maya
Angelou, young political hopefuls have been seen wrapping their arms around
each other at the smallest excuse.
In all countries the consequences of a misjudged kiss can be serious. In
Kuwait a peck on the cheek in a public place can land you in prison, and in
the US a man kissing a woman in a business setting could be charged with
sexual harassment. In Britain at the very least it makes for a sticky
beginning or end to a social gathering. Two male colleagues admit to having
absent mindedly kissed the husbands of guests in the general flurry of
kissing that follows a successful party.
So how to avoid such problems? Lesley Kark, chairman of Lucie Clayton, the
finishing school, says that if in doubt on any point of etiquette, you
should ask. However, it is not always practicable to discuss whether you
should kiss someone before doing so, especially as the person you ask may
not know the answer themselves.
The reason the British are making such a meal of kissing is that we are not
tactile people. Let me suggest an alternative way of greeting better suited
on us: look the other person in the eye, smile where appropriate and say
'hello'.
That meets all the criteria: it is clear, quick, does not offend against our
nature, and many people have been doing it for decades. I plan to try, even
if the word gets muffled as someone puts their cheek to my mouth.

FT  05 JUN 93 / As They Say in Europe: Keeping the coolie in a crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG Euro-event of the week came on Tuesday when the Financial Times got
three top editors to put their point of view on 'whither Europe.' There was
Rolf Schmidt-Holtz of Stern, Claude Imbert of the French business magazine
le Point and Kelvin MacKenzie of The Sun. Of the three Schmidt-Holtz was
certainly the most balanced in his formulation of where Europe stood today.
Germans always talk good sense in public.
It was the British and French contributions that struck a nice counterpoint.
On one side was a typical illogical xenophobia, on the other the clear
exposition of national interest and attitudes from Mackenzie who asked key
questions like 'can we trust the Belgians?'
Imbert said he wanted to abandon what he called the absolutism of free
trade. This was the 'doctrine established in our most glorious period of
economic growth, when the coolies of Asia were restricted to pulling
rickshaws; the coolies now sit at computer screens.' He also argued that the
globalisation of commerce 'brutally concentrates the production of rich
countries in the least labour intensive industries.' This destroys small and
medium-sized business, 'submerged by countries which offer their work forces
no social protection and pay them wages 20 or 30 times lower than our
levels.'
Thus imperialism masquerades as social concern. It weeps for sweatshop
coolies in front of their computer screens who work till they drop dead
because they have no pension, but adds that the poor should not be be rich
because they are poor, and they must not be allowed to change that because
if they do it will be at our expense.
'Social provision' is the Euro-mantra of today. Our unemployment benefits
show what a caring society we have and mark us out from the poor. But jobs
too are 'social provision' and the economy which has proved itself least
able to create jobs is that of France. And we are supposed to believe that
is the fault of countries like Malaysia.
Malaysia is an archetypal low-wage poor country, 'doing Europeans out of
jobs.' Unemployment is 0 per cent, well officially anyway. Life expectancy
is 70 years, more than 75 per cent of adults are literate and infant
mortality has been cut by 80 per cent since independence in 1963. These
achievements have been gained not through 'social provision,' but the
efforts of 'coolies behind the screens.'
In the orthodox French view this is terribly wrong: Malaysia's growth has
been based on doing somebody else out of a job. One can, therefore, only
marvel at the way French exports to Malaysia have grown steadily over the
past 10 years. On the other side of this trade account, Malaysia now
controls more than 0.25 per cent of the French import market. It is against
this threat that the trade barriers have to be raised.
Imbert also said that the EC provided a common market that was large enough
to guarantee competition and innovation at its heart. He concluded that the
protective systems of the Common Agricultural Policy should be made
available to other sectors. By mysterious means, I have come upon a fragment
of a conversation between Senator Smoot and Congressman Hawley from 1929
which started with the former's observation, 'I think, my friend, that no
clean cut all-American worker should be diddled and doodled out of his job
by wine-swilling, boozed up Frogs, Krauts and Limeys and their sly furrin'
ways.'
'You are quite right, Senator Smoot. We can produce every blamed thing we
want right here in these United States.'
So the Americans gave us the Smoot-Hawley tariff act and its descendants,
fascism, global poverty and world war.
The underlying assumption of Imbert's view is that crooked employers in poor
countries are grabbing an unfair share of the world market. Yet the total
value of French exports is greater than those of Africa, Latin America and
the Caribbean put together. The French have always been wrong on
international trade policy and even made a mess of it when they thought they
had played an ace in creating the CAP back in the 1950s. They thought the
Treaty of Rome's advantages for German industry were balanced by guaranteed
excess profits for French agriculture.
But as Jim Rollo of the Royal Institute of International Affairs points out,
the CAP saved German agriculture by imposing high prices which ensured its
uncompetitive farms could survive. Low prices would have driven the Germans,
and eventually the British, out of the farm business and given France what
it deserved, the position of food supplier to the Community. But that would
have implied a competitive marketplace which France could not accept even
when it was in its interests.
This week European ministers agreed on more barriers to immigration into
Europe from poor countries. And there was another French demand for barriers
to their exports. Thus we protect Europe's 'high level of social provision'
whose greatest monument is the unemployment giro cheque.

<TEXT>
NATURALLY I was called in to see Kenneth Clarke, Britain's new chancellor of
the exchequer, this week, and a rich experience it proved. Also highly
fattening and superbly entertaining, for the chancellor is a trencherman and
a voluptuary, a man whose talk is spattered with bursts of florid poetry and
football scores and tales from the music halls - a tribune of the people, if
ever I met one.
On one side of his desk stands an enormous walnut sideboard groaning with
concoctions - mainly rustic ales and ciders from Lincolnshire,
Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Herefordshire, Yorkshire, Cornwall, the
highlands and lowlands and off-lying isles.
On the other side of his desk stands another enormous walnut sideboard
bearing tureens of soup and a display of traditional foodstuffs - Glamorgan
sausages, Bradenham ham, wyau Ynys Mon (Anglesey eggs), cucumber ragout,
parsnip and shellfish salad, soft roe tart, jellied eel mousse with
watercress sauce, Bakewell pudding, St Valentine's syllabub.
Help yourself, old chap, said the people's tribune. So I filled my plate
with food such as pudding of capon neck with giblet gravy, and crunched and
munched heartily while the people's tribune vouchsafed to me his feelings
and higher mental processes.
I feigned surprise when the new chancellor declined to discuss what he calls
the 'technicals' - inflation, GDP, sterling, prices, job losses and certain
aspects of Kondratieff cycle theory that I thought might appeal to him - on
the grounds that he has only just got his scuffed suede shoes under the desk
at the Treasury and is not yet ready for full-blooded debate with someone
like me, duplicitous and odious.
The technicals are fine, he said, or will be quite shortly when I have
climbed on top of them, mastered my brief, banged a few heads together and
assured the nation, on primetime TV, that the only problem with Britain is
media scaremongering and misrepresentation, people like you, duplicitous and
odious if superficially charming. Have some more capon neck. Do try the
syllabub.
I said: I thought we were in Queer Street.
Nonsense, guffawed the chancellor. Balderdash and codswallop. You make
things up. You ought to be taking pills. What an imagination. The only
problems Britain has are inside your head. Look at Wednesday's Epsom Derby.
A magnificent national festival. The Queen looking . . . radiant. Ditto the
Queen Mother. A record Pounds 754,300 in prizemoney and a titanic, pulsating
win for Commander In Chief which quickened like a good 'un, a legend in the
making - another feather in the cap of his sire, Dancing Brave, which I
believe I recall you profiled once.
I said: Dancing Brave's in Japan. He was cast out and exported. In any case,
Wednesday's Derby was another national calamity. There was a hot-shot
favourite, Tenby by name, which was backed to odds-on - thanks to the racing
media: what a dozy lot - and finally finished tenth, enriching the bookies
by millions. The amount of money lost by poor people on Tenby, chancellor,
was just another nail in the national coffin.
Get along with you, roared the chancellor. As you've just admitted, the only
reason that Tenby was odds-on favourite was because a lot of stupid racing
hacks who couldn't pick a winner if its name was etched in letters of
flaming gold 1,000ft tall in the sky above Newmarket said he should be
favourite. Let me repeat myself: the only thing wrong with Britain is media
scaremongering and misrepresentation - plus incompetence. Have you tried the
goose? If you open that drawer you'll find a first-rate piece of Stilton.
I said: What about our institutions? From the monarchy and parliament down
they have all been exposed, during the low tide of recession, as the
blackened and rotting piles of a crazily-tilting pier. What is the
government doing about it?
There you go again, beamed the chancellor. You set one hare running and then
you set another in an endless, senseless flip-flop of non sequiturs. Slow
down. Keep calm. We have put the recession behind us. We have sacked Norman
Lamont. John Major is a broken man. I am now in charge. And what I say to
you is - have you tried the woodpigeon with chestnuts and cabbage? A
supremely English dish. Goes particularly well with cider . . .

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HOW TO mark the 40th anniversary of the Queen's coronation on radio but by
reminders of the day itself? Only Radio 2 did so wholeheartedly, first
recalling the events of the day (including the ascent of Everest), then with
music as played in Westminster Abbey precisely 40 years before.
This was followed by presenter Raymond Baxter (can it be his 40th
anniversary too?) remembering some events of 1953. Radio 3, who gave a
lovely concert of madrigals commissioned for the occasion, must have
regretted that the coronation had not been in 1968, which they are still
celebrating.
Anniversaries being in tune, on Sunday Radio 3 began its observance of
Christopher Marlowe's death 400 years ago with two of his shorter plays.
Dido, Queen of Carthage, perhaps written with Nashe, uses the same story
from the Aeneid as Purcell's opera Dido's love for, and betrayal by, Aeneas.
It is thought to be an early play, but uses the poetic skill of the later
works.
This production, directed by Michael Earley and Alan Drury, was very much
cut, not only of lines, but of speeches and whole scenes; and frankly this
was not much loss, for the performance was unexciting. Aeneas (Timothy
Walker), hailing the Carthaginian citizens on his first landing, might have
been asking the way to the library. Sally Dexter's Dido was short of emotion
too, and could not move me even with such lines as 'I'll frame me wings of
wax, like Icarus/And o'er his ships will soar into the sun/That they may
melt, and I fall in his arms.' It sounded too much like a first reading.
Josephine Veasey in Purcell's 'When I am laid in earth', played afterwards,
gave the true feeling.
The Massacre at Paris deals not only with the butchery of the Huguenots on
St. Bartholomew's Day (off-stage) but with sundry murders contrived by the
Duke of Guise in his campaign against the Protestants and hope for the
French crown. (He even put down the French King's professor of logic for
having argued against Aristotle's Organon, but this scene was cut.)
The Radio Times called the play 'savagely comic', and indeed the succession
of assorted deaths is somewhat extravagant; but there is much of Marlowe's
dazzling verse, and Jeremy Blake spoke Guise's splendid lines admirably. The
company, that must take 34 parts besides 'Protestants, soldiers, murderers,
etc.' was mostly the same as in Dido, but the playing was a good deal
better. The same directors were in charge, but the Radio Times has -
significantly? - reversed their names. To hear these two plays at all was a
joy; but we must do better next week with Edward II.
Radio 3 gave enjoyable readings of Graham Greene's short travel pieces, and
Radio 4 had Dirk Bogarde himself reading extracts from the memories of his
childhood in Great Meadow. Addicts can buy a Radio Collection cassette of
the entire set, but I have to say that the kind of youth recalled will
appeal mainly to older listeners. I would like his recollections as a
wartime staff officer - I had his job later when he had moved on. But that
is for the oldies too, I suppose.
Generally it is Radio 1 FM leading the social-improvement campaigns, but for
Do It] this week, designed to stir the nation's volunteers into helpful
action, they just boosted the free information line (0800-500-800 from 9am
to 7pm). More detail on Radio 2 and Radio 5, encouraging listeners to
deliver meals, rattle charity-cans, aid the blind, rescue lost cavers, what
you will - and some of the recorded recipients sounded less than grateful;
but the help-line is what really matters.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: A prophet overlooked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTEMPORARY British music over the past decade has had a prophet without
honour in his own land it has probably been Jonathan Harvey, whose music is
widely admired and performed throughout Europe, yet has remained securely
within the province of the new-music specialists here. All that may be about
to change. Harvey's opera Inquest of Love opens tonight at English National
Opera and his Song Offerings, a cycle of settings of Tagore from 1985, has
been awarded the Britten Prize for Composition worth Pounds 10,000.
Harvey is now 54, half a generation younger than Birtwistle and Maxwell
Davies; he grew up in the wake of the post-war avant garde and was able to
extract what he needed from their music. An early grounding in Schoenbergian
serialism from Hans Keller and Erwin Stein and study for a Cambridge
doctorate was followed by a year at Princeton University absorbing the
structural doctrines of Milton Babbitt; overlaid on this academic progress
was Harvey's discovery in the late 1960s of the music of Stockhausen, about
whom he went on to write an important early study. It all went into the mill
of making Harvey an outward-looking, open-minded and in many ways un-English
composer; he was, for instance, one of the earliest converts to the immense
possibilities of Boulez's IRCAM in Paris, where he has worked on several
works that use electronics and computer-generated material.
What has set him still further apart from most of his contemporaries has
been the intensely wrought religious and philosophical thrust of his music -
broadening out from the theosophy of Rudolf Steiner in the sequence of 1970s
pieces called Inner Light with which he first established his reputation, to
pieces in which he explores a pan-religious concept of consciousness, tying
in elements of Buddhism and Christian thinking. It is this same mixture,
unblinking and intellectually hard-centred, not at all the sentimentalised
spirituality so fashionable in the music of Tavener and Gorecki, that
underpins Inquest of Love.
Harvey regards the new opera as the summation, philosophical and musical, of
all the strands of his development so far. He first sketched ideas for the
work more than 20 years ago; he returned to the idea in the early 1980s when
a libretto was drafted, and that was enough to stimulate David Pountney's
interest in the project. ENO offered a commission and Harvey co-opted the
dramatist David Rudkin to shape and leaven his text. It tells a curious,
timeless story - a wedding ceremony that disintegrates into tragedy and the
eventual resolution of the suffering and its root causes in the after life.
There are echoes in the text of William Blake, W. B. Yeats, Tippett's
Midsummer Marriage and especially, in the second act's journey through the
'higher realm,' of Elgar's Dream of Gerontius. Harvey acknowledges the
oratorio as an important influence. 'As a boy I used to play Gerontius on
the piano; it was the first work that really obsessed me. I was a choirboy
in Worcestershire (at St Michael's College, Tenbury) where Elgar was very
much in the air.'
But a music impulse was the real starting point for the opera. 'Gerontius
speaks of a sound 'like the rushing of the wind', and these are sensations
of which I read much later in Steiner and Yeats. When I look back on my
music I realise how this scheme has been present in so much that I had done
before - Stockhausen was a very important influence, suggesting that his
electronic music offered a new reality, a different world, in an expanded
consciousness. In the world of my opera there is really no distinction
between life here and life after death - death becomes just a little gate to
push open and pass through.
'It is about the idea of life after death and suffering (you could call it
purgatory but I don't like the word), of living through suffering and
forgiving - as one does in life anyway, but probably after death it's much
more immediate and raw. It's being in a pure state of emotion with no
disguise, no hiding; I knew the opera would be a process of trying to
represent this suffering in the context of radiant possibilities. For me
music is about suffering and release; I just can't disconnect life from
music in the way some people can'.
If on one plane Harvey's thinking connects with an peculiarly English vein
of mysticism that stretches back through Hopkins and Blake to Thomas
Traherne, on another his music, with its use of electronics and synthesisers
in the orchestra, is very much late 20th-century in its spirit. Inquest of
Love is that rare contemporary thing: an opera which is going to stand or
fall by its music. The text has potential to be transcended by the invention
or dashed by it; if the former, then Harvey's stature is going to be
immeasurably enhanced.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Winning portraits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BP Portrait Award comes round again, for the 14th time, in as robust and
varied a competition as ever, writes William Packer. Ten thousand pounds,
with a further Pounds 2,000 commission for a portrait for the collection,
were always worth the winning, but the importance of the award goes deeper.
It has brought the discipline of the Portrait back into the currency of
contemporary art, a possibility that even 20 years ago seemed as remote as
the revival of the full-bottomed wig.
The winner this year is Phillip Harris, for his hyper-realist image of two
figures, male and female, nude and grunge respectively, lying on the bed of
a stream. But the strength of the competition is to be measured by the
immediate runner-up, a  3/4 length self portrait in a football jacket by
Christopher Prewett (left), an artist who has been in the offing for the
award a number of times, and could well have won this year with this, the
most confidently and painterly image of the show. The professionalism of the
entry throughout is remarkable; this is a competition that artists
themselves clearly treat with an increasing seriousness with every year it
continues.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Not cricket for culture - Off The Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GENERAL apathy in ministerial and media circles about the political
importance of the arts and heritage was spotlighted by the total absence of
comment or concern about the removal of the chorister Robert Key, number two
minister at the Department of National Heritage, in last week's government
reshuffle. He was replaced by Iain Sproat, best known as editor of a
cricketers Who's Who.
This might be good news for the sports side of the department's activities
but it bodes ill for its cultural brief. The overall lack of any initiative
in the arts world is also reflected in the anodyne investigation by Price
Waterhouse into the future role of the Arts Council, which faces, through
delegation to Regional Arts Boards, the loss of many clients and influence.
In the end no report was forthcoming; just a lot of alternative ideas on
which the Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, can brood.
There was a radical option: to drop 100 of the Arts Council's staff of 154,
saving Pounds 2.5m and leaving the Council little more than an advocate for
the arts. But Brooke made clear yesterday that he did not favour such root
and branch surgery. If he does make a decision - promised by July - it is
likely to be option two, cutting fewer than 40 jobs and saving less than
Pounds 1m.
There will be cosmetic changes - reducing the size of the Council's board
from 20 to 12; defining the role of the Council with both the Department of
National Heritage and the Regional Arts Boards; and getting the Arts Council
to concentrate on its traditional core activity such as funding, assessing
and championing the arts, and leaving well alone research, marketing, policy
analyses and communications. The Arts Council department handing this sector
has expanded to around 30 people in the last two years. This is the obvious
area for money to be saved while the traditional Arts Council carries on as
before.
* * * However gloomy the arts scene in England, a trip to Cardiff provides a
more optimistic picture. In the autumn the biggest arts building project
under way in the UK will be completed - a Pounds 26m extension to the
National Museum of Wales, which increases its display space by a third.
Already paintings that have languished in store for years are being
introduced to the six new art galleries emerging on former courtyard space.
Most welcome will be a decent show at last for the Davies Collection of
French Impressionists. Eight Monets, nine Rodins, three Cezannes and more
will be adequately displayed. Other artists to get a comprehensive airing
for the first time include Augustus and Gwen John, Richard Wilson and Ceri
Richards.
When the future of the National Museum was under investigation in the 1970s
one suggestion was that it should be converted into the much needed opera
house for Wales. Now even this long unravelling saga seems near conclusion.
Few doubt that a Pounds 60m opera house, a decent home for Welsh National
Opera after years of being squeezed at the New Theatre, will arise on the
revitalised Cardiff Bay (the sanitised soubriquet for old Tiger Bay) in time
for the Millennium celebrations. The site is fixed and the architectural
competition for the building should be under way by the summer.
Some of the Lottery-funded Millenium money must go to Wales, and this is the
one project that unites the nation. By doubling the potential audience for
each performance to 2,000 it could even re-pay its cost over a few decades.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Few acts of outrage at Summer Exhibition - Patricia
Morison reviews some of this year's 1,800 exhibits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARTIST bites back in the catalogue to this year's Royal Academy Summer
Exhibition. According to Tom Phillips RA, it is only the critics  - languid,
and blinkered as they are - who fail to perceive the 'defiant
outrageousness' of the Summer Exhibition. The people, on the other hand,
flock to Burlington House to 'assert their democratic right to know what is
going on in the visual arts'.
This year, the People's Show in London's Piccadilly exhibits 1,800 works,
slightly more than before. It is the last Summer Exhibition under the
presidency of Sir Roger de Grey, who retires this autumn. Pace Phillips, the
show is an enjoyable one although, as ever, so much work and so varied is
likely to give anyone a touch of the wilts - not just a critic.
In a year of blood-letting and stuffed fish, it is something to be grateful
for that individual acts of outrage are absent from the RA. Once again, a
hotchpotch of international grandees is found in the first two galleries; a
wall of six glaring Hockneys, also Kiefer, Liechtenstein, Jasper Johns,
Eduardo Chillida, and so on. To my mind, the Summer Exhibition would be none
the worse if it reverted to its old pattern and did without the grandees. A
corner of repose amid the peculiar jumble is created by 'A Crucifixion' and
'The Example - With Acknowledgements' by Robert Medley, next to Ken Howard's
'Muse d'Orsay' and his magical view of the Tuileries Gardens.
Retrospective groups of eight Academicians who have died in the past year
contribute a particular quality to this year's hang. Many visitors will
realise with real sadness that Peter Greenham, Richard Eurich and Sir Robin
Phillipson appear for the last time. Two examples of Phillipson's genius for
the small, colourful pastel drawing should not be missed in the watercolour
gallery.
John Bratby and Elizabeth Frink dominate Gallery III. Together with John
Bellany, they are the most commanding presences in the exhibition. The
Korn/Ferry Award for the Picture of the Year was awarded to Bellany's
'Sunset Song', a group portrait of his family hung in the Central Hall. The
RA's other big prize, the Charles Wollaston Award, was given to Paolozzi for
the bronze 'Road to the Isles'.
Gallery X, mainly sculpture, is a mess and not improved by a fearsome blue
tondo by Gillian Ayres. But then sculpture is rarely shown to advantage at
the Summer Exhibition. Look out for Allen Jones's little fragment of a
female torso which does indeed, as the title suggests, cry out for a caress.
I could see the point of Peter Randall Page's 'Where the Bee Sucks', bought
for the Tate under the Chantrey Bequest. It is best described as an enormous
sheep's dropping carved in stone. William Pye's water-sculpture, 'Plateau',
is a fascinating piece. In a bronze vessel, a broad rim of still water
presents a surface like black lacquer contrasting with limpid stream
coursing at the foot.
For the second year, Peter Blake has filled his gallery with small pictures
crammed frame-to-frame, many of them by naive artists. It is an exercise in
sheer egotism and wretched for exhibitors thus press-ganged into a Blake
creation. In the Small South Room, the cramming of small pictures is equally
bad but is at least hallowed by tradition. Among the works to hold my eye
was 'Towards the Sea', a very small, atmospheric landscape by Nikki Danks,
also Charles Hardaker's keyhole views of the Underground.
Anne Gardener's 'Face Pack' and 'The Convalescent' by Mark Shields stand out
from a number of balefully staring self-portraits. One of the best things in
the show is Stephen Goddard's portrait of an old woman, painterly, poignant,
and immensely skillful.
In contrast, one notices how few large, commissioned portraits there are
compared with a decade ago. The small self-portrait and the 'Portrait of a
Waiting Woman' by Tai-Shan Schierenberg are admirable. As last year, I am
affected by the vulnerability of James Rushton's watercolour heads.
The print selection is terrific. Rothenstein's small screen-print, 'Japanese
Kite', crackles with the same exuberance as his larger ones. In a year short
on the erotic, there is a ripe 'Semele' by Tom Phillips. Norman Ackroyd's
'Scottish Glen' has a transcendental beauty - what a wonderfully gifted
artist Ackroyd is, able so perfectly to capture the spirit of very different
places. Look, too, for John Howard's stark 'Disused Viaduct', Sean Harris's
'Hawksbill Turtle', and from the sculptor Nicola Hicks, a sheet of six
spirited etchings of farmyard animals called 'Old Macdonald'.
Elizabeth Blackadder's fascination with traditional Japan has inspired two
memorable works; 'Shrine, Kyoto' and 'Reflections in a Black Pool.' Among
other RAs who exhibit work on the grand scale, it is a memorably good year
for Anthony Wishaw. At first sight His massive canvas, 'Autumn Spinney'
might appear dour but then reveals its lyrical quality, a season simplified
by the painter's eye into branches, a scatter of red berries and silver
streaks of frost. Sonia Lawson is another RA who can be relied on not to
trot out a well-tried formula. This year, her paintings range from a large
still-life evoking Holland (herring, windmills, tulip-bulbs) to the strongly
symbolist 'Homage to William Blake'.
Although hung high and hard to see, Alfred Whiteley's 'Family Group with
Boer Soldier' is an interesting, enigmatic painting. Peter Layzell's 'Crowds
Around a Fire' has a mysteriously supernatural quality in a year when there
are many small pictures of obscurely menacing figures. I was also much taken
by Brian Nolan's still life, 'Apres Midi', Robert Chandler's subtle 'Blue
Vase' several attractive watercolours by Victoria Crowe, and strong,
uninhibited charcoal landscapes by Tessanna Hoare.

DIARIES by Alan Clark Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 421 pages
Thursday 31 May, 1990
I am getting a marvellous press.
Last week I had lunch, privately, at the FT, and sparkled. A highly
complimentary piece followed on the Saturday - 'one of the most attractive
(Hullo]) as well as one of the cleverest of Mrs Thatcher's Ministers'.
I remember it well. Most of my colleagues had never met a Tory like Alan
Clark before: iconoclastic, but seemingly on the traditional right wing of
the party. The subsequent decision to make him 'Man in the News' in the
Saturday paper was taken at short notice. A call was put in to the Ministry
of Defence who said he was somewhere in Scotland but promised to try to find
him. Clark rang in from an expensive address (I think it was Gleneagles) and
asked if we could call him back because, we would understand, he was quite a
poor man.
Other profiles followed in other papers, including the fashionable accolade
of an interview in Marxism Today. For Clark was then at the height of his
political powers: as minister for defence (procurement), he was assembling a
fundamental defence review for Mrs Thatcher ('never let her hear that term',
said even sympathetic officials). He would have liked to have been defence
secretary himself, but this was the next best thing.
Nothing much came of the review. It was stymied by the defence ministry and
the real secretary of state, Tom King. Shortly afterwards Mrs Thatcher, whom
Clark adored, ceased to be prime minister, and that in effect was the end of
his political career.
The really interesting questions are why he went into politics at all and
why, when he did, he shunted round at such a relatively low level. Clark had
most of the attributes admired by Jane Austen: wealth, intelligence, looks.
Yet, despite sometimes appearing arrogant, he seems ultimately to have
lacked self-confidence.
These Diaries provide only part of an answer. For a lot of the time, he
seems much like any other politician: anxious for promotion, interested in
who's in, who's out, and retailing second-hand gossip. The entry for 5 June,
1983 reads: 'A new Conservative Government. Will I be in it?' On another day
he meets a fairly junior MP, whom he does not like, on a train and picks up
the gossip from him. There is very little here that gives the inside story
of affairs of state.
Again, to anyone who knows Clark, however remotely, there is not much new
about the man. The sexual indiscretions perhaps, for which he makes no
apologies, but these are merely distasteful: for example, the reference to
'the golden summer of 1955 when I was running Anne, Marye and Liz, all of
them living within half a mile of each other'. There is always a vulgar side
to Clark to set off the civilised.
It is the same with money. Half the time he boasts about being rich. 'How
awful to be worried about one's pension]' he says about Patrick Jenkin, who
was sacked from the cabinet. The other half he complains about being poor:
too poor to have servants and scarcely up to the cost of entertaining -
'it's so expensive, with good claret at Pounds 100 - minimum - per bottle'.
And yet there is an endearing side to him. He loves animals and only the
forceful intervention of Mrs Thatcher prevented him from pushing a bill
obliging traders to label furs and skins from beasts that had been caught in
leg-hold traps. He weeps when he kills a heron to protect the fish but - the
contradiction again - confesses that he would have had no remorse about
killing a human intruder.
Some of his judgments are conventional. He admired David Owen as well as Mrs
Thatcher. He shared the distaste of the grey set for letting Michael
Heseltine become party leader. On the other hand, he could not stand his
near namesake, 'that podgy life-insurance-risk', Kenneth Clarke and
preferred the old rough Labour Party style to the new men in suits.
Like most politicians, he believed he had a better feel for the 'politics'
of a subject than anyone else. He also admits to devotion to the 'beloved,
magical electric aura' of the Chamber of the House of Commons. At one stage,
he considered leaving junior office and arguing for Toryism a l'outrance
(his French is good, as he often says), but (convention returns) 'bang would
go the K'. With more self-confidence, he might have done it. Enoch Powell
did.
He contemplates his work to come: 'Tories and the Nation State 1922-74'. At
a meeting in London he was talking about this when my colleague Samuel
Brittan asked, 'What is the nation state?'
'If you don't know what The Nation State is,' said Clark, 'you're decadent.'
Clark is quite decadent himself, but he should write the book.

<TEXT>
THE HIGH FLYER by Nicholas Shakespeare Harvill Pounds 14.99, 382 pages
POMPEY by Jonathan Meades Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 472 pages
SNOWSTOP by Alan Sillitoe HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 263 pages
MANY points of contact between this trio of novels - one cool and
controlled, another exploding with energy and invention, the third merely
going through the motions. The High Flyer offers the elegant craftsmanship,
even if it is finally an unsatisfying novel, a story of the diplomatic life
which sometimes exudes a Graham Greene-like melancholy.
The cover illustration - a detail of a late Renaissance Icarus in freefall -
provides the perfect resonance; Shakespeare's high flyer is a career
diplomat, Thomas Wavery, seemingly bound for ambassadorial success until he
is overwhelmed by the gravitational pull of an extra-marital affair. The
expected posting to the Lisbon embassy fails to materialise, his marriage
disintegrates and Wavery finds himself dispatched as consul to the Spanish
enclave of Abyla on the North African coast, there to serve out his time in
overseeing the completion of a road tunnel across the Gibraltar Straits.
As Wavery is gradually absorbed into life in the colony, the events that
conspired to his fall from grace are revealed; vignettes of local life are
counterpointed sharply against the finally hopeless tale of his love for
Catherine. But Shakespeare's carefully plotted narrative really lacks the
energy to make these parallel tracks converge; in the end the beautifully
textured patchwork of images of life in this disconnected fragment of Europe
merely provides a colourful wrapping to what develops into a terminal
tragedy for Wavery.
Energy is one quality certainly not lacking in Jonathan Meades' sprawling
baroque novel, which parades erudition, obsession and pure prurience on an
all too generous canvas. Pompey's central character - hero is certainly not
the mot juste - is one Guy Vallender, and the interlaced tales of his
exploits and the fruits of his loins are spread across four post-war decades
and countless vividly portrayed settings.
At the centre of this litany of decay and degradation is the city of the
title; Pompey, Portsmouth, is the central metaphor of attraction for its
excursions, irresistibly draws all the characters to their fates, disposes
of its victims. One admires the virtuosity, the creative nerve that has
enabled Meades boldly to go where few writers would dare. There are many
laughs, but not much love in the book and not much to love, save maybe the
fondness for verbal arcana - what, one wonders without a dictionary, is a
'spelaean' navel? - and the verve of someone prepared to present this
baleful vision of the contemporary world exactly as he registers it.
Which, in his own utterly different way, is precisely what Alan Sillitoe
continues to do. The England he mapped out more than 30 years ago in his
first massively successful fictions continues to provide his raw material,
though the territory has sometimes become gentrified in the process. The
latest transect is provided by a country house hotel which collects a motley
assortment of flaky humanity stranded for the night by a blizzard. In
thoroughly melodramatic fashion the enforced encounters provide an
assortment of catharses, none of them very credible. Sillitoe sets up the
clockwork, and just lets it unwind; the reader quickly ceases to care who
does what to whom, and the author gives no indication that he cares either.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Leonardo falls flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST. GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MUSICAL about Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) promises painting by numbers,
but threatens to put the great draftsman in the singing and daubing Rolf
Harris mould. Now at the Strand Theatre, 'Leonardo The Musical: a Portrait
of Love' has arrived, lamentably reworked from its opening at the Old Fire
Station in Oxford last November. This musical is less exciting than watching
Leonardo's paint dry - the show lacks passion, the songs want subtlety and
the issues beg credibility.
The story fixes on the relationship between Leonardo and the Milanese
Francesco Melzi, 'a very handsome boy and much beloved by him,' according to
Giorgio Vasari the art historian. When the Florentine Francesco del Giocondo
commissions a portrait of his wife, Mona Lisa, Leonardo falls in love and
fathers her child. Lisa marries Giocondo in haste, Leonardo repents at
leisure, and Melzi pines like a lost courtier in the blue distance of a
Renaissance fresco. This amounts to 'The Patron, the Wife, her Painter and
his Friend.'
'Leonardo' is a wonderful idea gone astray. The ultimate Renaissance man,
all the unfinished work in Florence and Milan, 'that' painting with her
smile. But a glance at the period shows a fine opportunity squandered.
Leonardo was a contemporary of Il Perugino in Umbria, of Raphael and
Michelangelo at Rome, Bramante in Milan, of Andrea del Sarto and Bartolommeo
in Florence, and of the Bellini family in Venice. He met Machiavelli at
Cesare Borgia's court in 1502. Not one appears in the plot. It has been
written as if the Renaissance was not happening. The plot fails to excite on
its own terms. Leonardo's love of Lisa and his love of painting sit uneasily
together. He did actually have music playing while she posed sometime
between 1500 and 1504. But neither songs nor action dramatise the creative
process or the relations between the principals. The lyrics beggar belief:
'She's a flower on the tree, the very heart and soul of me', Leonardo sings.
The dialogue is a close second; 'My late 'usband, Gawd rest 'is soul' chirps
a cockney Landlady.
Rolf Harris aside, the other antipodean connection is the show's finance
from the people of the guano and phosphate rich South Pacific island of
Nauru. Only the United Arab Emirates has a higher per capita income, and the
island's 8,000 inhabitants are celebrating 25 years of independence. Now
there is an interesting musical waiting within their own eight square miles,
a tale of Australian exploitation, phosphate fortunes, and coral island
romance.

EATING CHILDREN: YOUNG DREAMS AND EARLY NIGHTMARES by Jill Tweedie Viking
Pounds 15.99 314 pages
EATING CHILDREN is the first, startling instalment of Jill Tweedie's
autobiography, written years after she established a reputation as one of
Britain's leading feminists. She suggests that the catalyst for writing it,
though, is not the rise of 'post feminism' but the death of her father,
which left her, to her astonishment, emotionally adrift at the age of 50.
The events of the books are remarkable in themselves. Born in Cairo - and
convinced for years the hospital had handed the wrong baby to her parents -
she grew up determined to be different from them. Her father was an
authoritarian Scot, and her wistful and reproving mother had exchanged an
exotic Turkish upbringing for a respectable and loveless Home Counties
marriage. Early escape meant choosing a Swiss finishing school instead of
university, and then sudden marriage - the first of three - to a bullying
Hungarian count.
But the title points to the deeper theme of the book: the way parents and
children feed off each other, and the way this early relationship distorts
later ones. Terrified as a child that she will be 'sucked in, eaten up' by
her parents 'and would emerge as somebody else entirely', she later finds
herself in 'suffocating panic' at coping with her first baby's demands. When
he dies - in an unexplained cot death - she felt that she was 'the witch who
killed children and ate them'.
In spite of - or perhaps because of - her sensitivity to those
undercurrents, she was blind to the real risks of the relationships; she
dreamt her husband was a vampire, but failed to foresee that he might run
off with their two children. They were returned to her only after years of
court cases.
One of the book's surprises - given what you might expect from a 1970s
feminist - is her guilt about hurting men. The book opens with her fear that
she may have triggered her father's heart attack, and hints that the boy to
whom she was briefly engaged committed suicide when she ignored his letters.
The guilt leads to a paralysing confusion about who is the victim and who
the aggressor. She stays with her violent husband, she says, for fear that
he would kill himself, in spite of the growing fear that he would kill her.
Her anxiety about attracting men is also unexpected, and they are by far the
most prominent characters in the book. But where the women are described in
enormous physical detail - sprigged blouses, fruity perfumes, long legs,
olive skins - the men are more elusive. Her husband is a 'brooding presence'
and she gives a fragmented picture of her father, alternately domineering
and teasing.
She clearly links her claustrophobia in these relationships to her later
feminism, and shows more self-knowledge in doing so than Germaine Greer did
in her book about her search for her father. But the book's strength and
honesty is that it gives a personal not a social explanation of her route to
independence.
Clearly, the women's movement has changed some things that constrained her.
Rubber girdles have gone, and women no longer need a male guarantor to rent
a flat (her father refused to give his signature because she had left her
husband). But the psychological insight she is pursuing has won less support
in Britain than the 1970s gave grounds to expect. Nor, despite the flurry of
interest around the recent failed royal marriages, are there many writers
who acknowledge so clearly how parents shape their children.
That perceptiveness makes the book much more than a historical record. There
are irritations: she almost flaunts her past lack of control, and the tone
is sometimes reminiscent of 'before and after' features on self-help.
Her final casting-off of her parents legacy is also unconvincing: 'For far
too long, I had raised and nourished a hybrid persona which had produced the
odd fruit but at far too high a price. Now, with any luck, the real thing
had been dug in and the roots would hold'. But those are small points, and
simply raise the interest in her next instalments.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Credible rendering of cruelty - Alastair Macaulay
examines the updated Shylock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE VILLAINY you teach me I will execute.' David Calder, the RSC's
outstanding Shylock in David Thacker's new modern-dress Merchant of Venice,
makes this a key line. Yes, he is a Jew, but he only fully enacts
'Jewishness' - donning a skullcap, using florid gestures, enouncing words in
the mask of the face, forsaking his elegant city suit for a dour traditional
gaberdine - when the Christians have insulted him, beguiled him and,
finally, stolen his daughter Jessica. Yes, he becomes cruel, but only
because he has been made so by persistent and unthinking Christian cruelty.
He has been taught by masters.
Dignified, erect, urbane, his voice a heroic high baritone, Calder dominates
the play. For him, Thacker has even reinstated the post-Shakespearean scene
in which Shylock returns home to find Jessica gone: as Irving used to, and
as Verdi's Rigoletto does. Even in the courtroom scene, a sob escapes this
Shylock as he recalls his daughter - but then he recollects himself and, in
full view, his face becomes marble once more.
There are snags in so reasonable and updated a reading of Shylock - the only
obvious reason that Jessica might have for leaving such a father is that she
prefers partying to loud rock music to staying at home with his
piano-quartet CDs - but it is astonishing how potently most of the play
supports this noble reading.
Thacker's Venice, as designed by Shelagh Keegan, is a colourless high-tech
cityscape. Salerio, Solanio &amp; Co. are crass city slickers; Bassanio calls
Graziano on his mobile 'phone; Antonio is a white-haired older gent;
Launcelot Gobbo (with V-neck sweater and coffee mug) is Shylock's office
boy. These people's anti-Semitism is not gross. It is simply casual,
unthinking, shallow prejudice, and all the more credible. Most features of
the updating work with remarkable success, and Christopher Luscombe's mimsy,
prattling Launcelot is a comic triumph.
The Belmont scenes are more artificial. Penny Downie's Portia receives her
suitors in a 'period' full-length gown (and in mourning), and Nerissa's
dress is mock-18th century. Only later do these two fully enter the modern
world. Thacker catches the lovers' comedy of the final act neatly, and
Keegan's designs lend it colour. They do not, however, stop it from being
the usual charming anti-climax. Only Peter Hall's 1989 staging in my
experience has caught this scene's darker emotional pains, its moving belief
in the power of music, and its Renaissance return to rich musical harmony.
When Thacker's Lorenzo (Mark Lewis Jones) talks of 'The man that hath no
music in himself,' he unfortunately indicts Jessica, himself, most of their
chums and Gary Yershon's electronic muzak.
Downie, who five years ago fought a battle royal against Calder as Queen
Margaret to his York in The Plantagenets, is here outclassed. She has
Portia's breeding, her romance, and (interesting contrast) her stillness and
her impulsiveness. Yet these elements do not gel into an authoritative
portrayal. She etches no lines into memory, and her pianissimi are
inaudible. Owen Teale's Bassanio is virile, ardent, personable, and yet he
is too busy with a display of youthful excitability. I could not believe in
any sexual chemistry between them, or between the other two couples. But
these quibbles are petty against the revealing audacity of Thacker's
production, which makes us see Shylock and Venice with new eyes.
In repertory at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Collecting: Fair time for buyers - Antony Thorncroft
previews an exciting season for collectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUNE IS the month when, fleetingly, London reclaims its old position as the
centre of the international art market.
The important general antiques fairs - the splendiferous Grosvenor House
(starting on Wednesday) and the frenzied Olympia (already under way); the
specialist fairs, like those devoted to ceramics (Park Lane Hotel from next
Friday) and antiquarian books (same site from June 23); the special
exhibitions at the big galleries, and the attempt by the auction houses to
put on mouthwatering sales, combine to lure the foreign as well as the
domestic collector to the capital. The fact that Wimbledon, the Derby, and
Ascot also clog the calendar helps. For the very rich, if it's June it must
be London.
For many antique dealers their very future depends upon sales this month.
Like the economy as a whole the revival in business has been tentative, with
few signs of an entrenched recovery. The renewed interest in art and
antiques by some British buyers (and, perhaps more vitally, sellers) has to
be set against concern for the future finances of those Italian, Spanish and
German dealers whose buying trips to the UK have become so crucial in the
last few years.
A still convalescent market ensures that prices this summer are below or at
a rough level with those prevailing a year ago, and most dealers, their
optimism by now severely tested, will be prepared to bargain down. They are
still being hounded by their bank managers. The litany of the past year
continues: this is an excellent time to buy - if you can find decent goods.
For many dealers this is the key sales month. Some of the 370-odd exhibitors
currently cramming Olympia expect to achieve half their annual turnover
during the 11 days.
This Fair, the largest in the land, has been criticised for its overwhelming
size: it is exhausting just to look at the two jam-packed levels, with an
elite gold section upstairs while at ground level the silver section
dealers, now extended to embrace 'antiques' made before 1940 (up until 1960
for jewellery), fight for the wallet of the casual collector with Pounds 100
(or up to Pounds 50,000) to spend.
To make things easier for the anticipated 35,000 plus visitors ESP (Data) is
introducing a search system which allows time-pressed collectors to locate
particular types of antique. If you are only interested in Staffordshire
figures the computer should pinpoint the stands you need visit.
In the good years dealers from Grosvenor House would rush down to Olympia
for antiques to re-stock their depleted stands. Not any more. Even though
there is a special bus service to transport you from one to the other the
gap between the two fairs seems to be increasing.
Olympia embraces every conceivable type of antique and is for the affluent
general collector and foreign dealer: Grosvenor House maintains a bias
towards furniture and is for the seriously rich. A stand here can cost
Pounds 40,000 and there are always a few Pounds 1m-plus objects on offer.
The 90 exhibitors represent the best that the British trade, and
increasingly a few privileged foreign dealers, has to offer. Sales are
naturally important but for many exhibitors meeting old clients and new
contacts and negotiating later back at the shop are just as vital.
It should be an exceptionally good show. The crisis at Lloyd's has forced
some Names to dispose of antiques to meet their liabilities and they have
preferred to off-load discreetly through dealers rather than face the glare
of the salerooms.
Agnews usually has an expensive picture on display and this year it is
Constable's 'The Wheatfield', a re-discovery which is priced at Dollars 6m.
Another Pounds 1m-plus painting is on offer at the stand of New York dealer
Otto Nauman, Jan Steen's 'The Proposal'. Richard Green is always a strong
exhibitor at fairs and has a still life of flowers by Jan Brueghel the Elder
and a Henri Lebasque of women washing in the Seine.
Among the furniture dealers Norman Adams is showing a pair of George IV
writing tables supplied by the Royal cabinet makers Banting, France, to
furnish Ickworth around 1825, while Mallett has a pair of Chippendale period
mahogany bombe commodes.
Anyone whose taste has moved on into the 19th century will find rarities at
the stand of Country Seat, including a Gothic octagonal library table made
by Gillow after a design by Pugin.
This year Grosvenor House is attempting to portray itself as a shopping
place for the common man and although prices may still seem steep the
quality shines forth.
The Ceramics and Antiquarian Book Fairs mainly appeal to connoisseurs, who
are reappearing now that investors have burned their fingers and prices are
falling back to more reasonable levels. The Ceramics Fair in particular is
enhanced by the learned lectures which transform it from a market place into
a scholarly forum.
Undoubtedly the recession has bolstered the position of the dealers. Of
course they have seen their turnover and profits fall but they have the
great virtue of discretion. The well-publicised failure of major items to
sell at auction, and the glare of publicity that such transactions involve,
has sent many vendors back to dealers.
This is especially true in fields such as Old Master paintings where dealers
anyway account for 90 per cent of the buyers in the saleroom. Why not try
and deal direct with the main protagonists?
This is currently obvious on the walls of Agnews in Bond Street where the
176th Summer Exhibition offers Old Masters and British pictures of
comparable if not higher quality to anything available at Sotheby's and
Christie's. There is a major Rubens of the Holy Family with Saint John, an
important Turner view of Walton Bridge, and a charming Gainsborough
portrait. All are priced well into the millions but all have attracted
buying interest, especially from museums.
The important dealer shows in oriental works of art - at the new Oriental
Art Gallery; the old Eskenazi in new premises; and the exhibition at the
Christie's-acquired Spinks are mentioned elsewhere, but other current London
highlights are the Matisse aquatints, etchings and linocuts at the William
Weston Gallery; the Dutch and Flemish Old Masters at Noortman; and a St Ives
show at the Montpelier Studio to coincide with the opening of the new St
Ives Museum on the beach at the Cornish resort.
After some very quiet months Sotheby's moves up a gear in June with some
attractive auctions. Among the Victorian paintings on Tuesday there are four
interpretations of the awakening of physical love by Sir Edward Burne Jones
which could reach Pounds 900,000, plus a Rosetti beauty, 'La Ghirlandata', a
drawing estimated at around Pounds 500,000. A large painting of a bear fight
in the Coliseum which took Alma Tadema two years to paint has a top estimate
of Pounds 1.2m. Another large Alma Tadema recently made a record Dollars 2m
(Pounds 1.2m) in New York so this seems a reasonable forecast.
On Friday 1,200 Japanese prints of the Kabuki theatre collected by the late
Professor Kunhe should clear Pounds 650,000, but the really big money will
be splashed out on June 22 at the major summer Impressionist auction when
the most important oil by Honore Daumier to appear on the market in years
might make Pounds 2m.
Christie's also has an important Alma-Tadema, 'Roses of Heliogabalus', for
sale on Friday. It cost the enormous sum of Pounds 4,000 in 1888 but by 1935
its value had slumped to 460 guineas. Todays market estimate is up to Pounds
900,000.
Another June highlight at Christie's includes the first book printed in
English, 'The Recuyell of the Histories of Troy', which Caxton printed in
Bruges in 1476 and which is forecast at around Pounds 500,000, but the
really important items are reserved for July 6 when a Michelangelo drawing
of the Holy Family on the Flight to Egypt should make Pounds 3m.
However, there is a substantial fly, not to say spider, in this agreeable
ointment. On Monday the new chancellor Kenneth Clarke joins his fellow
finance ministers in Brussels to sign some important documents. One imposes
for the first time VAT of around 4 per cent on imports of antiques into the
UK from non-EC sources. In itself it does not seem too damaging. But the
trade and the auction houses are well aware that once a tax is levied it
will probably be increased, and could quickly sound the death knell of
London's eminence as an art centre.
The auction houses and the main dealers will move their business to
low-taxed Geneva, or New York, or the Far East. The paperwork and the hassle
will deter both buyers and sellers, and the open market which has been the
making of London, and the UK, will be no more.
The trade is united in urging Clarke to stand his ground and to persuade the
rest of Europe to follow the good old British practice of free trade. A good
result here is worth any number of sales at Olympia or Grosvenor House.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Collecting: Jewels from the East - Susan Moore welcomes an
upcoming feast of Oriental art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON TUESDAY, Eskenazi unveils the latest in a long line of spectacular and
scholarly Oriental art exhibitions to celebrate the gallery's move from a
first floor in London's Piccadilly to a five-storey 'Flemish Renaissance'
townhouse off Bond Street, at No. 10 Clifford Street. The acquisition and
refurbishment of the building cost in excess of Pounds 5m and is an
expression of confidence all the more striking given that Eskenazi has no
English clients.
The old premises in Foxglove House afforded no storage space, no room for
parallel exhibitions and inadequate wall space for the extensive library.
The restored 1897 facade of Clifford Street belies an imaginative,
purpose-built interior of some 12,000 sq ft. There are two gallery floors,
divided front and back to offer up to four independent exhibition spaces.
Moveable, free-standing showcases provide maximum flexibility.
A pool of natural light is brought to the heart of a once gloomy, narrow
building by a new atrium. Natural materials have been chosen throughout:
blond sycamore, French limestone, glass. The effect is cool, airy and
meditative.
For the new gallery, Giuseppe Eskenazi envisions more exhibitions (there
have already been 36 in the last decade), including loan shows, and
'symposia or anything which might interest academics'.
For him, the new building is also 'my way of showing my commitment to
London'. When he left Milan to open a London office of the family firm of
Oriental art dealers in 1960, London was the undisputed capital of the art
world. Thirty years on, and thanks to the arguably short-sighted policies of
the auction houses which now move objects around the world to offer them in
their primary markets, it has become just one important centre as Hong Kong
and New York have come to rival it in the Oriental art market. But Eskenazi
believes London still retains the trump card of unrivalled expertise - in
its museums, universities and art trade.
Significantly, Oriental art is one of the few markets in which the auction
houses have failed to wrest the biggest business from the hands of a small
group of top international dealers. Eskenazi may have no English clients,
but it claims the third highest turnover of any London dealers. In 1991-92
that was some Pounds 18.5m, a huge sum in Oriental terms.
Eskenazi's inaugural show is 'Early Chinese Art from Tombs and Temples'
(June 8-July 9). Some 48 works of art, from a Shang bronze of the 12th-11th
century BC to a Song or Jin wood Bodhisattva of the 12th-13th century AD,
have been selected to represent the breadth and quality of the gallery's
holdings. Collectors with deep pockets will be delighted to find that a
number of prize rarities have been extracted from the company collection.
'We are selling things we had no intention of parting with', says Eskenazi.
Notable among the highlights is an unusually large and superbly modelled
recumbent bronze ox of the Eastern Zhou period (4th-3rd century BC), inlaid
with scrolls of silver. A partial inscription states that it belonged to the
state treasury of an unknown king. From the Tang dynasty comes a sumptuous
silver reliquary, a vigorous glazed earthenware horse biting its knee and an
imposing amphora, 68cm high, streaked with a sancai glaze of cream, green
and chestnut. Most examples are half its size.
'Japanese Netsuke from the Carre Collection' also goes on show, June 15-July
9. The 243 pieces reflect the collector's particular fascination with the
folklore of Japan, a subject illustrated so effectively by the netsuke
craftsmen.
Another inaugural show also features a single-owner collection. Swiss dealer
Patrick Syz, formerly of Sarzi-Amade in Bond Street, opens as a private
dealer at No. 94 Eaton Place, London SW1 (tel: 071-235-4572) with an
admirable if highly specialist show. He presents 92 of the finest examples
of Japanese sword fittings, or tsuba, from the collection of the American
Henry D. Rosin, June 10-25. 'It is said to be probably the finest, small,
concise collection outside Japan,' Syz says modestly. Prices Pounds 500 to
Pounds 60,000.
Barry Davies Oriental Art (1 Davies Street, London W1) presents no less than
three shows this month, June 12-25. 'Inro - One Hundred Selected
Masterpieces' draws from a number of well-known collections. Its star turn
is a 'truly spectacular' unrecorded inro (a small, decorative container worn
from the belt) by Shibata Zeshin, probably the greatest 19th century
Japanese lacquer artist. This unusual piece takes the form of a wicker
basket in polished black lacquer which contains three fitted gold lacquer
boxes.
A second show introduces the contemporary Japanese lacquer artist, Unryuan,
whose Togidashi work of different coloured rubbed lacquers is hailed as fine
as anything produced in the 18th century. At Pounds 4,000 to Pounds 60,000,
it is certainly as expensive. Complementing his work is a small display by
the English contemporary netsuke carver, Guy Shaw.
More netsuke are to be found at Sydney L. Moss (51 Brook Street, London W1).
'Zodiac Beasts and Distant Cousins', which shows June 9-July 2, focuses
around a group of 12 wood animals by the Gifu/Nagoya masters, Tomakazu and
Ikkan.
A far wider selection of Oriental and South East Asian wares - including
bronze, ivory, lacquer, cloisonne, pottery and porcelain, glass, soapstone
and textiles - is to be found at The Oriental Art Gallery's summer bonanza,
4 Davies Street, from June 8. Most notable is a group of Ming and Qing
Imperial lacquers.
Spink's Far Eastern show, 5-7 King Street, London SW1, until June 18, for
the first time includes a significant group of Korean ceramics - far more
rare than their Chinese and Japanese counterparts. Outstanding among the
exhibits is an 18th century Choson Dynasty blue and white porcelain brush
pot sparely decorated with a continuous landscape under a full moon. Prices
Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 200,000.
Christie's, meanwhile, exhibits 118 pieces from the collection of Chinese
ceramics amassed by the Hong Kong dealer Robert Chang (until June 15). This
is a gloriously old-fashioned collection of flashy, brilliantly coloured and
finely potted wares which reflect the re-emergence of taste for late Qing
Imperial porcelains in the Hong Kong of the 1970s and 1980s.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Gardening: Chelsea, where small is beautiful - From passion
flowers to plastic rocks and beyond, Robin Lane Fox sums up the lessons of
the show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENOUGH of the millionaires: what do keen gardeners find they have gained
from the Chelsea flower show apart from sore feet? Every year, I use it to
build my yearly collection of catalogues from nurseries. I have never
ordered a plant on the spot but I have noted, questioned and admired. I have
tried to avoid most of the statuary and the outdoor gardens.
This year, my enthusiasms began with passion flowers and ended with
polystyrene rock. Between the passion and the plastic, there was enough to
keep me gardening all year.
The passion flowers were symptomatic of a new development and Chelsea's most
useful effect. Inside the tent, the holders of the National Collection
staged the finest exhibit of this family ever seen in Britain (these
national collections are the new life blood of Chelsea and allow us to raise
our sights by seeing so much more in families where most of us know only two
or three forms).
The credit goes to John Vanderplank at Lampley Road, Kingston Seymour, Avon
BS21 6X5. His glasshouses will receive visitors from Mondays to Saturdays
and his mailing lists of passion flowers range from Pounds 5-10 a plant,
including postage.
To my amazement, he lists more than 140 varieties, ranging from white to
scarlet; even so, he is missing more than half the known passion flowers in
the world.
There are no hardy surprises, but the half-hardy forms deserve close
attention from owners of stylish conservatories or frost-free gardens
abroad. Passion flowers will sometimes make big tangles of leaves or bear
flowers in preposterous shapes and colours, but there are varieties which
Chelsea has propelled high on my list for half-hardy cultivation.
This particular National Collection began in 1985 and is maintained by funds
from the nursery's sales. The collections are the idea of the conservation
movement and now number more than 500 throughout the UK.
Their holders have this increasing ability to change our ideas about
possible choices in well-known families, and the Royal Horticultural Society
is right to give them exhibiting space. In the past three years, my
knowledge of anything from Japanese anemones to mahonias has been deepened
by such collections on show.
At Chelsea, I was pleased to pass from the passion flowers to the erodiums,
those charming relations of the wild geraniums. They are superb plants for
carpets or edgings in dry, stony soils and I have been enjoying their
long-flowering season for more than 30 years. Suddenly, they are becoming
fashionable, although their names and hardiness are still chaotic in the
trade.
The National Collection belongs to a Dr Addyman but the exhibit at Chelsea
was staged by RV Roger of Pickering in North Yorkshire, a fine nursery which
houses the doctor's stock and knows what a cold winter means.
The other great gain at recent Chelseas has been the staging and colour
sense of the smaller nurseries. I cannot imagine why Hopleys was denied a
gold medal in its anniversary year (although I was surprised to hear
comments from the jury that Hopleys' arrangement of colour was not above
criticism). It showed a spectacular pink form of Cestrum elegans which would
excel even a passion flower in a conservatory.
For outdoors, it also had the dark Astrantia Hadspen Blood which has flowers
of such a rich, red colour; but its master stroke was a perfect plant of the
yellow-flowered wild paeony from the Caucasus, the flowers of which drop
within days of opening.
Among other smaller nurseries, I left with my first-ever list from the
Bluebell at Blackfordby, Swadlincote, Derbyshire, which is particularly
strong on good shrubs and trees. It shows and sells the variegated sweet
chestnut for only Pounds 18.95 and also lists a new garrya with wine-cloured
catkins (Pounds 9.95) and the pterostyrax (Pounds 12.95), which is one of my
particular favourites among easy trees with scented flowers.
Without the impetus of Chelsea, these small suppliers would go unnoticed.
Like the collections, the specialist exhibitors help to raise our standards.
For years, I muddled on with ordinary sweet peas and the conventional lupins
which we can all grow from a seed packet. I owe to Chelsea my awareness that
the ordinary varieties are no longer good enough and that the best are in a
different class.
The best sweet peas come from the celebrated Brackley family, from which I
buy young plants directly off the nursery at Wingrave, near Aylesbury,
Buckinghamshire, in mid-spring. Its new white Ann Gregg is a wonderful foil
for the dark shades of Balmoral, proving that new peas can still be sweet
and scented.
The judges agreed on the usual gold medal, as they also agreed over the
Woodfield brothers' lupins. Here, too, their breeding has changed my notion
of the family.
Their varieties are best bought as young plants from the nursery just south
of Stratford-on-Avon and, if you keep off the greenfly, these new hybrids
light up an entire border, out-classing the weary old Russell forms.
Perhaps you would rather have a cave or cliff of monumental rock. I have
coveted one secretly for years, hollowed into a grotto and available with an
optional hermit. The trouble is that transport and siting of huge rocks is
beyond all but the most extravagent pockets, although their boldness could
do wonders for gardens in rock-free towns.
This year, a new age of rock has dawned on me. 'It is better than real - it
is super-real,' says its inventor, Rockscapes, of Mill Lane, Godalming,
Surrey (tel. 0583-426 550). The new trick involves a backing of light
polystyrene faced with a special concrete mix.
Colours and roughness can be varied artfully to match huge pseudo-builders
to a surrounding wall or nearby house. The sham rock is much lighter to
handle and lob into position: it lasts well and will not scratch or
splinter, even when waterfalls or plants are added to it.
At Chelsea, the technique was used to simulate one of the vast historic
gardens of rock laid out by the Pulham family. Elsewhere, Rockscapes has
contrived the effect of 'large-scale picturesque' for an imaginative garden
owner in Hampstead, north London.
The total cost for a romantic landscape of rocky sublimity at the bottom of
the garden would probably not exceed Pounds 2,000, but it would allow a
natural fantasy which would transform the limits of urban life.
It is a brilliant con, perpetrated in the spirit of nature. And as soon as I
can think of a sufficiently awesome fragment of alpine scenery, I will -
thanks to Chelsea - roll the new rock into place and surpass the greatest
rock gardeners of the past.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Gardening: Fruitful inspiration for border browsers - Book /
Bridget Bloom on the latest in reading for gardeners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIDGET BLOOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT DO you expect from a gardening book? Inspiration? Practical advice and
a faultless index? The widest possible selection of plants?
Obviously, the answer must vary depending on the sort of gardener you are.
But I suspect that no gardener ever actually reads a gardening book, at
least to begin with. Browsing is what it is about, whether to dream away the
long winter evenings or decide which runner bean to plant in the spring.
Whether the problem is what to put into terracotta pots or how to design a
new water garden, a single book will rarely do.
Considerations of this sort, at least, must move publishers. Why else, in a
single spring, would you find several more volumes on gardening in
containers to add to those already on the market? Maybe container gardening
has become more fashionable but this spring also sees a number of new or
reprinted books on gardening in the shade and in dry or damp soils, subjects
which have been with us for a very long while.
The most ambitious of these new reference books bears the imprint of the
Royal Horticultural Society. Four titles open what the publishers, Conran
Octopus, bill as a 'new library . . . combining expert advice, inspirational
photographs and practical information . . . for the new and experienced
gardener.' Slimmish volumes of about 130 pages each, the four books cover
shady, flower, glasshouse and container gardening, written respectively by
Jane Taylor, Helen Dillon, John Watkins and Thomasina Tarling. Each costs
Pounds 15.99. Twelve books are promised altogether, with cottage, alpine and
landscape gardening expected next year.
The format of these new volumes is easy to follow with good pictures and
coloured drawings, a good index and in each a succinct list of 'key plants'
and key points to note for each of the seasons. Do not expect particularly
good writing or necessarily happy editing. (One chapter is headed
'Containers for Situations'). But the series should prove a useful addition
to any library shelf.
Plants For Dry Gardens, by Jane Taylor (Francis Lincoln, Pounds 18.99)
nicely complements her volume in the RHS series. Jane Taylor appears again
in a different series with a volume on Climbers and Wallplants for Year
Round Colour, alongside Peter McHoy's Containers and Baskets (Ward Lock
Pounds 14.99). I find these volumes less well produced and more pedestrian
than the RHS series but not so poor as the (admittedly, at Pounds 4.99, much
cheaper) Letts Guide To Garden Design. These hardback volumes (covering
containers again as well as Walls and Screens, The Small Garden and The Herb
and Kitchen Garden) are quite glossily produced. But for me they commit the
unforgiveable crime of failing to identify gardens singled out for praise:
each one of the four volumes carries a - different - photograph of Sybil
Spencer's herb garden at York Gate, near Leeds in Yorkshire, without once
identifying it.
From publisher J M Dent comes the classic Perennial Garden Plants by Graham
Stuart Thomas, first published in 1976 and Alan Mitchell's Gardeners Book of
Trees - the latter not for newcomers since there are very few photographs.
Roy Lancaster's Trees For Your Garden might be better there, though more
expensive at Pounds 16.99 (publisher Aidan Ellis).
For my money however, it is still very hard to beat Hillier's Manual of
Trees and Shrubs - both the longer and the 'picture' version, which started
life as a nurseryman's catalogue.
And so on to more elaborate reference books. One splendid and lavishly
illustrated volume to appear this spring is Headline's Illustrated
Encyclopaedia of Roses, edited by Mary Moody with Peter Harkness as
consultant and rather competitively priced at Pounds 19.99. This shows
however why gardeners so frequently need several volumes on a chosen
subject.
My 'bible' for roses is again a nurseryman's catalogue: and I happen to know
that David Austin's is the correct listing of Blush Noisette, for he and not
the encyclopedia mentions one of that climbing rose's chief asset, its
wonderful clove-like scent. There are several other examples where the two
diverge, not to the new book's credit.
And so to a couple of books which purport to be rather more complete
gardening guides in that both aim to take the gardener through design,
planning and planting of a range of different gardens, from cottage to
classic, and kitchen to container.
Initially, I was not sure what to make of Nigel Colborne's Short Cuts To
Great Gardens, (Conran Octopus Pounds 16.99). Like the 'crusty
professionals' he quotes, after only ten years of strictly amateur gardening
I tend to believe also that there are no real short cuts. But never mind.
The idea that there might be is a challenge in itself and as befits a
well-known television gardener and RHS show judge, his advice is sensible
and easy to follow. This would certainly be a book to have if you were
starting from scratch.
However, I am less keen on the rather pretentiously named Garden Source Book
(Pounds 25 from Mitchell Beazley) which I find less imaginative (and
considerably less tasteful) than another 'bible' of mine, John Brooke's
infinitely adaptable The Small Garden, originally published by Cavendish
House in 1977.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Property: Looking for the good life beyond Chianti-shire -
Italy has many attractions for the second home-buyer. But, says the head
must still rule the heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEATS, Byron and Shelley have a lot to answer for. So do Goethe, Gregorovius
and an army of German, French and Swiss writers, travellers and poets who
elevated the cultural pilgrimage to Italy into a model for enlightenment.
Their writings opened the gates to a flood of foreigners, for whom Italy
represents all that is best in culture, architecture, food or just sun and
society.
While many pass through, some prefer to linger, strengthening their bonds by
buying a piece of Italy they can call their own. Whether just for holidays
or more permanently for retirement, Italy's language, climate and lifestyle
have created a community of expatriates from Trondheim to Torquay, Sydney to
San Francisco.
But owning a second home is often a case of the heart ruling the head. While
the concept may be unquestionable, practicalities and execution can leave
much to be desired. For an unlucky few, a dream can turn into a nightmare.
Take the Zurich businessman so entranced by the Chianti region between
Florence and Sienna that he decided to run his company partly from there.
One beautifully converted farmhouse, swimming pool and manicured garden
later, the property is for sale. Even an autostrada-eating sports car and
the sort of serious money that does not worry about leaving a house
unoccupied have not compensated for a basic misjudgment.
So the first lesson must be: do you really want to buy, or might it be
better to rent? The financial arguments for buying have declined as prices
in popular areas around Sienna or the walled city of Lucca have soared,
making ownership prohibitive for many.
That is certainly the case in Chianti-shire, an area of rolling hills,
vineyards and olive trees renamed for its large expatriate community. Many
who bought delapidated farmhouses for a song during the rural depopulation
of the 1960s and early 1970s have made a killing.
Buying today is much pricier. Among properties currently on the market are
beautifully-restored farmhouses, in grounds and with pools, such as
Monticello (on offer from the UK-based Italian Property Portfolio for just
under Pounds 900,000) or Casalvento (on sale via Lucca-based Villaman for
Pounds 650,000).
While that represents an astronomical leap from 20 years ago, the market has
flattened, if not fallen, under recession in the 1990s. Even in
Chianti-shire, where the stock of property is severely limited by
prohibitive planning laws and Italian buyers are taking up some slack, there
is now a relatively large choice of property against uncommonly weak demand.
Those with more modest budgets must scale down or look further afield. Small
terraced town houses, without gardens, can be had even in Chianti or around
Lucca - almost as expensive - for as little as Pounds 50,000. Bigger places
can be found for about double that, provided the buyer is prepared to stump
up for restoration, which Michael Goodall, an expatriate Brit based in San
Gimignano, calculates at about L1.5m (Pounds 650) per square metre more.
Rising prices in Tuscany led to an upsurge of interest in Umbria in the late
1980s, the region lying south-east and known for attractive towns such as
Perugia and Assisi. Umbrian prices soared as buyers expanded their horizons.
But here too, the market is now flat at best, while the relative cheapness
compared with Tuscany must be measured against greater distances from
northern Europe and less convenient airports.
Although the British have tended to concentrate on Tuscany and Umbria, they
are by no means the only parts of Italy that appeal to foreigners.
The northern lakes such as Como and Maggiore are coming out of the doldrums.
Living on the lakes or the slopes above has always attracted the Germans and
Swiss: Frankfurt to Como is five hours by car, making even long weekends
possible. After being spurned as 'old-fashioned' 10 years ago, lakeside
property has regained popularity among the Italians.
But whatever the effect of local blips in the market, buyers should not be
motivated by making money from a second home. Asking prices are relatively
high; the market is mature; and the days of sharp speculative gains are
probably over.
The rationale should be different. Says Sandy Christie, a British
information technology executive now working in Milan, who bought a house
near Lucca in the early 1970s: 'I'd saved money after working two years in
Iran. The question was, should I buy an E-type Jaguar or something else. I
didn't really know what I was doing and I spent what I thought I could
afford to lose.'
The 'something else' was a farmhouse in four hectares, transformed over the
years into an attractive holiday home with pool. Christie has no regrets
about his investment. 'With the benefit of hindsight, we've probably been
overcharged right down the line. It's all been highly unprofessional, but
it's worked out well.'
Having decided to go ahead, how do you start? For those, such as the
British, used to a relatively standardised property market based on
relatively transparent rules, clear fee structures and marketing-conscious
intermediaries, matters will come as a shock. There are no big estate
agents, and, for property outside the cities, the 'agent' is likely to be a
one-man band with a limited range in a restricted area.
Such fragmentation means vendors seldom give agents sole instructions. That
can save time when it comes to looking, as one agent may know about much of
the property available locally. But it can also lead to confusion - and risk
 -once a choice has been made, as others may be negotiating for the same
house through different intermediaries.
While many agents, notably some of the established expatriates, are
knowledgeable and reliable, some locally-based foreign buyers who have the
language avoid agents altogether. That eliminates commission, which differs
locally but can reach 3 per cent from both sides.
Do-it-yourselfers in Lombardy begin with Secondamano, a five-days-a-week
listings paper, advertising various goods for sale. Other regions have
differently-named equivalents.
More specialised and up-market publications worth consulting are Dove, a
glossy travel monthly and Casa Bella, a decorating and interiors
publication. Some British agents operating out of Italy advertise in the
Sunday Times, the Financial Times or the International Herald Tribune. Brian
A French &amp; Associates, a London-based estate agency specialising in Italy,
even publishes Belle Cose, its own magazine.
Having time on one's side helps. Paul and Luann Erickson, an expatriate
American couple based in Milan, decided to escape the city's pollution and
lack of public spaces when their first child was born. 'After ruling out the
Riviera on cost grounds, we decided to look at the lakes.' Going through
Secondamano led them to a hamlet above Lake Como, where they bought a
semi-detached three-storey house four years ago.
The legal side of property purchasing can be a minefield, with conflicting
ground plans and land claims stretching back years. A concise guide is: find
a local surveyor (geometra) or lawyer to make the necessary searches and
take the trouble to do things properly from the start to avoid difficulties
when it comes to selling. Legal fees and taxes will add 10 to 15 per cent to
the purchase price. The declared contract price sometimes bears little
relation to the actual purchase price, as money often passes under the
counter.
Once the formalities are over, what do people do with their homes when they
are not there? The risks of burglary or accidental damage should not be
exaggerated, but are real nonetheless. 'We recommend installing an alarm,
ideally linked to the local police station,' says Bill Thomson, whose
Chianti Estates Management Company renovates and supervises properties as
well as selling them.
In many cases, buyers will ease the burden of vacant property - and possible
mortgage costs - by renting for part of the year. For the British, rentals
tend to be done either privately through adverts in magazines such as The
Lady, newspapers such as The Guardian, or through UK-based specialists.
Many of the Italy-based expatriates doubling as estate agents also offer
supervisory and rental services. A familiar voice at the end of a phone can
be reassuring for distant owners, even if some of them tend to abuse the
relationship. 'Sometimes, you get called from people at a dinner party on a
portable phone who just want to show off to their friends,' says one
Tuscany-based Brit.
Supervision charges differ sharply. Lucca-based Masterman has an hourly fee
structure, or alternatively negotiates longer-term arrangements. Thomson,
based in Gaiole in Chianti, also prefers to agree a yearly contract covering
regular visits and crisis-management. Contacts: UK: The Italian Property

THE ANATOMY OF THE NUREMBERG TRIALS by Telford Taylor Picador Pounds 25, 703
pages
IT IS unfortunate that this book did not appear earlier. Telford Taylor, a
lawyer and historian whose Munich (1979) remains the most exhaustive
treatment of that fateful conference, was a member of the American
prosecuting team at the Nuremberg trials in 1945-6.
Repetition has dulled the impact of the revelations which shocked the
Nuremberg judges, who viewed the first showing of the concentration camp
films. But such moments of high drama were rare. The actual proceedings were
tedious and repetitive, and Taylor's judicious and measured approach to his
subject further deadens whatever sense of drama might be derived from an
insider's view of what was, after all, an extraordinary occasion. For
Nuremberg broke new legal grounds, and the precedents set in trying 'crimes
against peace' and 'crimes against humanity' were debated fiercely during
the Vietnam war and are pertinent to the conflicts in Kuwait and Yugoslavia.
Taylor is at his best when discussing the background to the trials, and the
in-fighting and personal vendettas among the Allied representatives.
Nuremberg was very much an American show. It was they who wanted the trial.
The British, recalling the fiasco of the post-first world war trials,
favoured summary execution of a selected list of Nazi war criminals.
Twenty-three American lawyers addressed the tribunal, more than twice the
combined British and French legal teams and more than twice the number of
Soviet jurists.
Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson, the American chief counsel for war
crimes, was instrumental in setting the terms of the indictment and
primarily responsible for making the charge of conspiracy to plan and wage
aggressive war the centre of his case. In this rather hostile portrait, only
Jackson's passionate and eloquent statement, the unique and necessary
reminder of the moral dimensions of the trials, compensated for the
justice's administrative incapacities and poor showing as his country's
chief prosecutor. Jackson's bungled cross-examination of the unrepentent
Goering allowed the court's most important defendant ample opportunity to
outwit his interrogator.
Taylor has thought hard about what was done and accomplished at Nuremberg
but is cautious in his judgments. He has reservations about the way the
defendants were selected and, in some instances, sentenced. With most of the
major surviving Nazi leaders in their countrymen's hands, neither Sir
Hartley Shawcross nor Jackson paid sufficient attention to their
better-informed advisers as to who should stand trial.
Taylor underlines the gap between the western and Soviet conceptions of
justice, yet admits it probably had only a limited effect on the verdicts.
It was somewhat ironic that it should have been Soviet prosecutors who,
along with the French, concentrated on 'crimes against humanity' and
insisted on including the Katyn massacres in the indictment as a German war
crime.
It was left to the Soviets to present the evidence of the Nazi persecution
of the Jews and the mass executions in the death camps of Poland. The French
prosecutor made only a passing reference to the Jewish question while the
Americans and British concentrated exclusively on crimes against the peace.
Although troubled by the ex post facto nature of this latter category of
charges, the grounds for convicting 12 of the 24 defendants, Taylor argues
that Nuremberg has established the criminality of initiating aggressive wars
and has provided the legal basis for present and future national and
international action. One wishes that this general question had been
explored more fully. The Nuremberg trials were, above, all, trials of the
defeated by the victors, some of whom were not entirely guiltless of war
crimes in the Nuremberg sense.
One can understand why the Allies should have wanted to bring the Nazi
criminals to justice. It is harder to establish how far these trials
actually advanced international law. Many historians and legal theorists
have judged what was done at Nuremberg in far harsher terms than suggested
here. It is surely not without significance that, in spite of repeated
violations of the Nuremberg principles since 1946, no similar new
international tribunal has been created. Readers deserve a more persuasive
conclusion than Taylor's.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Books: The Sitwell with an inferiority complex - Anthony
Curtis on a candid new biography of Sir Sacheverell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SACHEVERELL SITWELL: SPLENDOURS AND MISERIES by Sarah Bradford
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 486 pages
EDITH SITWELL: COLLECTED POEMS Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 25, 444 pages
ALTHOUGH the Sitwell trio were extremely close in childhood, and remained on
terms of endearment even when they quarrelled as adults, Sir Sacheverell -
he inherited the baronetcy after Osbert's death in 1969 - always suffered
from a sense of being up-staged as a writer by his older brother and sister.
Therefore, it is somewhat ironic that this biography of Sacheverell, based
on family papers not hitherto available, should appear on the same day as a
re-issue of the Collected Poems of his sister Edith.
The last edition of Sacheverell's Collected Poems was in 1936. Does anyone
read any of his poems (he wrote a great many) now? When Philip Larkin came
to compile The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century Verse in 1973, he included
four poems of Edith's, and one of Osbert's, but none by Sacheverell.
Sachie was still at Eton when all three Sitwells sprang to notoriety as
poets. This was in Wheels, an anthology edited by Edith in 1916 and designed
as a counter-attack on Marsh's Georgian Poetry; Sachie's contribution was a
20-line poem in free verse.
During a spell in the army, and an abortive Oxford career at Balliol after
the war, he continued to publish poetry in subsequent editions of Wheels and
brought out a slim volume of verse of his own, The People's Palace, which
was praised by TS Eliot.
Sachie and Osbert were then sharing a London flat in Chelsea and were part
of a post-war arty set that included Harold Acton, Brian Howard, Siegfried
Sassoon, Gerald Berners, Cecil Beaton, Stephen Tennant, Anthony Powell,
Raymond Mortimer, Peter Quennell, Arthur Waley and, from a different
background, William Walton, whom the Sitwells adopted.
It was Edith's poem-sequence 'Facade' that brought this phase to its climax.
Sachie suggested it be set to music by Walton and the first private
performance, with the poems spoken through megaphones, was given in the
brothers' flat on January 24 1922.
A vociferous anti-Sitwell backlash from various quarters - notably those of
Noel Coward, Geoffrey Grigson and FR Leavis - greeted their antics. It was
said the Sitwells' activities belonged to the history not of poetry but of
publicity and it was perfectly true that, by their striking appearance and
love of battle, they kept modern poetry in the public eye well into world
war two.
There was, however, a rift within the symbiotic pattern of the trio's stormy
relations, both among themselves and with their parents, Lady Ida and the
formidable Sir George, that gives this biography its rather sad fascination.
Bradford presents us with all the relevant facts about what resembled a
large, ugly fissure in an otherwise exquisitely homogeneous marble statue.
Her book amplifies greatly the account given by Victoria Glendinning in her
life of Edith and that of John Pearson in Facades, an extended gloss on
Osbert's magisterial volumes of autobiography, Left Hand, Right Hand.
Pearson dealt with the trauma Sachie suffered at Eton during his mother's
trial and imprisonment for financial crime. In Sachie's long life, during
which he would publish volumes of belles-lettres, connoisseurship and travel
writing, there were many more traumas to come.
Being the younger son, he was two sets of heartbeats away from not merely
the title but, more pertinently, the family's Trust money. Sir George
('Ginger') squandered large sums and was cheated by his financial advisers
of lots more. Although extravagant personally, he was always extremely
tight-fisted when requested to disburse any funds to his offspring. This
fiscal constraint occurred again - as far as Sachie was concerned - when
Osbert took over. Bradford, an historian by training - with previous
biographies of Cesare Borgia and Disraeli under her belt - keeps us well
informed of all the intricate Sitwellian financial wheeling and dealing.
Sachie's emotional investments were just as complicated and far-reaching.
The great one was Georgia Doble, a Canadian beauty from Montreal whom he
married in Paris in 1925. 'Ginger' did open the purse strings for once and
bought Weston Hall, Northamptonshire, for the couple; they lived there for
the rest of their lives, interrupted by frequent forays abroad.
But Georgia was never accepted truly by the family, especially not by
Osbert, and the fissure began to widen. In spite of Georgia's many love
affairs after marriage, all enumerated dutifully by Bradford, and Sachie's
similarly intense extra-curricular passions, the marriage lasted until her
death in 1980; the couple remained devoted to each other, more or less.
None of the the trio ever really got over childhood. Memories of golden
summer days at Renishaw inspired all three Sitwells to put nostalgic pen to
paper, as in Edith's celebrated poem, 'Colonel Fantock.' She wrote:
'Dagobert, Peregrine and I were children then . . .'
Peregrine's - Sachie's - most cherished childhood memory of the colonel in
that poem (or rather as he was in real life, Major AB Brockwell, their
tutor) was set down in his autobiographical fantasy All Summer in a Day.
Just as memorable to him were the pierrots that used to perform regularly on
the sands at Scarborough, then in its heyday as a spa. When grown-up, Sachie
became a great authority on Pierrot and the characters of the Italian comedy
from which that character derives. Sachie adopted two of them as his and
Georgia's private emblems. He wrote beautiful passages on those Harlequin
and Columbine figures in porcelain fashioned by such craftsmen as Kandler
and Bustelli.
These drawing-room objects were described in minute detail with the same
infectious lightly-worn erudition he deployed to re-create the towering
splendours of Spanish and German baroque in his best-known books. To his
dozens of devoted friends, Sachie would seem to have exuded both the pathos
and the charm of Harlequin.
For Sitwell fans, and for historians of the morals of the great and the
good, this book is essential reading. Others may experience longueurs.

CRUELTY AND SILENCE: WAR, TYRANNY, UPRISING AND THE ARAB WORLD by Kanan
Makiya Jonathan Cape Pounds 18.99, 240 pages
KANAN Makiya's principal contention is, as he says, very simple: 'The
politics of keeping silent over escalating cruelties inside the Arab world,
cruelties inflicted for the most part by one Arab on another, is principally
responsible for an Arab moral collapse which has today reached epidemic
proportions.'
The silence which he so condemns is that of his fellow Arab intellectuals -
men, he argues, who were flushed out from under their protective stones by
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and forced to show themselves. 'The
whole apparatus of evasion and hiding behind sophisticated veils was laid
bare,' he declares.
Born in Baghdad but educated in the US, Makiya writes from the moral high
ground. His earlier book, produced protectively under the name of Samir
al-Khalil, revealed something of the nature of Saddam's regime but was
little noticed until the invasion of Kuwait.
What the book did reveal was, he says, ignored almost totally by those Arab
writers who sought to locate Iraq's aggression in the wider pan-Arab context
and in terms of the West's continued manipulation of the Middle East for its
own imperial and economic interests. Their attempts to transfer the blame
for Saddam's actions onto the West and the Arab-Israel dispute enraged
Makiya. 'Their relentless wallowing in illusion filled me with anger.'
The reality - first-hand accounts of the brutality of the Ba'athist regime
in Baghdad, particularly towards the Kurds in 1988 and subsequently to the
southern Shia - takes up the first half of the latest book. Much of the
remainder is devoted to denunciations of individual Arab writers, many
living in the West, who are accused of moral bankruptcy and failing through
their silence to aid the Arabs who are 'trapped inside the oppressive
countries of the Middle East.' The author's anger is focused so finely, his
primary targets defined so narrowly, that the wider issues raised by the
book risk being obscured by personal antagonisms.
Governments, almost certainly, bear much greater responsibility. No western
foreign ministry was unware of how Saddam Hussein maintained his grip on
Iraq. The atrocities commited before the invasion of Kuwait were known, if
not their full horror. But in the interests of maintaining a bulwark against
the Islamic revolution in Iran and selling into a profitable market, it was
convenient politically to overlook them. The same considerations apply
today, and not just in the Middle East.
Perhaps there has been a glaring, collective failure of the Arab
intelligentsia as Makiya asserts. But, if so, it is just one element in a
much greater international failure. There is no better example than Burma.
The people there actually voted massively for democracy, but the regime
which denied them so viciously is being allowed to inch its way back into
the international community.
It is a sobering lesson for those Arab populations of the Middle East who,
in their desperation, are being tempted to see radical Islamic factions as
an alternative to politically bankrupt leaderships. Switching the full beam
of the Arab intellectual spotlight on those regimes would help - but only if
there are more powerful people who wish to see what is revealed.

IN THE BEGINNING by John Gribbin Viking Pounds 16.99, 274 pages
ANY SHORTLIST of the world's best popular science writers must include John
Gribbin. His gift lies not just in eloquent and lucid presentation of
complicated ideas, but in writing about them as if they were adventures.
From the first page of one of his tours of the universe the reader is
gripped. He does not disguise the sometimes bizarre character of scientific
theory; rather, he relishes it. And he passes on his enthusiasm to his
readers.
But Gribbin is not just an explainer, he is also an hypothesiser. More than
20 years ago, in an editorial in the science journal Nature, he made a
suggestion which then seemed wildly speculative but which has gained
plausibility. It is that our universe occupies what astrophysicists call a
'black hole.' Now he has elaborated this idea, suggesting that our universe
is a living entity, born from other universes and itself the progenitor of
more. His book gives the background science needed to explain and support
this idea.
According to present theory, the Big Bang happened about 15bn years ago.
Ever since then, the universe has been expanding. Everywhere one looks in
the sky, galaxies are flying away; the further off they are, the faster they
are receding.
Among the puzzles of the Big Bang is this: how, if the universe has expanded
smoothly from its initial fireball, did stars and galaxies form? Inspection
of the Big Bang's left-over traces of radiation in space suggested at first
that all matter in the universe should be spread out evenly. Yet, the
universe is 'lumpy'; visible matter has aggregated into stars and galaxies,
with what seem like vast tracts of space between. How did this happen?
The answer, devised within the past decade, is that visible matter (the
stars and galaxies) represents only 1 per cent of the true mass of the
universe; the rest consists of what physicists call 'dark matter.' This
mysterious stuff was not detected by experiment but is demanded by the
mathematics of cosmology.
One prediction by 'dark matter' theorists was that there should be
irregularities in the universe's faint background radiation left over by the
Big Bang. In April 1992, Cosmic Background Explorer, a satellite launched to
look for traces of the Big Bang, detected these ripples. They explain not
just the lumpiness of visible matter, but also its very existence.
To the COBE discoveries, Gribbin adds ideas from biology. Using the idea
that life is a complex process of self-replication, evolution, and
interaction, he suggests that just as Earth can be considered a single
living system (the 'Gaia' idea), so can a galaxy and even the universe
itself.
Gribbin suggests that our own universe might have been born from a black
hole in a different, earlier universe. Theories about what happened in the
first split seconds after the Big Bang allow that an entire universe can
appear from nothing; a 'quantum fluctuation' in the vacuum can be, as
physicists describe it, 'the ultimate free lunch.' Similarly, the
'singularity' of a black hole can generate a new 'baby universe,' possibly
different from its progenitor and thus evolving beyond it. Perhaps, Gribbin
speculates, a universe containing life, like our own, had to evolve from
many other more primitive forebears.
These speculations are exotic and sound fanciful; that, though, is
characteristic of the frontiers of science. I think Gribbin stretches the
concept of life in directions it does not go happily and makes too much of
some guesses in science. But, in the process of advancing his intriguing
speculations, he recounts a great deal of up-to-date science very readably
indeed.

BLACK HANDS OF BEIJING by George Black and Robin Munro John Wiley Pounds
15.95, 400 pages
QUELLING THE PEOPLE by Timothy Brook Oxford Pounds 17.95, 265 pages
IN 1979, Deng Xiaoping remarked that 'the world did nothing' when Wei
Jingsheng, having demanded democracy in China, was sentenced to 15 years
imprisonment. A decade later, international opinion was again put to the
test as the tanks rolled into Beijing in June 1989 and thousands were
killed, imprisoned and executed. The intellectuals who received the longest
sentences, 13 years each, were Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao.
As students in 1979, they had stood alongside Wei Jingsheng at Democracy
Wall. They condemned his sentence but did not agree with his demands,
calling instead for reform within the Communist party. Later, as a
self-professed elite, they formed a think-tank which proffered advice
throughout Deng Xiaoping's decade of economic reform.
'To win the minds of the people,' they argued, 'the government must first
win the minds of we intellectuals.' Democracy was not part of their plans:
'the people are at too low a level.'
After the massacre in 1989, they were convenient scapegoats for a government
concerned to blame the events on the machinations of a few 'black hands.'
Unlike others, they had not managed to escape following the massacre - and
they were veteran dissidents. But George Black and Robin Munro in their
informative book show that, in spite of Chen and Wang's own sense of
importance, they were peripheral both to the students' occupation of
Tiananmen Square and to the government's response.
Workers, largely shunned by the students who refused them access to the
square proper, played a vital role. After the massacre they received the
harshest treatment and, while most students have now been released, numerous
workers are still trapped within the vast Chinese gulag and prison system.
Perhaps this is because - like Wei Jingsheng in 1979 - they have
consistently had the clearer vision about the lack of legitimacy of their
government.
Students, the future generation of leaders, have largely followed Wang and
Chen in calling for reform rather than the end of the party dictatorship.
Black Hands also follows Han Dongfang, a worker charged with
'counter-revolutionary incitement' but released last year and now in the US.
Unfortunately, the authors fail in their attempt to set up Chen and Wang as
China's Sakharovs and Han as a Lech Walesa: it is the figures on the
periphery of the story who arouse the most interest. Moreover, the book
prompts many unasked questions. Why, in spite of their keen sense of
history, did few of the intellectuals remember Wei Jingsheng? Why did they
believe that Deng - 'the needle wrapped in cotton wool' - would not resort
to violence? Maybe the students were like 'the newborn calf who does not
fear the tiger,' but the older intellectuals' continued faith in Deng needs
exploring.
In Quelling The People, Timothy Brook argues that China's leaders intended
to use force from an early stage in the demonstrations should intimidation
fail. Brook follows the deployment of troops from mid-May before the
declaration of martial law, the first abortive attempt to move soldiers into
Beijing, and the massacre of June 3 and 4 when the army encountered
resistance on its second attempt.
This is an admirably well-researched book, based mainly on interviews and
suitably wary about the evidence - 'no one lies like an eye-witness.' It is
also timely: Brook observes that unremitting propaganda has forced some in
China to accept the government's version of events, notably the low casualty
figures and the argument that the soldiers were provoked.
Dismayingly, this view also has its adherents in the West. The media aided
this propaganda unwittingly by concentrating on the students and on
Tiananmen Square. It is uncertain whether any students were killed in the
square itself on June 4. There is no doubt however, as Brook shows, that
more than 1,000 people - and probably nearer 3,000 - were killed by the army
on the approaches to the square.
Several years after the events, there are still gaps in our knowledge.
Claims in a recent book that the shooting was ordered without the knowledge
of Deng, or that the CIA masterminded the escape route, are not addressed in
these works.
The courage and commitment of Chen Ziming, Wang Juntao and the many others
now spending their fourth year in prison is not in doubt. Whether they have
the charisma to concentrate the chameleon sympathies of the west on the
plight of China is less certain.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Travel: Blasts from the past in old Kazakhstan - Giles
Whittell sneaks into the once-forbidden cosmodrome at Baikonur, and sees
where the Soviets used to test their nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES WHITTELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE WAS the corduroyed Moscow correspondent of a staid London newspaper in
raptures about a Russian rocket blast-off. He looked more like an opera
critic than a space nerd but he had seen Helen Sharman, the British
cosmonaut, go up from 500 metres, which is a lot closer than they let you
get at Cape Canaveral. The flame, billowing out over the Kazakh steppe, had
been apocalyptic. The earth had trembled.
So when my bus rolled into Alma Ata two days before a launch, I asked if I
could go and watch. Intourist wanted Dollars 1,200, excluding travel to the
cosmodrome 1,000 miles away, but could not guarantee permission from
Kazakhstan's foreign ministry. Permission was duly refused and Mrs Intourist
departed alone on a special flight to host a group of German advertising
executives whose cigarette brand was plastered over the communications
satellite being hurled into orbit for a fraction of what NASA charges.
This left a day in which to introduce myself to the authorities. Baikonur,
the cosmodrome, used to be highly secret and run exclusively from Star City,
a bastion of the former Soviet techno-elite in a forest near Moscow. Mission
Control is still there, even further from the launch pad than Houston is
from Florida. And the rockets are still built on very Russian soil at
Samara, on the Volga, from where they are flown in bits to Kazakhstan in the
world's biggest cargo planes. But Kazakhstan now controls the cosmodrome's
territory, and the foreign ministry in Alma Ata occasionally admits
foreigners if they book months ahead and pay a lot of money.
Casual visitors, on the other hand, get the run-around. I visited 11
different offices all over the city. The foreign ministry claimed to know
nothing about Baikonur. A KGB man was polite but bewildered. Eventually,
grudgingly, someone gave me a visa stamp for a place, not marked on any map,
called Leninsk.
This is a 'closed' military city on the Syr Darya river where cosmodrome
staff live. Baikonur is 30 miles to the north (which, to flummox spies, is
300 miles south of the only Baikonur on the map). Both are four hours' drive
across the steppe from the nearest public airport at Kizyl Orda. It felt
perverse but definitely heroic to leave the lush foothills of the Tien Shan,
rising from the edge of Alma Ata, in favour of one of the world's bleakest
voids.
I took a taxi from Kizyl Orda to Leninsk for Dollars 12 and tried to calm
the increasingly twitchy driver as the giant parabolic antennae of the
tracking station came into view. He had lived in Kizyl Orda all his life but
had never been here before. He left me at the entrance to Leninsk, from
where a guard took me to the cosmonauts' hotel. With a mosaic of Yuri
Gagarin in the lobby and chrome models of rockets festooning the bar, this
is the height of Soviet chic. I entered to see Mrs Intourist's jaw, under
her Astrakhan hat, fall gratifyingly open. 'However are you come here?' she
asked, anxiously. I explained how. But dour men in raincoats were already
homing in and talking quietly in Russian; ' . . . bolshoi skandal . . .'
said one.
I was making for the door when a hand fell on my shoulder and steered me to
a large, green sofa. Was I of the 'intelligentsia?' Raincoat was asking not
about my position in the Marxist-Leninist class structure but whether I was
a spy - an unnerving question even for the innocent. 'No,' I said. He seemed
sceptical. My visa had been 'a mistake.' He summoned an army Jeep and told
its driver to put me on the first train back to Alma Ata. Meanwhile, the
German advertising executives had been issued with souvenir jump suits and
were waiting smugly for a special bus to take them to the launch pad. It was
very irksome. Fortunately, my train did not leave for eight hours so, once
the Jeep had disappeared, I was able to set off on foot across the now
benighted steppe towards the cosmodrome.
Parts of Kazakhstan look as serene and beautiful as any wilderness on Earth.
But, environmentally, the country is a disaster area unrivalled even by the
rest of the CIS. It shares with Uzbekistan the territory of the tragically
shrunken Aral sea. It is fringed to the east by some of the world's dirtiest
cities, producing mainly chemical fertilisers for the wheat fields of the
Virgin Lands and heavy metals for atomic bombs and ammunition. In the
north-east, an area the size of Ireland served until two years ago as one of
the world's busiest nuclear test sites. And, in the middle, gigantic rocket
boosters have been crashing to earth and bemusing the nomads ever since
Laika the dog went into orbit in 1957.
Besides leaking unburned chemical fuel over the steppe, the rockets have
been accused of torching the ozone layer and blowing away much-needed rain
clouds with the shock wave that spreads out from the launch pad. Nowhere was
Soviet gigantism so unfettered. Nowhere were the scientists and soldiers
involved prouder of their achievements. Nowhere were the achievements so
awesome.
The guards at the entrance to the cosmodrome had received a telephone call
and were not surprised to see me. But instead of 'phoning Raincoat they
invited me into their hut, produced vodka and said that next time I should
call them direct. I would be their Latvian friend and they would escort me
to a flame-side seat, to the tracking station, to the rocket assembly site,
up the gantry, down the flame pit, out into the desert where the boosters
fell to earth.
Everything was on its head, the duty officer continued. Until a year ago,
come within 100 miles of this place and they would lock you up before you
could ask for a quote. Now, busloads of school children watched every
launch. My mistake had been to walk into the only place where appearances
mattered any more and introduce myself to an assemblage of bored ex-KGB men
hired to give a group of big-spending Germans an exclusive treat.
It was 7.57pm. 'Shall we go outside?' he asked. It was bitterly cold. At
7.59, I was stamping my feet when he pointed and said 'There.' Twenty miles
away, the rocket had cleared the horizon already, followed by a taut, white
flame. It rose fast, curving away from vertical after 10 seconds and
jettisoning stage one in a yellow explosion half a minute later. 'Already in
space,' said the officer. 'Eight kilometres a second.' After another two
minutes we heard a long, angry roar. The hut behind us shook, rattling its
windows. The soldiers looked at me proudly and I hope I was suitably
impressed.
Another strange and desperately extravagant link with space having been
accomplished, silence returned to the steppe and I returned to Alma Ata with
the duty officer's number in my pocket. It is 010-7-33622-27280 and his name
is Sergei. Or surrender your credit card to Intourist Alma Ata
(010-7-3272-330076). Next launch: July 1 1993.
For potential tourists who find the idea of watching space rockets too
trivial or Boys' Own, Kazakhstan is offering something altogether more
grown-up. In 1949, 18,000 square kilometres of steppe in the north-east of
the republic were given over to a nuclear physicist called Kurchatov. Since
then, 465 atom bombs have been exploded there, half of them above ground,
half below. When the test site ('polygon') was busy, it averaged 15 bangs a
year and employed 5,000 hand-picked scientists and engineers. They lived in
a town named after Kurchatov which, like Leninsk, is hard to find on the
map.
For nearly 40 years, the existence of the test site was denied, even though
the people of Semipalatinsk 100 miles away saw the mushroom clouds regularly
and, since underground testing started in 1963, felt the earth shake. But
these terrifying 'natural' phenomena were never mentioned in the media and
hardly ever, apparently, in private conversation. Then came glasnost and, in
1989, a Kazakh-American group called Nevada-Semipalatinsk which campaigned
bravely and successfully for the polygon's closure. Testing stopped in
October 1990 and there is now a permanent Nevada-Semipalatinsk exhibition in
Alma Ata's central state museum.
Semipalatinsk is the remote river port to which Dostoyevsky exiled
Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment. It was once picturesque, and there is
still a poignant scattering of log cabins round the bazaar. But as you leave
town on the Kurchatov road, the emptiness of the steppe feels sudden and
total. The road runs south-west, dead straight, for 2 1/2 hours and is
crossed only by an army barrier on the final approach to the polygon. 'May
peace prevail upon Earth,' says a sign in four languages.
Kurchatov is laid out on a tidy grid and has been indulged in various
places, including the army HQ, with fresh white stucco on pink paint.
General YB Konovalenko has been left under-employed by the closure of the
polygon he used to run, but he sees a future in tourism. He was out when I
called, but his deputy, a grumpy colonel with a Brezhnevesque breastful of
medals, outlined the plan: Kurchatov's hitherto secret army museum will open
to visitors this year. So will the 1949 test site and, possibly, a
mountainous area further south, Emmenthal'd by decades of underground
testing (Emmenthal: pale yellow Swiss cheese with many holes). Visitors are
also invited to catch and eat trout from a lake created in 1963 by a nuclear
explosion at the bottom of a 90-metre concrete shaft. This is an arid zone,
and the project was a joint venture with the Kazakh ministry of irrigation.
Having seen the polygon's health statistics prepared by
Nevada-Semipalatinsk, as well as grotesquely malformed human foetuses in
formaldehyde (which, they believe, were victims of lethal radiation), I did
not fancy the fishing trip. Having given such short notice, the colonel
said, I wasn't getting it, anyway. I was allowed to see only the river
Irtysh, which flows past Kurchatov, and the officers' dachas along its
banks.
My guide, Edil, a generally reluctant Kazakh among imported Russian
technocrats, was relieved. He gave his sanitised commentary as we strolled
among birch trees on the river bank. 'People who worked here during the
nuclear era had no health problems. They were educated people. When local
people had health problems it was usually radio-phobia.'
'Radio-phobia?'
'Perhaps they feel their chair jump. They know there has been a test, so
they are frightened and they get a headache from their fear.'
'But there were dangerous radiation levels.'
'Never above the safe ceiling.'
I produced a Geiger counter borrowed months before in Moscow for just this
moment - and was disappointed. The count was lower than for suburban Alma
Ata. Driving back to Semipalatinsk, into a spine-tingling, blue-black dusk,
Edil said it saddened him that every foreigner who visited his home town
came to see the polygon. Next time, I should visit the birthplace of the
great Kazakh writer Abai, or take a boat trip on the Irtysh, or walk in the
Altai forests. I said I would.
To do any of these - visit the polygon, take a boat trip, visit Abai's
birthplace, what have you - contact the Travel Bureau, Hotel Irtysh, Ulitsa
Abai 97, Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan (tel. Semipalatinsk 44-75-29 or
44-75-31).

FT  05 JUN 93 / Sport: The return of the painted warrior - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST time the Australians visited, in 1989, they began their
annihilation of England's Test teams with a crushing victory at Headingley.
When their batsmen there had reached 525 for six, I found Allan Border,
cheered no doubt by the score, happy to sit and chat about cricket.
Four years later the international game has changed. Or perhaps one should
say continued down its course. Strong, pragmatic defences have been erected
and press conferences are the preferred quarters for the press, which I can
understand. But players with the most spectacular public images, such as the
old painted warrior Merv Hughes and the new leg-spinner Shane Warne, are
stars as well as cricketers, with agents who have negotiated exclusive
interview rights for them with particular papers.
The nearest I have got to Hughes so far this season is watching him play
and, for a change, watching him jog round the Oval last week in a pair of
shorts when bad light stopped play. He was not in the Australian team
playing Surrey and this was a chance for him to get fit. Or at least look
fit; he has started to lose the extra fat he acquired in taverns back home.
Fitness has become an article of faith in Australia, as it has with a
vengeance in England, but at the same time Hughes's image is that of a large
and lumbering terrorist with the ball, a man of beer and power. I doubt if
his real power lies in his fitness or in his speed. Though I am sure his
agent would not like me saying so, I reckon it lies in his steadiness.
He and Craig McDermott make a good, steady, pair to open the Australian
bowling, neither of them on the West Indian level of speed or danger. Hughes
is an example of a player whose public persona has overtaken his play,
though he is experienced enough not just to survive but to profit from that.
At 31 he is nearing the end of his bowling career and is used to pressure,
including pressure from his aggressive image, and if he falters he can
always fall back on fierce antics to go with his zinc-cream war-paint.
England's best response, of course, would be to make him look ordinary, as
Graham Hick did with his mammoth 187 against the Australians at Worcester
last month. For those less blessed with the ability to hit fast bowlers for
six, polite indifference is a good weapon. The English team, imprisoned in
their own sad image, without a true fast bowler to their name, without a
victorious series since 1990, have every reason to remember that images are
only images and neither side has a top class bowling attack.
Much will depend on determination. In a way, Graham Gooch is a good man to
captain England now, while Australia are flushed with confidence, because he
is largely impervious to psycho-suggestion and image propaganda. He does not
look happy or comfortable as captain, but nor is he unduly impressed by
accounts of young Australian wizards, such as the spinning Warne, or of
Border's invincibility, especially as he knows Border from the latter's
Essex summer in 1986. Mark Waugh is another old Essex Australian. Best of
all, Gooch watched Hughes do a spell in the Essex second eleven, his first
step on the way up to being the hairy warrior straight from the outback.
Warne is more of a problem because he is more of a mystery, the Australian
equivalent of England's Phil Tufnell: a difficult, match-winning spinner,
very hit and miss. Warne is everything young and Australian in English eyes
 -a blond surfer-turned-cricketer adored by sunburnt girls. In other words,
at only 23 with little Test experience, he must be vulnerable as well as
threatening.
The Australians are counting on their transfusion of new blood mixing well
with their strong body of experience: Border and vice-captain Mark Taylor,
who is nothing if not enduring, the prolific David Boon, the Waugh twins and
Ian Healy, the neat wicket-keeper.
Hughes, in his new role as the grand old man of Antipodean bowling, gave
great help and comfort to Brendon Julian, the left-arm fast-medium bowler,
not yet 23, in the Texaco game at Lords. Julian offers lethally swinging
yorkers and wides in an assortment unpredictable to everyone, including
himself. At Lords he bowled Alec Stewart an over which included three wides
and three balls struck disdainfully for four. After swigging down tea and
Hughes's advice and changing ends, Julian bowled his second spell: eight
overs, three for 23, including the wickets of Stewart and Hick. He was made
man of the match.
Border looks more tired than Gooch of providing constant encouragement for
his team and makes no secret of the fact that he no longer enjoys Test
cricket because it is too fraught. It certainly is. I doubt if there is much
difference in ability between the two sides, though the selection of Mike
Gatting, a veteran might-have-been, is a step to nowhere in particular and
must have cheered Australian hearts.
English hearts need an enterprising attempt to get going again, especially
as there is nothing to lose. Why not a faster bowler to open the attack,
such as Surrey's Martin Bicknell (24) and a young, fine, left-handed
batsman, such as Graham Thorpe (nearly 24), who can also break up
partnerships with his occasional bowling and is a dynamic fielder?
Every team has its own focal point and I think the best one for this
uncertain and undistinguished English team is the one that indicates team
morale most clearly and has weakened most sadly since the good 1991 series
against the West Indies: fielding. The Australian fielding on this tour has
been noticeably good.
The pivotal point of fielding is wicket-keeping, which can transform a game
by plucking a wicket out of nowhere. A brilliant keeper, like Alan Knott,
England's magical 'Mr Punch' of the 1970s, generates optimism. There is none
of the slip / keeper confusion often caused by Stewart doing his best, but
not the best available, behind the stumps. Spinners toss the ball up, hungry
for snicks and stumpings. Bowlers such as Andrew Caddick who strive to find
an edge go from strength to strength. Fielders such as Chris Lewis risk
their sizzling throws for run-outs and the fielding side recovers the spirit
so vital to a winning performance.
It would be quite a feat to further weaken England's middle order, which is
a grim decline from the days when a batsman such as Basil D'Oliveira coming
in at number six could swing a match. I do not believe a proper
wicket-keeper would do England's unreliable five, six or seven positions any
harm. Last time Australia were in England, Jack Russell was second in the
English batting averages and has worked hard on his batting since then. He
is cheerful. He would be an asset.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Sport: Mary Joe finally has it taped - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 3 PM on Thursday in Paris Steffi Graf regained the No. 1 world ranking
from Monica Seles. Regrettable as it may seem, by beating Anke Huber 6-1 6-1
in the semi-finals of the 1993 French Open, Graf fulfilled the objective of
her demented fan Gunther Parche who stabbed Seles in Hamburg on April 30.
Graf is as upset by the ramifications of this as everyone else and did not
want to discuss the matter. 'I really don't care about the number one
ranking. I'm in the final in France and that is what counts to me,' she
said.
This afternoon 23-year-old Graf will face a new challenger for the title she
has held twice before. In the second of Thursday's semi-finals the
21-year-old American, Mary Joe Fernandez, seeded five, upset the form book
for the second time this week by inflicting a 6-2 6-2 beating on Spain's No
2 seed, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.
Coming on top of her courageous comeback from 1-6 1-5 against the No 3 seed
Gabriela Sabatini in the quarter-finals - a marvellous match in which
Fernandez saved five match points and eventually won on her fifth after
three hours and 36 minutes of energy-sapping effort - this was a commendable
victory for the 21-year-old Floridian. The Spaniard held a 6-1 lifetime lead
against her, but you would never have guessed it. Sanchez was the one who
was nervous - perhaps because she has been putting pressure on herself by
telling everyone what a great player she is. After failing to cope with the
clever changes of pace from a thoughtful opponent, Arantxa's uppance had
come with a vengeance.
On the face of it today's final, worth Pounds 337,500 to the winner, will
result in another easy win for Graf who has won 11 Grand Slam singles
titles, including a Grand Slam in 1988. In the 10 previous meetings between
them Fernandez won only one set. But that was in the most recent of those
matches just three weeks ago in Berlin. That afternoon at the Rot-Weiss Club
Fernandez won a 10-game opening set and then led 4-2 in the second before
losing it 6-4. She broke serve twice to build a 3-0 lead in the decider,
too, before losing the last six games.
Graf remembers that occasion. 'Yes, it was a really long, tough match. And
against Sabatini here she was going a lot for the lines and doing it very
well . . . she really stepped into the ball. At the moment she shows a lot
of confidence . . . she's definitely improved in the last half year. The key
this time will probably be my patience and to come in at the right moments.'
Patience is an elusive quality on the slow, red clay. The temptation to go
for winners too soon has destroyed many fine players. But after two years of
uncertainty Graf has looked admirably composed again here and, except for
the odd patch of waywardness on her match-winning forehand, seems to be back
to her best. After all, she has yet to lose a set and has dropped only 33
games in six matches, an average of 2.75 per set.
And yet . . . and yet . . . Even the hottest favourites sometimes lose - and
I apologise to those of you who backed Tenby on Wednesday for reopening so
recent a wound.
Harold Solomon is one who thinks that it may happen this afternoon. But,
then, you would expect him to because Harold has been coaching Mary Joe for
the past year and a half. He has done a fine job too, helping her to build
her physique with regular gym sessions and track work when she has not been
competing. Moreover - and this amuses me no end - Harold, has been teaching
Mary Joe to volley.
Harold was one of life's great baseline workhorses who could never have
found the net even with a qualified guide and an armed guard. But he has
improved that aspect of Mary Joe's game. Her unexpected volleying coups were
partly responsible for her crushing victory over Sanchez. She smashed well,
too, and even appeared to enjoy being in the forecourt. You could never have
accused her of that during the Australian Open in January.
'I've seen a tremendous change in her these two weeks,' claims Harold. 'When
we started working together I told her I thought it would take three years
for her to overtake the top three and win a Grand Slam. I have just revised
that view. I believe she's ready now.
'Clay has never been her favourite surface but suddenly she is attacking on
it. The match against Sabatini was responsible for that. She was so far out
of it that the only thing left was to have a swing. She's been banging that
forehand ever since.
'We've watched that match several times on tape and it has transformed her
belief. She has suddenly realised that she can beat any of the girls and
that is what no-one can teach you. It has to come from within.' How true. I
hope that yesterday Harold had the sense to sit Fernandez down beside the TV
set to watch the replay of her win against Sanchez-Vicario. That would have
reinforced belief marvellously.
I hope Steffi was also wise enough to watch that tape to see just what she
will be up against this afternoon. If she did she will know that only her
best will be good enough. For the world No. 1 that should be no problem. And
yet . . .

FT  05 JUN 93 / Motoring: Mercedes jazzes up its act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE AN ageing entertainer in search of a new audience, Mercedes-Benz is
changing its act.
For at least 50 years, its cars have been a byword for quality. I would
settle for one as my personal car in preference to any other - if only I
could afford to. The company's solid conservatism is rooted in the best
engineering practice. Mercedes shrug off very high mileages while continuing
to perform like new cars. There is a strong 'feel good' factor when you
drive behind the three-pointed star. At least, there is for me. Bernard Shaw
hit the nail on the head when he said that youth was a wonderful thing and
far too good to be wasted on young people, but let that pass. Car makers
have to live in the real world.
While Mercedes-Benz is happy to have a large and loyal band of mature
customers it knows it must attract younger buyers, not just their parents
and employers.
The car it hopes will do the trick is the new C-Class, successor to the
small - the term is relative - Mercedes-Benz 190 of which more than 2m have
been sold in the last ten years.
C-Class is a little longer than the 190, considerably roomier within and
sleeker without. For at least two years it will be offered only as a 4-door
saloon, though an educated guess suggests estate cars and 2-door coupes will
follow by 1996.
There are seven four-valves-per-cylinder engines. Three of the petrol
engines (1.8, 2.0 and 2.2-litre) and two diesels (2.0 and 2.1 litre) have
four cylinders. There is a 2.5-litre, five-cylinder diesel and the flagship
C-Class models have a 2.8-litre in-line six-cylinder petrol engine.
Mercedes-Benz contemplated following the herd and giving its new compact car
front wheel drive. But it decided the space-saving advantages were not great
enough to justify this break with tradition. When, as seems probable, it
launches a VW Golf-sized car later in the decade, this will be front-wheel
driven.
There is nothing radical about the design of the C-Class; it is an extension
of the philosophy that has served Mercedes-Benz so well. True, the front
suspension is new and the 16-valve and 20-valve diesels are the first of
their kind. The important changes are marketing, not engineering, led.
The styling is smoother, more rounded and, except from the front, less
typically Mercedes-Benz. In a bid to broaden the customer base, four
distinct versions of every C-Class car are being offered; standard, Esprit,
Elegance and Sport.
Standard models have plain, understated interiors. I found the two-tone trim
of some Esprit and Sport models rather brash but Mercedes-Benz believes
young buyers will approve. The smartest Elegance versions will appeal to
owners of the larger 200-320 Mercedes-Benz (now to be called E-Class)
wishing to trade down to a smaller car. Even the standard models come with a
driver airbag, ABS brakes and power steering.
Last week, in the sweltering Swabian Alps, I sampled four of the new cars -
a C 180 petrol and C 220 diesel with five-speed manual gears, a C 250 diesel
and C 280 with the optional four-speed automatic.
The billiard-table roads were no test of the suspension's ability to make
the rough feel smooth. But their sharp gradients and serpentine curves
showed handling and roadholding to be even better than the 190's  -
particularly so in the case of the nose-heavy five-cylinder diesel and
six-cylinder petrol versions.
The C 180 ran sweetly at 190 kmh (118 mph) on the autobahn, pulled hard in
fifth gear from under 50 kmh (31 mph) and seemed to enjoy hard driving on
switchback roads as much as I did.
Lacking turbochargers, the four-valve diesels felt urbane rather than urgent
though they cruised at high speed on the autobahn as quietly and
effortlessly as the petrol-engined cars. (I have to say that for sheer
performance combined with refinement, the six-cylinder BMW 325td and 525td
are ahead of the executive-class diesel pack).
The C 280 automatic felt as secure as a majestic Mercedes-Benz S-Class when
I drove it through a downpour on the autobahn. A ride in the back confirmed
the C-Class really is more rear-passenger friendly than the 190.
When left-hand drive C-Class cars go on sale in two weeks, they will cost
about the same as the 190s they replace. Right-hand drive prices will not be
known until the British launch this autumn. Mercedes-Benz UK will be
juggling with a strong D-mark in one hand and next year's list price-based
company car tax bands in the other.
It knows that if the C-Class is to seduce younger drivers away from their
BMWs and Audis, the prices cannot be too far out of line.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Despatches: The case of the discourteous cockroach -
Singapore / Kieran Cooke discovers an intruder in a society where everyone
observes the litter of the law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM SITTING in an old corner coffee shop in Singapore. A cockroach has just
walked past my chair. I almost fall to the floor in shock. Singapore is
possibly the cleanest place on earth; there is not even any bird muck about.
Every car looks sparklingly new. Cockroaches mean dirt - and dirt is not
allowed in Singapore. That cockroach must be punished.
There are societies where rules are flouted. People cross roads on red
lights, sit on lawns beside 'Do not walk on the grass' signs or insist,
quirkily, on the right to light up giant stogies in no smoking areas. Then
there are societies like Singapore, where rules are meant to be obeyed
strictly. None more so than the cleanliness laws.
The Singapore authorities wage a relentless campaign against dirt creators.
People can be fined up to SDollars 1,000 (Pounds 420) for not flushing
public toilets. Smoke in an indoor public place or give a careless spit and
bang goes another hefty wad of dollars. Carry chewing gum into the country
at your peril. Since last year, the evil stuff has been banned. It is dirty
and has been known to mess up the operation of the doors on Singapore's
pristine underground system.
The authorities go to considerable lengths to catch litterbugs. Recently,
closed-circuit TV cameras were installed at a housing estate to try to catch
people throwing rubbish out of windows. Being caught discarding a sweet
wrapper or cigarette packet risks not only a fine but public humiliation as
well. Recently, the government cornered 10 litter louts and the media was
called in. These social deviants were lined up for punishment, forced to
wear neon-green 'Corrective Work Order' vests and set to work picking up
rubbish. For an hour, they were paraded before jeering onlookers and
television crews. There were front-page pictures in the newspapers.
Some have said the government is going too far in its anti-litter campaign:
one MP drew a parallel with the activities of the Red Guards during China's
cultural revolution of the late 1960 when alleged counter-revolutionariees
were subjected to similar public humiliation. But most Singaporeans have
come to accept the finger-wagging ways of their government. In any case,
most are campaign drunk, anyway.
Scarcely a month goes by without a new campaign being launched. There is the
anti-smoking campaign (with the papers carrying a daily picture of a healthy
non-smoker), the anti-road bully campaign, the speak Mandarin campaign. Then
there was a birth control campaign for families to 'stop at two.' Now, faced
with a rapidly-ageing population, the government is changing tack. Educated
women, especially, are being encouraged to have more children.
The government is waging a campaign to make people more entrepreneurial.
There are even suggestions of a campaign to make Singaporeans more
spontaneous. Meanwhile, a courtesy campaign has been going on for 15 years.
This year, the government - under the auspices of the recently formed
Courtesy Council - has decided to spread its campaigning wings and the
target is 'ugly Singaporeans' misbehaving abroad. The local newspapers have
been full of stories about such people.
Apparently, Singaporeans have a vacuum cleaner approach to buffet meals,
piling up their plates and shovelling excess food into carrier bags. They
use calculators when looking at menus. They grab any free gift going, steal
hotel towels and are constantly on the look-out for free lavatories. They
take pictures when not allowed.
These anti-social traits are by no means exclusive to Singaporeans; many
people from other countries have similar, or even nastier, habits. But
Singapore's motto is: never let a chance for another campaign go by. Come
July 1, the foreign minister is due to fire the first shots against the ugly
Singaporean abroad. Tourists, business people and students will all be under
scrutiny. A search is on for the politest Singaporeans overseas - the
so-called 'courtesy ambassadors.'
An official involved in the campaign says one effect will be to make
Singaporeans overseas feel wanted. 'It will boost their morale, as many feel
neglected and left out of what happens in Singapore.' But my cockroach does
not look neglected. It is looking fat and content as it strolls around in
the dirt. Probably a smoker and gum-chewer to boot. Never flushes toilets.
Must be a visitor from overseas.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Fishing: Days of joy before the fouling of Eden - Tom Fort
reflects on the pleasures of his favourite river - since stricken by an
ecological disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NOT THAT long ago
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a lifetime or so - most of England was blessed with true trout rivers, by
which I mean rivers with self-sustaining stocks of native brown trout. But
our age, characterised by neglect and abuse, has seen the destruction of
much of this legacy. Pollution, abstraction, and unthinking exploitation has
picked off one river after another, and the process of ruination continues.
Of course, there are still English rivers on which the wild brown trout may
be caught. Those game, fierce fellows of Exmoor and Dartmoor still thrive.
There are sanctuaries elsewhere in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Northumbria and
Shropshire. And the wild fish hang on in the chalk streams of the south,
despite often being outnumbered and eclipsed by stocked interlopers.
Although a southerner who does most of his fishing on the Kennet, my most
potent daydreams are of another river which belongs to the north-west. It is
the Eden, a great, broad river in Cumbria which defines a landscape of
sweeping, fertile fields and treeless, dun fells. It has a scale and a
grandeur which no southern river can match, and its trout are - for the most
part - wild.
A while ago, l wrote of the bridge over the Eden at Langwathby, and the view
of the river above. It is as grand a sight to me now as when I first drank
it in nearly 30 years ago. The river here is so wide that, between one bank
and the other, it presents most of the varied aspects of its enchanting
character. There are bubbly shallows, dark channels between rosy sandstone
boulders, marbled runs emerald with weed, and calm depths shaded by beech
and hazel.
When there is a hatch of fly, it can take a full morning to do justice to
this short stretch, from the bridge up to where the river bends to the
right. A little way higher is a steep bluff, thick with trees. The water
runs deep and strong at its foot and is full of trout - although the
difficulty of the wading and the steepness of the bank make getting at them
something of a trial.
Above this stretch are wide, featureless flats followed by a tremendous
reach, deep enough to demand chest waders, thick with weed and alive with
fish. I have stood there at the height of a sedge hatch on a June night and
lost my head and my nerve utterly at the sight of a surface boiling with
feeding trout.
There, too, I suffered an early, indelible trauma. In those days, I knew
nothing of the dry fly and almost nothing of matching the fly to the hatch.
I would tie on a made-up cast of three flies - Fartridge and Orange, Brown
Owl and Greenwell, perhaps - and fish with it until a break or a tangle
forced me to desist.
On this occasion, I was with one of my brothers. It was late April. The sky
was white, the wind raw, and soon it began to snow heavily. We were
astounded when a frenzied rise began. Between the snowflakes, we saw
multitudes of dark, high-winged flies on the water and the trout slashing at
them.
Delirious with excitement, we flailed away until the numbness of cold and
failure overwhelmed us. Several years later, I realised that the hatch was
of iron blues and that, with a dry fly or a wet Snipe-and-Purple, we must
have done great deeds.
In those days, we fished the wet fly downstream and nothing else. I used to
hook a lot of fish - and lose a lot. When the weather warmed and the water
fined, the trout would not look at a wet fly. One hot day in June, I watched
a stranger extract two fish of more than 1lb each on a dry black gnat.
Entranced by the delicacy of the execution, I became an instant convert.
In general, I have remained true to the faith and the rewards have been
rich. There was a day, a couple of years ago, when the light olives hatched
for 12 hours without cease. I began below Watersmeet, where the Eamont flows
into the Eden, then fished up the Eamont, and returned to the Eden as
twilight came. And when I reeled in and splashed to the bank, the bats were
out and the trout were still taking.
So many hours and days on the Eden come back to the mind, the disasters and
blanks filtered out to leave the triumphs and the joys. Each time I have
returned, I - like so many before me on this river - have thought how well
it was named.
There is, though, a ghastly footnote to this lyrical celebration. At the end
of March this year, a tank containing liquid ammonium oxide fertiliser
overturned beside a small watercourse at the head of the Eden valley. The
chemical killed virtually every fish along 20 miles of river.
Although the slaughter stopped short of the stretch which I know and love,
the whole river has been stricken by the disaster. It is a reminder - if
such were needed - of man's infinite capacity for defiling his inheritance,
and of what happened to the first Eden.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Man with a plan tries to make sense of London: Jimmy Burns
joins a tour with the mayor of Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASQUAL Maragall, the elected mayor of Barcelona since 1982, presides over a
city that has come to be seen widely as a model of well structured urban
planning, bold architecture and leadership.
At 52, he can look back over two and half terms in office during which
Barcelona has undergone one of the most ambitious urban renewals of any
European city. The process culminated in the creation of an Olympic village
on what was a polluted wasteland on the banks of the Mediterranean.
The FT brought Maragall to London, a city despised by so many of its
inhabitants because it lacks the very qualities which Barceloneses claim as
their trademark. Is Barcelona as good as people make out? Is London as bad?
What too, could we learn from Maragall, the 'urban socialist' who claims to
know what makes urban dwellers happy. We flew him to Heathrow and took him
round the city for a day. This is a diary of his hectic progress through the
British capital.
11.30 am There are no traffic jams on the M4 as we drive into London from
Heathrow. 'The last time I took a taxi into London, the traffic was so bad I
abandoned ship and took a subway instead,' says the mayor. He has to admit
that traffic in Barcelona is also pretty horrible.
The western outskirts of London unfold. No Mediterranean sun or coastline
here, no Olympian village. Just a landscape of cricket fields, warehouses,
office blocks, and terraced houses. Maragall looks bored. 'I have to agree
with the Prince of Wales, there is a sound basis to dislike much of what has
been built in London. Look at all this. I am unable to understand what is
going on about me. For a citizen of a city, that is the most damaging of
sensations. Being lost in a landscape you cannot understand. There doesn't
seem to be a cohesive urban development plan.' Barcelona has the strictest
historical preservation code of any European city. A property developer who
wants to demolish a building has to prove to the mayor's officethat it is
not of historical significance.
12.00 am The terraced houses give way to the Imperial grandeur of museums
and parks. 'The British Empire was very clever. It made sure that if you
wanted to find out about the world you had to come to London. Even Marx had
to come to the British Museum.'
Barcelona boasts more art nouveau buildings that any other city and more
than 50 permanent exhibitions, but the emphasis is on the modern.
The taxi slows and Maragall joins the tourists watching the changing of the
guard. The Royal parks and Buckingham Palace are illuminated by a spring
sun. 'Now all this is the result of history and a time when there was 'sound
planning'. When I see all this, I think, God it's beautiful. It is the
summit of humanity, but I also think, how unfair. Why is it that it is
always capital cities that have the wealth of the nations to spend on
themselves? What will happen to London when it is not the capital of a
sovereign state when the real nation is Europe?'
Whitehall, he muses, as we leave Big Ben behind, has too much concentration
of power; the City is too exclusive in its emphasis on business, the way it
functions only by day and closes for the night.
'Cities are not islands, nor should they have islands in them because if
they do cities disappear . . . you deny citizenship . . . The City is dead
at night. I don't see why it should be. All you need is to mix residences
with shops.'
So what can Barcelona offer by day and night? I ask . . . 'A surprise: a
city that is alive. People strolling down the Ramblas . . . people talking
to each other . . . a city made up of equally important parts,' Maragall
answers.
12.30 Maragall alights from the taxi at the corner of Broad Street and
Bishopsgate in the midst of buildings wrecked by the IRA bomb blast. Looking
up at the shattered Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, he seems not so much shocked
as unimpressed. 'This building is not a Norman Foster. It's not very
beautiful.' (Foster is one of Britain's exports to Barcelona. He designed a
telecommunications tower described by Catalans as poetry in architecture).
'This kind of thing can happen in any city. It's very difficult to stop
terrorists as organised as the IRA. We couldn't' Maragall says a city that
concentrates its financial activities in one area is more vulnerable.
1.00 To the FT for lunch with Sir Peter Bowness, Tory leader of Croydon
Council; Tony Travers, from the London government unit at the LSE; Margaret
Hodge, former Labour leader of Islington Council and Stephen O'Brien, chief
Executive of London First and London Forum, the business-led body which has
the government's backing to promote London.
Sir Peter defends his patch. 'When one talks of London,' he says, 'one can
only consider its different constituents which in themselves are very
different from each other.' Travers says London is 'a whole collection of
villages' defined by history and justified by it.
Hodge insists that a city like London needs a voice.
Maragall knows Hodge as an ally. 'London to an outsider presents a curious
face. It seems a city that is being subtlety subjected to a very centralised
government which ignores the wishes of the citizen.'
O'Brien suggests that perhaps the mayor does not really know what makes
London tick. 'There is a definite move against centralised government
bureaucracy . . . greater co-operation between business and public sector to
put pressure on government . . . It is not an attempt to present a new
vision in London, it is an attempt to make things happen in London . . . '
And certainly not with an elected mayor, adds Sir Peter. 'There is not the
same loyalty in the populace to the concept of municipality as there is in
other parts of Europe. It simply wouldn't happen. There is no groundswell of
public opinion. Quite apart from the objections at local level, MPs
instinctively don't like competition.'
Hodge disagrees.' That's not what the surveys in the Evening Standard tell
us.'
The dialogue shifts to culture and design. Maragall says: 'If Barcelona has
one asset it is the gift of design. You cannot show a design that is not the
best otherwise you lose your trademark. Barcelona wanted to be a capital and
never was . . . it is always trying to go beyond itself and we had a lot to
catch up after 40 years of dictatorship . . . '
The gathered Anglo-Saxons look bemused.
2.45 pm The Docklands Light Railway. It is running on time, uncrowded, its
passengers are mainly businessman.
'In Barcelona not only do we not have half as many underground lines as you
have here . . . but no one apart from the working class uses them.'
But Londoners think their public transport is crowded, unsafe, dirty.
Maragall shrugs this off as unjustified moaning. 'I've spent two years
living in New York, this is paradise by comparison,' he says.
Docklands give him the cue to talk about his own achievements. 'We
redesigned whole urban areas which didn't seem to belong anywhere any more.
We gave symbols of power to the periphery in the form of statues. We gave
people the idea that we care about them . . . we built new low cost housing
and squares where brothels had been.'
Even an elected mayor cannot get everything he wants in a chain of
government that runs upwards to the regional authority and then to Madrid.
Maragall looks at the DLR with regret. 'This was the kind of train system I
wanted in Barcelona but I didn't get the money for it from the regionalist
government.'
3.00 pm Canary Wharf has some of the same architects as Barcelona. It has
bold designs. But Maragall finds it too empty and silent. 'Where are the
people?' he asks.
From the 34th floor of Canary Wharf tower Maragall looks across Docklands.
'I like this more than La Defence in Paris. The architecture is more human.
It's the scale that obviously is too big. This is going to take years to
occupy fully and someone will have to pay for that. This was the product of
a government that believed the free market was everything. This is a capital
sin. Sheer arrogance.'
However, Barcelona's equivalent docklands development, the Olympic village
built by a mix of private and public capital and socialist government
intervention, is also partly unoccupied.
4.45 pm The mayor goes upstream in a Riverbus. He says that while Barcelona
had rediscovered the sea, London has obscured its river.
Watching the rush hour stampede across London Bridge, he says: 'It would be
very difficult for Latins to cross a bridge . . . they don't like having
their cars more than about 200 metres away from their work . . . That's why
the traffic is so bad in Barcelona.'
5.15 pm Stepping ashore at Festival Pier, Maragall says of the South Bank:
'It's horrible. You should knock it down but only gradually . . . I remember
when Franco died the architects wanted to knock everything down . . . we
restrained them so something was left.'
The Mayor insists on diverting to the Hayward Gallery where there is an
exhibition by James Turrel, a Californian, and one of hundreds of artists
who Maragall has brought on to the streets of Barcelona to be viewed
free-of-charge by the public.
5.30 The delegation makes its way across cardboard city. London's homeless
loiter among excrement and empty beer cans. 'This is no worse than
Barcelona. This is a worldwide phenomenon. These people will always seek
shelter underground.'
5.45 The Mayor is given a private preview of the new international terminal
at Waterloo station. Gazing at Grimshaw's bold design, listening to the men
from Bovis and British Rail talk about the wonders of Europe and getting to
Paris in three hours, Maragall thinks he has found the link he has been
looking for. 'It's airy it's wide . . . it's beautiful . . . .It's EUROPE .
. . This is going to change London's history.'
Unfortunately the terminal is not the international link he imagines. BR has
abandoned its southern route extension to the Channel tunnel and the fast
European trains will run on a northern route from St Pancras, leaving
Waterloo redundant. It is an example not of European vision but of the
unco-ordinated government that bedevils London. At day's end, Maragall had
been seduced by a white elephant.

FT  05 JUN 93 / How to Spend It: China's antique treasures
</HEADLINE>

IF YOU are in the mood for some serious shopping in Hong Kong then you might
consider some proper antique Chinese furniture. For those who like the
thrill of the chase, who like rummaging in scruffy shops, then there is a
lot of fun to be had walking up and down the hills and backstreets of
Central District.
Head for Hollywood Road, a bare ten minutes walk from the Mandarin, and
potter round the 'ladder streets' - you will find everything from posh
set-ups discreetly exhibiting a few rarified pieces to little hole-in-the
wall shops where you can hardly see the contents for the dust.
If you prefer to have the hazard removed and want a certain source of
well-priced authenticated Chinese antiques, visit Beatrice Owen. She has
been collecting Chinese and European antiques for years. Finding herself in
Hong Kong she set about learning Cantonese and studying Chinese furniture.
She makes regular forays into mainland China buying furniture, carpets and
other traditional artefacts.
They are almost invariably in poor condition when she buys them but she has
two Chinese carpenters who repair, restore and sand down in the traditional
way. She will not buy furniture that has been restored on the mainland.
'The passion,' she says, 'for care has gone, they use modern materials and
glues whereas my carpenters make their own tools and use only the old
traditional methods.'
Her tastes runs to simple, country-style furniture. She does not go in for
the over- decorated, ornate pieces that sit uneasily in Western homes.
Her shop is at 40 Hollywood Road, Central, Hong Kong. It always holds a
selection of restored pieces and artefacts - a pair of late 18th century elm
wardrobes from the North at HKDollars 35,000 (approx Pounds 330) each,
butcher's tables (HKDollars 3,200), camphor chests (HK Dollars 1,100) and
porcelain, silver, children's toys and shoes.
Much more fun, though, is to visit her warehouse - ring the shop (telephone
850-7813) and she will make an appointment. Everything there is piled high,
covered in dust, mostly unrestored and much as it arrived from the mainland.
Here is a perfect chance to test your eye. Which is the camphor chest with
best grain, the butcher's table of the most pleasing dimensions, the
cupboard with the finest lines?
Prices seemed exceedingly reasonable - you could buy a fine piece of cabinet
work, a genuine antique, for less than half the price the equivalent piece
would cost in the West.
Owen will organise packing, shipping and all the tedious paper work. The
other great bonus is that not only is the antique furniture much more
beautiful than most modern repro but anything over 100 years old can be
imported free of duty.

FT  05 JUN 93 / How to Spend It: A more selective way to enjoy Hong Kong -
Lucia van der Post takes it easy and is not taken in by bargains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST time in Hong Kong is always special but now that I am an old hand
I find it interests me in different ways.
Fifteen years ago Hong Kong seemed like the bargain basement of the world.
Hand-embroidered linens, fake watches, cheapo copies of famous handbags,
slightly imperfect cotton shirts, cute children's clothing - you name it, I
bought it. I learnt the hard way that only the very best of Hong Kong
tailors ever produce exactly what you have in mind and that not every piece
of jade is precisely what it seems.
These days, I buy much less and better. If I need a special lens for my
camera or a string of pearls for a 21st birthday celebration or have a
special antique in mind, then I plan it and go where the prices are possibly
higher but the quality more certain.
First-timers, though, should never miss the markets - prices may have risen
but they still are filled with life and interest. Stanley Market and the
Kowloon City Market are the places for clothes - you need to be patient and
prepared to sort through rails but bargains are there to be found. In
particular, look for washable silks (wonderful Equipment-style shirts) and
tracksuits. Shoppers in both markets are mostly tourists. If you want to
shop where the locals shop then go to the women's market in Mongkok in
Kowloon - the prices are even lower.
Treat the Jade market (in Yaumatei on Kowloon, open every day from 10 am to
4 pm) as an experience, not as a place for serious investment and do not
expect, unless you are really knowledgeable, to find a bargain.
Dedicated shoppers wanting to track down keenly-priced designer labels
should get the excellent free guides issued by the Hong Kong Tourist
Association - Shopping and Factory outlets and Hong Kong Factory Bargains.
Those who, like me, are after proper antiques should buy Drummond's Hong
Kong Guide to Art &amp; Antique Dealers.
I always head straight for the oldest, fuddy-duddiest of the Communist China
Stores (the one in Queen's Road Central which is always filled with local
Chinese doing proper shopping) just to catch the flavour of China proper. I
like to look in on Li Yuen Street East and West, heart of the rip-off
merchants (this is where you buy a belt with Woschino written on it and once
the money changes hands you turn the W the other way round) just to see
what's up.
If I feel in need of anything smart to wear the best buildings (HK, you seen
learn, is full of buildings) are The Landmark, Princes and Pedder.
This time, though, I decided to wander more and buy less - I liked it
better. Start with the Hollywood Road, which is where all the best of the
antiques are and where there are still workshops and ateliers where almost
no English is spoken. Tomb figures, it seems, are currently all the rage -
you can buy Ming dynasty figures for around HKDollars 1,000 or a giant Han
dynasty horse for about HKDollars 7,000.
From there walk around the ladder streets and head in a Westerly direction.
As you walk along The Nun's Street listen for the click-click of the
Mah-jong pieces coming from almost every room.
In Tai Ping Shan Street in the Western district you will find the
fortune-telling temple where the locals line-up for serious consultations.
In Queens' Road West there is much more fun to be had browsing round the
traditional shops than in any number of smart department stores.
Where else could you find 20 candles for just HKDollars 10, if not at the
Temple Equipment Shop? Where could you drink Nine Dragon Tea, a tea to wake
the dead, if not with the fourth generation owner of the oldest tea
merchants in town, Yuen Mau Hing Kee Tea Co, 45 Queen's Road West? Who else
would show one how to serve the tea? (Use a pottery pot, keep it wet to make
sure it does not absorb too much and replenish endlessly). Where else could
one eat an authentic Chiu Chow meal in the simplest but most appealing of
local restaurants? (At 49, Queen's Road West, Sheung Wan, it looks like a
take-away but you will find seats upstairs).
When the jet-lag threatens to overcome you, head back to the sanctuary of
the Mandarin Hotel but before you sink back in your room to admire the view
stop in at the health spa which has had a 'major refurbishment'. Ask for one
of the soothing Eastern-style massages and you may, like me, get Christine.
She specialises in a combination of vigorous massages which she follows with
some reflexology, all accompanied by stream-of-consciousness chatter.
'Fat thighs.' (As if I didn't know.) 'You drink two pints jasmine tea a day,
you eat fish four or five times a week . . . crystal on kidley, crystal on
thyroid . . . cook plenty for your husband . . . way to husband's heart.'
Sound advice I am sure. Just what you need to hear as you set out on the
serious business of shopping.
Save some time to take a few days off in Macau. Jet-foils leave Hong Kong
about every 15 minutes all through the day, the journey takes about an hour
and it costs about Pounds 10 each way. Macau is an ancient trading city,
where the great tai pans of the old China Coast had their summer homes and
where Sun Yat Sen planned the overthrow of the Manchu Dynasty.
Do not be put off by your first glimpse of the sky-scrapers on the skyline
('Oh, God,' you think, 'not another Hong Kong'). You will find a heady blend
of strange cultures - Southern Chinese, Portuguese and Macanese - which
makes it quite, quite different.
In the old days people went there to gamble and to eat dog - today they
still go to gamble but I would go to wander round the old cobbled lanes,
rummage in the street markets and poke around the antique shops. I would go
to see the temples and the gentle colonial architecture and I would go to
stay in the Bela Vista. The Bela Vista is where Hong Kong's governor Chris
Patten comes to stay when he takes time off to rootle round the backstreets
of Macau for antiques and local colour. Once a grand private mansion
standing on Penha Hill overlooking the Praia Grande Bay it is a splendid
contrast to Hong Kong's Mandarin - small, with just eight suites, each one
different, it is personal, intimate, a hotel with real character.
From there you can saunter out to enjoy Macau. These days almost anything
you care to name is cheaper than in Hong Kong. If you are short of sports
clothes San Domingos Market is the place to head for - I bought a man's
cotton shirt for Pounds 2.50, a cream tracksuit for myself for Pounds 3.50
and jeans, polo shirts, children's clothes (in particular the Red Market)
are all available for a song. Many are seconds from the factories that churn
out these things for the West so look carefully before you buy.
More fun, in my view, is looking into all the antique shops - rumour has it
that many of the Hong Kong dealers buy here and double the price when they
get back home. The flea market - its best to go in the mornings - is in the
lanes round Rua das Estalagens (close to St Paul's ruins, a big Macau
landmark). We found marvellous old furniture shops in these little streets
and fell on the pieces in Lai Weng Lok in the Rua Nossa Senhora de Amparo No
37 R/7. A mixture of genuine old pieces from the mainland and new,
impeccably made copies about which they seem totally honest, prices were
incredibly good. Lai Weng Lok does not take credit cards but will pack and
ship.
Ian Kam Kei, Rua de Madeira No 19 A, I found more expensive but it takes
credit cards and is generally better geared up to Westerners.
Other good buys are hand-embroidered cottons and linens, porcelain old and
new - lots of gentle blue and white tea caddies, plant pots, tableware. Gold
jewellery and pearls come duty free and with no sales tax and are popular
but the designs seem to me dull and unoriginal, though you could not go far
wrong with a classic string of pearls.
And if you want to buy even cheaper and go closer to the original source of
the embroidery, the basket-ware, the jade, the porcelain, take a trip into
mainland China - you can make it to the border in a couple of hours and just
beyond the border you can start haggling in a small open-air market-place.
Otherwise three-day tours are organised to several Chinese towns.
Food is marvellously interesting. For posh dining you could go to the Bela
Vista - a lovely room and an eclectic mix of international food and local
specialities. Fernando's baked crab casserole they say is not to be missed
(though, sadly, we had to) - find him at Hac Sa Beach No. 9, Coloane. The
Inner Harbour area is wonderfully scruffy but filled with life and interest
 -eat at the informal tables set up in the streets and you will get fresh,
zesty seafood. We eat wonderfully at Henri's Galley, 4 Avenida de Republica
 -plate after plate, starting with spicy prawns and including African
Chicken (a local speciality) and a whole roast fish.
Flights to Hong Kong are expensive (British Airways offers a World
Traveller, with a minimum seven night stay, but otherwise the economy fare
is Pounds 1,200 return) so I would recommend the special British Airways
Holidays (Tel: 0293-611611) package of Pounds 925 for return scheduled
flights and 7 nights at the Mandarin Hotel (room only).
The Bela Vista in Macau charges HKDollars 1,600 per day per suite.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Food and Wine: Worthy clarets on the fringe - Wine / Edmund
Penning-Rowsell tries some lesser-known bottles in Bordeaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHICH Bordeaux district has a very different appellation controlee for its
red and dry white wine?
The answer is not immediately obvious because the area is little visited by
wine tourists to the Medoc or St Emilion - or even by the Bordeaux wine
trade. In Britain the wines are all too seldom seen. The appellation
Premieres Cotes de Bordeaux applies to the reds. The dry whites are now
classified as Bordeaux Blanc or Bordeaux Superieur, according to alcoholic
strength. Yet, since 1981 the sweet whites are Premieres Cotes de Bordeaux
Cadillac .
The Premieres Cotes stretch for 60km and 37 communes along the right bank of
the Garonne from just north of Bordeaux to St Maxiant on the outskirts of
Langon, but their width is never more than 5km - usually less - following
the sinuous river upstream. Inland these attractive, often steep 'first
hills' above the river become the Entre-Deux-Mers.
Like most lesser French wine districts the Premieres Cotes had never really
recovered from phylloxera (a lice which destroys vines) and the almost
continuous economic crises up to the second world war. Afterwards it was a
somewhat decayed area, but in the 1950s and early 1960s, it was partly
revitalised by immigrant growers from North Africa. However, in many cases
they lacked sufficient resources to transform neglected vineyards and
restore semi-abandoned chateaux completely.
In the last dozen years a new generation of growers from a variety of
professions - but all fired with the ambition to make wine - saw the
opportunities to buy estates at between FFr150,000 and FFr350,000 per
hectare according to their state, compared with FFr1.5m in St Emilion and
FFr4m in Pomerol. Accessibility to Bordeaux was also an attraction. Estates
that I recently visited included purchases made in the last 12 years by
Belgians, Danes, German and Japanese, as well as Bordelais and those from
other parts of France. The most recent I came upon was made last summer, Ch
Barreyre in Langoiran, acquired by a Bordeaux builder and a doctor who had
left medicine to become a wine grower.
Traditionally, the dominant red grape has been Merlot. The stated average
proportion is 55 per cent, with 25 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon and 15 per
cent Cabernet Franc. There is a little Malbec too, although seldom
replanted. But there are wide variations, and I visited chateaux with up to
70 per cent Cabernet-Sauvignon. However, the preponderance of Merlot and the
terroir means less tannic wines than in districts such as Bourg and Fronsac.
Thus they are usually drinkable after four or five years. The '88s and '89s
are already agreeable, though the more concentrated '90s will need more
time.
There are 450 growers in the area, 250 making mainly red wine, with an
average total production of about 1.2m bottles. White wines, basically
Semillon, with Sauvignon and Muscadelle added account for roughly another
290,000 bottles. In the north the wine is mostly red, but white gradually
becomes dominant south of Cadillac (the walled bastide town built by the
English in the 12th century).
Popularity of the Cadillac moelleux has been growing, following increased
demand for Sauternes and Barsac. Sweet, but not luscious, it is commonly
served in the area as an aperitif - with or without foie gras. If available
in the UK it should not cost more than Pounds 6, and the reds and dry whites
from Pounds 3.50 to Pounds 5.
Increasingly made is Clairet rose, said to have originated in Quinsac, where
in the Place de l'Eglise the Syndicat has its offices and will help visitors
to visit chateaux.
Nowadays 80 per cent of Premieres Cotes wines are sold in bottle, almost all
bypassing the Bordeaux trade and selling direct to private customers,
wholesalers and restaurants, with a surprising proportion exported,
particularly to Belgium, experts at seeking-out good, inexpensive claret.
Germany and Scandinavia also provide good markets, but almost everyone told
me that the British market is very difficult. Tesco has the exclusivity of
Ch Leon, a subsidiary of Ch Carignan, which is bought by Victoria Wine.
Waitrose is selling Ch Haut Rian.
Traditional merchants may buy a certain vintage, via a Bordeaux house, and
then perhaps not replace it immediately. Firms mentioned to me include
Averys of Bristol; Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, London SW1; Justerini &amp; Brooks, London
SW1 and the Wine Society, Stevenage, Hertfordshire. For quality and price
the wines are worth exploring.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Cookery: Guess who's coming to dinner . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS TO have been a simple yet greedy feast a deux: asparagus to start,
followed by wild salmon tails dressed with an olive oil variation on beurre
noir, then soft goat's cheese with oatcakes or soda bread, and fresh
cherries and apricots to finish. But it was not to be. Friends turned up
unexpectedly and stayed to dinner.
The thought of such impromptu entertaining sometimes seems daunting but, in
practice, many cooks rather enjoy the challenge - occasionally. Sudden
demands on resourcefulness can stimulate good ideas providing, of course,
that there is a store cupboard worthy of the name on which to to fall back
and that the refrigerator contains something other than the mouldy remains
of a tin of tomatoes.
On this occasion, I teamed the olives and capers with a few hard-boiled eggs
for hors d'oeuvres. The asparagus and salmon then combined to make a ritzy,
yet fresh-tasting, version of kedgeree, which went down so well that I have
made it several times since. The cheese course and dessert ingredients were
telescoped similarly, this time following an idea gleaned from food and
gardening writer Lynda Brown.
Wrap 1-1 1/2 oz mounds of soft goat's cheese in vine leaves that have been
blanched and painted all over with olive oil. Grill the parcels gently until
the contents are warm and the leafy surfaces begin to brown. Serve with a
fresh apricot sauce made by stewing until tender some skinned and chopped
ripe apricots, with a few tablespoons of water and vanilla sugar to taste.
Partner the pud with chilled dessert wine.
SALMON AND ASPARAGUS KEDGEREE (serves 4-5)
Flecked generously with flavoursome goodies, this is a pretty dish: pink,
green and white. The rice could be increased to 10 oz without any hint of
meanness. The asparagus is cooked as I like it (neither fashionable semi-raw
nor old-fashioned limp) but timing can be altered to taste.
Ingredients: 2 salmon tail fillets weighing about 5 oz each; 12 oz
asparagus; 8-9 oz basmati rice; 1 1/2 pt fish stock; about 3 oz butter; a
bunch of flat leaf parsley; wedges of lemon for serving.
Method: Soak the rice in cold water for 10 minutes or so. Wash, trim and
scrape the asparagus. Cut it obliquely into 1 1/2 -inch lengths. Set the
tips aside and put the rest into a steamer basket. Oil lightly the base of a
second steamer basket, lay the fish in it skin side down, and season with
salt and pepper.
Bring the stock to the boil and stir in the soaked and drained rice. Cover
and cook at a fast simmer for about seven minutes. Then, stack the steamer
baskets over the rice and continue cooking for about eight minutes more.
Put the asparagus basket immediately over the rice (the stalks will need
about eight minutes, the tips about half that time so add them later) and
place the salmon basket on the top of the pile, where the steam will be
gentler so the cooking process is slower.
This means that all three ingredients should be ready more or less
simultaneously - the rice tender, the asparagus not collapsing but retaining
a litle crunch, the salmon moist and just cooked through - but it is best to
check progress by looking and tasting now and then. Adjust the flame, alter
timings and re-stack the steamer baskets as necessary.
Lift out the salmon as soon as it is cooked and lay it skin side up in a
serving dish in which you have melted the butter. Strip off the skin and
flake the flesh into the butter. Add a good grinding of black pepper, mix in
the rice drained of the stock, and 5-6 tablespoons chopped parsley. Fold in
the asparagus, check for salt and serve with wedges of lemon.
SALMON WITH OLIVES AND CAPERS
This recipe, which uses the same amount of fish as the kedgeree, makes an
almost-instant main course for two people.
Although the salmon is cooked to the same degree as in the kedgeree, the
steaming process is quicker here because the fish basket is placed directly
over boiling liquid.
Ingredients: 2 salmon tail fillets weighing about 5 oz each; 1 1/2
tablespoons olive oil; 1 tablespoon black olives (preferably tiny whole
Nicoise olives, or stoned and sliced kalamata); 1 tablespoon chopped capers;
1 tablespoon chopped parsley; 1 lime.
Lay the fish skin side down in a lightly-oiled steamer basket. Season with
salt and pepper and steam over boiling water until it is just cooked
through, about four minutes.
Make the sauce while the fish rests. Heat the oil gently until hot and
fruity. Draw the pan away from the flame and add a good seasoning of
freshly-squeezed lime juice. Swirl to mix and stir in the olives, capers and
parsley.
Spoon the sauce over the salmon and serve garnished with wedges of lime.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Fashion: Goodbye Wall Street, hello West Coast cool - The
British male professional is turning increasingly to Hollywood for a role
model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL KEERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST A FEW years ago, the sartorial and professional role model for young
British professionals was Bud Fox, the aspiring arbitrageur in the film Wall
Street. Now, he has been replaced by another big-screen business figure:
Griffin Mill, studio executive in The Player. Things have changed: the
American look and lifestyle to which British men aspire is no longer Brooks
Brothers, East Coast traditional - but West Coast contemporary.
As the dress code of the 1990s has become more relaxed, West Coast has
replaced East Coast as the sartorial role model. For casual clothes, British
men are looking to the West Coast workwear, typified by The Gap chain of
fashion stores. And for business, the designer look of Hollywood executives
is replacing the formality of East Coast bankers.
Each world has its codes. There is a particular movie business style - a
cashmere/silk blend suit with pleated trousers, saved from dark-suit
conformity by a subtle stripe of, say, lilac, rust or peacock blue in the
fabric; a light, designer shirt; a Giorgio Armani tie (wider in cut and
lighter in fabric than East Coast power ties); and spectacular socks.
Magically transported to the other coast, to the corner of Wall Street and
Broadway, the Brooks Brothers-clad businessmen would stop and stare - but in
Hollywood, that is just the Uniform.
Even the lace-up black shoes. the classic half brogued New &amp; Lingwoods worn
by Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy in The Bonfire of the Vanities, are replaced,
by tasselled loafers - and in suede, too. When Sig Rogich, an advertising
and PR man from Las Vegas, was brought to Washington to polish President
Bush's image, his brown suede, Cole-Haan loafers immediately attracted
attention. 'I'm fighting for freedom around the world,' said Secretary of
State James Baker with mock scorn. 'So you can wear shoes like that?'
Designer menswear took off quickly on the West Coast. It was new, and it was
expensive - two endearing characteristics in LA. Italian designers use
lighter fabrics, better suited to the Californian climate than the heavier
weight of East Coast tailoring. Indeed, tailoring itself is seen as Old
World, and Los Angeles is the place furthest from being Old World.
And as with movies themselves, the entertainment industry believes in paying
for big names and trusting them to get it right. So buying top-to-toe
Giorgio Armani is the executive dress equivalent of investing in Arnold
Schwarzenegger. Arnie or Armani - it is still a low-risk investment in a
high-concept name.
The look spreads beyond the movie industry itself, even to sports
personalities such as Pat Riley, coach of the LA Lakers basketball team, who
now lectures American executives on motivation. He wears sharp, continental
suits with his slicked-back hair: he is stylish enough to have featured on
the cover of US GQ and attended Giorgio Armani's country house parties. And
when the Lakers won their second consecutive championship, the talk was not
of their achievement, but of why the coach wore a purple shirt in the
victory parade.
It was the UK screening of the hit television series LA Law which allowed
British executives to see just how sharp West Coast dressing could be. And
the BBC series Naked Hollywood, coupled with the movie The Player, have
provided an equivalent view of the professionals in the movie industry. The
result has been to legitimise West Coast style for British business.
The West Coast look shuns the traditional trappings of preppy businessmen:
no cufflinks or braces, no heavy silk power ties, no striped shirts, brogues
or three-piece suits. Instead, think in terms of lighter weight, foulard
ties with Art Deco-inspired patterns; plain designer shirts with unstiffened
collars; loafers; and lightweight suits, dark but with an intriguing stripe,
cut more loosely than traditional tailoring. The look is like the West Coast
mood - lighter, and more relaxed.
In LA, work is done at odd times and odd places: Sunday brunches, beach
parties, around the pool. No wonder the dress codes of business and pleasure
have become so intermingled. And while the lawyers and agents have relaxed
the traditional business dress code, their style is still formal when
compared with many West Coast men. The relaxed style of Californian dressing
is something of a cliche.
It is still said in New York that the edict 'formal dress' on a West Coast
invitation means that you are expected to wear socks. Informality has
reached such extremes in California that the Triad Artists agency recently
felt obliged to stem the tide and issue a dress code, banning jeans and
T-shirts during business hours.
The most informal professionals in Western business are probably those in
the California computer companies. The average age of employees at many
Silicon Valley companies is between 25 and 33. And aside from giants such as
IBM and Digital, most high-tech firms are simply too young to be shackled by
orthodoxies from the past. Polo shirts, jeans and loafers are standard
working attire. At Apple computers. staff favour T-shirts, shorts and
Birkenstock boots. 'People put in a lot of hours around here,' says an Apple
spokeswoman. 'You have to accommodate them. We have to warn executives if
outside people are coming around.'
And at Sun Microsystems, which employs nearly 7000 producing workstations,
Scott McNeally, the chief executive, says: 'We don't have a dress code. The
only rule on dress is that you must.'
It is this shifting attitude to dress which has spawned The Gap, the San
Francisco-based clothing chain which is now the second-biggest clothing
label in the US, behind that other West Coast clothing phenomenon, Levi
Strauss.
What The Gap sells is dubbed 'workwear' because its style comes from
blue-collar professions such as truck driving and engineering; yet it is now
workwear for white collar work, such as film production, media and computing
in both the US and Britain.
When their stylish, black-and-white ad campaign appeared on London buses,
you could see a traditionalist like shoe designer Manolo Blahnik wearing a
Gap turtleneck under an Anderson &amp; Sheppard Savile Row suit. In a British
menswear market looking for a way forward from traditional tailoring it was
clear that this West Coast combination of the classic with the comfortable
was going to succeed. It was timeless - the value we had been taught to look
for in quality menswear - but also relaxed, that key word both of the 1990s
and of Californian culture.
The Gap now provides British professionals with the casual basics - chambray
shirts, chino trousers and polo shirts - which are becoming increasingly
acceptable in creative work as well as at weekends. Of course, on the West
Coast those two may be indistinguishable: but that may also, eventually, be
true of the wardrobes, too.
As the LA look makes business dress more relaxed, and casual wear more
acceptable for work, there may come a point when the two meet in the middle.
Or is that just California dreaming?

FT  05 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Books that shouldn't be taken as
read - Nick Garnett visits a company where fakery flourishes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS THE big bookcase Jonathan Eaton had up for sale at the antiques fair
in London's Olympia that sparked off the idea for a new business.
'It needed 2,500 books to fill it so we had that many dummies made up to
help present it. I asked the buyer whether he also wanted to purchase all
those book spines and he said . . . 'Well, of course I want them. I haven't
any time to read'.'
That was 1990. The Dummy Book Company, set up shortly after the antiques
fair, generated sales last year of Pounds 380,000. From its workshop in a
converted Gloucestershire cow shed, the tiny business supplies not only
false tomes for bookcases but also a range of items based on this curious
use of fakery. Boxes for videos which look like ageing copies of Fly Fishing
by JR Hartley, CD holders simulating Gardiner's History Of England, an
icebucket camouflaged as the Waverley Novels. Rules Of Football is made up
as a paperweight crowned with a rugby ball. Other paperweights come with
miniature models of baseball bats and mitts and golf clubs. 'I know it
sounds a crazy business, but it really took off.'
Eaton, who abandoned his life as an antiques dealer to concentrate on
running the Dummy Book Company, vividly remembers those first 2,500 dummy
book ends.
'We thought about buying them completed but the ones you could buy then just
looked like Readers Digest volumes with no age. We went to a local company,
History Craft in Cirencester, and it supplied the basic resin dummies. My
wife and I painted them all on our kitchen table. We nearly had a divorce
doing it.'
The Dummy Book Company, which employs 11, now does things a bit more
professionally. It still buys the chalk-based resin blanks from History
Craft. These book spines are made from moulds taken directly from real
books. A small team at the Dummy Book Company converts the white resin into
simulated leather by staining, then uses waxing and polishing techniques to
produce antiqueing followed by gilding the letters.
Eaton, aged 38, and his wife Anne-Marie started the dummy book business with
Pounds 500 of their own money and maximum loan arrangements of Pounds 65,000
from the Royal Bank of Scotland which took out a charge over their house.
Early sales grew quickly, Eaton says, mainly through word of mouth along the
antique dealers network, customers paying up to Pounds 20 a foot for
imitation book spines. Sales were a surprisingly high Pounds 150,000 in the
first 12 months.
Last year, the company moved from a small shop in Tetbury to a cow shed on
the edge of the town. The Eatons spent Pounds 15,000 clearing the mess and
erecting internal walls and are paying just Pounds 5,000 a year rent for
2,000 square feet.
The company has grown by expanding its odd range of mimicry, adding holders
for letters and telephone directories, waste paper bins, jewellery boxes and
ledger containers impersonating Walton's The Compleat Angler. Just 10 per
cent of sales come from straightforward dummy book runs. Almost all the rest
of the business is based on selling to the gift trade and to some large
stores such as London's Harrods and the General Trading Company. Three
quarters of the company's output is exported, most to the US. The Department
of Trade and Industry helped Eaton take a foothold there by partly funding
the company's display at a New York trade show. Every market, from Portugal
to Japan, wants only English language books as dummies, Eaton says.
The Dummy Book Company is not the easiest type of venture to run. Its costs
seem very high. Purchasing, covering materials such as resin blanks and
packaging, are the equivalent of a half of turnover and labour 30 per cent.
The company's pre-tax profit last year was Pounds 28,000. Selling in the US
caused some headaches. 'We originally took on two distributors there but
there was some overlapping and it was a mistake.' The company now has one US
distributor selling through 65 agents.
As with so much of manufacturing it is the retailer that takes the biggest
slice. A so-called compact disc 'hide' retails for about Pounds 14.50 and a
book paperweight decorated with resin dog at Pounds 45. But this includes a
retailer's mark up of usually 100 per cent and VAT.
Eaton has made product mistakes. 'We've done about 8,000 of the paperweights
with the dog lying on the book but the one with the cat didn't work. The
icebucket retailing at Pounds 120 was not successful.' He considered making
bedside condom holders using Dickens' Hard Times as the dummy, but thought
it too risque.
'Our biggest problem though is cashflow,' Eaton says. Dispatching Pounds
40,000 of merchandise a month and carrying stocks creates a serious
financial and management burden. Eaton says the Dummy Book Company is trying
this year to put its house in order. 'Cashflow went up the chute. We have
been doing too many gift shows. We are trying now to control stocks better.'
The bank recently requested regular cashflow statements and profits will
fall this year. Seamus Hawthorne, who joined the company at its start, has
been made a director at the age of 21 with a 10 per cent share of the
venture. Eaton though has toyed with the idea of attracting investors.
Does Eaton use his company's dummy Aesop's Fables or The Ruins of Elsinore
at his own home? 'Funnily enough, I've got real books there.'

FT  05 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Accounts package that remembers
every transaction - Computing / David Carter on a program which puts the
facts at your fingertips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGEING pugilists dream of finding a good young 'un to take under their wing
and guide to glory and a crack at the title. Software reviewers feel the
same way. As they work their way through piles of new packages sent in by
young hopefuls, there is always the excitement of perhaps discovering an
unknown who is going to knock the big boys for six.
The UK accounting software industry needs some new blood. Recently there has
been an invasion of heavyweight accounting packages from other countries:
Platinum from the US, Scala from Sweden, Exact from the Netherlands, SAP
from Germany.
So note the name of a British accounts package which you will being hearing
much more of in the years to come - Exchequer. Exchequer is designed and
sold by a company of the same name in Bournemouth, Dorset. It also sells
indirectly through a small number of dealers.
At the top level Exchequer Professional costs around Pounds 3,500 for a
networked, multicurrency version. For this you get sales, purchase and
nominal ledgers, cashbook, costing, invoicing and stock control, bill of
materials, and basic sales and purchase order processing. This version
competes with products such as Pegasus Senior, Sage Sovereign, Tetra 2000,
Multisoft Prestige.
For Pounds 495 you get single currency ledgers, invoicing and stock control
and Pounds 695 will buy you stock control and order processing.
This list of modules is no different from any other package, so what is so
special about Exchequer? Basically, most accounts packages were designed in
early and mid-80s, when memory and disk space, were limited they aimed at
efficient processing of transactions. For example, sales invoices are
entered on to the sales ledger and analysed to the nominal ledger. At the
end of the day the details of the invoices are printed out in a report (the
'audit trail') and then wiped off the system. The nominal balances are
summarised at the end of the month and posted from the sales ledger into the
nominal ledger.
Packages differ in what they do but the basic idea is that individual
transactions are entered into the computer at the lowest level, then passed
on in summary form at a higher level until data from all modules is brought
together in the nominal ledger.
The resulting small data files may be fine from a processing point of view,
but are poor at providing management information. Managers want to look at a
total balance, then work their way back (in the jargon, 'drill down') to the
original transactions. Traditional accounts packages only store these
original transactions in summary form. To find out the precise details you
have to rummage around in dusty old boxes full of printouts.
What is the point of having a computer if it does not store all the data you
have keyed in?
Exchequer is one of a tiny group of packages I have seen recently which does
the job properly. All transactions are retained in full detail and can be
accessed at any time. If you are in the nominal ledger and are looking at,
say, the balance on the advertising account, you can immediately call up all
the individual purchase invoices which make up the balance and see them in
full, exactly as they were originally posted on to the computer.
From this basic design a wealth of benefits flow. Pressing an F key in
Exchequer brings you instant access to any customer, purchase, nominal or
stock account. In both nominal and stock you can 'drill down' from the
highest level (eg 'sales - computer hardware') to all your individual sales
invoices for computer hardware in just three or four keystrokes.
All invoices on a supplier's or customer's account are maintained on the
account ledger and can be viewed in detail at any time. To generate a credit
note, simply retrieve the offending invoice and reverse it automatically. To
see how a past invoice was paid, just press M for match and the payment
details are displayed.
There are many more features. Exchequer is an astonishing package. Because
it operates under a new set of rules you will have to put some effort in to
learn it. The ability to jump around all over the place can mean you lose
your bearings. When I first worked on Exchequer I was totally confused
trying to work out what was going on, but after a week or two I was able to
hot-key my way around the system with the best of them.
Exchequer is a young product. It does not offer as wide a set of modules as
the majors. Order processing, for example, is limited. Countrywide support
is not yet available. But this is one of those rare packages that takes
accounting software into a new era.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Recession puts a damper on M &amp; G's
strategy - Recovery stocks are key to success, reports Philip Coggan / Doing
the Splits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE M &amp; G Income investment trust was launched with considerable fanfare,
including a TV advertising campaign, back in October 1991. The issue was an
enormous success; the Pounds 246m it raised made it the biggest trust launch
in history.
Eighteen months later, investors may well be wondering if the fuss was worth
it. The packaged shares, which were bought by around 59 per cent of
investors, stand at just 103p - only 3 per cent above the offer price.
Manager John Allard admits that, with hindsight, the fund was launched too
early. 'We didn't think the recession was going to last as long as it did,'
he says.
M &amp; G's investment philosophy is built round the contrarian approach. Buy
shares when they have a high yield, or their depressed prices make them
recovery stocks, and eventually they will rebound to your profit.
That theory has worked very well in the long run, but it is a high-risk
strategy in the middle of a recession. At such times, corporate profits turn
out to be worse than the market expects.
The Income trust was a prime example of the M &amp; G philosophy in action.
Aimed at giving investors a 6.6 per cent yield (tax-free when held in
personal equity plan form), the trust needed a portfolio yield of 7.5 per
cent-plus. That, inevitably, involved buying some high-risk stocks.
What did not help is that, shortly after the trust's launch, the market
decided recovery was not under way and, furthermore, feared a Labour
election victory. Investors moved into the perceived safety of growth
stocks, such as Glaxo and Wellcome, and away from the high-yielders. M &amp; G
Income's portfolio suffered accordingly.
But Black Wednesday, and the subsequent declines in interest rates, have
helped. Before the pound's exit from the ERM, the trust's net asset value
fell 17.8 per cent while the All-Share fell by 9.3 per cent. After
devaluation, though, the trust's assets have risen 34.5 per cent while the
All-Share has risen only 24.2 per cent.
Investors have not seen the full benefit of this recent recovery since the
price of the packaged units has recently dropped from a premium to net asset
value to a discount. M&amp;G blames the Budget's effect on the popularity of its
income shares for the switch.
Allard says the yield on the portfolio is now down to 5.5 per cent and,
during the year, he will be selling some of the successful low-yielding
stocks and moving into the high-yield end of the market. The trust has a 6
per cent holding of gilts which helps to provide income.
The 10 largest stocks in the portfolio are BAT, British Gas, General
Accident, GEC, GKN, Standard Chartered, Scottish Power, Royal Bank of
Scotland, Morgan Crucible and NatWest.
Five different types of security are traded. The zero dividend preference
shares receive no income but have the first claim on the assets of the
trust. Shareholders will be entitled to be repaid at 102.46p in November
2001.
Compared with the original net asset value of 34.5p, this is equivalent to a
gross redemption yield of 11.5 per cent per annum. Philip Middleton,
investment trust analyst at Smith New Court, says the zeros are among the
riskier in the sector, since the assets of the trust are now only just
enough to cover full repayment. The present gross redemption yield, at 50p,
is around 8.7 per cent.
The income shares are entitled to all the revenue of the trust, but will be
repaid only at 0.1p per share on wind-up in 2001. They resemble an annuity
in that investors receive a high income at the expense of capital loss.
In the first year of the trust, the gross dividend was 6.55p, equal to the
prospectus forecast. The trust has indicated it expects to be able to
maintain the net dividend this year, helped by revenue reserves from last
year.
But the Budget change in advance corporation tax, which reduced the tax
credit on dividends, means that the gross dividend will fall, to around
6.14p. On that basis, the shares, at 36p are on a flat yield of 17 per cent.
Since their capital value dwindles to virtually zero by 2001, however,
Middleton says the gross redemption yield is lower, at 9.8 per cent,
assuming nil dividend growth. He feels that these shares are on the cheap
side since they offer a good spread over the equivalent gilts, plus some
protection against a renewal of inflation, which would lead to an increase
in dividend income.
The capital shares receive no income but can claim all the assets of the
trust once the zero dividend and income shares have been repaid. Middleton
says the trust's assets will need to grow at 1.5 per cent a year for
investors to get back the present share price of 17p.
If the assets grow at 5 per cent a year, the return to investors would be 15
per cent, although he points out the high portfolio yield will restrict the
prospects for capital growth. He feels the capital shares are trading above
their fair value.
In addition to the three individual classes of share, the trust also created
two combinations of securities. The packaged units consist of one zero
dividend preference, one income and one capital share and, to most intents
and purposes, are just like ordinary shares in a conventional investment
trust. Those private investors who bought into the trust via the personal
equity plan will have received packaged units.
There are also geared ordinary units which consist of one income and one
capital share. These accordingly receive a high level of income (the present
yield is 11.6 per cent) but have the chance of capital growth.
Middleton says it is important that investors do not get too caught up in
the mathematical calculations. The key to the success of the trust is that
recovery stocks continue their recent outperformance.
Key facts
The trust has assets of Pounds 263.5m and is due to be wound up in 2001. The
manager's annual fee is 0.75 per cent of assets minus current liabilities;
half this fee is charged to income and half to capital.
Board
The chairman is Paddy Linaker, deputy chairman and group managing director
of M &amp; G. Other M &amp; G staff on the board are John Allard and Anthony
Shearer. Outside directors are Bryan Hines, former general manager of ICI's
insurance and investments group; Donald Macpherson, deputy chairman of
County NatWest; and Neil Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle.
Savings plan and Pep details
The Pep was designed specifically for the trust's launch and is no longer on
offer, although investors could put trust shares into a self-select Pep.
There is no savings scheme.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): B&amp;B doesn't apply to
land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I own a site that could be given planning permission for
development. If that happens, we could get a Pounds 40,000 capital gain.
We also own a commercial property that we bought for Pounds 100,000 but is
now worth only about Pounds 60,000. Is there any reason why we should not
bed and breakfast the commercial property at Pounds 60,000 to crystallise
the loss, and use that loss to offset the potential capital gain on the
development site?
Alternatively, rather than bed and breakfasting, is there any reason why I
should not transfer the commercial property into my name at Pounds 60,000 to
crystallise the loss and avoid the capital gains tax?
Unfortunately, you seem to have missed our article about bed and
breakfasting on March 7 last year. The closing paragraphs would have warned
you that land cannot be bed and breakfasted:
'It is worthwhile to re-state the basic principles of traditional bed and
breakfast for listed shares . . .
There must not be any agreement on day one (the day of the 'bed' sale) that
a 'breakfast' purchase will take place on day two.
Full beneficial ownership must pass to the counter-party on day one.
These basic principles are readily satisfied on the stock exchange, of
course, but they make it virtually impossible to do an effective B&amp;B outside
the exchange.'
Transferring property from the joint ownership of husband and wife (either
as joint tenants or as tenants-in-common) to the sole ownership of one
spouse does not produce an allowable loss (or a chargeable gain), because of
section 58 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.
The rules are outlined in the free pamphlet CGT15 (Capital gains tax: a
guide for married couples).
Furthermore, a simple sale of the commercial property would not produce a
usable allowable loss if it was sold to a 'connected person', as defined in
section 286 of the TCGA (including a parent, parent-in-law, sibling or
sibling-in-law), because of section 18(3).
You should consult your solicitor on the possible application of section 776
of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (Transactions in land: taxation
of capital gains) to the sale of the development site.
If this section is applied - and it looks likely, from the bare facts given
 -then there could be no offset of a CGT allowable loss in any event.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): No double tax relief on
these dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FULLY-FRANKED dividends from Australia are subject to a 39 per cent
Australian imputation tax, and I believe an Australian resident receives the
net amount without paying further taxes. My bank subjects the net amount
received here in the UK to full UK taxes, without any double tax relief.
Is this procedure correct, since dividends are then doubly taxed?
The new Australian tax system, where there is an imputation credit attached
to each dividend, means there is no further tax payable for Australian
residents. Shareholders who are not resident in Australia normally receive
dividends subject to a withholding tax of 15 per cent deducted at source on
the gross amount of the dividend. However, dividends received in franked
form are free from dividend withholding tax but no refund of the imputation
credit is available. It follows that, as the imputation credit is not a tax
as such, the dividends are not taxed in Australia and are, therefore, fully
taxable in the UK.

answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Flight plan is filed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Flight is the latest unit trust company to launch a combined bond
and equity fund attached to a personal equity plan. The attraction of such
funds is that they can offer a higher yield than many conventional Peps (5.7
per cent after charges in Guinness Flight's case) without taking high risks.
Provided the new fund, called the Equity &amp; Bond income trust, holds more
than 50 per cent in equities, it will qualify for Pep status. In fact, the
aim is to hold around 60 per cent in equities.
Investors do not get something for nothing, of course; the higher yield
comes at the expense of the prospects for capital growth. But with base
rates at 6 per cent, many investors might well be attracted by a 5.7 per
cent tax-free yield, paid quarterly.
The charges on the fund depend on whether you take the Pep option. If you
do, the initial charge is 2 per cent (reduced to 1.5 per cent until the
offer period ends on June 25); if you want only the unit trust, the charge
is 5 per cent (cut to 3.5 per cent during the offer period). The annual
management fee is 1 per cent on the unit trust, with an additional 0.25 per
cent on the Pep.
There are also exit fees for Pep investors if they want to withdraw money in
the early years: 3 per cent in year one, 2 per cent in year two and 1 per
cent in year three. The minimum investment in the trust is Pounds 1,000; for
Pep investors, it is Pounds 3,000, or Pounds 100 a month.
How does the fund compare with three similar products launched earlier this
year from Cazenove, Fidelity and M &amp; G? The charging structure is very
similar to Fidelity's, as is the yield (Fidelity pays around 5.8 per cent at
present), but Fidelity offers the facility to pay income monthly.
Cazenove's Bond &amp; Utility fund offers a higher yield - 7 per cent - caused,
in part, by its lower charges. Some investors, however, may like the wider
spread of equities on offer from Guinness Flight. Its fund invests in a wide
range of high-yielding stocks instead of limiting itself to utilities such
as BT or the water stocks.
The M &amp; G Managed Income fund yields only 4.13 per cent and has higher
initial and annual charges. But it has a higher proportion of equities than
any of the other funds and offers better scope for capital growth.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Annuity gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST PEOPLE who retire choose a flat rate annuity, since those tend to pay
the highest immediate income. But, in fact, there is a wide variety of
annuities.
These include some which rise in line with inflation and others where the
returns are linked to the stock market.
The table shows both conventional annuities and those which offer income
that increases by 3 per cent a year. As you can see, the initial returns on
offer on the level annuity are around a third higher.
An investor who picked the top escalating rate from Royal Life would take 11
years to catch up with the Pounds 8,723 on offer from the top-level rate. As
with much else, therefore, the choice represents a gamble - in this case, on
the life expectancy of the investor.
The figures were provided by the Annuity Bureau Limited, 11-12 Hanover
Square, London W1R 9HD, tel. 071-495 1495.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Plan ahead for holiday cash - Bethan
Hutton suggests some ways to make the traveller's life more tolerable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLERS' tales of nights under the stars and eating for a pittance from
authentic street stalls may make wonderfully escapist reading, but most
people's idea of a holiday involves comfortable accommodation, good
restaurants and, perhaps, a spot of shopping.
If you are unlucky, though, you could return to tell picturesque tales of
living on a shoestring. Cash can be stolen, credit cards rejected, and
travellers' cheques take time to replace if they go missing.
The combination of cash, plastic and cheques you choose depends on your
destination. If you are going somewhere for the first time, ask your travel
agent what is likely to be acceptable - you could be surprised. Sterling
travellers' cheques can be cashed in some of the most exotic locations, but
only with extreme difficulty in the US. Travellers' cheques in dollars are
the easiest to change internationally.
Most people find it useful to buy at least some of the local currency in
advance for airport and other on-the-spot expenses. Check, though, on
currency restrictions: some countries do not allow their money out of the
country, or only in very small amounts.
Some currency suppliers charge a flat rate commission and others a
percentage, usually with a specified minimum (see table). But good deals
available widely include American Express offices for any single currency;
National Westminster for more than Pounds 175 worth of two or more
currencies; and Midland for less than Pounds 175 worth of two or more
currencies.
The replacement service for lost or stolen travellers' cheques makes them
about the safest holiday money option, but keep a separate note of the
numbers of those that remain unspent. Remember, too, that such cheques can
be expensive to buy (shop around first) and cash abroad. They can also incur
a charge when you return those you have not used. If you are not careful,
you could end up paying commission three times over.
You can buy cheques in at least 14 different currencies in the UK. If the
one you want is not available, ask which other is likely to be easiest to
change.
When getting cheques, ask if the seller will buy back unused ones free of
charge. Thomas Cook, American Express and most banks buy back their own
without commission, but some banks charge for non-sterling cheques and
building societies may not buy them back at all.
American Express, the inventor of travellers' cheques, still offers one of
the better deals in the UK with a 1 per cent commission charge (and no
minimum) on cheques in sterling and seven other currencies. They can be
cashed commission-free at Amex offices abroad.
Anyone planning to take advantage of last-minute holiday bargains should
check how far in advance currency and cheques need to be ordered. The main
clearing banks recommend allowing at least three to five working days for
currency or non-sterling cheques.
Some branches keep stocks of the currencies requested most often. But Amex
and Thomas Cook stock cash in several dozen currencies, and cheques in eight
or 12 respectively. Other currencies normally can be obtained within 24
hours.
Plastic has obvious attractions for holiday spending but it does have
drawbacks. Visa and MasterCard are accepted in around 10m outlets worldwide
and American Express in around 3.5m. In many parts of the world, though,
cash is still the norm and you might find paying by card limits where you
can eat and shop.
At the other extreme, there are countries like France where electronic
payments are standard and British travellers could be caught out by advanced
technology. In the UK, most retailers can process a transaction by hand if a
card's magnetic strip is faulty, but this alternative might not be available
over the Channel. Check your card for wear before you go and get a
replacement if necessary.
Because many British credit card-holders never use them to withdraw cash,
they never bother to find out their pin numbers. If you are holidaying in
Europe, however, a pin number could be crucial - they can be required at
such places as fully-automated petrol stations. You might even need a pin
number when using a card across the counter in banks and shops.
Fraud is also a serious problem, particularly in the Far East where
counterfeiters use details from credit card slips or carbons to make new
cards. Elizabeth Phillips, of Credit Card Research, suggests: 'Rather than
giving the card to the waiter at the table, you should go with him and stay
with it.' Insist on credit card carbons being torn up in front of you.
Using a credit card to withdraw cash can be a useful fallback option, but
beware of hidden costs. As well as the commission charge - commonly 1.5 per
cent with a minimum of Pounds 1.50 - remember that interest will be charged
from the date of the transaction rather than that of the statement. Most
credit card-issuers also add 1-3 per cent to standard exchange rates when
converting foreign transactions to sterling.
Frequent travellers to Europe may find a Eurocheque book and card
worthwhile. These allow you to write cheques in the local currencies of 40
European countries, and use a network of 50,000 cash machines. But, for
once-a-year tourists, the annual fee of around Pounds 8 charged by most
banks, plus minimum fees of Pounds 1.10-Pounds 2 for each one, may make
Eurocheques unattractive compared with traditional travellers' cheques.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Ulster power sell-off - a bright
long term prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS INVESTORS contemplate buying into Northern Ireland Electricity, the
utility company which goes on sale later this month, they can take heart
from the knowledge that the government likes to be generous when selling off
state assets.
By far the majority of privatised government stocks have outperformed the
market - that is, fared better than the average share - both immediately
after flotation and in subsequent years.
Investing in former public sector companies does not guarantee success, as
buyers of shares in British Steel and British Aerospace can testify. Both
have underperformed the FTSE-100 index by 50 per cent since their
privatisations in 1988 and 1981 respectively, although in BAe's case the
underperformance has occurred mainly in the last two years.
However, BAe and British Steel are the exceptions rather than the rule. More
typical - and more relevant to NIE - is the performance of the electricity
companies since privatisation of the sector began three years ago.
Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric, considered to be the tightest priced of
all electricity stocks in the electricity privatisation process, have seen
their share rise from 240p in June 1991 to 323p and 342p respectively. If
they had merely kept pace with the market, their prices would be 279p.
NIE's flotation benefits from the more generous approach which the
government displayed in privatising the England and Wales electricity
companies. One view is that this is because the NIE flotation will face
competition for funds from the sale of the third tranche of BT shares.
Northern Ireland Electricity procures electricity from the province's four
generators, privatised separately last year, and transmits and supplies it
to the whole of the province. The company is being offered at Pounds 362m,
consisting of 164.6m shares of 220p each.
For utility investors, the most important consideration is the dividend
yield, and for NIE this is high. The average historic yield for the regional
electricity companies in the England and Wales is about 5.3 per cent; for
NIE it is 5.8 per cent.
This, together with the City's positive view of NIE's management and
prospects, means that, barring unexpected changes in the market, shares in
the company are likely to rise on the first day of trading on June 21. Some
analysts believe 10 per cent is possible.
That does not necessarily mean that everyone should apply for shares.
Investors hoping for large, quick profits will probably be disappointed.
More than 800,000 people have registered an interest in the shares, and that
means that some may get less than 100 shares, the minimum application.
Profits, after dealing costs, of such a small amount of shares would be
virtually negligible. Investors should therefore consider the long term.
Among concerns about tying up capital for long periods will be the
unpredicatibility of Northern Ireland politics. Government practice is to
replace assets which have been damaged through terrorism but there are no
cast iron guarantees. Even if all costs of a terrorist attack were
recovered, there could be long term effects on staff morale and
productivity.
Analysts believe such considerations are outweighed by the positive elements
offered by NIE. Chief among these is that the regulatory regime covering the
province is settled until at least 1997.
In England and Wales, the regulator has said that he may refer the
generators to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, and the 12 regional
electricity companies (Recs) face regulatory reviews over the next year
which could limit their ability to increase profits and increase dividends.
Northern Ireland has no such uncertainty and its innovatory regulatory
regime means that most of the prospective income in transmission and
distribution is guaranteed, regardless of whether sales go up and down. If
unit sales fall, NIE is allowed to raise its prices.
This is a double edged sword. It increases potential for slack marketing in
the lead-up to the competitive threat posed by British Gas which may start
selling gas to households from the middle of the decade. However, it also
provides the company with an even greater incentive for cutting costs. The
scope is considerable given that there are six employees per thousand
customers compared with the Recs' 3.6.
All this means that NIE should be able to increase dividends by about 12 per
cent a year for the next four years and most analysts are advising clients
to apply for shares. Some, including John Wilson, of UBS, believe it may
even be worth buying shares in the market early on the first day of trading,
before prices rise significantly.
'The company makes an excellent long term investment and provides a good
hedge against the regulatory risk of the electricity companies in England
and Wales,' he says. Additional research by Ewan MacDonald.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The benefits of legal insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE HAWTHORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN PEOPLE think of buying a property, they look at its price, condition,
position, and the mortgage terms. Equally important, but often ignored, can
be the neighbours.
Even if you complete the purchase after confirming they are environmentally
perfect, this situation might not last. They could themselves sell and move,
to be replaced by hordes of hyperactive children playing hyperactive games
until midnight, or by groups of motorcyclists all seemingly practising for a
race.
And even if you buy a property in 10 isolated acres, your neighbour could
decide to change from arable to pig farming so that your land smells not of
vine but swine.
Situations such as these, along with rubbish tipping, car parking and
boundary disputes, often lead to arguments and, in the worst cases, to
violence. A London-based group, the Right to Peace and Quiet, claims some
people can even be driven to suicide by such ever-increasing urban noises as
barking dogs, loudspeakers and DIY activities.
So, how so you deal with these difficult (and sometimes life-threatening)
situations? You have two remedies: mediation and litigation.
John Crawley is an authority on the former and one of the authors of a new
book Neighbour Disputes (Institute of Housing, Pounds 10.95) which deals
with the various rules and laws that apply in such cases. He says you should
first talk to your neighbour about the problem.
If that fails to produce an amicable solution, approach the local mediation
service. Mediation UK (0272-241-234), funded by charitable organisations,
supplies its various addresses free of charge while Conflict Management Plus
(081-802-3525) provides a professional mediation service.
Persistent noise-makers may be served a notice by the local authority under
the Environmental Protection Act. Failure to comply will lead to court
action and the offender could be fined Pounds 2,000.
The London borough of Camden has evicted nine tenants for noise over the
past year, including one which the judge called 'the worst case of nuisance
I have ever heard.' Another 59 cases are in the pipeline.
Even if you opt initially for mediation, it is still wise to cover yourself
with a legal expenses policy in case you have to take further - and more
costly - action. This type of policy is often sold as an add-on to other
insurance policies, but family legal benefits insurance, from the Legal
Protection Group, (081-661-1491) is sold direct or through intermediaries.
It gives you the choice of two levels of indemnity: Pounds 25,000 a claim
for an annual premium of Pounds 195, or Pounds 50,000 a claim (up to an
annual total of Pounds 250,000) for a premium of Pounds 234. There is an
extra Pounds 55 charge for any additional property you might own in the UK.
DAS legal expenses insurance offers two types of protection. Consumer and
accident cover, from DAS legal expenses insurance, helps to protect your
legal rights in domestic and contractual disputes. It is sold as an add-on
to household insurance policies through DAS agents.
The Homeowners legal protection policy is sold direct (0272-290321) or
through intermediaries and covers disputes arising over the renting or
occupation of your own home or any other you might own in the UK.
It costs Pounds 120 a year for cover up to Pounds 25,000 for each claim,
including hotel expenses up to Pounds 50 a day. (In an emergency, such as a
burst pipe, you can call DAS for one of its repairers, although you will
have to foot the bill.)
Hambro's family legal protection (0206-870-570) can be sold as an add-on to
almost any type of personal insurance or financial service.
It covers one family living at the same address for legal claims relating to
this residence, plus a variety of other claims. Maximum cover is Pounds
25,000 for each.
One thing to remember. With all legal expenses and protection policies, it
is essential to check the exclusion clauses.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Cash trusts chase savers' money -
Bethan Hutton examines a challenge to the building societies and finds there
are definite advantages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS with a few thousand pounds who want to earn a reasonable rate of
interest but need the money to be accessible often assume that their only
real option is a building society. But a growing number of people are
turning to cash unit trusts. These offer rates as good or better than the
societies, are equally secure and have no interest penalty for withdrawals.
Cash unit trusts invest in the money markets where banks and other financial
institutions lend and borrow. This means they can offer yields very close to
bank base rates. From the consumer's point of view, they operate in a very
similar way to building society postal accounts, with deposits and
withdrawals carried out through the post. Some even allow withdrawals to be
arranged over the 'phone. Most charge a 0.5 per cent annual management fee,
but yields are quoted net of that.
The interest rolls up within the trust to increase the price of the units
(the exception is Fidelity, where the unit price stays the same, and the
investor's holding of units increases). Indeed, Fidelity was the first to
launch a cash unit trust in the UK, in April 1989. Since then, more than 30
have been started, ranging from tiny funds with only a couple of hundred
thousand invested, to Fidelity - still the biggest  - with Pounds 126m.
Govett's MIS cash fund was set up to cater for private client brokers and
other professionals, with a minimum investment of Pounds 100,000. Since
April, though, the minimum has been cut to Pounds 2,000 to appeal to a
broader range of investors. 'I think the general public are beginning to
realise that there are alternatives to the old-fashioned high street deposit
accounts,' says Govett's Ian Taylor.
In the US, cash unit trusts (known as money market mutual funds) for savings
are common, especially following the collapse of large numbers of thrifts -
the equivalent of building societies. In the UK, societies are seen as a
very safe bet but, because fund managers check their investments carefully
and spread the risk between a number of institutions, cash unit trusts can
be just as secure. Fidelity's recently got a triple A rating from Moody's,
higher than the banks and building societies in which it invests.
In fact, investors of large amounts are likely to fare better if a unit
trust collapses than a building society, as they are covered by different
compensation schemes. Depositors can claim only 90 per cent of the first
Pounds 20,000 invested in a failed society whereas trust investors can claim
all of the first Pounds 30,000 plus 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000.
One potential disadvantage to non-taxpayers of cash unit trusts is that
income is paid net, so tax has to be reclaimed, unlike income from building
societies, which can be paid gross. But the last Budget gave trusts a slight
advantage over comparable society accounts for basic-rate taxpayers.
Income from trusts is subject to corporation tax, which was cut from 25 per
cent to 22.5 per cent for this financial year, and 20 per cent next year.
Once this has been paid, there is no extra income tax liability for basic
rate-payers. Building society interest is paid net of basic rate income tax,
which remains at 25 per cent.
James Higgins, of independent financial adviser Chamberlain De Broe, points
out, however, that the benefits of cash unit trusts compared with building
societies can be marginal, and says trusts may see them as a way to draw in
investors who can then be sold other products. Fidelity's cash account,
which yields 5.3 per cent, has followed societies into offering additional
facilities. Around 5,000 of its 12,500 customers have cheque-books, which
are offered to any investor with a balance of more than Pounds 5,000 (the
minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 50 a month), as are gold
MasterCards. Fidelity is now test-marketing a cash card.
Govett, like most of the cash unit trusts, does not offer a cheque-book or
other extras. It charges an initial 0.5 per cent, 0.5 per cent annually, and
yields 5.1 per cent. Prudential's Cash Haven makes an 0.5 per cent initial
and 1 per cent annual charge on minimum investments of Pounds 1,000. It is
the second-biggest fund, with Pounds 122m invested, and also yields 5.1 per
cent.
Scottish Amicable Maximum Income is unusual in that it is sold through
agents; because of this, it makes an initial charge of 2.5 per cent to allow
for commission but it yields 5.46 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds
5,000 and additional sums deposited must be at least Pounds 500. Capital
House caters for those with a smaller amount to invest - its minimum initial
deposit is Pounds 500, or Pounds 30 a month, and it yields 5.21 per cent.
Mercury's cash fund, which yields 5.46 per cent, has a minimum deposit of
Pounds 1,000. It does not offer a cheque-book but the company is examining
options to find out what customers want.
Shopping around can unearth some building society accounts offering interest
rates higher than cash unit trusts on similar balances. Birmingham Midshires
pays 6.75 per cent on balances over Pounds 500 in its First Class postal
account. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's London Share postal account offers 6.25
on more than Pounds 2,500, while Bradford &amp; Bingley's Direct Premium postal
account pays 6 per cent on more than Pounds 1,000.
But figures from Moneyfacts show that many instant access accounts at major
societies offer less than cash unit trusts. Alliance &amp; Leicester pays 4.65
per cent on Pounds 5,000 in its instant access account, the Woolwich 4.1 per
cent on the same sum, and the Halifax 4.6 per cent. So, it could be
worthwhile for many investors to switch.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the airport operator, has enjoyed upgraded forecasts in recent weeks
ahead of its full-year results on Monday. Traffic growth has meant more
revenues from landing fees and retail trade. Pre-tax profits could approach
Pounds 300m against Pounds 192m. A Pounds 30m gain on the sale of its
electrical distribution network will be offset by provisions on property.
Northern Foods is expected to report on Wednesday pre-tax profits for the
full year a shade above Pounds 150m, up from Pounds 126.2m a year earlier.
The forecast increase reflects a strong performance by short shelf-life
foods, notably the convenience meals supplied to Marks &amp; Spencer, and
continued gains from post-acquisition rationalisation of the Express milk
operations.
However, biscuits and other grocery products are expected to show the impact
of recession, while high beef and pork prices have offset the benefits of
efficiency improvements in the processed meat businesses.
Unigate, the food and distribution group, is expected on Tuesday to announce
profits almost unchanged at Pounds 93m for the year to March 31. Analysts
will be watching to see whether the company has recovered from a
disappointing first half, and also at Unigate's gearing levels.
Pilkington, the glass group which announces results on Thursday, is expected
to announce a sharp fall in profits from Pounds 77m to Pounds 37m for the
year to March 31. But attention is likely to focus on Pilkington's cash flow
and the dividend, which the company maintained by raiding reserves at the
interim stage.
Vodafone, the cellular telephone network spun off from Racal, has benefited
from a sharp increase in new subscribers. Pre-tax profits for the year to
March, to be announced on Tuesday, are forecast at about Pounds 320m against
Pounds 272m a year earlier.
PowerGen, the smaller of the two main electricity generators, has seen a
small erosion of its market share during the year but cost cutting will have
helped it life pre-tax profits to about Pounds 415m from Pounds 359m.
Christian Salvesen, the distribution group, is expected to report pre-tax
profits for the year to March of around Pounds 75m.

<TEXT>
THE WEEK started with a bang as Sir Bernard Ashley and his family sold a
total of 30m shares in Laura Ashley at 108p. This came shortly after his
announcement that he would step down as chairman to become non-executive
life president. The sale also furthered the family's stated intention to
reduce its holding to about 30 per cent over time.
The other significant sales were in Domestic &amp; General, the fast-growing UK
insurance company. Martin Copley and Howard James, respectively chairman and
managing director, have been prominent in reducing their holdings in recent
years. The shares have been consistently good performers and the latest
deals came after a near-50 per cent rise in the share price since the
beginning of the year.
Osprey Communications has featured recently under the 'purchases' section,
but a sale of 500,000 shares at 36p was made by Frederick French, who
resigns as chairman and chief executive as soon as the acquisition of SMS is
complete.

Fidelity (0800-222 190) charges a minimum commission of Pounds 25 on deals
worth less than Pounds 2,500. Above that level, dealing charges are: Pounds
2,501-Pounds 5,000 (Pounds 50); Pounds 5,001-Pounds 7,500 (Pounds 60);

US shares. US discount broker Charles Schwab (071-495 7444) opened recently
for business in London and charges an over-riding minimum of Dollars 39 for
dealing in US shares. Based on transaction sizes, commission rates are: up

1,000 shares, plus 4 cents a share therafter (for stocks trading below
Dollars 5 a share) or 5 cents (for stocks above Dollars 5).
Fidelity deals in US securities at rates which vary according to the
following scale: deals worth less than Dollars 2,500 (Dollars 29.50 plus 1.7

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Taking stock: how to find the right
broker - Philip Coggan on the choices you face if you want to invest in
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC image of stockbrokers has often been poor. Either they are seen
as the haughty pin-striped types, who will not let you through the door
unless you are a millionaire; or they are portrayed as spivs on the lines of
Private Walker in Dad's Army, trading on wild rumours or inside information.
These stereotypes are nowadays fundamentally unfair. The harsh laws of
economics have made more and more brokers willing to welcome clients of
modest means, and using some of the cheap and cheerful telephone dealing
services is no more daunting than ordering theatre tickets by phone.
So investors who are looking for an alternative to the building society
should not be frightened of approaching a broker. But how do you find the
right one for you?
First decide what type of service you need. In essence, there are three
types of stockbroking service. Execution-only brokers will buy and sell
shares on your behalf, but will not offer advice on which stocks to select.
Advisory brokers will trade for you but will also discuss the wisdom of your
decisions, and suggest their own trades. In addition, they may help with tax
planning or portfolio construction.
Both the above types of service earn their corn by the commissions they
charge every time you deal. Discretionary brokers assume command of your
portfolio and take all the investment decisions. Some still take their
reward in the form of commission but more and more are switching to fees,
based on a proportion of assets under management.
For the client, this has the advantage of creating a coincidence of interest
between himself and his broker; if the portfolio does well, the broker's fee
rises. It also reduces the threat of 'churning' the portfolio - excessive
dealing to earn commission - although this partly depends on whether
commissions are charged on top of fees.
For the broker, a fee represents a steady source of income. The industry has
tended to polarise in recent years between execution-only brokers and the
discretionary kind. In part, this is because some brokers found advisory
services unprofitable, with a long list of clients who seldom bothered to
deal. Another factor is that the dealing commissions of advisory brokers are
undercut by the execution-only firms.
But Paul Killik of the London-based Killik maintains that clients still
appreciate an advisory service. 'It gives the client the chance to kick
ideas around with somebody else. They are happy to do that for the cost of
an extra 0.4 of a percentage point in commission,' he says.
Killik adds: 'Clients may think they are saving a few pounds commission
using an execution-only broker but they may get legged over in the market
when it comes to the prices at which they deal.'
Brian Tora of London-based broker Greig Middleton says it is a great help to
be able to bounce ideas off people at the other end of the telephone.
'Advisory brokers can give you greater control of timing, and add a certain
perspective to your own research' he argues. Greig Middleton offers a
service called Assetcare where commission is reduced and can be offset
against fees.
It is very hard to judge whether the advice of a broker is value for money.
Accordingly, it is just as difficult to choose between one advisory broker
and another. All one can rely on are three qualitative rather than
quantitative criteria: do you know someone who can recommend a broker? do
you feel comfortable with the individual who will be your point of contact
with the advisory firm? and are the ancillary services provided by the
broker - tax planning etc - of the standard you seek?
When it comes to a discretionary service, there is a little more evidence to
go on. Few brokers will give performance figures for the 'average client' on
the grounds that the needs of their clients differ fundamentally; some want
income, some want growth; some are very cautious, others are willing to take
substantial risks.
But often firms will manage collective funds such as unit or investment
trusts, and investors can check their performance records in publications
such as our sister magazine, Money Management.
The size of the fees (or combination of fees and commissions) being charged
is another obvious criterion for assessment. Another factor may be whether
the broker will invest your portfolio directly into equities or (normally if
your holding is worth less than Pounds 100,000) into unit or investment
trusts.
There is nothing wrong with the latter course and indeed some brokers, such
as City firm Foster &amp; Braithwaite make a speciality out of it. On the other
hand, some investors might find it more interesting to own a stake in Marks
&amp; Spencer and Glaxo than in the M &amp; G Dividend fund.
If you are giving a broker complete discretion over your funds, then you
will need a high level of trust in the individual handling your account. But
you should also expect a good service in the form of regular valuations,
handling of dividend income and your capital gains tax position and so on.
Price is the obvious way to compare execution-only services and some details
are given in the article on the right. But there are other factors. Some
brokers, such as Fidelity's, offer money market accounts in which investors'
cash earns interest in between deals. On the other hand, Fidelity's service
is nominee-based and many investors might prefer to own the shares in their
own names, as occurs at Sharelink.
Although there is a tendency to think that those who use execution-only
services are 'on their own' in terms of investment decisions, brokers can
give factual information or pass on details of what other brokers are
recommending.
Sharelink, for example, offers an excellent low cost range of information
including reports of analysts's recommendations for Pounds 2.95 and company
reports for Pounds 4.95.
The toll-free telephone lines available from services such as Fidelity may
appeal as may those brokers who have phone lines open at weekends, or who
can deal in overseas securities (see article on right for US dealing
details).
In terms of sheer cheapness, the Share Centre (0442-890800) offers a
tone-phone service with a minimum commission of just Pounds 8. This service
is available only for privatisation shares plus Abbey National and TSB.
Finally, if you are only interested in selling individual shares, perhaps
acquired through privatisations, you may well find special deals on offer
through banks and building societies. The upcoming BT3 offer will involve
150 'share shops', many of which will be seeking to attract new customers by
offering special incentives to those who register for the BT offer. The
Weekend FT will try to give details of these special offers over the next
few weeks.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Markets: Dealers obsessed with simple little number - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETIMES, as every well-dressed woman knows, a plain black dress outshines
the most glamorous couture.
So it was with Wall Street this week. A multi-billion dollar alliance
between British Telecom and MCI, the second largest long-distance telephone
company in the US, and a record-breaking flotation failed to divert
investors from one simple concern: inflation.
Having spurted to an all-time closing high 10 days ago, the US stock market
hung on to these levels for the first couple of days after the Memorial Day
weekend. But it failed to push ahead to new highs, and the closing levels on
Tuesday and Wednesday fell slightly shy of 3554.83-mark which the Dow Jones
Industrial Average had reached on the previous Thursday.
Moreover, by the latter half of the week, traders were obsessed with the
employment data due to be released on Friday morning. In the event, they had
good reason to be worried. The May employment report showed a rise 209,000
of in non-farm payrolls last month - considerably more than the 155,000
which many analysts had predicted. The unemployment rate fell by one-tenth
of a percentage point, from 7 to 6.9 per cent. Most forecasts had suggested
that it would stay unchanged.
On the one hand, the surprisingly strong numbers seemed to alleviate some of
the recent concerns about the strength of the US economy's recovery. But
from the viewpoint of both the equity and bond markets, they also reinforced
the notion that inflation may have crept back into the system - in turn,
suggesting that the Federal Reserve will seek to raise interest rates.
Long-dated government securities slipped on news of the jobs data, bond
yields rose, and shares prices eased back. By the close, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average had recovered slightly to end up 0.27 at 3,545.14.
Perhaps the best description of Wall Street's current mood came from the
pundit who likened it to a tug-of-war. At one end of the rope are the bulls,
who see an economy rebounding but with enough lingering weakness to hold
inflation at bay. At the other are the bears, who see rising prices and
interest rates at every turn. Last week was a small victory for the latter.
Amid these 'big issues', few stocks grabbed much of the spotlight. The
notable exception was in the telecommunications sector where repercussions
from the BT-MCI link-up were widespread. Essentially, the deal involves BT
investing Dollars 4.3bn for a 20 per cent stake in MCI, and the two
companies in setting up a Dollars 1bn-plus joint venture. This enterprise,
in which BT will hold the majority stake, plans to concentrate on
fast-growing demand from multinationals for international voice and data
transmission services. As such, it represents a direct challenge to efforts
by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph to corner this type of international
custom.
BT will invest its money in MCI in two tranches, and the deal will not be
completed until 1994. Still, with BT prepared to pay an average Dollars 64
per MCI share, the US company's stock rose sharply and hung on to some of
those gains. MCI shares, which had closed at Dollars 52 ahead of the deal's
announcement, were trading at more than Dollars 54 on Friday morning.
By contrast, A T &amp; T, which also announced last week that it was linking up
with Viacom to test a new video-on-demand technology, dipped immediately but
quickly recovered. They ended the week little changed. BT's American
Depositary Receipts were the loser, shedding about Dollars 4 to end the week
at Dollars 64 1/4 .
The other important event of the week was the flotation of a 20 per cent
stake in Allstate, the second largest writer of home and car insurance
policies in the US after State Farm. It was wholly-owned by Sears, Roebuck.
But Sears has pledged to concentrate on its core retailing interest - and
the flotation of a minority interest in Allstate is part of this strategy.
Late on Thursday, the Allstate issue was priced at Dollars 27 a share, at
the upper end of the indicated range and ensuring proceeds of over Dollars
2.1bn. This made the sale the biggest 'initial public offering' ever seen in
the US, easily outstripping Conrail's Dollars 1.64bn share sale in 1987. By
the end of the week, moreover, Allstate's underwriters and its new-found
investors had every reason to smile: the insurers shares had moved to a
healthy premium, at Dollars 28 7/8 .
Meanwhile, BT was not the only transatlantic stock to win some attention.
Investors indulged a flurry of 'dividend-stripping' at Hanson, causing the
UK conglomerate's ADR to become the most-actively traded issue on the Big
Board on Wednesday. This time, however, there was no multi-billion deal to
underpin the interest, and the ADR price remained unchanged.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Markets: A new way to put Pep in a mortgage - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER SINCE personal equity plans were first sold in 1987, there has been
scope for investors to use them as a mortgage repayment vehicle. They would
appear to have many advantages: tax-free income and growth; a return based
on equities (which have been shown repeatedly to be the best long-term
investment); and flexibility. But the Pep mortgage has failed singularly to
break through into the territory of the endowment policy.
The initial problem was lender reluctance to accept a Pep as security. More
recently, it seems to have been the low rates of commission paid relative to
endowment policies; this reduces the incentive for brokers to sell Pep
mortgages.
A new product on offer from Capital House, part of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, aims to challenge the endowment's domination. The Synergy mortgage
plan combines a unit trust Pep with life assurance. The idea is that the
combined premium will be lower than for an endowment designed to repay the
same sum.
There are some ingenious features. The amount of life insurance varies each
month, so that the Pep's value, plus the life insurance, is always equal to
the loan. Therefore as the Pep increases in value, less needs to be spent on
life insurance and more can be invested.
In order to sell the idea, Capital House has put together a packaged
product, thereby giving it scope for paying greater commission. The snag for
the borrower is some endowment-style charges. For a 25-year loan, half the
first two years' premiums will disappear in fees. In addition, a flat
administration fee of Pounds 2.35 is deducted from each monthly payment. The
underlying unit trusts have a 6 per cent initial charge and an annual fee of
1.25 or 1.5 per cent.
Given all these charges, how is it that the plan is 'cheaper' than an
endowment? In part, this reflects the costs involved in an endowment policy.
But it also relates to growth assumptions of the policy. In order to repay a
mortgage, you must assume that the money invested grows at a set rate per
year. The higher the growth rate you assume, the smaller the premiums you
need to repay a given sum.
In the case of the Synergy mortgage, Capital House is assuming a 10.5 per
cent growth rate, the middle of the range permitted by regulators for Peps.
When quoting rates for endowment policies, the assumed growth rate is
normally around 7.5 or 8 per cent.
Of course, returns within a Pep are free of both income and capital gains
tax. Although the eventual payout from an endowment policy is tax-free, the
life fund in which the money is invested is subject to tax. So, it is
legitimate to assume that a Pep will grow at a faster rate.
There is nothing guaranteed about it, though; indeed, the regulatory growth
assumptions will shortly be reduced so that, from September, Capital House
will probably have to quote on the basis of 9 per cent returns. There are
other factors which might upset the assumptions; tax rates on dividends may
change (as they did in the Budget); Peps could be abolished (in which case,
the unit trust element would continue but the tax breaks would diminish);
and a very good life fund manager might outperform a Pep fund manager.
The investment assumptions are very important. Take the example of a male,
aged 40, wanting to borrow Pounds 50,000. The Capital House sum requires a
premium of Pounds 66.85 a month compared with Pounds 72-Pounds 80 for
endowment policies. But if you assume the Pep grows at only 8.5 per cent a
year, the plan would fall short of repaying the mortgage by some Pounds
13,600.
In practice, this would not happen. Premiums would be increased when it
became clear investment performance was worse than expected. But suppose
that endowment providers, instead of assuming 7.5 per cent returns, went
nearer the top of the permitted range allowed by regulators.
Take the premium needed to repay a Pounds 30,000 loan for a male aged 29.
Capital House quotes Pounds 37.45 a month. Standard Life, quoting on the
same basis, came up with Pounds 42.84 a month on its normal assumed growth
rate of 7.5 per cent. Had it assumed 9 per cent a year, its quote would have
been Pounds 35.07; and at 10.5 per cent a year, the premium dropped to
Pounds 28.74.
A Pep is more flexible than an endowment. Investors should not suffer unduly
if they want to cash in their plan - and repay the mortgage - after, say, 18
years. The value of their plan is easy to ascertain. But the surrender value
of a with-profits endowment after 18 years is at the discretion of the life
company. Even the more transparent unitised with-profits policies allow for
a 'market adjustment factor' on early surrender.
The cautious might argue that there is no equivalent to the with-profits
endowment policy's 'guaranteed sum' on the Synergy plan. But the guaranteed
sum is not sufficient to repay the mortgage; it is simply the base sum to
which bonuses are added.
What about the investment credentials of Capital House? The Pep is based on
two unit trusts; Managed, and Income &amp; Growth. The former, previously known
as Global Opportunities, was 81st out of 116 funds in its sector over five
years; the latter was 13th out of 97 over the same period.
One hopes that the example of Capital House will spur other investment
groups to push the Pep mortgage, giving investors the prospect of
competition on charges and a choice of funds for investment.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Markets: Investing in the cult of personality - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON WEDNESDAY, the stock market had to divide its attention between a Pounds
500m bet on the property cycle and a Dollars 5bn commitment to global
leadership in the 21st century's most important industry.
No prizes for guessing which stimulated more excitement. It was the
announcement that George Soros, 'the man who broke the Bank of England' on
Black Wednesday, was buying a Pounds 34m stake in British Land and setting
up with it a Pounds 500m partnership to buy UK property. Investors pushed up
British Land's shares by 46p to 344p, brushing aside the company's
accompanying Pounds 132m rights issue and helping the property sector as a
whole to rise 6 per cent on the day.
By comparison, British Telecom's news had much less impact on share prices.
BT is paying Dollars 4bn to buy a 20 per cent stake in MCI, America's
second-biggest long-distance phone company, and creating a Dollars 1bn joint
venture to serve the global communication needs of multinationals. BT shares
closed down 5p on the day, at 421 1/2 p. The only side-effect was a mild
flurry of interest in the shares of Cable &amp; Wireless and Vodafone, seen as
potential partners for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
The contrast between the two reactions illustrates, perhaps, that investors
are more comfortable with straightforward questions of timing and
personality than complex judgments about a company's vision and abilities.
Soros's property play was a reassuring validation - by the man who is, at
present, the world's most influential investor - of the conclusion the
market reached some time ago: that the UK property market is past its worst.
Since investors cling to the visceral belief that timing property right is
one of the few sure-fire ways of making money in the UK, their reaction is
not surprising.
As the chart alongside shows, however, in the very long run neither property
shares in general, nor the talents of John Ritblat, British Land's boss
since 1970, are a guarantee of sustained outperformance.
The question hanging over property shares - is there still lots of recovery
to come, or has the 92 per cent rise since September exhausted the immediate
potential for gains? - is also an issue for investors considering other
kinds of cyclical stocks. For property, the Soros/Ritblat deal went some way
to assuage any worries this week. For other cyclical sectors, however, the
jury is still out - a thought underlined by a research note from Sushil
Wadhwani and colleagues at Goldman Sachs.
Looking back at how cyclical sectors have done during other recessions, they
find that the usual period of outperformance, as the market anticipates
economic recovery, comes to an end 6-9 months after the economy touches
bottom, to be followed by a period of underperformance.
If September 1992 is the trough of the most recent recession, that might
make you think that the period of strong gains by cyclical stocks is now
drawing to a close. Goldman Sachs concludes, indeed, that a large part of
the cyclicals' outperformance is probably over.
Every cycle has its quirks, however. One striking factor this time is that
the market's fears that ERM membership would prolong the recession long
beyond its natural trough postponed the moment at which the cyclicals'
outperformance began. Usually, a number of cyclical sectors - banks,
property, electricals, building materials - start outperforming the rest of
the market well ahead of the moment the economy starts its own recovery.
This time round, that did not happen. Almost all the cyclical sectors did
worse than the market as a whole in the period before Black Wednesday. They
have since done much better, but some may still have ground to make up to
compensate for their relatively late start in the business of
outperformance. Goldman Sachs thinks contracting and construction,
electricals, hotels and leisure, motors, and (you guessed it) property are
all sectors where there is still scope for further outperformance.
For the market as a whole, this was another week trapped inside the trading
range of 2,780 and 2,880 on the FT-SE 100 index. The upper and lower
boundaries of this range, set six weeks ago, came under little threat in a
week when much of the City seemed still to be celebrating Monday's bank
holiday. For those at their desks, there was the stimulus of renewed
speculation about a possible cut in base rates, perhaps timed to accompany
Kenneth Clarke's first set-piece policy speech as chancellor at the Mansion
House on June 15.
Bank of England actions in the money markets appeared first to be steering
the market away from this conclusion, by keeping money tight, then to be
lending support to it by offering money on a two-week basis (which coincides
with the speech) rather than the more normal three. The net effect of these
actions - and of some money supply figures which raised the possibility that
the recovery was slowing down prematurely - was to leave a lingering
impression that an interest rate cut might indeed be possible.
As the week drew to a close, the most intriguing news was the announcement
that Transatlantic Holdings, the financial services group chaired by Donald
Gordon of South Africa, had taken a 3 per cent stake in Sun Alliance, the
insurer. 'We see this as a strategic investment in embryo,' said Gordon,
implying that, in time, the embryo would grow.
In the mid-1980s, Transatlantic acquired a similar embryonic shareholding in
Sun Life, which matured in time into a 50 per cent controlling stake. On
Friday, the market reacted to this thought by marking Sun Alliance shares up
5 per cent, to 350p. As with George Soros, the 'who' of the investment was
more important, in the short run, than the 'what.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MMI this week launched Homemaker, a Business Expansion Scheme company which
will buy residential properties in the midlands and north of England, to be
let as assured tenancies. It offers investors a covenanted return after five
years of Pounds 1.23 for each Pounds 1 invested, equivalent to a net annual
return for higher rate taxpayers of 14.1 per cent. For basic rate taxpayers
it equates to 9.9 per cent. The return is covenanted by Davenham Group, and
is supported by cash deposits to meet 100 per cent of its obligations.
Investors will receive 50 per cent of any excess in the value of the
properties when they are sold. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, and
the issue is limited to Pounds 3.5m.
Britannia claims to have found a way round a proposed amendment to the
finance bill which would cause investors in loan-back BES companies to lose
tax relief on loans taken up after June 30. Britannia has written to
investors in schemes launched in March offering them the opportunity to
complete a loan before June 30. Loans could not previously be taken up until
six months into the scheme.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Contradictory data on UK house
prices - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE prices in the UK fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.2 per cent in May,
according to the Halifax House Price Index. Prices had risen 1.4 per cent in
March and 1.7 per cent in April. House prices are now 3.3 per cent below a
year ago, compared to last month's figure of 2.3 per cent down on the year.
But figures from the Nationwide building society this week showed a 1 per
cent rise in house prices in May, with prices down 5.5 per cent from a year
ago. The Halifax said that the housing market showed clear signs of
recovery, but warned that realistic prices were still necessary to generate
house sales. The Halifax predicts a gradual recovery in 1993, becoming more
sustained in 1994, when house prices should grow broadly in line with
earnings as a whole.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Markets: Soros factor lifts property - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN commercial property companies have hit the roof. This week, when
George Soros, the international speculator, announced he was sinking Pounds
284m in UK property, the sector rose by more than 6 per cent in a day.
This added further sparkle to the revival in property share prices that
started last September. Since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism,
cuts in interest rates, hopes of economic recovery and the prospect of
higher inflation pushed the property sector up by 92 per cent, compared with
a 26 per cent rise in the FTA-All Share index.
The stock market's enthusiasm for property shares is highlighted in the
relationship between share prices and net asset values. As the chart shows,
shares in property companies usually trade at far less than the value of
their underlying assets. Now - and for only the second time in 15 years -
shares are trading at a premium to asset value.
There are two reasons. First, investors have been attracted by property
shares' higher-than-average yield. Although prospects for dividend growth
remain feeble, yields look increasingly secure as property companies become
less likely to make dividend cuts.
Second, the City has become increasingly optimistic about the outlook for
asset values. Looking ahead, investors expect the discount to net asset
value to reappear, as property values rise.
But predicting the movements of property values is notoriously difficult.
Moreover, any errors in forecasting property values will be magnified into
large errors in net asset values, since property companies are highly
geared.
Would-be property investors are not confined to property shares. Two
authorised property unit trusts are targeted at private investors: Barclays
Unicorn Property Trust and Norwich Union Property Trust. In addition,
Johnson Fry, the financial services group, is marketing a unquoted
commercial property investment that will invest in high yielding property
for a maximum of four years.
However, most private investors are likely to rely on property shares if
they want to be exposed to the sector. People wanting to spread their risk
might consider the two investment trusts that specialise in property shares,
TR Property Investment Trust and Trust of Property. Otherwise investors will
need to select stocks with care, since the next few years are likely to see
large disparities in the performance of different companies according to
their spread of assets and quality of management.
The ratio of debt to equity is important. The gearing of the large property
companies ranges widely, from about 50 per cent for Land Securities to
around 90 per cent for Great Portland Estates.
On the face of it, the companies with the highest gearing will produce the
greatest increase in net asset values, if property values are rising. But
the City is often more enthusiastic about companies with lower borrowings
that have the scope to make shrewd acquisitions, which is why the stock
market has reacted enthusiastically to the recent spate of fund raising
exercises.
The property sector is dominated by a handful of large investment companies,
namely Land Securities, MEPC, British Land, Slough Estates, Great Portland,
Brixton and Hammerson. But analysts believe several smaller companies have
good prospects. UBS, the broker, favours Town Centre Securities, Frogmore,
Mucklow, PSIT, Capital &amp; Regional and Burford.
Recovery situations, such as Scottish Metropolitan and Dwyer, may also prove
rewarding, it says. But investors should be aware of the risks. Last week's
collapse of Speyhawk, the developer, demonstrates that stock picking in this
sector is still potentially treacherous. The ranks of smaller property
stocks are littered with penny shares that may not survive.
In any case, investors should not expect to make profits in the short term.
Even the most enthusiastic City analysts are talking about a period of
consolidation. It may take firmer evidence of an uplift in the underlying
property market before the recovery in property share prices resumes.

FT  05 JUN 93 / At war with the Mafia in an island of fear: A car bomb in
Florence only 10 days ago killed five people and reminded Italy of the
honourable society's muscle. But the big battle remains in Sicily where the
state is cracking down on organised crime
</HEADLINE>

THOSE murdered by the Mafia in Sicily are accorded magnificent funerals. As
if to compensate for society's inability to protect them, the coffins are
decked with enormous wreaths of flowers and there are great outpourings of
grief. Dignitaries of church and state attend in all their finery to
eulogise the dead. Yet, once buried, the names of the victims disappear from
the public's conscience.
Giovanni Falcone is an exception. The brutal murder of this anti-Mafia
magistrate just over a year ago has made him a latter-day martyr and a
symbol of all that is uncorrupted in Italy's body politic. His killing,
followed two months later by that of colleague Paolo Borsellino - both blown
up by bombs - has proved a turning point, both in public attitudes towards
organised crime and the willingness of the government to fight it.
By its actions, the Mafia overstepped itself. The challenge to the authority
of the state became too great to ignore, and the traditional short-lived
responses to such outrages - debates in parliament, a flurry of police
activity, the round-up of a few token mafiosi - were no longer tolerable.
'The state has taken the war to the Mafia,' says Giorgio Musio, the prefect
(police chief) of Palermo. 'Especially among the young, there is a new mood.
People want to stand up to the Mafia and break with the tradition of omerta
(the vow of silence traditional among mafiosi). Among Mafia members
themselves, these violent tactics have provoked divisions, causing some to
turn against the honoured society.'
Musio represents the new stamp of authority in Palermo. He was drafted there
last August from the tranquility of Florence to boost morale among police
shaken by the killings, and to co-ordinate more effectively the three
different services: police, carabinieri, and guardia di finanze. But he will
not have forgotten that the last prefect to do this, General Carlo Alberto
Della Chiesa, was gunned down with his wife in 1982.
The stiffened resolve of the state is only one aspect of change. The wave of
corruption scandals sweeping Italy have weakened the Christian Democrat and
Socialist parties which long provided political protection to the Mafia in
southern Italy in return for votes. Now, the Palermo judiciary - described
by Falcone as 'a den of vipers' because of its Mafia infiltration and
political intrigue - is being cleaned out.
Giancarlo Caselli took over as Palermo's attorney-general in January and,
within three months, produced a dossier on the alleged connections between
the Mafia and Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat politician
who has served seven times as prime minister. Last month, MPs agreed
Andreotti - who denies the claims - should lose his parliamentary immunity
and face investigations that could lead to prosecution.
At the popular level, the Mafia is confronted with the indomitable presence
of Falcone's two sisters and the widow and two sisters of Borsellino. They
have been relentless in their calls for justice. Their dignified anger in
bereavement has converted them into the nation's conscience and, already,
they have begun to receive anonymous death threats - a sure sign that the
Mafia is worried.
In many ways, they have acquired the same moral force as that of the Mothers
of the Plaza de Mayo, who became Argentina's conscience for the
'disappeared' during the years of military rule. And the Pope seemed to
formalise this status last month when, on his third visit to Sicily, he
received them in private audience. He also caught the changed mood of the
island. Celebrating mass in the grandiose valley of Greek temples at
Agrigento, he spoke of the Mafia by name for the first time and condemned it
 -a crucial step because the Church, a powerful influence in the island, has
been accused for years of being too passive in the fight against the
criminals.
Falcone recognised that Cosa Nostra, the umbrella group of the Sicilian
Mafia, was the most dangerous organisation of its type and far more powerful
than its associates, the Naples-based Camorra, the 'ndrangheta in Calabria
and the Sacra Corono Unita in Puglia. As such, the battle against organised
crime in Italy had to be fought primarily by defeating and isolating the
Sicilian godfathers.
His patient detective work led to the first maxi-trials of Mafia bosses
during the mid-'80s. He proved that Cosa Nostra operated with a formal
structure as a state within a state. Through use of a few key former members
willing to turn state's evidence - the so-called pentiti - he showed that it
was organised through a series of regional committees controlled by a
commission of the leading clans, which took all major decisions. This made
him a marked man - and he knew it.
Although the most heavily-protected public servant in Italy, with 60
round-the-clock bodyguards, the Mafia managed to discover his travel plans -
almost certainly via a mole in the interior ministry. As his convoy of three
armour-plated cars drove from the airport towards the centre of Palermo, it
was torn apart by a huge explosive device planted in a storm drain, A
similar technique was used to kill Borsellino as he visited his ageing
mother in one of Palermo's countless high-rise flat blocks.
Today, the motorway has been re-surfaced and only a strip of red paint on a
roadside fender marks where the convoy was blown up. In Palermo, the
make-shift memorial to Borsellino is less anonymous. A small shrine of
flowers and a billboard covered with simple messages of condolence marks the
site of his murder.
Behind these simple tributes lies a whole series of measures which seem to
show that, after decades of impunity, the Mafia is on the defensive. The
most visible evidence is the capture of the alleged two top figures in the
Cosa Nostra hierarchy: 'Toto' Riina, with his squat build and steely eyes,
is said to be the 'boss of bosses,' heading the clans from a base at
Corleone, near Palermo. Arrested on January 15 in Palermo, he had been on
the run for 23 years. Then, last month, police grabbed Santapaola, allegedly
the Cosa Nostra number two and head of the newer clans in Catania, Sicily's
second largest city. Wanted for 10 years, he is thought to have had a role
in the killings of Della Chiesa, Falcone and Borsellino.
Riina could have been betrayed. Experts on the Mafia, like criminologist
Pino Arlacchi, claim he broke with its tradition of ruling through consensus
and, instead, imposed his will violently with an army of 500 gunmen.
Bolstered by the profits from the drugs trade during the '80s, Riina
believed the old 'co-habitation' with the politicians was no longer
necessary. And he had no compunction in getting rid of opponents like
Falcone.
The theory goes that, as a result, Riina brought too much pressure on the
organisation and part of Cosa Nostra felt he had become a liability. This
scenario is backed by the testimony of his former chauffer, Baldassare Di
Maggio, arrested in December and now a pentiti. As one member of the
anti-Mafia team in Palermo noted: 'The fact that Riina's chauffeur has
turned against him is very important. Di Maggio was not party to the inner
secrets of Cosa Nostra but he was the man most trusted by Riina, collecting
him from where he lived and taking him to all the meetings.'
The role of the pentiti is crucial to action against the Mafia. The first of
these 'super-grasses' came forward in 1984 - Tommaso Buscetta, a former
Palermo boss who fled to Brazil. He was followed in 1989 by Francesco Marino
Mannoia, the chief 'chemist' (working with heroin) of one of the clans that
lost out to Riina in the bitter battle to gain control of Cosa Nostra. Both
sought protection in the US and their evidence has been accepted in court;
Buscetta, in particular, has displayed an elephantine memory.
Following new laws passed last year, establishing a witness protection
programme on the lines of the US, Italy's interior ministry now says nearly
400 pentiti are co-operating - compared with fewer than 20 a year ago. This
is a staggering increase in such a short time, and a substantial burden on
the state.
The government provides each with a basic L1.5m a month, or L2m if married,
plus the guarantee of a safe haven. In one instance, around 40 members of
one family were moved to avoid reprisals.
The evidence of the pentiti has been used already to incriminate a top
intelligence officer supposedly working against the Mafia, expose corrupt
justice officials and policemen, and reveal alleged links with politicians -
including Andreotti, who Di Maggio claims to have seen embracing Riina at a
Cosa Nostra meeting.
Luciano Violante, head of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, maintains
the pentiti have every interest in telling the truth. If found to be lying,
they risk not only losing state financial support but imprisonment. And
although nearly all these men have blood on their hands, they also know the
lives of their fion while Mannoia's mother, aunt and sister have been
murdered.
Musio is cautious about the progress of the anti-Mafia battle. 'It would be
wrong to give the impression the Mafia is being beaten,' he says. 'The
organisation is still strong and Riina still has lieutenants in key
positions among the families; but progress has begun to be made. The message
is rather that the Mafia, with time and determination, can be beaten.'
Even so, the Mafia retains the ability to kill and cause terror. Late last
month, it was thought to be behind a car bomb in Florence that killed five
people and damaged the famous Uffizi gallery. That was preceded, a few days
earlier, by another car bomb in Rome aimed at a television talk show
journalist - the first such incident in the capital.
One of the main problems in beating the Mafia is the difficulty of getting
at its illicit earnings - much of them derived from drug dealing - reckoned
to be worth L26,000bn annually throughout Italy alone; indeed, one of the
events marking the anniversary of Falcone's death has been a major
conference on this issue. In the past 12 months, L3,000bn worth of alleged
Mafia assets have been confiscated, although there are legal problems
associated with the seizures.
Then there is the personal security of those in the front line of
investigation. Mafia intimidation has made the job of an honest official
lonely, frightening and exhausting mentally - the strained faces of the
magistrates in the palace of justice at Palermo tell that story. The
staffing situation there is dramatic, with nearly 500 posts vacant. At the
beginning of the year, 143,000 criminal proceedings were still in a
preliminary phase and 13,000 others were waiting to go for trial.
At Caltanisetta in the centre of Sicily, where investigations into the
Falcone and Borsellino killings are centred, the government last summer had
to seek special volunteer magistrates to help out.
Despite all this, on one important criterion laid down by the anti-Mafia
commission, Cosa Nostra is losing. 'Impunity sanctions Cosa Nostra's status
of a state within a state,' it says; 'and if this is not corrected by the
state, it is a sign that the former is either stronger than the state or
that it is recognised and legitimised by the powers that be.' Arguably, this
is no longer the case.

FT  05 JUN 93 / The Long View: When brass is greener
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAT VULGAR people should make a lot of money by going into 'trade' has long
been deemed offensive by the more refined classes in Britain. But there are
more interesting trends behind the present explosion of protest over the
rewards of top businessmen. The same resentment, after all, is apparent in
less elitist America, where executive pay has reached extraordinary levels.
Once, you had to create a business rather than run it in order to become
truly rich. But not any more.
Remember that the average wage in Britain, the would-be sweatshop of the
European Community, is Pounds 16,500 a year. The rate of earnings growth has
slowed from about 6 per cent in 1992 to 4 per cent at the latest
calculation. Last year, however, the average director of a constituent
company of the FT-SE 100 index received some 13 per cent more even though,
on average, profits fell and dividends stagnated. This is no more than the
continuation of an established trend. Throughout the 1980s, the pay of top
executives of listed companies rose roughly twice as fast as that of humble
workers. We have been seeing a step change in differentials.
The opportunity for this arose in Britain from 1979 onwards when top
salaries ceased to be restrained by pay controls and there were high
marginal income tax rates (which favoured non-pay benefits). The primary
reason for the shift, however, is to be found in the changes in corporate
ownership patterns which have presented executives with hitherto undreamt-of
power because of the bizarre strategy of institutional shareholders.
Pay levels of Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1m are now quite common for big
company bosses. Moreover, they are positioned to make extravagant raids on
company pension funds, being granted retirement incomes vastly out of
proportion to the contributions paid on their behalf (although the Pounds
75,000 cap on eligible salary imposed in 1989 will, gradually, restrict this
bonanza). Finally, these pay levels do not even reflect high contractual
risks because vast compensation packages are paid out even to executives who
have cost shareholders dear.
In an earlier phase of capitalism, companies were run by proprietors. They
would direct the strategy and, as owners, would have a clear long-term
commitment. However, they would hire managers to run the factories. A good
manager was worth a decent salary, and might even be encouraged to wear a
bowler hat, but he would not be allowed to get above himself; he called the
proprietor 'sir' (or, in a family company, 'Mr John' or 'Mr Richard') and
could be replaced easily.
It is quite different in the modern public company. Some 60 per cent of the
shares are, in a typical case, owned by institutional investors. They do not
have the time or the inclination to act as proprietors. They treasure the
right to sell at will, a freedom they would lose if they were to enter into
commitments and thereby become 'insiders'. In place of proprietors, we now
have recommended boardroom structures.
These have been defined clearly recently by the Cadbury Committee on
corporate governance. Guidelines have been laid down for the chairman and
the non-executive directors. Compensation committees and audit committees
are supposed to keep boardroom greed under control and ensure that distant
shareholders are properly informed. It is proprietorship by proxy, and the
clear message from the grotesque pay spiral is that it is not working.
Who exactly are these proxy proprietors, the non-executive directors? There
are two pools. One is a group of professional directors and advisers, of
highly variable experience and status and of uncertain effectiveness. The
other consists of senior executives who are encouraged to take up
non-executive directorships in other companies. They are classic cuckoos in
the nest. The idea is that they can pass on their wisdom and spot trouble in
the making. Perhaps, but they are managers playing at being proprietors, and
it is dangerous to muddle up the roles.
It is plainly in their self-interest to encourage the pay spiral, which they
are doing with some vigour. They may, of course, consider that they are
being given nods and winks by the institutional shareholders, whose bosses
are themselves benefiting from exactly the same widening of differentials.
For instance, I liked the story of George Greener, the chairman and chief
executive of the life insurance company Allied Dunbar. Greener, who ekes out
an existence on the modest salary of Pounds 660,000, took on another
responsibility recently within the parent BAT Industries. He did this
without extra remuneration because - a spokesman explained - money isn't
everything.
His near-namesake Sir Owen Green, who has just retired as chairman of BTR
(where he was paid a pittance of Pounds 217,000) has attacked rampant greed
in the boardroom. But are top managers really any greedier than they ever
were? What appears to have changed is that they have the opportunity.
One or two leading institutional shareholders, such as PosTel and Gartmore,
appear at least to be seeking more information about what is being decided
in the remuneration sub-committees. But the institutions will have to
organise themselves properly, and lay down appropriate benefit scales, if
they are to gain control of top executives' pay. Managerial capitalism is
taking over from proprietorial capitalism. The rewards are being diverted to
where the real power is. For a glimpse of the future, look at the pay
packages worth tens of millions of dollars being enjoyed by top US
executives.
To head this off, British institutions will have to form strategic
commitments to companies and be ready to supply control and direction. The
top executives of the companies should be made to feel a little scared, and
should judge that it is appropriate to say 'sir' when speaking to their
owners. But perhaps, to soothe bruised egos, they could be permitted to wear
bowler hats.

FT  05 JUN 93 / US fears interest rate rise after big employment gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS of higher interest rates rose on Wall Street yesterday after an
unexpectedly sharp rise in payroll employment.
The Labour Department said non-farm employment rose by more than 200,000 in
both April and May, and revised up figures for job growth for the preceding
12 months. The unemployment rate fell to 6.9 per cent from 7 per cent, the
lowest in 18 months.
The figures indicate economic growth is accelerating after a depressed first
quarter. If May figures for producer and consumer price inflation, due in
the next 10 days, show a continuation of the inflationary pressures recorded
in the first four months, the Federal Reserve is likely to tighten monetary
policy.
However, if the price figures are subdued, then the Fed is likely to
postpone a tightening of policy until the underlying growth and inflation
trends become clearer.
If the Fed moves, it will probably raise short-term rates from 3 per cent to
3.25 per cent or 3.5 per cent. Last month, Fed governors and regional
presidents are believed to have shifted from a neutral stance on interest
rates to a bias towards tightening. This would allow Mr Alan Greenspan, the
Fed chairman, to raise rates by up to half a point if needed.
The benchmark long bond finished the day just under a full point down on
fears of higher short-term rates. The dollar rose sharply against most
currencies, closing at DM1.6264, a gain of more than 2 pfennigs. The stock
market finished the week with a flat performance. The Dow Jones industrial
average closed 0.27 up at 3,545.14.
Employment rose 209,000 last month, a bigger gain than most analysts
expected. The increase in April was revised up to 216,000 against the
119,000 reported last month. In the year to March the average monthly
increase in employment was put at 83,000 rather than 46,000 as reported.
The figures 'were very impressive and would dramatically change perceptions
of the economy's strength,' said Mr Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C J
Lawrence, a New York broker. They followed reports this week of a 23 per
cent rise in sales of new homes between April and May and a robust gain in
domestic car sales last month.
Mr Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the
figures pointed to an acceleration in the growth rate to 3 to 3.5 per cent
or more in the second half of the year.

FT  05 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: UK house prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The two main house price indexes may have been pointing in opposite
directions this week, but there is no doubting the upward trend. There are
sound reasons for the increase. As house prices have fallen and earnings
risen, the market has started to return towards stable valuations. When
prices are compared to earnings, houses are now more affordable than at any
time since 1985. In addition the cost of servicing the loans is at a 25-year
low. Repayments as a percentage of earnings have fallen from 45 per cent in
1989 to 15 per cent now.
Value may underpin the market, but price inflation is unlikely to be rapid.
Some 50,000 repossessed houses are currently on the market and another
70,000 may be repossessed this year. That compares with only 140,000 new
starts, and will be a drag on a market which will struggle to turn over 1.2m
properties in 1993. The market is also gridlocked by a lack of good property
on sale, while with the experience of the last three years still fresh,
buyers are not even prepared to bid up for prime houses.
Price rises will also be patchy, with negative equity slowing recovery in
the south more than elsewhere. The highly priced studio flats and
rabbit-hutch conversions which soared at the market's peak market will also
languish as first time buyers leapfrog them for better value homes. Smaller
family houses which trade between second time buyers may also lag, as
potential buyers take time to work through negative equity and rebuild
deposits. There is a recovery on the way, but not for everyone.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The peseta has been holding up well in the run-up to tomorrow's election.
But that does not mean the markets can be particularly confident about the
outcome. The two main parties are neck and neck: neither is likely to be
able to form a government without some tough coalition negotiations with the
Catalan and Basque national parties. They have been playing their cards
close to their chests. Everyone would like lower interest rates. Less
certain is how far a new administration will be prepared to sacrifice ERM
membership to that end.
The assumption is that Mr Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists would be more
determined to defend the parity than the conservative opposition. If he
remains prime minister, even he may come under considerable pressure. The
official unemployment rate of 22 per cent may over-state the pain, but it is
excruciating just the same. Some further exchange rate risk thus remains,
especially given the Bank of Spain's limited reserves.
Until the peseta's future becomes clearer, though, bonds are probably a
better bet than equities. Not only do they yield some 4 percentage points
more than German bunds; the lack of inflationary pressure implicit in
Spain's weak money supply should push absolute yields lower even if the
peseta left the ERM, as happened in the UK. Bond market returns could thus
easily exceed any further depreciation. The equity market by contrast is
much more dependent on lower short-term interest rates. That in turn
requires a gesture from a reluctant Bundesbank or a radical rethink of
exchange rate policy.

FT  05 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Dunhill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 12 per cent fall in Dunhill's share price in response to a 7 per cent
slide in annual profits seems a rather extreme reaction. Then again,
shareholders presumably take the view that it is hard to reinflate a burst
bubble. Dunhill's bleak comments about trading prospects suggest luxury
goods companies will find life tough for a long time to come. Deprived of
their bonuses, Japanese salarymen are not buying fancy trinkets and the
corporate gift market has all but dried up.
Shareholders might expect some protection from sterling's depreciation given
that 95 per cent of Dunhill's sales are made overseas. But the company's
conservative hedging strategy complicates the sums. Dunhill will also see a
declining return on its cash pile, which has shrunk by Pounds 60m to Pounds
120m, following an acquisition spree.
At least a secure dividend limits the downside. More general worries about
luxury brand values may also be overdone. After all, it is difficult to
envisage an own label version of Dunhill's fast-selling Pounds 900 Lorenzo
de Medici Montblanc pen. Yesterday's flotation of 4 per cent of Hermes,
which was 33 times over-subscribed, also underscores the amazing faith some
investors retain in luxury brands. Should Dunhill's shares fall too far out
of fashion, Rothmans International, its 57 per cent shareholder, may simply
snap up the rest.

The story of London equities is a tale of two markets. Having watched the
FT-SE 100 index first rally and then close down on the week, the overriding
impression - in line with the mood in government - is one of drift. Yet the
FT-SE 250 hit a new high on Wednesday, continuing its steady progress since
sterling's devaluation in September. The excitement generated by Mr George
Soros' investment in commercial property certainly contributed to the
record. With the exception of the largest, Land Securities, property
companies are clustered in the Midcap.
The composition of the FT-SE 100 has equally contributed to its malaise.
Pharmaceutical stocks, which account for 10 per cent of the index now Zeneca
has been split from ICI, continue to act as a dead weight. The recent poor
performance of water companies ahead of next year's regulatory review has
also damped spirits. But that is not a full explanation. Having been
presented with Pounds 7bn by way of rights and new issues this year,
institutional cash flow is looking even more stretched. The stream of
enhanced scrip dividends has hardly helped in that regard.
With cash flowing into unit trusts at a rate not seen since 1987, not all is
gloom. Since equity income and growth funds took the largest portions of
April's Pounds 955m cash inflow, the higher yielding and recovery stocks of
the Midcap might be expected to benefit. With deposit rates so low, private
investors' enthusiasm for equities is understandable. But the flagging
fortunes of the FT-SE 100 underline that such support is no substitute for
an improvement in the fundamentals.

FT  05 JUN 93 / SIB may never publish Maxwell report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Invest-ments Board, the City's senior regulator, is
unlikely ever to publish the full report of its investigation into the
failure of regulation surrounding the Maxwell affair, it disclosed
yesterday.
The decision to withhold the highly critical report will make legal action
against the regulators difficult and may jeopardise similar action against
other individuals and organisations named in the report.
Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensions Action Group, said: 'This is
a cover-up. It shows the weakness of the City system of regulation. How can
we have faith in a self-regulatory system when it doesn't tell us what
happens when it goes wrong?'
The SIB report covers the relationship between the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation (Imro) and Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM)
and London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management (LBI) - both
Imro members - and Maxwell Central and East European Partners, an applicant
for membership.
The report was initially commissioned by Imro, but was then included in a
report by SIB. Some of its conclusions and recommendations were published
last July, but without the substance of its findings.
SIB said yesterday it had decided not to publish the report because it might
jeopardise civil and criminal action in connection with the Maxwell affair -
in which Pounds 440m was stolen from company pension funds - and because its
authority to publish documents under the Financial Services Act was limited.
Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead and chairman of the Commons social
security select committee, which has been examining the Maxwell affair, said
last night: 'On every ground this is unsatisfactory.'
Maxwell settlement may be speeded up, Page 6

FT  05 JUN 93 / Luton accuses BAA of predatory airport pricing: Inquiry
sought into aid for loss-making Stansted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUTON AIRPORT has launched the first full-scale attack on BAA's monopoly of
London airports by accusing it of anti-competitive behaviour and abusing its
position.
Luton airport, owned by the local authority, filed a formal complaint to the
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) yesterday asking the regulatory agency to
investigate what it claims are anti-competitive subsidies and predatory
pricing policies by BAA to support its loss-making Stansted airport.
The CAA has a statutory duty to investigate the complaint.
The move could have far-reaching implications for BAA, which is expected to
report a sharp rise in pre-tax profits on Monday of between Pounds 275m and
Pounds 285m for its financial year ending March, compared with Pounds 192m
the previous year.
Luton reported a tiny profit of Pounds 10,000 in the financial year ended
March.
Opponents of the government's policy argue that there would have been more
competition between UK airports, especially in the south-east of England, if
BAA had been broken up when it was privatised. BAA owns Heathrow, Gatwick
and Stansted airports and its airport network accounts for 73 per cent of
total UK passenger traffic and 84 per cent of air cargo.
In its filing to the CAA, Luton accuses BAA of cross-subsidising Stansted's
operations from the profits it makes at Heathrow.
Luton airport, which is only 30 miles away, competes head-on with Stansted,
in which BAA has invested about Pounds 500m in a new terminal and other
facilities. Luton claims Stansted receives up to Pounds 75m a year of
cross-subsidies from BAA's other profitable operations.
Luton says its business has been depressed by artificially low airport
prices at Stansted. Mr Richard Gooding, Luton airport's chief executive,
also said Stansted had 'raided' his business with predatory pricing.
Ryanair, the Irish carrier, had already moved the bulk of its operations
from Luton to Stansted, while airlines wanting to operate new services were
being lured to Stansted by artificially low charges, he claimed.
He said Luton had been forced in some cases to reduce charges below cost to
keep business from going to Stansted.
Luton, where passenger numbers fell from 2.7m in 1990 to about 2m last year,
wants an immediate doubling of Stansted's airport charges and a requirement
that the airport should supply services only on published terms and
conditions.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Warburg gives up Pounds 80m equity plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
S. G. WARBURG, the UK's leading merchant banking group, has dropped plans to
raise Pounds 80m of new equity after sounding out its leading institutional
shareholders.
The bank had been considering raising the new equity although there has been
no formal stock exchange announcement. In the middle of the week, Cazenove,
which acts as Warburg's stockbroker, took soundings from the merchant bank's
institutional shareholders about whether they would be prepared to buy
Pounds 80m of new convertible preference shares.
That process is known as 'pre-marketing'. The broker took the view that the
institutions were not keen to subscribe, and so the share sale plans were
dropped.
Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, refused to comment yesterday.
However, the bank said at the time of its results ten days ago that it had
no pressing need for new equity. At March 31, it had total capital resources
of Pounds 1.2bn, including shareholders' funds of Pounds 889m.
But the ratio of its shareholders' funds to gross assets, an important
measure of balance-sheet strength, fell in the past year from 5.9 per cent
to 4.6 per cent. The bank does not publish its risk-asset ratio, the
internationally accepted measure of the strength of a bank's balance sheet.
Warburg's three biggest shareholders, regarded as strong supporters of the
merchant bank, are the Canadian National Railway Pension Trust Fund, with
12.3 per cent; Munich Reinsurance of Germany, with 5.8 per cent; and
Dai-Ichi Mutual Life of Japan, with 4.3 per cent.

FT  05 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases as inflation fears
hit sentiment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities staged an unconvincing sell-off yesterday before ending the day
essentially unchanged in a market which seemed torn between satisfaction
over unexpectedly strong employment figures for May and concern about the
prospect of inflation, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up a tiny 0.27 points at
3,545.14. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 was 2.69 lower at
450.06, while the Amex composite was up 0.04 at 440.95, and the Nasdaq
composite off 4.21 at 702.01.
Trading volume on the NYSE was more than 224m shares, as declines
outnumbered rises by about three to two.
The minor erosion in prices contrasted with a sharp decline in longer-dated
bonds, when the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue lost close to one point
in morning trading before recovering somewhat in the late afternoon, when it
was quoted down  19/32 , yielding 6.905 per cent.
Treasury prices were hit by the morning's release of employment figures for
May: non-farm payrolls rose by 209,000 in the month, compared with a
forecast 125,000.
The April figure was revised up to 216,000 from an initially reported gain
of 119,000 and the unemployment rate eased to 6.9 per cent from 7.0 per
cent.
The figures led to speculation that the Federal Reserve might tighten
monetary policy.
For equities, the prospect of an improved economy helped moderate the impact
of fears of inflation.
Allstate Insurance dominated trading for a second day. The initial public
offering of 78.5m shares in the company, priced at Dollars 27 a share on
Wednesday night, was the biggest IPO by a US company. The shares closed at
Dollars 28 5/8 , down Dollars  3/4 .
Car issues went against the downward trend, with General Motors adding
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 and Chrysler Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars
46 5/8 .
Federal Express recovered Dollars 1 to Dollars 46 1/2 after plunging Dollars
4 3/8 a day earlier on reports that the broker, Donaldson Lufkin&amp;Jenrette,
had reduced its investment rating on the stock to 'moderately attractive'
following recent resignations.
Shares in Wal-Mart, the discount retail group, edged Dollars 1 lower to
Dollars 26 5/8 in active trading in the wake of Thursday's release of
uninspiring sales figures for May.
The speciality fashion retailer, Merry-Go-Round, dropped Dollars 1 to
Dollars 10 3/4 after Dean Witter cut its rating on the stock from 'buy' to
'neutral' on disappointing earnings.
In the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55
5/8 , Sun Microsystems eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 32, Apple Computer lost
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 54 7/8 , Intel fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 112
3/4 and Lotus Development added Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 34 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stock prices ended the week on a positive note, closing solidly
higher in busy trading.
The TSE-300 composite index climbed 19.62 points, or 0.51 per cent, to close
at 3894.63, about 28 points up on the week.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 423 to 283. Volume was 75.311m shares
and trading value rose to CDollars 713.7m from CDollars 675.1m.
Eleven of 14 sub-indices closed higher.

FT  05 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt active in automotive
and retail sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were mixed performances among bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT produced notable gains in the automotive and retail sectors as the
DAX index rose 8.23 to 1,637.85, up 0.4 per cent on the week.
Turnover rose from DM4.3bn to DM5.1bn. Among carmakers, Daimler rose DM7.80
to DM562 and Volkswagen, ex a DM2 dividend, by a net DM7.20 to DM324.70; in
retailing, Douglas put on DM7 to DM491 and Karstadt DM12 to DM530.
The industrial background has not been encouraging in either case. Orders
for German carmakers released yesterday were down 14.1 per cent by volume in
April; and on Wednesday, the Ifo economics research institute said that west
German retail sales would drop by a real 3 per cent, and a nominal 1 per
cent this year, due to recession.
VW has been making encouraging noises about the second half of this year,
which may imply more recent knowledge of events. Karstadt, in share price
terms, has been falling behind Kaufhof which on Thursday produced a 6.2 per
cent sales rise for the first five months of this year.
In financials, AMB produced one of the biggest gains of the day, DM45 to
DM930; Mr Stephen Dias of Goldman Sachs said that yesterday's results had
reminded the market that AMB had sold a large, troublesome stake in BfG Bank
over the past year; the size of the gain, he said, probably reflected lack
of liquidity in the stock.
MILAN was unsettled by a 4 per cent fall in Montedison, triggered by the
announcement that Mr Sergio Cragnotti, a former managing director, had
decided not to return to the group to help with the restructuring programme.
The shares fixed down L46 at L1,132, before easing further to L1,118 on the
kerb. Ferruzzi, the holding group, lost L50 or 4.7 per cent to L1,016. The
Comit index eased back as a consequence, closing off 6.77 at 531.42, for a
fall of 1.5 per cent on the week.
Fiat continued to lose support with a report that Italian May car sales had
fallen by 28 per cent against the same period last year. The shares dipped
L59 to L5,590, a drop of 4.6 per cent over the week.
Profit-taking in the telecommunications groups, Stet and Sip, saw the shares
slip L54 and L37 respectively to L2,023 and L3,195.
ZURICH closed at a new record high, the SMI index rising 15.4 to 2,284.3 for
a 0.6 per cent gain on the week. Relatively good earnings performances and
the strength of the dollar were advanced as reasons for the improvement.
SMH surged SFr150 to SFr2,160 on the watchmaker's announcement that it
expects another significant improvement in 1993 earnings, following a 64 per
cent climb in group profits in 1992.
MADRID's general index nosed past the 260 level, 1.29 higher at 261.24 and 1
per cent up on the week, hopeful that the weekend's general elections would
be followed by a quick cut in interest rates.
STOCKHOLM, satisfied with the Volvo/Procordia announcement on Thursday,
nevertheless fell back on scattered profit-taking. The Affarsvarlden general
index slipped 2.10 to 1,089.20, barely changed on the week, in turnover of
SKr1.3bn.
The B shares in Volvo and Procordia moved forward by SKr10 and SKr4
respectively to SKr416 and SKr197.
Ericsson was also prominent, rising to an all time high, up SKr3 to SKr329
in the B's, with foreign investors continuing to be attracted by its
strength in the European telecoms sector.
AMSTERDAM was flat on the day, the CBS Tendency index ending at 104.7, a
slight loss on the week. KLM lost nearly all of Thursday's gains, down 80
cents at Fl 25.50.
VIENNA followed this week's break through the 800 mark with the ATX index up
10.14 at 815.77, 2.3 per cent better on the week. Traders said the gains
were partly generated by the OeTOB futures and options exchange.

FT  05 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Paris marks time ahead of privatisation
sales - Alice Rawsthorn assesses the mood of the French market after a spate
of gloomy company reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the next few weeks no-one, but no-one, will be watching the Paris stock
market more closely than the new French government. Judging by the market's
recent performance, the results will scarcely be scintilating.
The government, desperate to raise capital to bring down the burgeoning
budget deficit, is eager to start its long-awaited privatisation programme
which could include the sale of as many as 21 state-controlled companies
over the next two years.
But the timing and scale of the sales will be determined by the condition of
the Paris market. So far the signs are far from reassuring. The CAC-40
index, which was virtually static last year, has shown no sign of rallying
in 1993. It ended the week at 1,859, barely above its 1,858 close at the end
of 1992, and 1.5 per cent lower on the week.
The primary reason for the market's sluggishness is the stream of
pessimistic statements from French companies over the past month or so.
For instance, Michelin, the world's largest tyre maker, announced it was
implementing more lay-offs and short-time working.
The car company Renault, a candidate for privatisation, warned of a sharp
fall in first quarter profits, saying that it saw no prospect of early
recovery. Elf-Aquitaine, another privatisation target, has also predicted a
decline in interim operating profits.
French companies had a tough time in 1992, when the problems of weak
domestic demand were aggravated in the closing months of the year by the
impact of the strong franc on exports. These difficulties have continued in
the opening months of 1993 as France has slipped into recession. Meanwhile,
the deterioration of the German economy casts a cloud over the prospects for
exports to its largest trading partner.
The recovery plan, launched last month by Mr Edouard Balladur, the new prime
minister, has been well-received by the public. But the financial support
for the flagging construction industry and small businesses, together with
the FFr40bn (Dollars 7.2bn) special bond issue, are seen as stop gaps. They
should, according to Mr Paul O'Brien, economist at JP Morgan, 'put more
stimulus into the budget, but not enough to pull France out of recession'.
There are some positive signs. Some French companies, particularly luxury
goods and drinks groups, should benefit from the fledgling recovery in the
US. The French franc is still strong, but it has been much more stable since
the Balladur government's arrival in late March.
The new administration has orchestrated steady reductions in interest rates
 -with bank base rates falling from 10 per cent to 8.8 per cent since the
elections - thereby alleviating the pressure on corporate borrowing and
small companies.
So far the rate reductions have had no tangible effect on consumer demand or
industrial investment. The only signs of improvement are in the financial
sector. Paribas, the prominent investment banking group, announced last week
that the pressure on its lending margins had been alleviated, and
highlighted signs of modest recovery in residential property.
'Eventually the reductions in interest rates will have a positive effect,'
says Mr Michael Diehl of James Capel in Paris.
'We're now at a half-way stage where we're still waiting for evidence of
recovery and French companies are still coming out with really gloomy news.
As a result there's a certain amount of lethargy in the market.'
The critical question is when will the market's mood change or, more
specifically, when will it be in a suitable condition to absorb a stream of
privatisation issues?
At present the market is weak, but not disastrously so. There was enough
enthusiasm among investors this week for Hermes, the luxury goods group, to
stage a successful flotation on the second market. The issue, which raised
FFr127.5m by selling 4 per cent of Hermes, was 33 times over-subscribed.
The strong response to Hermes augurs well for next week's flotation of Naf
Naf, the clothing company. However Hermes and Naf Naf are both relatively
small issues.
The real test for the market will be the forthcoming sale by the government
of a stake of between FFr4bn and FFr5bn in Credit Local de France, the
banking group, which will mark the start of the privatisation drive.
The Credit Local sale, which follows the sale two years ago of a minority
stake under the old Socialist partial privatisation programme, is scheduled
before the end of this month. The market's response will be critical in
influencing the timetable for the other state asset sales, expected to start
in early autumn.
Most analysts expect the market to continue in its present sleepy state
through the summer; but the consensus is that it should at least have
started to rally by early autumn. One reason is that, traditionally, the
CAC-40 index is strongest in the final quarter of the year. Another is that,
by then, lower interest rates should have had a beneficial effect on the
economy.
'The market is fairly well underpinned,' says Mr Diehl of James Capel. 'It
isn't overvalued and there's no serious risk of it tumbling down.
'The triggers for recovery will be the rising US dollar and falling French
interest rates. They should have had an effect by the autumn, just in time
for the government's privatisation plans to get off the ground.'

FT  05 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines
on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POSITION adjustment ahead of the weekend, institutional profit-taking and
arbitrage selling weighed on the market. The Nikkei average fell below the
21,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed down 193.76 at 20,882.24, barely changed on the week,
after arbitrage buying had pushed it to a day's high of 21,222.77 in the
morning session. But late profit-taking and index-linked selling depressed
prices to a low of 20,841.68.
Volume totaled 564m shares against 609m. Losers led gainers by 565 to 471
with 155 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell for the
first time in four trading days, losing 4.43 to 1,671.70; in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.64 to 1271.21.
Traders noted light buying of steel issues by foreign investors. Nippon
Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y5 to Y411, while NKK gained Y2 to
Y340. Tokyo Steel rose Y180 to Y2,840 on reports of a rise in steel bar
prices.
Electrical issues, which gained prominence recently on buying by US pension
funds, lost ground on profit-taking: Fujitsu fell Y15 to Y796 and NEC lost
Y20 to Y1,040.
Ricoh rose for the fourth consecutive day, gaining Y20 to Y821, a new high
for the year. Investors were encouraged by the company's development of a
digital copy and facsimile machine which can also be connected to personal
computers.
Reports that some industrialists were in favour of redenominating the yen to
boost the economy, helped printing companies and paper and pulp makers.

FT  05 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Further losses as equity account ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCLOSURE overnight of a significant move in the insurance industry failed
to excite the UK stock market for long yesterday. Trading volume remained
disappointing and shares were sold down steadily in the second half of the
session as the two week trading account in equities closed.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index down 22.9 at 2,829.9, effectively
the low of the day. The Index ended 10.8 down on the week, after steady
selling over the last two sessions brought the market back from the 2,868
area touched on Wednesday. The market remained 17.7 Footsie points up over
the two week equity account but has been chastened by the absence to date of
any downward move in interest rates, either in Germany or in the UK.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also fell yesterday, closing 8.5 off at 3,175.1. The
Mid 250 Index has outperformed the blue chips, gaining 10.7 points this week
and 9.7 points over the two week account.
Much of yesterday's activity was driven by the stock index futures sector
where the June contract on the Footsie fell to a discount against the cash
market in the second half of the session. But dealers said that both
equities and index futures were sluggish.
London was depressed at the close when Wall Street opened worth a loss of 8
Dow points in early trade in spite of favourable news on US employment
levels.
Seaq volume increased to 625.6m shares from Thursday's 568.2m, swollen by
intra-market business as the big securities houses balanced positions for
the new account which effectively opened last night. Non-Seaq business, at
62 per cent of the day's total, returned to average levels.
Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.31bn on Thursday,
confirming that genuine investment activity has returned to satisfactory
levels after a brief setback at the beginning of the week.
The strongest features in the market yesterday were the composite insurance
stocks, after the news that Transatlantic Holdings, a financial services
group owned by French and South African interests, has become one of the
largest shareholders in Sun Alliance, with a 3 per cent-plus stake.
US sources sold pharmaceutical stocks again at the close of the London
market; Zeneca and Glaxo gave ground, while ICI, now purely a US chemical
company, continued to move ahead.

FT  05 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures and share options were in negative form yesterday and
helped to undermine the equity market itself. However, business in
derivatives was mostly left to the locals, or independent traders.
Traded options featured a large trade in Amstrad, the consumer electronics
company. In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE Index came in for
selling as the market repositioned itself for the new equity trading account
which will take in the expiry of the June contract.
Locals tried to take the contract higher at first but soon found no buyers
were around, a factor which dominated derivatives throughout the session.
The June contract then fell to a discount of around 7 points to cash, with
Fair Value at 5.
By the close, the contract was virtually in line with the cash market,
considered by traders to be a realistic rating as it moves towards expiry.
Total contracts in traded options increased from 24,467 to 28,691 with
Amstrad (6,422) the active feature.

FT  05 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone pauses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A week of exceptionally heavy turnover and strong gains in Vodafone shares
culminated in the stock price easing back despite news that US investors
have been increasing their holdings in the shares during recent weeks.
Vodafone shares, the FT-SE 100's best performer last month with a 17.3 per
cent rise, reached a year's high in mid-week, but dipped 1 1/2 to 454 1/2 p
yesterday.
The company, which announced highly encouraging new subscriber numbers for
its cellular telephone businesses this week, is scheduled to report
preliminary results next Tuesday, with top analysts forecasting pre-tax
profits of as much as Pounds 325m, compared with last year's Pounds 271.8m.
And dealers are looking for a near 20 per cent increase in the dividend
total to around 7p.
The main source of the heavy buying interest of recent weeks became evident
yesterday when it was announced that US investors now speak for over 18.5
per cent of Vodafone stock, equal to 186.5m shares, up some 2 per cent on
the last declared US holding.
The 24-hour strike at British Airways (BA) by cabin crew and ground staff
and a new threat of a pilots' strike weakened sentiment in the UK flag
carrier. The shares shed 1 1/2 to 296p, in light trading of 2m shares. One
analyst warned: 'Industrial action or the threat of it will make premium
passengers think again about travelling on BA, which will affect the yield.'
However most of the day's activity in the stock was in the nil-paid shares
in which Charterhouse Tilney, the stock broker, crossed a block of 8.5m at
45p. This raised the day's total volume in the nil-paid to 19m, ahead of
next Friday's renunciation date for the Pounds 441m rights issue.
Takeover speculation in Evered Bardon built up strongly as the session wore
on with turnover expanding rapidly to reach 7.8m, with several blocks of
around 1m shares traded around the 57p-58p mark.
Dealers said there was no evidence that the day's biggest trades represented
corporate stake-building, but one said: 'It now seems obvious that the
company is up for sale.' The shares closed 3 higher at 58p, equalling the
year's high-point and valuing the group at just short of Pounds 200m.
Among property stocks, British Land ended an active week by continuing to be
in demand. The shares added 6 to 324p. The same sentiment boosted Conrad
Ritblat which firmed 4 to 46p. The rights issue from Burford was well
received by the market and the shares firmed 1 1/2 to 75 1/2 p.
Talk of a bid by Airtours for Hogg Robinson continued to circulate though
analysts dismissed suggestions that Airtours would bid for the whole group.
They instead suggested Airtours might go for Hogg Robinson's chain of more
than 200 travel agencies and - following its failure to win the battle for
Owners Abroad earlier this year - such a move was likely to be agreed. Hogg
Robinson put on 14 to 204p, while Airtours firmed 5 to 306p. Owners Abroad
eased 2 to 94p.
The recent strength in the property sector helped leisure and property group
Ladbroke firm 3 to 186p in trade of 4.7m.
Strong two-way business in Guinness led to above-average volume of 4.7m. The
shares eased a penny to 468p.
Shares in Dunhill Holdings, the luxury goods company, dived 44 to 335p,
after it issued a profits warning. The company, which revealed a decline in
profits for the year to March 1993 to Pounds 70.7 (Pounds 76m), said it
would be unable to sustain the current level of profits unless there were a
big improvement in its major markets. Rothmans, which owns a 57 per cent
stake in Dunhill, gave up 9 to 610p.
Hopes of an improved offer for Securiguard from its predator Rentokil
continued to boost the former and it added 4 to 302p, while the latter
followed the market lower to end 8 lighter at 181p.
Solid investment demand for FR Group sent the shares ahead 9 to 270p in
trade of 3.4m. A clutch of profit downgrading from several brokers weakened
Glynwed International and the shares lost 5 to 294p. Favourable results
earlier in the week continued to power VSEL Consortium and the shares gained
another 8 to 803p. An uninspiring presentation in the city earlier this week
continued to dog TI Group and the shares fell 6 to 325p. NatWest Securities
was said to have been negative on GKN where the shares lost 6 to 468p.
In foods, Northern Foods continued in the doldrums following a negative note
from NatWest Markets earlier in the week and the shares lost another 7 to
245p.

FT  05 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance move questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVELATION that Transatlantic Holdings, the insurance group owned
jointly by Liberty Life of South Africa and UAP, the French insurance group,
had increased its holding in Sun Alliance, the composite insurer, to 3.01
per cent, triggered a surge of speculative buying in Sun Alliance.
The speculators piled into Sun stock after Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of
Transatlantic, described the holding as a 'strategic stake', triggering
rumours in the market that this could presage a full takeover bid. Sun
Alliance leapt 15 to 350p after heavy turnover of 5m shares.
Insurance sector specialists, however, were not wholly convinced that the
Transatlantic move was quite so decisive. One leading analyst said that
investment groups often declare big stakes in possible targets, without
necessarily intending to seek a full-scale takeover. He believed Sun
Alliance was not at risk of a takeover, adding that a take-out price for Sun
would be between Pounds 3.2bn and Pounds 3.8bn and 'Transatlantic just does
not have the funds. And UAP has its own problems with Group Victoire.'
Another analyst said the rise in Sun Alliance shares, as well as big gains
in other composites, was a reflection of the sector's underperformance in
the last month.
Other composite insurers followed Sun Alliance higher with dealers adopting
the view that even without the bid speculation surrounding Sun Alliance the
sector had been oversold during the recent past. Two were among the FT-SE
100's 10 worst performers over the past month, with Royal Insurance down 8.4
per cent and Guardian Royal Exchange down 6.7 per cent.
Commercial Union rose 12 to 588p, on 1.5m traded, General Accident were 11
firmer at 582p and Guardians added 3 to 178p. Royal Insurance put on 4 to
289p with the nil-paid rights 5 better at 34p.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Money Markets: London remains static
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON money markets remained largely static yesterday, reflecting the
uncertainty that is still dogging the British markets, as they wait for
clear policy signals from the new chancellor, writes Gillian Tett.
In spite of hopes earlier in the week that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British
chancellor, might be prodded into early interest rate cuts, the mood among
dealers by the close of the week was more downbeat. Although the shorter end
of the market was more optimistic than the long end about the prospect of
early rate cuts, most analysts predicted that three month interbank rates
would remain frozen around yesterday's close of 5 7/8 per cent in the near
future.
'There are a lot of political pressures for a rate cut. But I can't see the
Chancellor doing anything until the Mansion House speech, or perhaps even
later,' said one dealer, who predicted that three month interbank rates
would consequently continue to hover between 5 3/4 per cent and 5 7/8 per
cent.
After trading in a narrow band, the September contract for sterling futures
closed around 94.25, slightly lower than the previous day's close of 94.28.
For the second day running the Bank of England was slow to meet the Pounds
1.9bn shortage it had forecast for the day. But after late assistance of
Pounds 475m, overnight rates closed at 6 1/2 per cent.
On the continent, German futures drifted slightly downwards, after the
Bundesbank's decision on Thursday not to cut its repurchase rate from 6.70
per cent. After a heavy day's trading, the September contract closed at
93.21, 9 basis points down on the previous day, of 93.30.
With yesterday's figures for German manufacturing orders and unemployment
slightly better than expected, there was a growing expectation that the
Bundesbank might be persuaded to reduce its 7.60 per cent repurchase rate at
its meeting next week, in spite of the D-Mark's continued softness.
Meanwhile, with the Spanish economy still the focus of nervous attention in
the run up to Sunday's general election, the Bank of Spain yesterday
announced that it had injected Pta 601bn in money market funds at 11.82 per
cent, slightly higher than the previous day's rate.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar surges against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONGER-than-expected US employment data caused the dollar to surge sharply
yesterday, rising 3 pfennigs against the German D-mark, writes Gillian Tett.
The US non-farm payroll figures for May showed an increase of 209,000, well
above previous forecasts of 141,000.
Coupled with a slight fall in the unemployment rate, from 7.0 per cent in
April to 6.9 per cent in May, the data fuelled market confidence about the
prospects for US economic recovery, causing the dollar to strengthen against
most currencies.
Though its movement against the D-Mark was slightly tempered by the
announcement of better-than-expected German figures for manufacturing orders
and unemployment, the dollar nevertheless rose against the D-Mark, piercing
the DM1.62 resistance level.
By the close of the day it stood at DM1.622, up from the previous day's
close of DM1.602.
Although its gains against the yen were slightly more modest, it
nevertheless finished at Y107.7, up on its opening level of Y106.80.
But while most dealers agreed that the dollar seemed set to strengthen
further over the coming months, they were devided about how far it would be
able to defend its gains against the D-Mark in the short term.
Mr Avinash Persaud, economist at UBS, believed that yesterday's dramatic
rise marked the beginning of a clear trend, in the light of Germany's
economic weakness.
'The dollar will be well supported for a time to come,' said Mr Persaud.
But as Ms Alison Cottrell at Midland Global Markets Research pointed out,
relatively weak US manufacturing indicators suggested that the American
recovery was still patchy.
Coupled with the slightly better-than-expected German economic indicators,
the D-mark might, she suggested, harden slightly over the next few days.
'The important thing about today's figures from Germany is not that they
were good, because they weren't, but they weren't as bad as expected and
that is helping the D-Mark,' said Ms Cottrell.
Continued uncertainty over Spain's general election, caused the peseta to
slip slightly against the D-Mark during the day, closing at Pta78.27 against
Thursday's close of 77.89. With the markets fearing an inconclusive election
result, many analysts predicted a turbulent time for the peseta next week.
'The peseta is very vulnerable right now,' said Mr Julian Callow, treasury
economist at Citibank.

FT  05 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi names banks to draw up
restructure plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI, Italy's second-largest industrial grouping, announced yesterday
that it and its parent company, Serafino Ferruzzi, had hired five domestic
banks to draw up a restructuring plan for the financially troubled
agro-industrial, chemicals and energy group.
In a statement, Ferruzzi said the plan called for an industrial and
financial reorganisation of the group and that the five banks - Banca
Commerciale Italiana, Banca di Roma, Credito Italiano, Istituto Bancario San
Paolo di Torino and Mediobanca - would assist it in carrying out the plan.
The statement indirectly confirmed that Mr Sergio Cragnotti, a former
Ferruzzi executive, would not play a role in the restructuring. It had been
widely reported that Mr Cragnotti would assist in the much-needed
recapitalisation of the Ferruzzi group.
The statement also seemed to exclude a role for foreign financial
institutions.
Last week, it had been reported that Goldman Sachs and Citicorp, both of the
US, would advise Ferruzzi in the restructuring.
Although no details have been disclosed, the shake-up, made necessary by the
group's indebtedness, could include a large capital injection supported by
the banks, possibly through an exchange of debts for equity.
Through Serafino, the Ferruzzi family's private holding company, Ferruzzi
has a 45 per cent stake in the stock market-listed Ferruzzi Finanziaria
(Ferfin), which controls Montedison, the food-to-chemicals group.
Ferfin last week reported a loss of L1,519bn (Dollars 1.04bn) in 1992,
compared with a net profit of L115bn in 1991, while Montedison posted a loss
of L1,244bn for 1992, compared with a profit of L168bn in 1991.
The group's consolidated net indebtedness jumped to L15,123bn at the end of
1992 from L8,801bn a year earlier.
Ferruzzi had already announced a disposals plan aimed at concentrating group
assets in the agro-industrial division, while shedding its interests in
chemicals, pharmaceuticals and plastics.
Generali, Italy's largest insurance group, raised consolidated net profit in
1992 by a marginal 0.9 per cent to L675.7bn (Dollars 443m) from L670bn.

SCHMALBACH-Lubeca, the German packaging and paper group, has acquired
Impetus, one of Europe's largest manufacturers of PET packaging, from the
CarnaudMetalbox packaging company for an undisclosed sum in a cash
transaction.
Impetus, which has annual sales of FFr780m (Dollars 144.4m) through its
operations in the UK, France and Spain, was until earlier this year run as a
joint venture between CMB and the Lawson Mardon group.
However, the capital requirements of the PET sector are very high and
neither CMB nor Lawson Mardon was prepared to make the necessary financial
commitment to modernise Impetus's production plants and develop the
business.
Moreover, CMB, which has an annual turnover of FFr25bn and employs 30,000,
is pursuing a policy of concentrating resources on three important areas of
activity - steel-based packaging products, packaging for the health and
beauty business and expansion in the Asia-Pacific region.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, CMB chief executive, described Impetus as 'a good business,
but not strategic for us'.
He said the disposal would enable CMB 'to focus our efforts even more on our
core strategic businesses'.
CMB will retain its other PET interests, which are directly related to the
health and beauty sector.
The Impetus deal follows the sale of a 25.3 per cent stake in CMB previously
held by MB-Caradon, the UK building products group, to a consortium of
investors led by CGIP, the French holding company which was already a
minority shareholder.
Schmalbach, a leading European packaging manufacturer, has been keen to
expand its interests in the PET sector. A subsidiary of the Viag industrial
group with more than 12,500 employees, Schmalbach made pre-tax profits of
DM91m (Dollars 56.9m) last year on sales of DM3.46bn.
The Impetus deal is the latest in a series of international acquisitions by
Schmalbach.
Last year it bought Italian White Cap, a metal vacuum lid manufacturer,
following the previous year's purchase of Continental White Cap in the US
for DM500m and Continental Can Europe for DM1bn.

FT  05 JUN 93 / International Company News: Foreigners make inroads into
China - Lynne Curry reports on the country's rapidly modernising car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO decades ago, traffic jams in China consisted mostly of bicycles with the
occasional bus, truck, or official limousine. Today, the country's roads are
crowded with imported cars and lorries.
Foreign manufacturers are scrambling to get a foothold in this large and
rapidly modernising market of more than 1bn people. Foreign car sales are
rising fast. Chinese car imports have risen from about 40,000 a year in the
mid-1980s to 120,000 in 1992.
The potential for growth is enormous. There are just 7m vehicles on China's
roads of which barely 850,000 were produced at home last year. By contrast,
the US produces more than 12m cars and trucks a year.
In an effort to meet demand, joint ventures with foreign car groups produced
about 200,000 cars in 1992 and are expected to turn out 305,000 cars this
year. The market for cars made in China by foreign manufacturers is
dominated by Germany's Volkswagen. Other big sellers are Peugeot of France,
Chrysler of the US and Daihatsu of Japan.
Western analysts predict that by the end of the century foreign car
manufacturers in China will produce about 1m vehicles annually. That is half
the output the government hopes the Chinese motor industry will reach within
the next decade.
In addition to attempting to satisfy consumer demand for cars, foreign
manufacturers are seeking to break into the light duty truck and minibus
market.
VW is negotiating with the Chinese to produce a seven to nine-seater
minibus. Chinese officials are having talks with Ford and Chrysler about
similar proposals.
GM produces a light duty pick-up truck in a joint venture with Jinbei, one
of the country's's largest state-owned vehicle manufacturers, in Shenyang in
north-east China. In Nanjing, Fiat has an operation that turned out 5,500
15-20 seater minibuses last year.
In spite of these developments, foreign vehicle manufacturers face
significant obstacles in reaching the level of volumes needed to make the
Chinese motor industry competitive internationally. 'To be profitable, you
need economies of scale to produce in a higher volume,' a US car
manufacturer says.
The Chinese vehicle industry is highly fragmented, with factories that
produce components scattered across the country, far from the large
state-run vehicle manufacturers.
In addition, there are about 120 small individual vehicle manufacturers
making about 10 vehicles a week. With this kind of minimal output and
de-centralisation, these types of enterprises are unable to achieve the
levels of efficiency and profit that come with producing in great volume.
An inefficient spare parts sector makes developing cars difficult. 'A weak
supply industry is the main hurdle in the way of a model change,' one
European carmaker says. 'A model change costs about Dollars 200 to Dollars
300 per car. The Chinese want change, but they can't afford it at that
cost.'
In order to curb random car production and streamline the country's vehicle
industry, Beijing announced it would ban all car production by small
manufacturers not included in China's eighth five-year plan. This move is
also an effort to help the industry focus on making more internationally
competitive parts.
To improve the spare parts industry, two Shanghai companies have signed
letters of intent with Ford to establish joint ventures to manufacture car
components. Ford plans to establish a joint venture with China's leading car
makers to design and develop component systems that would be made in China.
Because of the fragmentation of its industry and its inability to produce
cheap, high-quality cars in large volume, China's ambitions to become a
vehicle exporter, like its neighbours Japan and South Korea, have been
thwarted.
The 240 per cent to 300 per cent duties and other fees charged on all
imported vehicles make the difficulties greater.
While these charges are designed to protect the growth of the home-based
industry they also shield the small, inefficient vehicle producers from
competition and prohibit China from moving to high-volume production.
However, Beijing is under pressure to lift these duties and tariffs to be
able to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Chinese officials have said they would reduce some of the taxes on passenger
cars, but at the same time they want foreign car manufacturers to reduce
their profit margins.

FT  05 JUN 93 / International Company News: Suez increases stake in Victoire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUEZ, one of France's largest industrial and financial holding companies,
has increased its controlling shareholding in the Victoire insurance group
by 10 per cent.
It has acquired stakes previously held by two other insurance companies,
Baltica of Denmark and Dai-Ichi of Japan.
The acquisition, which raises Suez's interest in Victoire to 63 per cent
from 53 per cent, comes at a time when the subject of Victoire's ownership
is in the spotlight following months of wrangling between Suez and Union des
Assurances de Paris.
UAP owns a 35 per cent stake in Victoire and a significant holding in Suez.
UAP, chaired by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, former head of Suez, is keen to swap
its Victoire holding for a controlling position in Colonia, the German
insurer run by Victoire.
However, Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, recently broke off negotiations
after a disagreement over the price of the deal.
Mr Peyrelevade has since been manoeuvring to increase UAP's influence over
Colonia and Victoire, while Suez has been taking pre-emptive steps to try to
prevent such a move.
As a result, when Baltica put its Victoire shares up for sale earlier this
year, Suez agreed to buy them. It is paying FFr1.2bn (Dollars 222.2m) for
the 5 per cent stake.
Similarly, Suez was receptive to Dai-Ichi's suggestion that it swapped its 5
per cent holding in Victoire for shares in Suez.
The French company is issuing convertible bonds to Dai-Ichi so that the
Japanese group can raise its stake in Suez to 3.5 per cent from 1.4 per
cent.

FT  05 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rome faces pressure to settle
ENI finance deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government is expected to come under strong pressure to allow
ENI, the state oil group, to retain the proceeds of its privatisation
following the announcement of a L1,081bn (Dollars 708m) loss in 1992 and a
sharp rise in borrowings.
When ENI was turned into a joint stock company last August, the Amato
government said the oil conglomerate would have to hand over funds raised
through privatisation to the Treasury.
In contrast, IRI, the state holding company, was permitted to retain the
proceeds of privatisation because it was in poor financial shape.
Last year's loss - ENI's first for eight years - compared with profits of
L815bn in 1991 and L2,072bn in 1990.
At the same time, net debt rose to L28,439bn from L23,298bn. Unofficial
estimates of ENI's net worth centre on L18,000bn.
ENI is in the throes of a reorganisation of management and a slimming of
activities to concentrate on core business under Mr Franco Bernabe. He has
been in control since March, when Mr Gabriele Cagliari, chairman, was
arrested along with the chief executives of ENI's four main subsidiaries, on
charges of corruption and illicit financing of political parties and
falsifying accounts.
The full impact of the corruption scandals on ENI is likely to be reflected
in the 1993 accounts. But the group announced that the cost of extraordinary
items was L1,379bn, believed to be largely paying for cuts in the labour
force and covering effects of the corruption scandals.
In addition, financial charges and foreign exchange losses as a result of
devaluation of the lira were L2,581bn against L2,090bn.
ENI is committed to a broad programme of divestiture. But with capital
spending last year running at L10,700bn, the group will be squeezed for
funds if it is not allowed to benefit from the proceeds of its
privatisation.
Significantly, the group pointed out this week that its core oil business
turned in a profit of L1,252bn.
The losses weighing down the group came from its involvement in chemicals,
fertilisers, textiles, mining and publishing. Losses from ENI's chemical
business totalled L1,790bn.

FT  05 JUN 93 / International Company News: Procordia to sell Wallac to EG&amp;G

<TEXT>
PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals and food group, is selling Wallac, a
Finnish biotechnology subsidiary, to EG&amp;G, a US services and technology
group. The unit is changing hands for SKr330m (Dollars 46m).
The company said the sale was not connected to an agreement to demerge its
drugs and consumer goods units, reached on Thursday between the Swedish
government and Volvo, the vehicle manufacturer, which jointly control
Procordia.
Procordia had planned for some time to dispose of Wallac, which has annual
turnover of Dollars 50m, because its diagnostic equipment did not fit with
Procordia's core biotechnology activities. Wallac became part of Procordia
three years ago.
The deal between the government and Volvo will result in the consumer goods
section of Procordia being taken over wholly by Volvo, while the government
will privatise its majority holding in the streamlined pharmaceuticals
business by 1995. Volvo will remain a large shareholder in the
pharmaceuticals side, holding up to 35 per cent.
Mr Jan Ekberg, Procordia's chief executive, said the new drugs-only company
would concentrate on expanding in the US and Japan following the integration
this year of Erbamont, the Italian drugs group acquired from Montedison in
May and poised to become fully owned by Procordia.

CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products, the North American pulp and paper group,
plans to spin off its western Canada wood products business into a new
publicly-held subsidiary.
The new unit is Pacific Forest Products, which will make an initial public
offer of 10m common shares through an underwriting group led by Burns Fry,
Scotia McLeod and RBC Dominion Securities.
Pacific Forest will take over CPFP's western saw-mill operations.
CPFP, which is owned by the Canadian Pacific transport and resources
conglomerate, will retain a voting majority in Pacific Forest.
Pacific Forest had pro-forma 1992 sales of CDollars 173m (Dollars 138m) and
operating profits of CDollars 22.9m. A preliminary prospectus has been filed
for the public issue and the terms will be set by mid-July.
Tioxide Canada, an affiliate of ICI of the UK, will pay a CDollars 4m fine
for allowing a titanium pigment plant near Montreal to pollute the St
Lawrence river.
It is the highest environmental fine imposed in Canada for pollution.
Mr Guy Martin, head of Environment Canada's investigations division in
Quebec, said he was happy with the outcome. 'The court recognised it is
criminal to pollute,' he said.
The CDollars 4m penalty will be used mainly to restore wildlife habitat on
the St Lawrence south shore.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper surge gets bears
on the run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange copper market this week staged its first
substantial rally since it went into free-fall in mid-April.
The upturn, which began after an initial post-holiday dip to Dollars 1,785 a
tonne for three months metal, was stalled for a while by resistance around
the Dollars 1,850 area; but when this barrier was breached on Thursday fresh
momentum was provided as investors who had gambled on further falls
scrambled to cover their short positions.
That pattern was continued yesterday morning, when the three months delivery
position peaked at Dollars 1,940 a tonne, but as bearish fundamentals were
underlined by another rise in LME warehouse stocks to a fresh nine-year high
profit-taking pared the price back to Dollars 1,855 a tonne at the end of
after-hours trading, down Dollars 10 on the day and up Dollars 60 on the
week. The sterling quotation, which was given an extra boost by the pound's
weakness, had closed afternoon ring trading at Pounds 1,262.25 a tonne, up
Pounds 101.75 on the week.
Dealers said the market's strength had been bolstered by concern about
possible supply disruptions in the US and Chile. Labour contracts at Phelps
dodge's Chino mine, Asarco's Ray mine and RTZ Corporation's Bingham Canyon
all expire at the end of this month; while in Chile, unions at Chuquicamata,
the world's biggest copper mine, on Wednesday rejected the first offer of a
new two-year contract from Codelco, the state-owned mining corporation.
Meanwhile Asarco and Phelps Dodge executives told institutional investors in
London this week that a sharp increase in US copper demand was far
outweighing the downturn in Europe.
Mr Richard Osborne, Asarco's chairman, predicted that, as a result of this
and of modestly reduced exports from former Soviet bloc countries, stocks in
LME and New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) warehouses would begin to fall
in the second half of this year.
He was less hopeful about the outlook for zinc as stocks were so high that
it would take a long time for price-induced production cuts to make a
significant impact on them.
Nevertheless copper's more bullish sentiment spilled over into the LME zinc
market this week and the three months price, which dipped to a six-year low
of Dollars 937 a tonne on Tuesday, recovered to touch Dollars 970 yesterday,
before closing at Dollars 968.50 a tonne, up Dollars 2 on the week.
Lead's slide to record lows in real terms was halted in mid-week after two
more smelters announced production cuts. Nuova Samim, the Italian
state-owned group, said it would close its Portovesme smelter for two months
at a production cost of 30,000 tonnes, while MIM Holdings of Australia
revealed that it planned to reduce output by 3,000 tonnes at its Britannia
Refined Metals plant in Northfleet, UK, by shutting secondary (recycling)
furnaces. These cuts take recently announced output reductions to between
160,000 and 200,000 tonnes a year.
Although analysts thought a retrenchment of this order was bound to
influence market sentiment before long the market's initial reaction was
hesitant, with the price slide being halted rather than reversed. On
Thursday, however, LME quotations started to move upwards and at yesterday's
close three months lead was at Pounds 275.75 a tonne, up Pounds 8 on the
week and Pounds 10.25 above Tuesday's low.
Aluminium put in a robust performance, shrugging off the continuing flow of
metal into bulging LME warehouses and news early in the week that labour
contracts had been agreed at Aluminium Company of America, the world's
biggest producer, and Reynolds Metals, also of the US, the third biggest,
thus averting the threat of serious supply disruptions.
Tuesday's price decline was reversed on the following day and Thursday saw
the three months price break through resistance above the Dollars
1,150-a-tonne mark. That allowed buyers to get the upper hand yesterday,
when three months metal closed at Dollars 1,169.25 a tonne, up Dollars 17 on
the day and Dollars 19 on the week.
At the London bullion market the gold price retreated to just above Dollars
370 a troy ounce in mid-week and traders were talking of a test of support
in the Dollars 366 area. But continental buyers were back in the market on
Thursday and by yesterday's after noon fix the price had recovered to
Dollars 377.60 an ounce.
At that point traders were looking forward to a successful test of
resistance at Dollars 378, but in the event the price slid back Dollars 3 to
end Dollars 5.15 down on the week.
Cuba brought the sugar market back to life yesterday with a force majeure
declaration that pushed the New York market's October futures price, which
had been easing, up by 0.66 of a cent a lb at one stage. In late trading the
rise had been trimmed to 0.55 at 11.33 cents a lb.
The Cuban move, which refers to June shipments, was reported to have been
prompted by the recent torrential rain, which has made extremely difficult
to move sugar to the ports.
Bad weather had already hit the Cuban sugar-cane crop, as had shortages of
inputs and fuel caused in part by the break-up of the Soviet Union, the
island republic's ally and main customer for sugar. Last week Cubazucar, the
state sugar agency announced that the 1992-93 crop would reach only about
4.2m tonnes, down from 7m tonnes in the previous year.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Exchange ruling on enhanced scrip price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK exchange has taken steps to ensure that the cash alternatives for
enhanced scrip dividend schemes are set fairly.
It has issued rules to ensure that underwriters of such schemes do not
manipulate the price of the shares during the three-day period when the cash
reference price is struck, determining the number of new shares to be
issued.
Although there is no suggestion that any manipulation has occurred, the
exchange was concerned to ensure that trading taking place during the
reference period should accurately and fairly reflect buying and selling.
Accordingly, it said that while it is acceptable for a market-maker to
adjust quotations to reflect the flow of two-way business, the market maker
should not initiate a change in the price of the stock where the intention
is deliberately to lower or otherwise manipulate the price.
In the event of these rules not being obeyed, the exchange reserves the
right to call for an adjustment in the final reference price.
Meanwhile, shareholders in Ladbroke, the hotels, racing and property group,
are to receive a higher cash alternative from Swiss Bank Corporation than
they were originally offered by BZW, which designed the enhanced scrip
scheme.
It has been agreed that all shareholders will receive 9.15p per share,
compared with the original cash dividend of 6.23p and BZW's enhanced offer
of 8.88p.
Forte, the hotels and leisure group, also announced that enhanced scrip
dividend elections had been received on behalf of 90.15 per cent of its
ordinary shares.
The reference price for the enhanced scrip had been calculated at 196.39p,
which will result in 26.89m new shares being issued, representing an
increase of 3.28 per cent in the ordinary share capital.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: LBC frequencies under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LBC, the London commercial radio station, is facing a powerful challenge for
both its frequencies from a heavyweight consortium which includes
Independent Television News and Reuters, the news and information group.
The other consortium members are Associated Newspapers, publishers of the
Evening Standard, SelecTV, the independent television producer, and GWR, the
west of England commercial radio group which is also a significant investor
in Classic FM.
The group is applying for three franchises to offer three separate
London-wide services dedicated to news, entertainment and business.
The consortium is chaired by Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated
Newspapers, and the appropriate consortium members would take the lead in
running specific services.
For example, SelecTV, which produces hits such as Birds of a Feather, would
team up with GWR to provide the entertainment service.
In addition to applying for both LBC frequencies to run news and
entertainment the group also wants one of the two new AM franchises on offer
to launch a dedicated business news channel drawing on the strengths of
Reuters and the Evening Standard.
In awarding the new frequencies the Radio Authority has made it clear it
will favour applicants who propose to extend the choice available to
listeners.
LBC will go into the battle to hold on to its two London frequencies without
a long-term managing director in place. Mr Charlie Cox, the current managing
director, has resigned although he will not leave the company for at least
two months.
Mr Cox decided to quit now because he did not want to sign a new long term
contract at LBC partly, at least, because he believes the style of the new
owners will be different.
Dame Shirley Porter, the LBC chairman, whose son Mr John Porter now controls
the radio with his partner, Mr Matthew Cartisser, is expected to announce
high profile new board members next Tuesday. Mr Christopher Chataway, the
former LBC chairman, will be standing down as a direc-tor.
Tuesday is the deadline for submitting applications to the Radio Authority
for six existing London licences and the two new ones.
Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank, has also put together a consortium to
apply for one of the LBC frequencies.
Mr Bruce Fireman, of Guinness Mahon, refused to say yesterday who the other
backers were, but he confirmed that the group wants to run a news service.
CLT, the Luxembourg-based international broadcaster, confirmed yesterday
that it had teamed up with Trans World Communications to bid for a London
licence.
The applicants will want to offer a mixture of adult contemporary music.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clive Smith associate being investigated -
Insolvency accountant is on bail and faces professional ban from practising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACCOUNTANT acting for Mr Clive Smith, the British oil entrepreneur who
will on Monday seek to avoid bankruptcy with debts exceeding Pounds 20m, was
arrested last year on suspicion of defrauding creditors in an insolvency
procedure and is on police bail awaiting possible charges.
Mr Graham Wilson, a certified accountant with offices in London, has
recently been disciplined by his professional association, which could ban
him from insolvency and auditing work. The Department of Trade and Industry,
which monitors insolvency practitioners, is also believed to be taking an
interest in his affairs.
Mr Wilson last night said his arrest was a 'storm in a tea-cup'. He added:
'I am a professional man and I operate in a professional manner. All I am
doing in life is conducting my business.'
He has recently arranged two creditors' meetings connected with Mr Smith.
One is due to take place on Monday, when Mr Smith's creditors will vote on
proposals designed to help him avoid bankruptcy through an individual
voluntary arrangement.
Mr Smith, who has interests in a number of offshore trusts, has had
connections with several natural resource companies. Pre-1990 events at two
of these, Butte Mining and Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, are being investigated by the
Serious Fraud Office. Both are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Mr Smith faces claims of more than Pounds 20m from creditors including the
Inland Revenue and Societe Bancaire de Paris. The largest creditor, claiming
Pounds 12.3m, is Richard Pearce and Son, a Hong Kong-registered company
which lists an Irish address, which is the same as that of Mr Kelvin Myles,
who has administered some of Mr Smith's offshore trusts. Creditors will able
to vote on Mr Smith's proposed voluntary arrangement in proportion to the
debt they are owed. Mr Wilson has also arranged a meeting, due to take place
on June 15, for the creditors of Alpine (Double Glazing), which ceased
trading earlier this week.
It has since emerged that the DTI was asked in February to investigate
Alpine's activities. Employees have also expressed concerns about pension
contributions deducted from their pay.
Alpine has had a relationship with Mr Smith since he personally guaranteed
the Pounds 900,000 purchase of Alpine from administrators in February 1992.
One Alpine director, Mr James Berry, was a director at Corporate Broking
Services, a London stockbroker which went into liquidation in 1991. Mr Smith
held a substantial stake in CBS, which had sponsored Richmond's flotation.
Police in Kingston upon Thames arrested Mr Wilson and two other men last
August on suspicion of misrepresenting the financial circumstances
surrounding a former client's petition for an individual voluntary
arrangement. Inquiries are continuing, according to police. Mr Wilson said:
'Yes, we were arrested but no charges were preferred because we were totally
innocent.'
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants last week rejected Mr
Wilson's appeal against charges of misconduct, including professional
incompetence, in a separate case. Its disciplinary committee upheld an order
that he be 'severely reprimanded' and fined Pounds 1,000. He must also pay
costs of Pounds 600 and appeal costs of Pounds 500.
The disciplinary committee has also ordered the association to investigate
'all aspects of Mr Wilson's practice'. He faces the rare penalty of
exclusion from auditing and insolvency work if the resulting reports are not
'satisfactory'.
The ruling followed a complaint by a former client called Euroborus, which
traded as Inside Art. The association found Mr Wilson had 'failed to deal
expeditiously' with that company's affairs. It said he 'failed to honour a
cheque' and 'performed his professional work inefficiently and/or
incompetently to such an extent or on such a number of occasions as to bring
discredit to himself, to the association or to the accountancy profession'.
Mr Wilson has also supplied insolvency services to some companies which were
liquidated owing substantial sums to London and Provincial Factors, the
debt-trading company which collapsed into receivership in February owing
creditors almost Pounds 7m.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Dunhill's slide prompts 12% share price
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Dunhill Holdings fell 11.6 per cent, from 379p to 335p, after the
luxury goods group reported lower pre-tax profits and warned about trading
prospects in the current year.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 76m to Pounds 70.7m in the year to March
31, although sales increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 327m. Operating
profits were flat at Pounds 55.5m, but interest income fell from Pounds
20.3m to Pounds 15.2m.
Lord Douro, chairman, said trading profit had been maintained in spite of a
substantial downturn in consumer spending in Japan, weakening economies in
Germany, Italy and Spain and only very hesitant recoveries in the US and UK.
He added: 'Trading in recent months indicates that unless these leading
economies improve in the near future it is unlikely that the group will be
able to sustain this level of operating profit in the current year.'
Alfred Dunhill's luxury accessories such as leather goods and watches had
been affected by reduced demand both in Japan and from Japanese tourists
elsewhere in the Far East. However, results in Europe had been encouraging.
Montblanc fountain pens had achieved an excellent result in a year in which
it had taken control of distribution in several of its major markets.
Sales of the men's outfitter Hackett's had increased substantially from a
small base, mainly because of the opening of a flagship shop in Sloane
Street, London.
The Karl Lagerfeld fashion brand, for which Dunhill paid up to Pounds 16m in
June, had a successful year. Chloe, the fashion and perfume house, had
benefited from increased sales of ready-to-wear clothes as a result of
Lagerfeld's re-appointment as designer.
Net cash fell from Pounds 180m to Pounds 120m following the purchase of
Seeger, a German leather manufacturer, the Lagerfeld brand, and Montblanc's
distribution companies in the US, Italy and Japan.
The chairman said about half the Pounds 70m of extra turnover was accounted
for by acquisitions, which contributed Pounds 4m to operating profit. Some
30 per cent of sales are in Europe, including the UK, 46 per cent in
Asia/Pacific and 21 per cent in the US.
Mr Graham Searle, group managing director, will retire in July. Lord Douro
said the board had decided not to appoint a new chief executive, as each of
the individual companies in the group was run as a separate entity, with its
own managing director.
Earnings per share fell to 26.4p (28.4p). A final dividend of 5.25p raises
the total from 7.7p to 8.15p.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Burford rights to fund purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURFORD Holdings yesterday joined the ranks of property companies raising
money from their shareholders when it announced a Pounds 41.9m rights issue
to help pay for a Pounds 68.2m property acquisition.
Burford is buying a portfolio of 11 properties from Provident Mutual, which
includes office buildings in Glasgow, Birmingham, Leeds, Leicester, Exeter
and Mayfair and some industrial and retail warehousing property.
Some 69.6m shares will be issued on a 3-for-5 basis at 62p a share.
Burford's share price yesterday rose from 74p to 75 1/2 p. The issue has
been underwritten by BZW.
The remaining funds needed for the acquisition will be financed by a new
Pounds 44m banking facility from Societe Generale.
Burford, which is regarded by the City as one of the best managed small
companies in the sector, yesterday described this latest deal as a 'quantum
leap'. It will make it the 15th largest company in the sector with a market
capitalisation of about Pounds 140m.
Mr Nick Leslau, chief executive, said the property market was now off the
bottom. 'The price of good quality property has gone up quite dramatically,'
he said.
The portfolio's initial yield is 9 per cent and its net annual rental income
is Pounds 6.1m. Burford said it was confident that rental increases would
result in the yield rising to more than 10 per cent within five years. The
average rent on the offices is less than Pounds 11 per sq ft outside London
and less than Pounds 29 per sq ft in Mayfair.
Burford said that the properties were generally of a higher quality than its
existing properties. They would help the group achieve its aim of having a
balanced portfolio comprising quality properties as well as properties that
required more intensive management.
Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said that their strong rental income would enhance
the company's earnings. He believed that there would be many opportunities
to enhance the value of the portfolio in the future.
The company said its current year performance had been in line with
expectations. 'There has been a perceptible hardening in yields although
opportunities to purchase high quality assets on satisfactory terms still
remain difficult to identify,' it said.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Budgie the Helicopter lands contract with
ITV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUCHESS of York may no longer be a wholly paid up member of the Royal
family but she is still reaping the rewards of her literary endeavours.
Sleepy Kids, the children's programme maker, and HTV have just been
commissioned by the ITV Network Centre to a make an animated series out of
her creation - the four Budgie The Helicopter books.
The deal will be a boost for the loss-making Sleepy Kids which last month
announced a Pounds 1.2m rights issue mainly to fund the group's
participation in the production of the series.
The ITV deal for thirteen 11-minute episodes should also provide some extra
uplift for HTV's share price which has risen from a low of 19p to 50p.
The ITV company for Wales and the West is planning to specialise in making
children's programmes for the national ITV network. At the moment HTV is
broadcasting The Pig Attraction - a series that marks the return to the
national screen after a long absence of Pinky and Perky.
Budgie is described as a resourceful little character who constantly gets
himself into tricky situations because he wants to help but doesn't really
think about the consequences of his actions. A bit like the Duchess of York.
Her financial adviser, Mr John Bryan, was involved in the negotiations with
Sleepy Kids on the original rights deal.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Coopers &amp; Lybrand to undertake review of
Hartstone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARTSTONE Group's bankers have appointed Coopers &amp; Lybrand to undertake a
thorough review of the group's current financial position ahead of agreeing
to any refinancing arrangement.
Shares in the hosiery and leather goods company - which issued two profits
warnings within a week - have fallen from a 1993 high of 277p to yesterday's
closing price of 39 1/2 p.
It is believed that the banks have agreed to a standstill arrangement which
will apply until the work by Coopers is completed.
The company recently said that it had breached at least one banking covenant
which calls for 2.5 times interest cover.
One of the company's directors yesterday named the senior employee who has
been suspended after he revealed that he had arranged for certain funds
derived from a foreign exchange hedging contract to be paid to an account
for his benefit.
He is Mr Michael Small, the company treasurer who came to Hartstone from
Credit Suisse First Boston. An advance of Pounds 50,000 to Mr Small may also
be irrecoverable.
It is understood that some of the company's directors were unaware of the
loan until this week.
The lenders to Hartstone are being led by Chemical Bank of the US, which has
held a number of meetings recently with the company and its advisers.
One of the group's advisers yesterday said that the banks were 'broadly
supportive at this stage.'
He described the Coopers remit as an information gathering exercise which
'is not unusual in such situations.'
Hartstone's current auditors, Binder Hamlyn, said that their position
remained unchanged in spite of the Coopers' appointment. 'Our relationship
with the company and its directors is still very good,' it said.
Hartstone said earlier this week that its profits for the year ended March
1993 would be not less than Pounds 9m after Pounds 12m of exceptional costs.
Then on Thursday it added that profits could be reduced by a further Pounds
260,000 after arrangements came to light over payments due to a subsidiary
company.
In March the company's brokers, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, were predicting
profits of Pounds 22m after exceptionals.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Transfer Technology in Pounds 7.1m
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSFER Technology, the West Midlands specialist engineering group, is
expanding its automotive components business with the takeover for Pounds
7.1m of Fenworth, a private group owned by Mr Peter Munday, Mr Clive Francis
and their respective family trusts.
Fenworth, comprising two companies - one manufacturing engine and body
parts, largely for Ford and Rover, and the other marketing and selling the
parts - is based near Stroud, Gloucestershire. In the year to March 1992 it
made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.9m and had net assets of Pounds 2.75m.
TransTec is paying Pounds 5.1m in cash and making up the balance with the
issue of new ordinary shares. Mr Neil Logue, finance director, said the
payment would raise TransTec's gearing to 35 per cent, but it would fall to
15 per cent by the end of the year.
The acquisition of Fenworth extends the range of the group's automotive
component products. Hitherto, TransTec had supplied parts only for vehicle
power trains.
A further acquisition may be in the offing for TransTec's control and
manufacturing technology division. Mr Logue said the group was having talks
with Cincinatti Milacron, US machine tool group.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 200m Devro heads for market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVRO, the Scotland-based producer of sausage skins, is to raise about
Pounds 80m in new money through an offer for sale later this month, which is
expected to value the company at more than Pounds 200m.
The company was the subject of a Pounds 108m management buy-out from the US
multinational Johnson and Johnson in 1991. It claims to be the world's
leading producer of products made from collagen, a natural protein used for
making edible sausage casings and film.
According to the pathfinder prospectus, issued yesterday by Charterhouse,
Devro has more than half the world market for small diameter collagen
sausage casings, three times that of its nearest competitor.
Mr Frank De Angeli, chief executive, acknowledged yesterday that the
flotation had been 'somewhat marred' by last week's announcement that Devro
was to pay Pounds 390,000 to Mr David Fyfe after it withdrew its offer of
the post of chief executive, in succession to Mr De Angeli.
The company decided, following pre-flotation talks with potential investors,
to nominate Mr Graeme Alexander, Devro's technical director.
The pathfinder says unaudited sales in the first five months of 1993 were
almost 20 per cent higher than in 1992.
In 1992 Devro made operating profits of Pounds 22.1m on sales of Pounds
82.7m. It will use the flotation to cut gearing to 50 per cent and fund
expansion.
Impact day, when the full prospectus is issued, will be June 17 and dealing
begin on June 30.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Creston, the construction components group, is acquiring Co-ordinated Land
and Estates, the property consultancy, for 31.35m Creston shares, being
61.51 per cent. At the mid-market price of 15p on June 1, the consideration
is Pounds 4.7m.
For qualifying shareholders to participate in future growth, the directors
propose to issue warrants to subscribe for shares, on the basis of one
warrant for every two shares held.
The warrants are exercisable within 28 days after the annual meeting in each
year from 1993 to 1997 at 15p. And if all the warrants are exercised the
vendors would have 51.59 per cent of Creston.
The company also plans to dispose of its 5m ordinary shares in Ex-Lands to
London Finance &amp; Investment Group for Pounds 1m cash.
Creston shares have been suspended at 18 1/2 p pending an extraordinary
meeting. Dealings in the new shares and warrants are expected to begin on
June 29.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: GBE makes the market at its second attempt
 -Richard Gourlay on Robert Newman's latest deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GBE International, which this week secured passage to a stock exchange
listing through the reverse takeover of Downiebrae, a shell company, was
within a whisker of floating four years ago.
At that time it had more than half its sales in China and was almost totally
dependent on tobacco companies buying leaf processing equipment. Then GBE, a
management buy-out from AMF International in 1986, had a rude shock.
Within a matter of months the Tiananmen Square massacre decimated its
Chinese market. At the same time RJR Nabisco, under Kohlberg Kravis Roberts,
slashed capital spending and BAT, under attack from Sir James Goldsmith's
Hoylake, also tightened its grip on the purse strings.
The issue was pulled.
Venture capitalists who had been pressing for an exit through a trade sale,
were therefore delighted this week with the arrival of Downiebrae and its
largest shareholder, Mr Robert Newman.
The deal involves the sale of GBE to Downiebrae for Pounds 22m, satisfied by
the issue to the vendors of 36.7m shares of which 24.9m are being placed and
a further 7.78m offered to existing Downiebrae shareholders in a 4-for-9
rights issue.
The new company will have a stock market valuation of not less than Pounds
31m when its shares resume trading after the June 28 annual meeting.
Mr Newman, an acquisitions specialist and former colleague of Sir Edward du
Cann at Keyser Ullman, the failed merchant bank, has been making a name for
himself recently.
Last year he and a partner bought The Sanctuary, the women's health club in
London's Covent Garden. And he has recently become managing director and
part owner of Thomas Goode, the prestigious glassware and antiques shop in
South Audley Street, London.
Of GBE, he says that unlike some professional investors in shell companies
he has no intention of taking an active management role. A self-proclaimed
dealer in, rather than manager of, businesses, Mr Newman will act as a
consultant and hopes to bring further acquisitions to GBE.
It is not Mr Newman's first involvement in Downiebrae. Just before the 1987
stock market crash he was part of a consortium that injected Pounds 2.5m to
take a 48 per cent stake and seek similar deals.
The stake was sold after the crash but it is unlikely he could have found a
company quite like GBE, which last year made Pounds 2.25m from sales of
Pounds 34.7m.
In addition to selling tobacco processing equipment from its base in
Andover, Hampshire, GBE has a foothold in the potentially lucrative market
for environmental control equipment. Under licence from Wheelabrator, now
part of Waste Management Inc of the US, GBE sells two processes which treat
acid gases emitted from the incineration of liquid sewage.
Severn Trent, the water company, is installing the equipment and Mr Gerald
Edwards, GBE chairman before and after this takeover, says the company has
quoted for 12 contracts worth Pounds 50m.
EC regulations restricting the dumping of sewage at sea should mean 12m
tonnes needs to be disposed of, Mr Edwards says. Incineration is a way of
reducing the amount of landfill required for this disposal.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Letter: Incentives for private rented housing sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ROBINA RAFFERTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A revitalised private rented sector providing good quality, secure
accommodation, with an expanding social housing sector and the provision of
more varied access routes to owner-occupation, could help solve Britain's
housing crisis. Your review of the options that the government may pursue so
as to encourage a revival of private rented sector is thus timely ('In
search of the private landlord', June 1).
Private investment into private renting will not be forthcoming unless
investors are assured of an adequate return. The mechanisms by which such a
return could be offered to potential investors should, however, be designed
so as not to divert public resources away from the core social housing
programme. If private landlords were able to bid for capital grants, the
likelihood would be that housing association provision of new accommodation
for the homeless and other priority groups would consequentially diminish at
great human and financial cost. Thus, taxation concessions rather than
grants should help provide a net return sufficiently attractive to potential
investors who may be interested in investing index-linked and other
long-term funds in the tenure. Landlord returns should also relate to a
long-term rental income stream, not short-term capital gains. A reliance on
a return from capital gains presupposes lack of security for tenants. Any
successor to the Business Enterprise Scheme should, therefore, reward
investors looking for a long-term return rather than wishing to exit after
five years.
The first combined expenditure and revenue Budget in November would be a
fitting backdrop for the new chancellor to announce targeted taxation
concessions designed to encourage financial institutions to invest in
private rented accommodation. A process of learning and doing through pilot
demonstration projects rather than abstract conjecture will aid progress.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Letter: UK should obey EC rules only as scrupulously as its
partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr L C ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Kelvin MacKenzie ('Mass trick treaty', June 1) said of the EC that
'most of all we want the other members. . .to obey the rules as scrupulously
as we do'. Assuming that we do obey them scrupulously, this amounts to
wishing that, in general, EC rules carried more weight in member countries.
It would surely be more consistent with the rest of his views to argue that
we should obey the rules as scrupulously as they do. Apart from ideological
neatness, this approach puts the solution to the problem in our hands rather
than theirs. Whether we should use such an approach is a matter of opinion.
Kelvin's readers would doubtless approve, but what do they know? L C Atkins,

FT  05 JUN 93 / Letter: Guided busway proposal ignores the realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A N PEACHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re Mr Bale's proposal to convert the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line to
a guided busway after privatisation ('Buses may run on rail tracks after
privatisation', June 1), he may, as a resident of Jersey, perhaps be
forgiven for not being aware of the daily realities of life on this line.
Between 16:30 and 18:30, 32 trains consisting of either eight or 12 coaches
are scheduled to leave Fenchurch Street. Assuming an average occupancy of
500 passengers per train, this equates to 16,000 passengers carried during
this period. Even with 70 passengers per bus some 230 vehicles would be
required to carry the same number of passengers. A similar number of buses
would also be required in the morning rush hour.
Another problem which Mr Bale's initial enthusiasm does not appear to
address is how he proposes to deal with the 2 1/2 mile viaduct out of
Fenchurch Street, much of which is not wide enough to permit conversion to a
busway. Does he envisage the buses pouring off the busway on to the
Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road at Bromley by Bow to fight their way from
there into the City? How does he propose conveying his passengers while
large sections of the line are closed for conversion?
With regard to the proposal to convert the Chiltern Line from Marylebone to
Aylesbury, Mr Bale could do worse than to consult the report on this project
prepared at the behest of the late Greater London Council. It recommended
against the proposal owing to the astronomical cost of acquiring property
required for the conversion at the London end of the line.
Finally, if Mr Bale would like advice on guided busways nearer to home than
either Adelaide or Essen, he could consult the West Midlands passenger
transport executive. It abandoned its experiment after less than one year's
operation.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Letter: Reneging on radicalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY HOCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Liberal Democrats' policy paper on housing ('Lib Dems suggest early
end to mortgage tax relief', June 1) shows how much the party is distancing
itself from its radical foundations. Opposition parties are now pursuing
strategies for electoral popularity above all else, fudging answers to the
most fundamental questions of reform. By the time of the next general
election the UK may be faced with a choice in which the incumbent government
presents the only radical agenda.
The opposition parties' failure to tackle the issue of the mortgage interest
subsidy that seriously distorts the UK housing market demonstrates their
political timidity. It is a tribute to Mr Lamont that in 1991 he restricted
the subsidy to the basic rate. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, would
be wise to continue with the course of reform this autumn.
The economic recovery is likely not only to raise the cost of reform but
also to make it more politically difficult. The 1991 Budget was, amid the
country's economic ills, highly radical, redirecting the economy towards
greater fiscal efficiency and macroeconomic stability. Mr Lamont will have
been sacrificed in vain if this radicalism is curtailed in the name of
electoral popularity.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Masters of fudge declare a victory: South Africa's
constitutional talks veer from the sublime to the ridiculous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was an unedifying spectacle. After bargaining all day and into the night
on Thursday, South Africa's constitutional negotiators reached what can only
be described as a tentative provisional agreement to recommend a date for
the first multi-racial elections. Then they declared victory, and went home.
Thursday's 'decision' by the 26-party constitutional body, that elections
should be held on April 27 next year, has no more than symbolic
significance. It must first be confirmed by the same 26 delegations who
failed to confirm it on Thursday; then it must be ratified by their
political masters, at a meeting of the 208-member 'negotiating council' on
June 25. And then, most difficult of all, delegates must agree a
constitution under which elections can be held. Until they do, April 27 1994
is no more than a target.
With luck, the simple existence of that target will, in the words of Mr Joe
Slovo, delegate from the South African Communist party, 'put a fire under'
the negotiators. Now that they have set that target - however conditionally
 -they dare not ignore it; to do so would be political suicide.
Indeed, it was to prevent the political suicide of the African National
Congress leadership that a date was set at all. ANC leaders had promised
their increasingly restive constituents that a date would be set by the end
of May. They could not afford to disappoint them.
Small wonder that ANC leader Nelson Mandela chose to embrace chief
government negotiator Roelf Meyer after the decision. The government, which
supported the date, had saved him and other moderate leaders from the wrath
of the militant ANC youth, who had already threatened protests unless a date
was set.
But it may prove a pyrrhic victory. To hold elections next April, delegates
must agree a new constitution by September at the latest (this will be
referred to as the 'interim' constitution, to remain in force until the
election provides a constituent assembly to write a permanent one).
They must agree the principles by which writers of a final constitution will
be bound; resolve more immediate problems such as the powers of the
so-called Transitional Executive Council (TEC), due to take power soon to
oversee government in the transition; put in place independent commissions
to oversee elections and the state broadcast media in the transition;
resolve the vexed issue of joint control of the security forces and
political armies; agree a bill of rights for the transition. The list goes
on.
But so far, with few exceptions, delegates have taken the line of least
resistance on all these issues - refer the problem to a 'technical
committee' and hold a press conference to claim triumph.
Thursday provided ample examples of this syndrome. Delegates congratulated
themselves for 'tabling' (not agreeing, which is something they could not
do) proposals on combating violence. They commended each other for
'receiving' proposals on devolution of power to regions, and for
establishing a commission to demarcate regions. It would be splendid farce,
if it were not so serious.
On the central issue of whether South Africa should be a unitary or a
federal state - the issue which will determine whether several of the 26
parties will sign an eventual agreement - delegates staged a masterly fudge.
Faced with opposition from the secessionist Conservative party to a
principle declaring South Africa a 'single sovereign state', delegate Rowan
Cronje, from the black homeland of Bophuthatswana, declared that this did
not exclude the Conservatives' demand for a separate Afrikaner homeland.
His reasoning was that 'South Africa' would still be a single sovereign
state even if there was another single sovereign state of 'Afrikanerland' in
its midst. So the problem was not resolved but avoided - and Mr Cronje was
proposed (privately) for the title 'man of the negotiations' by a government
official.
Delegates moved on to debate extensively whether the constitution should
forbid Moslem men from mistreating their wives (Catholics will apparently be
free to do so), as well as other gender issues. But at least the conference
avoided the embarrassment of one recent session, when debate had to be
interrupted because two delegations had no female representation (each is
meant to be a man-woman team). Once women were found to complement
delegation leaders from the Transkei and Solidarity party, proceedings
resumed. (The government delegation fielded a secretary to fill its female
seat.)
Though the ridiculous vies daily with the sublime at the talks - and often
wins - concrete progress is gradually being made. Earlier this week,
delegates moved toward agreeing the process by which South Africa should
reach democracy - in two phases, with an interim constitution written by the
present body and a final one by an elected constituent assembly (though the
KwaZulu government, speaking for Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, gave notice on
Thursday that it was having second thoughts about this agreement).
And delegates are finally on the point of debating the detailed distribution
of power between central, regional and local governments under the interim
constitution (as well as a devolution principle to guide a final
constitution).
But as one government minister commented privately this week: 'When you take
away all the fancy documents, we are at the same point as last year at this
time.' There are more parties participating in the talks; but their
continued presence is guaranteed only by avoiding the hard issues. South
Africa's constitution obviously needs broad multi-party support to gain
legitimacy, but not if the quest for legitimacy compromises agreement
itself.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Global link-up down the line: BT's venture with MCI is a
pricey but plausible strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most BT shareholders, perhaps even BT's campaign character, Inspector
Morose, will be nonplussed by concepts such as 'global outsourcing' and
'global telecoms platforms'. They should start pursuing them, since BT is
spending about Dollars 5bn of their funds applying the ideas to the task of
making itself an international telecoms giant.
The alliance announced this week between BT and MCI, the second-largest US
carrier, represents a large injection of cash by the privatised UK company
into the US in return for an assured entree to the American telecoms market.
Against BT's Dollars 5bn, which will give it a 20 per cent stake in MCI and
two-thirds of a joint venture company formed by the two carriers, MCI is
putting up barely Dollars 400m - of which about Dollars 120m is to buy most
of BT's North American assets.
BT can afford Dollars 5bn with ease. The sum represents only four years of
its uncommitted cash flow. But it remains a huge investment. To put it in
perspective, it represents more than the total projected capital spending by
Cable and Wireless, BT's main UK competitor through its Mercury subsidiary,
on all projects - home and abroad - for the next three years.
Nor did BT's investment come cheap. At Dollars 64 a share, it paid a 20 per
cent premium for its stake in MCI. BT shareholders, who could have bought
MCI shares in the market on their own account at about Dollars 12 less,
might well ask how that premium is justified.
Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman - for whom the MCI deal is the culmination
of a three-year campaign to break into the US - dismisses any suggestion
that BT should be passing on its cash instead either to customers (in lower
prices) or to shareholders (in higher dividends). On prices, he points to
the tight, regulator-imposed price caps below which BT already operates; for
shareholders, he emphasises the value which BT will add to MCI, and the
longer-term gains that will accrue to them if BT succeeds in establishing
itself as a global leader.
As for BT's undistinguished record as a North American investor over the
past decade, Mr Vallance emphasises MCI's impressive track record in prising
market share in the US long-distance market - currently 18 per cent of it -
from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, America's largest telecoms operator.
BT's strategy is simple. Multinational companies want sophisticated telecoms
and data services. And pursuing today's management philosophy of
concentrating on core business and contracting out as much of the rest as
possible, they will leap at the chance of 'outsourcing' their telecoms needs
if a supplier with international credibility and state-of-the-art products
presents itself. Since some 40 per cent of multi-nationals are based in the
US, BT's credibility requires a strong US presence.
Furthermore, BT will soon have to endure increased domestic competition,
from cable TV companies in the local market, and from new entrants in the
long-distance business, led by Energis and Ionica, new UK companies recently
licensed to build national telecoms networks. As BT loses market share in
the UK, it is determined to seek compensation abroad.
Enter BT in alliance with MCI, outsourcer to tomorrow's multinationals. The
idea has a powerful attraction for proponents of 'UK plc'. Many of BT's
leading customers endorse the logic of the move. Mr David Harrington,
director of the Telecommunications Managers Association, hails the MCI deal
as 'yet another global stride for the national flag carrier, which will
further strengthen its claim to offer international businesses a seamless
service on a world scale'.
The actions of other leading international telecoms operators further
validates the notion of the 'global stride'. Last week, AT&amp;T launched
Worldsource, a partnership with five Asia-Pacific carriers (to be extended
to Europe next year) pursuing almost the same strategy as the BT/MCI joint
venture. Deutsche Telekom and Telecom France have an outsourcing joint
venture of their own, called Eunetcom, while a consortium of the Swiss,
Dutch and Swedish state telecoms companies (Unisource) is also courting
European transnationals.
But fashion is not enough. BT has to answer three questions. Is the 'global
outsourcing' market going to materialise? Is significant added value to be
gained from the MCI alliance? And was a Dollars 5bn investment necessary to
enable BT to exploit the market and add the value?
'The benefits of the aggressive pursuit of global outsourcing have yet to be
proven,' says Mr Gregory Staple, a Washington consultant. There are grounds
for such scepticism. Both AT&amp;T and BT claim to be targeting
'multinationals', of which AT&amp;T estimates there are between 2,000 and 3,000.
Yet virtually all multinationals already have sophisticated telecoms
operations, with extensive private networks and operational expertise.
Shell, for instance, has a Netherlands-based subsidiary dedicated to
managing its telecoms needs in more than 100 countries. More than anything,
it is likely to be lower prices that will attract multinational custom; but
BT has discounted the idea that its alliance might undercut the existing
international cartel arrangements which keep prices high.
Nonetheless, at its Worldsource launch AT&amp;T produced an impressive array of
international companies, including Unisys, Honeywell and Motorola,
professing their interest in outsourcing. And the market need not be
restricted to multinationals. According to the United Nations division which
studies them, there were 35,000 'transnational corporations' in 1990 with
more than 150,000 affiliates between them. True, most of them are small and
medium-sized companies, minute in comparison with Shell; equally, they
possess far less telecoms expertise, and could find single-supplier packages
attractive.
Lower prices and 'one-stop shops' apart, it is new high-tech data
transmission services that companies are likely to be seeking from the
global outsourcers. To meet the demand, an obvious strategy for telecoms
operators is to forge alliances with computing and managed data networks
companies.
AT&amp;T has done just that. In 1989 it bought Istel, the UK IT services
company; two years ago it spent Dollars 7.4bn on NCR, the fifth largest US
computing group. It looked as if BT was going down the same road in its
talks with Electronic Data Systems, America's largest computing services
company.
The talks with EDS appear to have broken down last month. A few weeks later
the deal with MCI was announced. While the MCI alliance gives BT improved
access to the US market, it does far less than a partnership with EDS would
have done in terms of broadening BT's range of services and potential to
exploit emerging data communications technology. Indeed, MCI is itself
anxious to develop its data transmission services, which account for only a
small proportion of its current sales.
Furthermore, if its aim was simply to gain access to the US market and
develop joint marketing and research programmes with an innovative operator,
BT did not need to expend Dollars 4.3bn on a stake in MCI on top of the
Dollars 750m for the joint venture.
BT evidently expects to have a large say in the uses to which MCI devotes
its new pot of gold; but with only a minority stake, it will be in no
position to impose its will. Given the speed at which the alliance appears
to have been negotiated, it is not clear that BT is even sure what it wants
the money spent on.
That said, BT would not have approached MCI in the first place but for the
US operator's remarkable success in building its business and branding new
products. Mr Bert Roberts, MCI's chairman, talks eagerly of 'expanded
efforts in the emerging (US) fields of multimedia and local competition'. If
MCI can do to those what it has done to AT&amp;T in the long-distance voice
market, BT's dowry will be well spent.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Glory days gone for now: Edward Balls says England's
football decline mirrors its economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gutted', 'gob-smacked', 'sick as a parrot' - no footballing cliche can
adequately characterise the depth of national despair that engulfed England
after Wednesday's World Cup defeat at the hands of Norway.
England - where the game of football was invented - was beaten 2-0 in Oslo
and probably ejected from the 1994 World Cup final round, to be held in
America next year.
And at the hands of Norway, too. Norway, more famous for its fish than its
football, with a population a 10th that of England's. A country that
worshipped English soccer (as BBC commentator John Motson reminded his
unfortunate audience) had trounced England's national team.
But the defeat has been interpreted as more than just a freak - a single
poor performance by a disorganised team. Instead, it is seen as further
evidence that the decline of English football has become terminal. 'Fatal
flaws of woeful England exposed', thundered The Times; 'Norse manure', The
Sun added.
Yet was anyone really surprised? Britain still has a seat on the UN Security
Council; it has nuclear weapons; it even won the World Cup (at home) in
1966. But surely the decline of English football has gone hand in hand with
England's relative economic decline.
Starting with the 6-3 home defeat at the hands of Hungary in 1953, the
first-ever defeat at Wembley, England's footballing star has been waning,
along with its economic clout. Since 1953 England has slipped from second to
fifth in the world in terms of output; it has fallen considerably further
down the league table of income per head. More populous nations, such as
Brazil and Argentina, have risen to prominence on the world footballing
stage.
The FT's analysis of England's World Cup record since 1953 suggests that the
English soccer team has continued to do better than might be expected from
the country's size and economic power. The analysis awards points for
performance in the final rounds of the World Cup (failure to qualify scores
no points). It divides the 10 World Cup competitions from 1953 into two
groups, the split coming between the 1970 and 1974 contests. The year 1973
was a watershed for England. In addition to the Opec oil shock and the
Barber boom, it saw the English soccer team draw 1-1 with Poland at Wembley
in October. The side was eliminated from the competition during the
qualifying stages (see charts).
From 1954 to 1970, English soccer continued to fare comparatively well,
despite the country being overtaken in economic size by France, Germany and
Japan, and suffering the shock of sterling's 1967 devaluation. The English
team ranked third, well behind Germany and Brazil.
From 1970 on, it was downhill all the way. Inflation soared during the
1970s, labour relations deteriorated, and the England team failed to qualify
for either World Cup tournament. Despite qualifying in 1982, 1986 and 1990,
England has been overtaken in the rankings by Argentina, Italy, Holland and
Poland. Only England's fortuitous 1990 victory over Cameroon prevented the
team from falling behind France and Belgium.
The biggest shifts in relative soccer performance since 1970 have been the
slippage of Brazil and the collapse of the communist teams - only Poland has
bucked the trend, coming from nowhere to sixth place in 1974-90; the rise of
continental European football; and the enormous success of Argentina since
the early 1970s.
The economic background to these changes provides few clues as to England's
relative footballing decline. High and fluctuating inflation since 1973
might have been a clue to the decline of both Brazil and England, though on
different scales, were it not for the rise of Argentina. Nor does the
decline of Soviet-style collectivism help explain why British soccer has
withered alongside British socialism. If anything, the rise of Thatcherite
individualism is a better explanation for England's poor performance at team
games.
Despite the present gloom, it appears that England's declining World Cup
performance has continued to outstrip its economic record. Over the period
1974-90, England ranked seventh in the FT World Cup league table. But among
World Cup qualifying nations, England now has only the 11th-biggest
population and the 14th-highest income per head. Defeat by Norway is not so
surprising. Though smaller, it is now much richer than England - Dollars
6,000 a person a year richer in 1990, according to the World Bank.
So why has England taken the defeat so badly? Part of the explanation is
economic. For a country grappling to get out of recession, and with a prime
minister ill at ease with himself, failure to qualify for the 1994 World Cup
final seems disastrous. The other reason is more simple: England's
performance on Wednesday was terrible. A shocked Mr Graham Taylor, the
England manager, accused his players of giving up. 'It's a performance that
will make people back home very angry,' he said.
But Mr Taylor must take his share of the blame. It was his last-minute
tactical decisions which caused the players to appear like 'headless
chickens' on the pitch. Refusing to select Chris Waddle, and playing Gary
Pallister at left-back, made little sense.
Following Mr John Major's example, he will have to consider a reshuffle. But
it may not be enough to produce a winning team.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Leading Article: The shock of the old
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market's instant reaction to this week's depressed set of money
supply figures was to assume that a cut in interest rates was moving
inexorably closer. Certainly a cut is the kind of gesture that might be
expected of a populist chancellor; and in some moods, that is what the
market hopes that the new incumbent at Number 11 Downing Street, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, will turn out to be. But in the absence of appropriate reassurance
on fiscal policy, the cheer might very quickly turn to alarm. The folk
memory of the roaring 1980s remains strong, giving rise to the inevitable
question: could it all happen again?
For those in the housing market whose mortgages now exceed the value of
their homes, the equally inevitable answer is: yes please. But lightning in
the financial markets never strikes in the same place twice. Indeed, the
danger after a particularly extreme economic cycle is that policymakers
react to the old problems instead of the new. As the conflicting signals
emerging from the housing market suggested this week, a dramatic surge in
house prices, which was at the heart of asset price inflation in the 1980s,
is not in the offing for a long time yet.
That said, the most savage downturn in the UK housing market since the
second world war is probably at an end. The signs are apparent in
housebuilding, in mortgage-lending and in turnover in the housing market.
The fact that the Halifax Building Society reports that average prices fell
in May by 1.2 per cent, whereas Nationwide had earlier reported a 1 per cent
increase, merely tells us that what ought to be happening is happening. In a
recession driven by debt, where between 1 1/2 m and 2m home-owners have
negative equity and repossessions are running at record levels, the
restraining influence on house prices is considerable.
Psychological turn
The reason why the British became so enamoured of housing in the post-war
period was largely to do with gearing. Because so much of the purchase price
was financed by borrowing, a small rise in house prices led to a much bigger
rise in the equity in the home. The fact that gearing exaggerates the impact
of downward price movements on equity, as well as upward movements, was
obscured until the 1990s by high inflation. The big question now is whether
the first sharp fall in nominal house prices since the war has broken that
psychology.
Research revealed by the Building Societies Association this week showed a
significant fall in the number of people aged between 16 and 34 wanting to
own a home within two years. Taken together with the looming squeeze on real
incomes implied by the current Finance Bill, that amounts to a very powerful
damper. So, too, does the expected decline in the size of the first-time
buying age group in the second half of the decade.
The constraint on demand will be further reinforced by the retreat from
lending at absurdly high percentages of value. Increased prudence, more
expensive insurance premiums and tougher prudential rules have already
forced people to save more and longer before buying. This week the chairman
of the Building Societies Commission, Mrs Rosalind Gilmore, announced that
the risk weighting she applies to building society assets will be changed to
encourage a further reduction in the percentage of value on which societies
lend.
Future shocks
All this tends to confirm that the risk of another house price spiral is
remote. But that does not mean that further financial shocks can be ruled
out. Where depositors exercise no discipline over bank and building society
management, growth-hungry lenders find themselves engaged, when the economy
turns up, in a constant battle with the regulators. And while the
authorities can dictate the rate of growth in the reserve base of the
banking or building society system, it is the financial structure that
dictates the efficacy with which those reserves are deployed.
That is another way of saying that financial innovation tends to leap-frog
regulatory awareness. It happened in Britain in the 1980s, with financial
deregulation. And it is not inconceivable that it could happen again in the
1990s in the building society movement. There has, for example, been a
notable recent shift towards fixed rate mortgage-lending. But whereas, in
the past, a mismatch between short-term deposits and longer-term fixed rate
loans would have caused the societies to lend more cautiously, today the
risk in the mismatch is neutered by using interest rate swaps. In a more
speculative climate the temptation to hedge less, and to speculate more
might increase. Or, again, under-regulated counterparties in the swap market
might take aboard excessive risk.
Mrs Gilmore is acutely aware of such issues and has delivered the
appropriate warnings. But the pace of financial innovation makes it harder
to read each new twist and turn in the financial structure. The only
certainty is that when the next shock comes, it will take a different form
from the last one. And come, it will. Only the timing is in question.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Man in the News: Odd couple with a common cause - Clinton's
new 'counsellor' blames partisanship for many of America's problems / David
Gergen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the current hot movie, Dave, a rotten, promiscuous president suffers a
stroke in flagrante delicto. His administration is saved by his physical
double, the eponymous Dave, who normally runs an employment agency and does
all the nice and good things the real president eschewed, and by his
accountant, Murray, who sorts out the budget deficit in a trice.
Nobody in Washington is seriously suggesting that David Gergen, five years
older, two inches taller and with a thinner thatch of unstyled hair than
Bill Clinton, is being charged with a similar mission, though some comedians
have been unable to resist the obvious comparison. But the new 'counsellor'
to the president, precise duties still to be determined, would not have been
brought on board if the current White House had been steaming smoothly ahead
in untroubled waters.
Gergen and Clinton are not quite the odd couple they might seem. It is true
that, while Clinton was protesting against the Vietnam war, Gergen was going
to work for Richard Nixon. Equally, when the former was a firebrand liberal
first-term Democratic governor of Arkansas, the latter was Ronald Reagan's
communications director, helping to sell those conservative policies that
the current president is now intent on reversing.
But the two southern boys (Gergen grew up in North Carolina) have grown
personally and politically closer over the years. They met regularly at the
annual Renaissance weekend, a new year's New Age gathering on the Carolina
coast of mostly like-minded politicians, lawyers, academics and journalists.
As Clinton, in his later terms in Little Rock, moved towards the middle, so
Gergen, never entirely at home among the Reagan ideologues, left government.
He became a senior editor and columnist at US News magazine and a
commentator on the MacNeil/ Lehrer public affairs programme on public
television. His Friday duet with Mark Shields, the literate and witty
consultant to the Democratic party, far exceeded in quality of comment the
clamorous verdicts of the journalistic kangaroo courts that have come to
dominate much political discussion on television.
He became, as many media stars now do, much in demand on the speaking
circuit, cultivating an ever wider range of political contacts around the
country. He also immersed himself in conspicuously non-conservative
organisations with an international scope, like the Aspen Institute.
The net result of a lot of public talking and writing was the suspicion that
his disappointment in George Bush was such last year that he forsook his
long allegiance to the Republican party and in the end voted for Bill
Clinton. Reflecting either this or the president-elect's promise to reach
out to moderate Republicans, he was rumoured in the transition period to be
under consideration for a senior administration post, possibly running
foreign aid from the state department.
Up to a point, he was kind to Clinton this year, too, approving of his
initial budget victories and welcoming the new dawn in intelligent
government. Even his later criticisms as things began to go wrong were
tinged with admiration. While he worried about the president's tendency to
tax and spend too freely and even questioned a lack of backbone, he could,
in the same paragraph of a US News column on May 24, still describe him as
'one of the most gifted, dedicated men ever to serve in the Oval Office . .
. a wonderful head and a big heart'.
This article, in retrospect, should be read as an overt appeal to Clinton to
return to where Gergen believed the president belonged - in the reformist
middle - and less than two weeks later the president was announcing his
appointment from the Rose Garden. Gergen fleshed out his reasons for signing
up in another interview this week. Complaining about the neglect of American
education and of US competitiveness, he told National Public Radio that the
root problem was partisanship run riot.
'I think he (Clinton) is someone who is trying to come up with innovative
ideas that get beyond the boxes of the 1980s, . . . to define solutions that
will draw support and inspiration from both camps. We reek of privilege and
power in this city - we've got lots of it - but we refuse to get together
and see if we can help define common ground and find some answers. I think
people around the country are disgusted with that and I think they have a
right to be disgusted with that.'
As best as can be defined, Gergen joins the Clinton inner circle that
comprises the president, his wife, Mack McLarty, the maligned chief of
staff, and Al Gore, the vice-president. He sees his duties as combining
political and policy advice together with the public presentation of
whatever decisions emerge. George Stephanopolous, doubtless relieved no
longer to have to fight the media daily, may be a floating member of the
group. ('Only in Washington,' Paul Begala, a Clinton adviser, observed
sarcastically, 'is it considered a demotion to spend more time with the
president than with the White House press corps.')
It may be no accident that Gergen's recruitment coincided with a significant
shift back to the centre by the president himself. There were hints of
compromises on the budget, especially the energy tax, on deferring an
increase in the minimum wage, on the admission of homosexuals into the
military, trade with China, and, most painfully for Mr Clinton, the
withdrawal of the nomination to the justice department of an old friend,
Lani Guinier, because, as he conceded on Thursday night, 'I cannot fight a
battle that I know is divisive . . . if I do not believe in the ground of
the battle'.
If this was a retreat from the left, it was conducted with several guns
blazing. In a Milwaukee speech, the president stuck to the argument that his
approach to the budget was right and that the complexities and basic
fairness of his programme were misunderstood or not grasped at all, thanks
to a combination of muddled White House messages and a wilfully perfidious
media.
Yet behind the smoke there were the sort of overtures to the Washington
establishment, of which more can be expected under Gergen. Two White House
dinners this week, for example, included invitations to representatives of
the heavy writing press, previously almost ignored. Though the media may
have changed, some things do not. The Reagan administration's mastery of
television was made possible by some discreet courting of those newspapers
from which television still lifts many of its reporting leads and opinions.
James Baker, whom Gergen acknowledges as a mentor, spent 12 successful years
in Washington employing the same technique.
But Gergen's accession, while generally reckoned to be a smart move by the
president, did not pass without reservations. The more cynical, who have
been writing off the Clinton presidency for weeks with increasing vigour,
doubted whether Gergen could work a sea change on either Clinton himself or,
as an ageing nominal Republican, on a young, partisan Democratic White House
staff.
Veterans recalled that the last luminary of the opposition party to be
brought in to work miracles was Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now the senior
Democratic senator from New York, mysteriously hauled in to advise Richard
Nixon in 1969 to minimal ultimate effect. 'There is no magic in personnel
changes,' intoned Johnny Apple of the New York Times.
His newspaper was more disturbed by another aspect of what it called
'Gergenism' - packaging over content - and worried that the new governing
ideology is now no longer represented by two political parties with distinct
philosophies but by a phenomenon known as inside-ism. In a similar vein,
David Shribman in the Boston Globe wrote of 'a political class - a culture
all of its own - inscrutable to outsiders . . . and populated with
interchangeable political operatives'.
If Dave suggested that even presidents were interchangeable so long as they
looked alike, another older movie, The Bermuda Triangle, was perhaps more
apposite to David Gergen's week. He flew to the island for a short break
but, far from disappearing without trace, found himself boating with none
other than Ross Perot, who 'expressed pleasure in my new job'. He could, of
course, have pushed the pesky Texan populist overboard, but just getting him
off Clinton's back would be no mean initial service.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Hunter who goes for the jugular: Martin Dickson and Patrick
Harverson examine the successes and setbacks of the financial empire of
George Soros
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Soros has become that rarest of investment gurus - an individual
with such mystique that his actions can trigger large jumps in financial
markets around the world. Where Mr Soros goes, a motley army of fans
stampedes behind.
This remarkable power was demonstrated in Britain this week when the New
York-based fund manager announced plans to invest Pounds 284m in the
stricken British property market through a Pounds 500m partnership with
British Land, the property company headed by Mr John Ritblat.
UK property stocks immediately rose 6 per cent and observers rushed to
pronounce the deal as definitive evidence that the market had turned for the
better.
Six weeks ago Mr Soros had a similar impact on the world gold market. News
that funds under Soros management had bought a 10 per cent stake in the US
company Newmont Mining helped spark a strong rally in the price of gold.
Mr Soros has been regarded for the past 20 years as one of the canniest
investors on Wall Street, but his current superstar status is something new.
It dates from last November, when he let it be known that his funds had made
about Dollars 1bn on 'Black Wednesday' last September by taking a huge,
correct, bet that the British government would be forced to devalue
sterling.
Mr Soros was hardly alone. Many foreign exchange traders had made the same
calculation, but the sheer size of the Soros speculation - on his reckoning,
his Quantum Group of 'hedge' funds had some Dollars 10bn committed to the
bet - gave him a reputation as the 'man who broke the Bank of England' and
an aura of unerring investment expertise.
Like most 'Midas-touch' reputations, his has become somewhat overstated. As
he is the first to acknowledge, he has made his share of mistakes down the
years. And since 1988 many important elements of his investment strategy
have been devolved onto his publicity-shy American lieutenant, the
39-year-old Mr Stanley Druckenmiller, who oversees day-to-day investment
activities.
Nevertheless, the duo are greatly admired on Wall Street. Mr Julian
Robertson, who runs Tiger Management, one of the biggest hedge funds, says
of Mr Soros: 'He's a brilliant man and has a fabulous lieutenant in Stanley
Druckenmiller.'
So just how good is Mr Soros's track record? How do his funds operate? And
what can other investors learn from his methods?
From a 33rd-floor office with a magnificent view of Manhattan's Central
Park, the 62-year-old Hungarian-American runs Soros Fund Management, which
sets the investment strategy for the unquoted Quantum Group, which has
assets of about Dollars 8bn.
Hedge funds, which invest in a wide range of liquid assets, such as stocks,
bonds, currencies and commodities, have been a feature of US financial
markets since the 1960s. But neither they, nor their investment technique,
are suitable for the small investor. Managing them requires access to large
amounts of capital, very strong nerves, fast reflexes and a willingness to
take huge risks.
Unlike most traditional mutual and pension funds, which are restricted to
certain investment strategies by industry regulators or internal policy,
hedge funds are free to use complex, speculative trading methods to maximise
investors' returns, including using leveraged funds (money borrowed against
the value of assets), and hedging techniques.
The most common form of hedging is short-selling, which is when a trader or
investor sells a security he does not own in the hope that later, when it
has to be delivered to the buyer, the security can be acquired at a lower
price. It was this technique which Mr Soros used before Black Wednesday,
when he 'shorted' sterling.
Hedge funds are only for the very rich, or for financial institutions. The
Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the US financial markets,
requires that individual investors in such funds have a net worth totalling
at least Dollars 1m, or annual income of at least Dollars 200,000 for two
consecutive years. Most fund managers require their investors to be even
wealthier.
And in the case of the Quantum Group, investors cannot be American citizens
or residents. This is because the funds, domiciled in the Netherlands
Antilles or the British Virgin Islands, are not registered with the SEC,
since this allows them more operating flexibility and freedom from US
disclosure rules.
Most of Quantum's investors are thought to be European, and Mr Soros himself
is rumoured to own between 25 and 30 per cent of the funds.
Born in Hungary in 1930, Mr Soros suffered early hardship when he and his
Jewish family spent much of the second world war in hiding from occupying
Nazi forces. After the war, aged 17, he moved to Britain, attended the
London School of Economics and worked for the securities firm of Singer &amp;
Friedlander before moving to the US in 1956.
In 1969, after working for several Wall Street houses as a trader and
analyst, his investment career took off when he was assigned the management
of an offshore vehicle which grew into Quantum Fund, the largest fund in the
group.
Mr Soros and his then partner, Mr Jim Rogers, gained a reputation in the
early 1970s for shorting some favourite fund managers' stocks, such as
Disney and Polaroid. In 1985 he made what he called 'the killing of a
lifetime' by speculating in the yen at the time when the Plaza Accord was
sending the value of the Japanese currency soaring.
But there have also been many big losses. On his own account, he lost money
trading currencies in the four years before the Plaza Accord. Most famously,
Quantum Fund is estimated to have lost up to Dollars 800m in the 1987 Wall
Street crash, though it still managed to boost investment returns by 14 per
cent during that year. Mr Soros, who had been warning that the Japanese
market was wildly overpriced, had been expecting a crash, but not one
beginning in the US.
Still, by any reckoning the Quantum Fund has one of the best and most
consistent records of any large fund over such a long period. It claims a
compound annual rate of growth since 1969 of 35 per cent, after fees and
expenses, and has had only one year, 1981, in which the value of investments
fell.
Micropal, a London company that tracks international investment funds, says
that Quantum Fund is the top performer over both the past three and five
years among the 57 large derivative, leveraged and geared funds that it
follows, with returns of 296 and 503 per cent respectively. Over the past
year, Quantum ranked third, earning a return of 67 per cent.
Beginning with only Dollars 4m under management, Quantum Fund now has about
Dollars 4.1bn - and that after distributions to investors of Dollars 3.4bn
to keep its size manageable. For the same reason, Mr Soros has spun off four
other funds from Quantum since 1991 - Quasar International, Quota, Quantum
Emerging Growth and Quantum Realty Trust.
Mr Soros himself has increasingly drawn back from day-to-day involvement in
the funds, which are run by a team of about a dozen managers, led by Mr
Druckenmiller.
Mr Soros, while still coach and strategist to the team, spends a substantial
part of his time involved in philanthropic work in eastern Europe. Starting
in 1979, he has set up several foundations to encourage freedom of
expression in the former Soviet bloc and is estimated to have given away
some Dollars 200m to Dollars 300m to this and related causes.
In a rare interview with Mr Jack Schwager, author of the book New Market
Wizards, Mr Druckenmiller admitted that his first six months with Mr Soros
were fairly rocky, as the two men had different strategies. But then came
the collapse of the Soviet Empire and 'with George in eastern Europe, he
couldn't meddle even if he wanted to'.
Mr Druckenmiller has a strong investment reputation. Appointed head of
equity research at Pittsburgh National Bank at the young age of 25, he set
up his own money management firm, Duquesne Capital Management, three years
later. He still handles this very successful fund, alongside his Quantum
responsibilities.
Whatever the early friction, the two men clearly have a very similar
approach to investing. Mr Soros, a man given to philosophical musings - he
described himself as a 'financial and philosophical speculator' when
receiving an honorary Oxford degree - tried to sum his ideas up in a complex
book called the Alchemy of Finance.
His theory of 'reflexivity' holds that markets are moved partly by
irrational pyschology, rather than any scientific rules, with perceptions
changing events, and events in turn changing perceptions. In simpler
language, markets tend to go to extremes, opening up great opportunities for
profit.
But for all the philosophy, other Wall Street investors say Mr Soros's
greatest traits - as with every successful trader - include the willingness
to reverse his position in an instant, when he recognises he has made a
mistake.
In his book interview, Mr Druckenmiller says that probably the most
important thing he has learnt from Mr Soros is that 'it's not whether you're
right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're
right and how much you lose when you're wrong. The few times that Soros has
ever criticised me was when I was really right on a market and didn't
maximise the opportunity . . . Soros has taught me that when you have
tremendous conviction on a trade, you have to go for the jugular.'
For all its success, Quantum Fund is not trouble-free. The group was was one
of three big New York funds accused of involvement in 1991's Salomon
Brothers bond auction scandal. While all were given a clean bill of health
by goverment investigations, the three are being sued in the New York courts
by investors for allegedly conspiring with a Salomon trader to corner the
market in certain government securities. Quantum denies the charges.
More fundamentally, as the group gets bigger, it becomes harder for the
funds to keep up their historic growth rates, and the number of investment
areas in which they can make a killing diminishes. The currency markets,
which dwarf all others, are probably Quantum's best hunting grounds.
'We're like a super-tanker in a way,' Mr Soros acknowledged in a recent
interview. 'Very efficient, but we can only put into two or three ports.' So
far, it has been a very lucrative voyage.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Buoyant car sales underline recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGISTRATIONS of new cars rose 11.9 per cent last month on a year-on-year
basis, reassuring carmakers and traders that the recovery is still under way
and that the drop in sales in April was a 'blip'.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday
were also particularly encouraging for UK-based carmakers, showing that the
share of the market taken by imports fell by nearly 3 percentage points to
52.17 per cent compared with May last year.
For the first five months of the year, imports took 54.03 per cent of the
market, down from 54.94 in the same period last year. UK car production this
year has been running at its highest level for nearly two decades.
But the industry's optimism about the car market, and what it might imply
for recovery in the economy overall, was tempered by continuing gloomy
statistics from the commercial vehicle sector.
Last month's registrations of vans, trucks and buses were down 4.45 per cent
on May last year and down 4.46 per cent for the first five months of this
year, even though last year was one of the worst in the commercial vehicle
industry's history.
May's 136,389 new car registrations, up from 121,862 in the same month last
year, lifted total registrations for the first five months of this year to
725,116 - an 8.85 per cent rise on the 666,179 registrations in the same
period last year.
Mr Roger King, the society's director of public affairs, said yesterday:
'After the slight blip in April, when the figures slipped back by 1.9 per
cent, the encouraging trend in the May registrations suggests that recovery
is still under way.' May's performance means that the new car market has
risen in 11 of the past 14 months.
Although Ford remains the UK market leader, a feature of the May market was
the strong performance put up by Vauxhall, General Motors' UK car
subsidiary, which captured the first two places in the 'top 10' list of
best-selling cars and increased its market share by more than two percentage
points to 19.46 per cent.
This was only just behind Ford's 20.55 per cent share. However, Ford is only
just starting to reap the benefit of the Mondeo, which replaced the Sierra,
and which won fifth place in the best sellers' list last month even though
supplies are still building up.
Rover, which also has yet to feel the full benefit of its new 600 range,
lost ground last month. But its 13.24 per cent share of the market for the
first five months is up nearly a percentage point on the same period last
year.
One of the most sharply improved performances last month was from the Fiat
group, which showed the first signs of reversing several years of decline in
the UK market. Fiat's registrations increased 46 per cent last month, and
are running at 26 per cent higher for the year so far.
The top 10 sellers for last month were the Vauxhall Cavalier; Vauxhall's
Astra; the Ford Fiesta; the Ford Escort; Ford's Mondeo; the Rover 200
series; the Peugeot 405; the Rover Metro; Vauxhall's Corsa and the Rover 400
About 500 car windscreens are being stolen each week and this is now the
fastest growing form of car-related crime, replacement windscreen company
Autoglass has warned.
The increase follows the introduction of a stricter MoT test which requires
damaged windscreens to be replaced. Cars most at risk are those with
flexible rubber windscreen surrounds. Most such cars are older variants of
some top-selling models.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Unlikely alliances bring aviation success: Paul Betts on the
success of Shorts under Catholic ownership in a Protestant bunker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE industrial sprawl of east Belfast's docklands, the world's oldest
mass producer of aircraft faces a double test.
Short Brothers is trying to rejuvenate a business that was all but given up
for dead four years ago. Its new Roman Catholic ownership, operating out of
a traditional Protestant bunker, is striving to encourage harmony and
co-operation in a split community.
Since its privatisation in 1989 and its sale to the French-Canadian
Bombardier transport equipment group, Shorts, Northern Ireland's largest
employer outside the public sector, has become the largest private-sector
employer of Roman Catholics in Belfast.
Mr Roy McNulty, president of Shorts, says the proportion of Catholics
employed by the company has risen to about 13 per cent from only 5 per cent
a few years ago.
The unlikely alliance between Bombardier, which is relatively new to the
aerospace industry, and one of the most historic names of aviation, rooted
in Protestant Belfast, has produced one of the few recent success stories in
the aerospace industry.
'Four years ago we had no money, no modern equipment,' says Mr McNulty. 'We
were doomed.' Since privatisation, sales have doubled. From a loss of Pounds
46.9m in 1988, Shorts made Pounds 26.5m in 1991 and Pounds 28.5m in 1992. Mr
McNulty predicts a 'another good solid profit' this year.
As part of its recovery strategy, Shorts has worked to develop harmonious
working relations inside its plants in order to remove religious animosity
from the factory floor.
Encouraged by Bombardier, the company has invested in internal training, in
education programmes for Protestant and Roman Catholic schools throughout
Northern Ireland - including programmes on aerospace and other advanced
technologies for primary schools - and the endowment of a new university
chair of aeronautical engineering.
Mr McNulty says the company is spending 2 per cent to 3 per cent of its
annual Pounds 392m turnover on training.
While maintaining tight control on costs and overall strategy, the
French-Canadian conglomerate has traditionally left subsidiaries to manage
their own affairs.
'They don't buy companies to change them but let the management in place get
on with it,' says Mr McNulty. He says Bombardier has adopted a sympathetic
approach to the problems of manufacturing in Northern Ireland. 'They are as
confused as most people about the political situation here, but they also
have tensions in Quebec that are not so different.'
The fact that Bombardier was prepared to take over and maintain Shorts as a
corporate entity was one of the main reasons why the government agreed to
sell it to the French Canadians.
An alternative joint bid by the UK General Electric Company and Fokker, the
Dutch aircraft manufacturer, was rejected because of fears that Shorts might
be split.
'The crucial thing to remember,' said a UK aerospace industry analyst, 'is
that should anything happen to Shorts, it would have a huge economic and
political impact on Northern Ireland. Shorts has been a pillar of stability
for the Northern Ireland economy, and if the pillar started crumbling it
would have shattering repercussions.'
Although Shorts has not escaped the recession, its workforce has increased
by nearly 10 per cent during the past four years from 7,700 at the end of
1988 to around 8,300 today after reaching a peak of 8,982 last year. This
has been at a time when the UK aerospace industry as a whole has suffered a
25 per cent decline in employment.
'Privatisation was the essential catalyst for the transformation of Shorts,'
says Mr McNulty, admitting it was an expensive exercise, costing the
government about Pounds 800m to write off debts and recapitalise the company
before selling it for Pounds 30m.
'For a decade our government owners put nothing in the business,' Mr McNulty
says. 'Capital investment per employee was the lowest in the industry; we
were getting an average of Pounds 3m a year from the government, which had
to approve any investment over Pounds 100,000; our plants were still
operating with second world war machines and technology.'
Bombardier's strategy was 'to fix what we've got' rather than start afresh.
'We've been living in a continuous building site since privatisation,
upgrading and investing in new machinery,' says Mr Ken Brundle, head of
Shorts' aircraft division.
In the past, the company had to sub-contract much high-value-added machining
and other work outside Northern Ireland because of lack of adequate
equipment. Investment has enabled it to reverse that process.
'We used to have as many as 110 machinery sub-contractors all over the
world: we now have only 12 of which eight are in Northern Ireland employing
a total of about 4,000 people,' says Mr Brundle.
Improved motivation and work practices as well as new equipment have brought
a big boost to productivity.
In 1989 it took Shorts 40,000 man-hours to complete a wing set for the
Fokker 100 regional jet. Last year, according to Mr Brundle, it took just
under 17,000 man-hours to complete the same wing set.
Next week, Shorts is expected to try to capitalise on its new relations with
the French-Canadian company at the world's biggest air show in Paris and win
new business. In so doing, it hopes to continue restoring Northern Ireland's
reputation as a centre of aerospace manufacturing activity.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Final moves on Daf buy-out expected soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MANAGEMENT buy-out team from the Leyland Daf truck assembly plant at
Leyland, Lancashire, has reached agreement 'on all outstanding commercial
matters' with the administrative receivers to take over the UK operation.
The deal, expected to be finalised next week, is the most important step in
the rescue of the failed Dutch-owned Leyland Daf plant which collapsed into
receivership at the beginning of February.
The buy-out will secure about 700 jobs and opens the way for the rescue of
other parts of the former Leyland Daf business, including the Albion axle
plant in Glasgow, and the Leyland Daf spare parts operation at Chorley,
Lancashire, now trading under the Multipart brand name.
The buy-out team is being backed with Pounds 5m of equity capital by
Barclays Development Capital.
As part of the deal the Leyland site is to be acquired by Lancashire
Enterprises, the development arm of Lancashire County Council. The buy-out
team will purchase the immediate site of the assembly plant.
Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, joint administrative receivers with
Arthur Andersen, said they were in the process of completing an agreement
with Daf Trucks of the Netherlands to take over the former Leyland Daf sales
and marketing operation based in Thame, Oxfordshire.
Daf Trucks, the new company formed earlier this year to take over the core
medium and heavy duty truck operations of the old Netherlands and Belgian
Daf group, will now market the UK-built Leyland Daf light trucks in the UK
and continental Europe.

FT  05 JUN 93 / PW faces further BCCI probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE WATERHOUSE faces investigation on three further substantive grounds by
the accountancy profession's highest disciplinary body for its role as
auditor to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The firm is being examined by the Joint Disciplinary Scheme to determine
whether its audits should have detected the fraud at BCCI earlier; and
whether the form of its audit report for the 1990 accounts was adequate in
view of the issues that came to light during that year.
It is also being investigated to consider whether helping the BCCI
management with the restructuring of operations and advising the government
of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder, adversely affected or was compatible
with its role as auditor to the bank.
An inquiry into the 'conduct and competence of members and member firms' in
relation to the collapse of BCCI was announced in April last year by the
scheme, operated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales, its sister institute in Scotland, and the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants.
Fuller details of the investigation have emerged as a result of documents
lodged in the High Court when Price Waterhouse requested a judicial review
to stall the progress of the scheme.
Price Waterhouse argued any proceedings from the inquiry would be subject to
legal discovery and could prejudice the outcome of writs against the firm by
liquidators to BCCI for more than Dollars 8bn.
It requested a delay until after this action was completed, which was
resisted by the scheme, which wants to proceed as quickly as possible.
But Mr Justice Tuckey has granted Price Waterhouse leave for judicial review
next month.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Late-night deal fails to save most BA flights

A PEACE deal between British Airways and the TGWU transport union was agreed
too late to avert a 24-hour strike which yesterday disrupted most of BA's
420 daily flights from London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports, the two
busiest in Britain. The deal was reached late on Thursday night.
But as normal services resume today, two other disputes at BA remain
unresolved. One involves the airline's 3,000 pilots who have voted 5-1 to
strike in pursuit of a claim for common contracts for all the group's
pilots, although the British Airline Pilots' Association said it was
'optimistic of getting back into talks with BA'.
A second dispute involves 300 cabin and ground staff at Gatwick airport who
have rejected the offer of a 3 per cent pay rise. The staff, who are
employed by the BA subsidiary British Airways European Operations Out of
Gatwick (BA EOG), have voted for strike action.
BA said it was difficult to estimate the cost of disruption to yesterday's
services. It carried only about half its normal daily load of passengers -
about 35,000 instead of 70,000.
BA normally has 420 flights from Heathrow and Gatwick on weekdays. All
flights from Gatwick save one were cancelled yesterday, but 18 long-haul
flights left Heathrow, ensuring that these aircraft were in position for
return flights tomorrow.
Eleven European flights took off, but all domestic flights were cancelled.
Passengers unable to travel were offered either re-bookings, refunds or
flights with other airlines.
The company insisted there was no question of dropping BA EOG, the low-cost
operation which has been the catalyst for the dispute. BA EOG was set up to
operate flights to European destinations after BA took over Dan-Air's
lossmaking operations last year - rates of pay reflect the generally lower
pay scales which operated in Dan-Air.
The TGWU said widespread staff fears over job security were at the heart of
the dispute.
The deal agreed by BA and the TGWU had four main elements:
BA agreed it had no plans to create any new subsidiaries other than those
already announced - and, if it did consider such a move, it would consult
with the national joint council which represents management and staff.
BA agreed to consult unions over any further sub-contracting of services.
Agreement was reached on the number of overseas cabin crews on flights.
The deadline for staff who wished to transfer to BA EOG at Gatwick - an
option, for example, for workers who live nearer Gatwick than Heathrow - was
extended to November. Staff transferring will not suffer pay cuts and basic
rates of pay will be frozen until those of existing BA EOG staff catch up.
The deal was presented by BA as a 'staff charter' which it said reaffirmed
assurances over the airline's business development and job security.
Talks will take place next week on the other disputes. BA said a dispute
involving clerical workers who are members of the GMB general union at
Gatwick should now be resolved quickly.
Mr Chris Darke, general secretary of the pilots' association, said the key
to resolving the pilots' dispute was a common contract of employment for
staff employed by BA and BA EOG. Pilots at BA EOG earn about 30 per cent
less, but Mr Darke said money was not the main problem - the BA EOG pilots
want assurances that they can move between BA EOG and the main company.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Failed group's accounts were queried

SFV HOLIDAYS, the travel company which collapsed last month, had its most
recent accounts qualified and had not kept accurate records since, creditors
heard yesterday.
The company collapsed shortly after being told by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, that it did not require bonding.
Mr Jeremy Berman of joint liquidators Berley and Co told a creditors'
meeting in London that the auditors of SFV Holidays, which collapsed last
month, had qualified its 1991 accounts because of questions arising from a
property sale after the year end.
Accounts for 1992 had not been completed when the Oxford-based company went
into liquidation, but Mr Berman said the financial records held by SFV's
management were inadequate. 'The management information I've seen is very
poor. The accounts I've seen on their computers are inaccurate.'
SFV was not bonded and had not made alternative arrangements to protect
customers' money. The company wrote earlier this year to Mr John Patten,
education secretary and an Oxford MP, saying it was unable to comply with an
European Community directive which requires package holiday operators to
ensure that clients' money can be returned if the company fails.
SFV had been refused membership of the Association of Independent Tour
Operators and could not persuade any insurance company to provide it with a
policy to protect its customers. The company said it believed it was obliged
to comply with the directive.
Mr Patten wrote to Mr Heseltine about the company's concerns last January
and April. Mr Heseltine replied to Mr Patten saying he had examined SFV's
brochures and concluded that the company did not have to comply with the
directive as it was not a package tour operator. This was because - while
the company sold self-catering accommodation in France - it allowed
customers to specify what ferry service they wished to use.
Mr John Cullom, SFV's managing director, told the meeting he agreed with one
creditor who said the company should have fallen within the ambit of the
directive because it was selling inclusive accommodation and ferry holidays.
Mr Berman said the company owed customers just over Pounds 1m. Of this,
Pounds 750,000 had been paid by credit card and customers would be able to
get refunds. The remaining customers are ordinary creditors. SFV's total
deficit is Pounds 1.2m.
SFV's client list was earlier this week sold to Kingsland Holidays of
Plymouth which said it would attempt to ensure that trips were able to go
ahead. It said, however, that about 600 of the 3,000 holidaymakers who had
booked with SFV had not paid by credit card and would not get refunds. The
600 would be able to re-book their holidays but would have to pay again.
